Bush says will lay out tax reform plan next week in North Carolina,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/8HRORSO-pbA/story01.htm,reuters,"HAMPTON, N.H. Jeb Bush will lay out a tax plan next week aimed at lowering corporate and personal tax rates and giving the U.S. economy a jolt, the Republican presidential candidate said on Thursday.

Bush said he would announce details of his plan on Wednesday in Raleigh, North Carolina. He said he would seek to enable U.S. companies which have an estimated $2 trillion in cash abroad to bring that money home to reinvest in American businesses and create jobs.

Companies keep those funds overseas to avoid having it taxed twice, in the country in which they are doing business and again when brought back to the United States.

""The basic notion of this is to make our tax code the economic driver of investment in our own country,"" the former Florida governor told a town hall event in Hampton, New Hampshire.

Bush did not give a lot of details about his plan, but said the idea would be to ""lower the rates, corporate rates and personal rates, as low as you possibly can, eliminating as many of the deductions as you can.""

Republicans have long sought to pass legislation reducing the U.S. corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have talked about tax reform during President Barack Obama's second term, but the effort has stalled.

""The tax code is rife with all sorts of deductions and credits and make people feel compelled to kind of follow the script rather than say 'I’m going to invest in this business,'"" Bush said.

Bush is a leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, and is one of the many contenders who have made repeated swings through New Hampshire, one of the earliest states to vote in the runup to the November 2016 election.

He said small foreign companies are buying larger American companies in order to take advantage of lower rates.

""I want to reverse that,"" he said, and do this by ""eliminating the worldwide taxation of income.""

Bush said if the tax code can be reformed, it would lead to massive capital investment in the United States.

Bush's goal is to achieve 4 percent economic growth in the United States, a level that has not been reached in years.

He also said he will release the names of his major campaign donors, so-called ""bundlers"" who persuade a group of people to contribute money at the same time.

Is Snapchat worth its political salt?,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/09/03/is-snapchat-worth-its-political-salt/,washpo,"A billboard displays the logo of Snapchat above Times Square in New York March 12, 2015. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson What is Snapchat, and can it actually shift outcomes in a presidential race? Seasoned political hands are asking in response to a blitz of media coverage for Snapchat, a four-year-old mobile application that lets users trade messages that disappear after 24 hours or less. That fact is a feature, not a bug for the platform, which promotes a kind of fun, cryptic Internet banter that can leave curious baby boomers scratching their heads. If you’re a young person and you’ve got an inside joke with friends, there’s a good chance it’s been communicated in some form on Snapchat. Not that you could ever go back and find it or anything. The company defied low expectations — who would use the service except for sexting? — and now sees activity from nearly 100 million people every day, including more than 60 percent of 18-to-34-year-old Americans who use smartphones. The younger skew has made Snapchat the buzziest application of the 2016 election cycle, and the company now promotes itself as the prime venue for political advertising and content designed to sway that elusive and coveted demographic: millennials. Why does Hillary love Snapchat? Watch and learn: https://t.co/ZkevdcvZOY — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) August 15, 2015 Snapchat’s foray into politics only just recently began. The app landed its first political spot on June 6, one month after the company snagged former Google executive Rob Saliterman to sell advertising to campaigns. Washington readers will remember Saliterman as a spokesman for former President George W. Bush and an early pioneer on the White House-to-Silicon Valley career trail. In May, the company plucked another D.C. player to run its news division: former CNN political reporter Peter Hamby. Headlines were positive. The company was eager to play in the presidential race. Snapchat made quick headway. Nearly every 2016 team is using the app in some form or another, whether running advertisements targeted by state (the app can’t hone in closer, for now) or posting “snaps” from behind the scenes. Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush used Snapchat to document their campaign kick-offs. Scott Walker is an active user, aided by his sons, both under 25. John Kasich might not post much original content, but he’s advertised on the platform, as has Walker: Part of Saliterman’s 2016 pitch is the intimacy of viewing ads on the app. Paid content takes up the entire mobile screen, interrupting Snapchat users’ flow of activity (a good thing) to deliver a message that hits them up close, “within arm’s length,” as Saliterman says. Snapchat’s immersive “live story” feature also provides candidates with an opportunity to upload content related to events, like a primary debate. “One of the game changers in the 2016 cycle compared to the 2012 cycle is that a much higher percentage of people involved in the election have smartphones,” Saliterman said in an interview. “This means that almost everyone has a video recording device right in their pocket. And that video can be broadcast instantly through Snapchat.” Snapchat argues it can play a big role in the early primary states by galvanizing millennial voters, increasing a candidate’s standing in the primary and even putting them over the edge. After all, Rick Santorum finished only 34 votes ahead of Mitt Romney in the Iowa caucuses in 2012. Could a Snapchat ad for Romney have made the difference? It’s almost impossible to know, but you can’t rule it out an era when social media has become the primary source of news for millennials. Read more: LinkedIn tries to become destination for candidates, voters From rap lyrics to political speeches: the evolution of Genius Can Medium replace the op-ed page? Still, there’s plenty of skepticism about the app’s political worth. Compared with Facebook and Twitter, Snapchat’s ability to target advertisements and connect viewers back to the campaign are rudimentary. The app’s search function is unwieldy and candidates’ accounts are hard to find. Like other tech firms, the company is also secretive about its plans and analytics, which might prove problematic for campaign ad buyers. For example: how many people view political ads on Snapchat to completion? (Ad buyers have complained that Snapchat charges them for ads viewed for less than one second.) And do candidates reach much of anyone with the content they post themselves? Snapchat won’t say. Wired magazine summed up these critiques in a recent piece titled, “Sorry Snapchat, But You’re Not Winning This Election.” The use of new online platforms has become a defining aspect of the 2016 presidential race, and every candidate wants to prove they’re on board with the latest trends. But sometimes, that just means throwing ideas at the wall, including on Snapchat. Cue the latest experiment from John Kasich: In Hooksett, N.H., Post reporter David Weigel tests out the bacon-themed snapchat geo-filter that presidential candidate John Kasich's campaign rolled out for New Hampshire social media users Sept. 2.

A majority of millennials don&#8217;t think they are millennials,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/03/a-majority-of-millennials-dont-think-they-are-millennials/,washpo,"Millennials doing millennial stuff. (Photo by Kyle Gustafson / For The Washington Post) One of the first big media explorations of the term ""millennial"" came from the pages of Advertising Age magazine. There was a book that came out in September 2000 called ""Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation,"" and within a few months, AdAge's Bonnie Tsui laid out a few thousand words about what this new generation meant for brands. Her savviest point was this: In the past, generations were defined largely by the year in which one was born. Now target marketing has reached the point where generational attitudes are discerned and used as a starting point for media planning. Put another way? Generations mean more in marketing terms than in sociological ones. Which mirrors what Columbia University sociologist Tom DiPrete said when we spoke last year. ""The media in particular wants [generational] definitions, identities,"" he said. ""I don't know that the definitions are as strong or as widely shared across all the boundaries. … At the end I think it gets fuzzy."" A new survey from Pew Research shows that ""millennial"" isn't really how millennials see millennials, either. Pew asked respondents to identify the generation with which each identified, and sorted them by their ""actual"" generation. Obligatory reminder, to DiPrete's point: There is no ""actual"" generation for any group besides the Baby Boomers, which is a statistically defined group. Pew's definition of what counts as millennial -- defined by year of birth -- isn't the same as other organizations'. That said, millennials were less likely than other groups to identify as their ""correct"" generation. (Wearing out my scarequote key here.) Forty percent of people born within Pew's millennial boundaries saw themselves as millennials. Eight percent ... saw themselves as Boomers. Pew notes that the generational self-identity of Millennials (born 1981 to 1997) is lower than that of Generation X (1965 to 1980) or Baby Boomers (1946 to 1964). It's higher than the ""silent generation,"" those born (1928 to 1945). Just as older millennials see themselves as part of Generation X (43 percent of those aged 27 to 34), the silent generation prefers to identify as Boomers or the ""greatest generation"" -- those that fought in World War II. ""In part, this reflects the low visibility of the term 'Silent Generation,'"" Pew's researchers write. But also it probably reflects that the name is lousy. If you gave me the choice between saying I was in the Greatest Generation or the Silent Generation, you know what I'd pick? Pew's question was ""How well would you say the term GREATEST GENERATION applies to you?"" Pretty well, thanks! Eight percent of millennials say they're in the greatest generation, but very, very few of them fought in World War II. I am in Generation X, to the extent that any non-Boomer is anything.* And I remember with great clarity how we were all terrible cynical slackers that wore flannel to Ethan Hawke movies. Well, guess what! Millennials see themselves as more cynical than we do. They see themselves as more wasteful and more self-absorbed. Generations now come of age in a world that analyzes and markets and leverages and social medias everything they do, a world in which older people look at younger people and their newfangled music and contraptions, package them into ad hoc groups and judge them poorly. Happened to us; it's happening to them. Millennials, though, are probably more aware of this process. Many of them no doubt know that when we talk about ""millennials,"" we don't actually mean and aren't actually describing them. It's marketing! And in the lingo, ""millennial"" means ""young"" or ""new."" It's a framework that allows things like this 2007 exploration of how millennials behave and think, produced as sponsored content for ABC family by AdAge. It means that millennials often see ""millennials"" in those defined terms -- which often aren't complimentary. Millennials see themselves as less patriotic than Boomers see themselves -- and less responsible, hard-working, moral, self-reliant, etc. ""To be sure, some of these differences may be related more to age and life stage than to the unique characteristics of today’s generations,"" Pew writes. And since each generation sees itself more positively in the contexts of these positive terms, per Pew, that's likely right. The media made up millennials and then constantly talks about how millennials are young selfie jerks, and voila. No wonder older millennials see themselves as Gen X, given the chance. No Boomer would have chosen that in 1995. And now the kicker. The term ""millennial"" itself apparently stems in part from an informal survey conducted by ABC News in late 1997. When Peter Jennings revealed the results during World News Tonight, he explained that ""the second largest number though there should be no label [for the generation] at all, and the greatest interest was in the millennium generation, or the millennials."" As often happens, the runners-up had the better point. * Weirdly enough, one sociologist I spoke with thinks that the millennial generation may end up sharing enough sociological indicators to be a ""real"" generational cohort! For now, though, it's still mostly marketing.",0.99226916031240353

Weekly Jobless Claims Rise; Trade Deficit Narrows,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/business/economy/weekly-jobless-claims-rise-trade-deficit-narrows.html,nyt,"WASHINGTON — The trade deficit in the United States fell in July to its lowest level in five months as exports rose broadly, signaling underlying strength in the economy despite concerns about a global growth slowdown.

The Commerce Department said the trade gap narrowed 7.4 percent to $41.9 billion, the smallest level since February. The trade deficit for June was revised to $45.2 billion from the previously reported $43.8 billion.

When adjusted for inflation, the deficit fell to $56.2 billion in July from $59 billion the previous month.

The smaller deficit implied a modest contribution to gross domestic product from trade early in the third quarter. Trade contributed 0.3 percentage point to the economy's 3.7 percent annualized growth rate in the second quarter.

Other data released on Thursday showed an increase in the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits. The trend in jobless claims, however, remained consistent with a strengthening labor market.

The Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 282,000 for the week that ended on Tuesday.

The claims data has no bearing on Friday’s closely watched employment report for August as it fell outside the survey period. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls most likely increased by 220,000 last month after rising 215,000 in July.

But job gains could come in below expectations as the first reading of August payrolls has tended to be weaker in the last several years before being revised higher.

The August employment report will be released less than two weeks before the Federal Reserve's Sept. 16-17 policy-setting meeting. There is speculation the central bank could raise interest rates at that meeting.

The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it smooths out week-to-week volatility, rose 3,250 to 275,500 last week.

It was the 23rd consecutive week that the four-week average remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is usually associated with a strengthening labor market.

In July, exports increased 0.4 percent to $188.5 billion. While that was the first increase since April, exports remain constrained by a strong dollar. The dollar has gained 16.8 percent against the currencies of the United States’ main trading partners since June 2014.

Exports to China fell 1.9 percent, and imports from that country dipped 0.2 percent. That left the politically sensitive United States-China trade deficit at $31.6 billion, up 0.4 percent from June. The trade deficit with China will be closely watched in the coming months after that country devalued its currency in August.

Exports to Canada fell 8.3 percent in July and could come under more pressure after the Canadian economy slipped into recession in the second quarter.",0.69611056128451287
Make a Monthly Content-Marketing Check-In a Must-Do,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/national/~3/BLZpmyGA0jY/,fox,"A monthly content-marketing check-in gives you the opportunity to measure the success of your campaigns. Without a regular review, you won’t be able to take a strategic approach to your efforts, and if you don’t understand where you’re at, you can’t create a clear path for where you’re going.

Entrepreneurs that fully invest in content marketing will generate an abundance of data as their campaigns grow. It’s crucial that you have a plan for analyzing these numbers and making adjustments to your efforts along the way.

Content marketing is a dynamic effort. You’ll want to test different things and see what works and what doesn’t. The only way to truly know that is through regular check-ins.

Review progress of overall goals.

Start the check-in with a brief review of your overall goals. Your content-marketing team should have set these initial goals in the beginning of your efforts.

( source)

Goals are important because they set the baseline for all other analyses. For example, an increase in traffic doesn’t have value if there isn’t a business goal to measure it against. But if you knew that your overall goal was an increase in monthly revenue, you can measure your financial results against your traffic to see if you’re on track with your goals.

That said, things change. Make sure to reevaluate your goals once a quarter to be sure they’re still applicable.

Related: How to Use Content Marketing to Build a Brand with Purpose

Measure traffic changes.

Review your traffic and see how it changed compared to last month. If you’re investing in content marketing, you’ll want to see that your efforts are continuing to bring in new traffic from different sources. Some questions to ask yourself include:

Which traffic source increased/decreased?

Did any product launches or events create a large bump in traffic this month?

Have we recently done a trade show, mailer or other marketing campaigns that could account for the increase in traffic?

Have we started or ended any prominent partnerships with industry leaders?

Try to find the reason for any major shift in traffic. It will help you evaluate what’s working and what isn’t.

Recap campaign performance.

Look at how your content-marketing efforts have impacted your marketing performance overall. Specifically, you’ll want to analyze:

Traffic to landing pages from content-marketing efforts, such as blogging or guest blogging.

Lead-generation numbers compared to last month.

Results of A/B tests on content-related items such as call-to-action copy on blog posts.

Conversion rates and traffic from social-media campaigns.

You’ll learn a lot when you evaluate your content marketing against your other digital-marketing campaigns, as doing so will help you see the true impact of your efforts.

Look at your content-marketing landing pages.

For the most part, you’ll be creating landing pages focused on lead generation. These types of landing pages typically include a form that aims to convert viewers to email list subscribers. But there are other types of landing pages as well.

In content marketing, you can develop things such as resources pages and in-depth guides that serve as landing pages. If you’ve developed this type of content, evaluate its success.

Look at metrics such as the number of social shares, traffic increases or decreases, conversion rate and new leads acquired this month. Knowing this data can help you evaluate whether this type of content works with your audience. If it does, you can make plans to do more of it in the future.

Related: How Much Should Your Content Marketing Really Cost?

Identify top-performing blog posts.

Some of your blog posts will out-perform others. Identifying the types of posts that are performing best on your website gives your team special insight. You can use this information to guide your future topics, hone in your buyer personas, direct your marketing team and locate opportunities for blog-post optimization.

Specific metrics you can use to gauge success include:

Number of views

Conversion rate

Number of social shares

Number of comments

Keyword rankings

I particularly like this part of the check-in because it directly correlates to the type of content that resonates with your audience. The more you can narrow down those topics, the better.

Track social-media impact.

Content marketing is great, but it won’t accomplish much if you don’t promote it. Social media is one of the main ways many marketers promote their content. Review how much traffic is coming from your social-media channels. Also, measure how many people arrive on your site and then share your content to their social profiles.

I’ve found that it’s one thing for someone to retweet my content. But it’s far more valuable if I get them to my site and they share it themselves.

Establish opportunities for the upcoming month.

Once you have all this information, it’s time to make plans for the upcoming month. I like to ask myself a few questions:

Should I alter my strategy based on this month’s findings?

Are my content-marketing efforts serving my business goals? If not, what adjustments should I make to realign my efforts?

How can I make sure that next month’s results are better than this month?

These simple questions set the stage for my next month of marketing. Sometimes I’ll make radical changes. But most of the time, it’s the small tweaks, adjustments and tests that create the lasting impact.

Are you measuring content marketing on a regular basis? If not, make plans to implement monthly check-ins such as these as soon as possible. The fate of your success depends on it.
