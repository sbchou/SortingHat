Bush says will lay out tax reform plan next week in North Carolina,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/8HRORSO-pbA/story01.htm,reuters,"HAMPTON, N.H. Jeb Bush will lay out a tax plan next week aimed at lowering corporate and personal tax rates and giving the U.S. economy a jolt, the Republican presidential candidate said on Thursday.

Bush said he would announce details of his plan on Wednesday in Raleigh, North Carolina. He said he would seek to enable U.S. companies which have an estimated $2 trillion in cash abroad to bring that money home to reinvest in American businesses and create jobs.

Companies keep those funds overseas to avoid having it taxed twice, in the country in which they are doing business and again when brought back to the United States.

""The basic notion of this is to make our tax code the economic driver of investment in our own country,"" the former Florida governor told a town hall event in Hampton, New Hampshire.

Bush did not give a lot of details about his plan, but said the idea would be to ""lower the rates, corporate rates and personal rates, as low as you possibly can, eliminating as many of the deductions as you can.""

Republicans have long sought to pass legislation reducing the U.S. corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have talked about tax reform during President Barack Obama's second term, but the effort has stalled.

""The tax code is rife with all sorts of deductions and credits and make people feel compelled to kind of follow the script rather than say 'I’m going to invest in this business,'"" Bush said.

Bush is a leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, and is one of the many contenders who have made repeated swings through New Hampshire, one of the earliest states to vote in the runup to the November 2016 election.

He said small foreign companies are buying larger American companies in order to take advantage of lower rates.

""I want to reverse that,"" he said, and do this by ""eliminating the worldwide taxation of income.""

Bush said if the tax code can be reformed, it would lead to massive capital investment in the United States.

Bush's goal is to achieve 4 percent economic growth in the United States, a level that has not been reached in years.

He also said he will release the names of his major campaign donors, so-called ""bundlers"" who persuade a group of people to contribute money at the same time.

Is Snapchat worth its political salt?,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/09/03/is-snapchat-worth-its-political-salt/,washpo,"A billboard displays the logo of Snapchat above Times Square in New York March 12, 2015. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson What is Snapchat, and can it actually shift outcomes in a presidential race? Seasoned political hands are asking in response to a blitz of media coverage for Snapchat, a four-year-old mobile application that lets users trade messages that disappear after 24 hours or less. That fact is a feature, not a bug for the platform, which promotes a kind of fun, cryptic Internet banter that can leave curious baby boomers scratching their heads. If you’re a young person and you’ve got an inside joke with friends, there’s a good chance it’s been communicated in some form on Snapchat. Not that you could ever go back and find it or anything. The company defied low expectations — who would use the service except for sexting? — and now sees activity from nearly 100 million people every day, including more than 60 percent of 18-to-34-year-old Americans who use smartphones. The younger skew has made Snapchat the buzziest application of the 2016 election cycle, and the company now promotes itself as the prime venue for political advertising and content designed to sway that elusive and coveted demographic: millennials. Why does Hillary love Snapchat? Watch and learn: https://t.co/ZkevdcvZOY — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) August 15, 2015 Snapchat’s foray into politics only just recently began. The app landed its first political spot on June 6, one month after the company snagged former Google executive Rob Saliterman to sell advertising to campaigns. Washington readers will remember Saliterman as a spokesman for former President George W. Bush and an early pioneer on the White House-to-Silicon Valley career trail. In May, the company plucked another D.C. player to run its news division: former CNN political reporter Peter Hamby. Headlines were positive. The company was eager to play in the presidential race. Snapchat made quick headway. Nearly every 2016 team is using the app in some form or another, whether running advertisements targeted by state (the app can’t hone in closer, for now) or posting “snaps” from behind the scenes. Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush used Snapchat to document their campaign kick-offs. Scott Walker is an active user, aided by his sons, both under 25. John Kasich might not post much original content, but he’s advertised on the platform, as has Walker: Part of Saliterman’s 2016 pitch is the intimacy of viewing ads on the app. Paid content takes up the entire mobile screen, interrupting Snapchat users’ flow of activity (a good thing) to deliver a message that hits them up close, “within arm’s length,” as Saliterman says. Snapchat’s immersive “live story” feature also provides candidates with an opportunity to upload content related to events, like a primary debate. “One of the game changers in the 2016 cycle compared to the 2012 cycle is that a much higher percentage of people involved in the election have smartphones,” Saliterman said in an interview. “This means that almost everyone has a video recording device right in their pocket. And that video can be broadcast instantly through Snapchat.” Snapchat argues it can play a big role in the early primary states by galvanizing millennial voters, increasing a candidate’s standing in the primary and even putting them over the edge. After all, Rick Santorum finished only 34 votes ahead of Mitt Romney in the Iowa caucuses in 2012. Could a Snapchat ad for Romney have made the difference? It’s almost impossible to know, but you can’t rule it out an era when social media has become the primary source of news for millennials. Read more: LinkedIn tries to become destination for candidates, voters From rap lyrics to political speeches: the evolution of Genius Can Medium replace the op-ed page? Still, there’s plenty of skepticism about the app’s political worth. Compared with Facebook and Twitter, Snapchat’s ability to target advertisements and connect viewers back to the campaign are rudimentary. The app’s search function is unwieldy and candidates’ accounts are hard to find. Like other tech firms, the company is also secretive about its plans and analytics, which might prove problematic for campaign ad buyers. For example: how many people view political ads on Snapchat to completion? (Ad buyers have complained that Snapchat charges them for ads viewed for less than one second.) And do candidates reach much of anyone with the content they post themselves? Snapchat won’t say. Wired magazine summed up these critiques in a recent piece titled, “Sorry Snapchat, But You’re Not Winning This Election.” The use of new online platforms has become a defining aspect of the 2016 presidential race, and every candidate wants to prove they’re on board with the latest trends. But sometimes, that just means throwing ideas at the wall, including on Snapchat. Cue the latest experiment from John Kasich: In Hooksett, N.H., Post reporter David Weigel tests out the bacon-themed snapchat geo-filter that presidential candidate John Kasich's campaign rolled out for New Hampshire social media users Sept. 2.

A majority of millennials don&#8217;t think they are millennials,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/03/a-majority-of-millennials-dont-think-they-are-millennials/,washpo,"Millennials doing millennial stuff. (Photo by Kyle Gustafson / For The Washington Post) One of the first big media explorations of the term ""millennial"" came from the pages of Advertising Age magazine. There was a book that came out in September 2000 called ""Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation,"" and within a few months, AdAge's Bonnie Tsui laid out a few thousand words about what this new generation meant for brands. Her savviest point was this: In the past, generations were defined largely by the year in which one was born. Now target marketing has reached the point where generational attitudes are discerned and used as a starting point for media planning. Put another way? Generations mean more in marketing terms than in sociological ones. Which mirrors what Columbia University sociologist Tom DiPrete said when we spoke last year. ""The media in particular wants [generational] definitions, identities,"" he said. ""I don't know that the definitions are as strong or as widely shared across all the boundaries. … At the end I think it gets fuzzy."" A new survey from Pew Research shows that ""millennial"" isn't really how millennials see millennials, either. Pew asked respondents to identify the generation with which each identified, and sorted them by their ""actual"" generation. Obligatory reminder, to DiPrete's point: There is no ""actual"" generation for any group besides the Baby Boomers, which is a statistically defined group. Pew's definition of what counts as millennial -- defined by year of birth -- isn't the same as other organizations'. That said, millennials were less likely than other groups to identify as their ""correct"" generation. (Wearing out my scarequote key here.) Forty percent of people born within Pew's millennial boundaries saw themselves as millennials. Eight percent ... saw themselves as Boomers. Pew notes that the generational self-identity of Millennials (born 1981 to 1997) is lower than that of Generation X (1965 to 1980) or Baby Boomers (1946 to 1964). It's higher than the ""silent generation,"" those born (1928 to 1945). Just as older millennials see themselves as part of Generation X (43 percent of those aged 27 to 34), the silent generation prefers to identify as Boomers or the ""greatest generation"" -- those that fought in World War II. ""In part, this reflects the low visibility of the term 'Silent Generation,'"" Pew's researchers write. But also it probably reflects that the name is lousy. If you gave me the choice between saying I was in the Greatest Generation or the Silent Generation, you know what I'd pick? Pew's question was ""How well would you say the term GREATEST GENERATION applies to you?"" Pretty well, thanks! Eight percent of millennials say they're in the greatest generation, but very, very few of them fought in World War II. I am in Generation X, to the extent that any non-Boomer is anything.* And I remember with great clarity how we were all terrible cynical slackers that wore flannel to Ethan Hawke movies. Well, guess what! Millennials see themselves as more cynical than we do. They see themselves as more wasteful and more self-absorbed. Generations now come of age in a world that analyzes and markets and leverages and social medias everything they do, a world in which older people look at younger people and their newfangled music and contraptions, package them into ad hoc groups and judge them poorly. Happened to us; it's happening to them. Millennials, though, are probably more aware of this process. Many of them no doubt know that when we talk about ""millennials,"" we don't actually mean and aren't actually describing them. It's marketing! And in the lingo, ""millennial"" means ""young"" or ""new."" It's a framework that allows things like this 2007 exploration of how millennials behave and think, produced as sponsored content for ABC family by AdAge. It means that millennials often see ""millennials"" in those defined terms -- which often aren't complimentary. Millennials see themselves as less patriotic than Boomers see themselves -- and less responsible, hard-working, moral, self-reliant, etc. ""To be sure, some of these differences may be related more to age and life stage than to the unique characteristics of today’s generations,"" Pew writes. And since each generation sees itself more positively in the contexts of these positive terms, per Pew, that's likely right. The media made up millennials and then constantly talks about how millennials are young selfie jerks, and voila. No wonder older millennials see themselves as Gen X, given the chance. No Boomer would have chosen that in 1995. And now the kicker. The term ""millennial"" itself apparently stems in part from an informal survey conducted by ABC News in late 1997. When Peter Jennings revealed the results during World News Tonight, he explained that ""the second largest number though there should be no label [for the generation] at all, and the greatest interest was in the millennium generation, or the millennials."" As often happens, the runners-up had the better point. * Weirdly enough, one sociologist I spoke with thinks that the millennial generation may end up sharing enough sociological indicators to be a ""real"" generational cohort! For now, though, it's still mostly marketing.",0.99226916031240353

Weekly Jobless Claims Rise; Trade Deficit Narrows,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/business/economy/weekly-jobless-claims-rise-trade-deficit-narrows.html,nyt,"WASHINGTON — The trade deficit in the United States fell in July to its lowest level in five months as exports rose broadly, signaling underlying strength in the economy despite concerns about a global growth slowdown.

The Commerce Department said the trade gap narrowed 7.4 percent to $41.9 billion, the smallest level since February. The trade deficit for June was revised to $45.2 billion from the previously reported $43.8 billion.

When adjusted for inflation, the deficit fell to $56.2 billion in July from $59 billion the previous month.

The smaller deficit implied a modest contribution to gross domestic product from trade early in the third quarter. Trade contributed 0.3 percentage point to the economy's 3.7 percent annualized growth rate in the second quarter.

Other data released on Thursday showed an increase in the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits. The trend in jobless claims, however, remained consistent with a strengthening labor market.

The Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 282,000 for the week that ended on Tuesday.

The claims data has no bearing on Friday’s closely watched employment report for August as it fell outside the survey period. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls most likely increased by 220,000 last month after rising 215,000 in July.

But job gains could come in below expectations as the first reading of August payrolls has tended to be weaker in the last several years before being revised higher.

The August employment report will be released less than two weeks before the Federal Reserve's Sept. 16-17 policy-setting meeting. There is speculation the central bank could raise interest rates at that meeting.

The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it smooths out week-to-week volatility, rose 3,250 to 275,500 last week.

It was the 23rd consecutive week that the four-week average remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is usually associated with a strengthening labor market.

In July, exports increased 0.4 percent to $188.5 billion. While that was the first increase since April, exports remain constrained by a strong dollar. The dollar has gained 16.8 percent against the currencies of the United States’ main trading partners since June 2014.

Exports to China fell 1.9 percent, and imports from that country dipped 0.2 percent. That left the politically sensitive United States-China trade deficit at $31.6 billion, up 0.4 percent from June. The trade deficit with China will be closely watched in the coming months after that country devalued its currency in August.

Exports to Canada fell 8.3 percent in July and could come under more pressure after the Canadian economy slipped into recession in the second quarter.",0.69611056128451287
Make a Monthly Content-Marketing Check-In a Must-Do,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/national/~3/BLZpmyGA0jY/,fox,"A monthly content-marketing check-in gives you the opportunity to measure the success of your campaigns. Without a regular review, you won’t be able to take a strategic approach to your efforts, and if you don’t understand where you’re at, you can’t create a clear path for where you’re going.

Entrepreneurs that fully invest in content marketing will generate an abundance of data as their campaigns grow. It’s crucial that you have a plan for analyzing these numbers and making adjustments to your efforts along the way.

Content marketing is a dynamic effort. You’ll want to test different things and see what works and what doesn’t. The only way to truly know that is through regular check-ins.

Review progress of overall goals.

Start the check-in with a brief review of your overall goals. Your content-marketing team should have set these initial goals in the beginning of your efforts.

( source)

Goals are important because they set the baseline for all other analyses. For example, an increase in traffic doesn’t have value if there isn’t a business goal to measure it against. But if you knew that your overall goal was an increase in monthly revenue, you can measure your financial results against your traffic to see if you’re on track with your goals.

That said, things change. Make sure to reevaluate your goals once a quarter to be sure they’re still applicable.

Related: How to Use Content Marketing to Build a Brand with Purpose

Measure traffic changes.

Review your traffic and see how it changed compared to last month. If you’re investing in content marketing, you’ll want to see that your efforts are continuing to bring in new traffic from different sources. Some questions to ask yourself include:

Which traffic source increased/decreased?

Did any product launches or events create a large bump in traffic this month?

Have we recently done a trade show, mailer or other marketing campaigns that could account for the increase in traffic?

Have we started or ended any prominent partnerships with industry leaders?

Try to find the reason for any major shift in traffic. It will help you evaluate what’s working and what isn’t.

Recap campaign performance.

Look at how your content-marketing efforts have impacted your marketing performance overall. Specifically, you’ll want to analyze:

Traffic to landing pages from content-marketing efforts, such as blogging or guest blogging.

Lead-generation numbers compared to last month.

Results of A/B tests on content-related items such as call-to-action copy on blog posts.

Conversion rates and traffic from social-media campaigns.

You’ll learn a lot when you evaluate your content marketing against your other digital-marketing campaigns, as doing so will help you see the true impact of your efforts.

Look at your content-marketing landing pages.

For the most part, you’ll be creating landing pages focused on lead generation. These types of landing pages typically include a form that aims to convert viewers to email list subscribers. But there are other types of landing pages as well.

In content marketing, you can develop things such as resources pages and in-depth guides that serve as landing pages. If you’ve developed this type of content, evaluate its success.

Look at metrics such as the number of social shares, traffic increases or decreases, conversion rate and new leads acquired this month. Knowing this data can help you evaluate whether this type of content works with your audience. If it does, you can make plans to do more of it in the future.

Related: How Much Should Your Content Marketing Really Cost?

Identify top-performing blog posts.

Some of your blog posts will out-perform others. Identifying the types of posts that are performing best on your website gives your team special insight. You can use this information to guide your future topics, hone in your buyer personas, direct your marketing team and locate opportunities for blog-post optimization.

Specific metrics you can use to gauge success include:

Number of views

Conversion rate

Number of social shares

Number of comments

Keyword rankings

I particularly like this part of the check-in because it directly correlates to the type of content that resonates with your audience. The more you can narrow down those topics, the better.

Track social-media impact.

Content marketing is great, but it won’t accomplish much if you don’t promote it. Social media is one of the main ways many marketers promote their content. Review how much traffic is coming from your social-media channels. Also, measure how many people arrive on your site and then share your content to their social profiles.

I’ve found that it’s one thing for someone to retweet my content. But it’s far more valuable if I get them to my site and they share it themselves.

Establish opportunities for the upcoming month.

Once you have all this information, it’s time to make plans for the upcoming month. I like to ask myself a few questions:

Should I alter my strategy based on this month’s findings?

Are my content-marketing efforts serving my business goals? If not, what adjustments should I make to realign my efforts?

How can I make sure that next month’s results are better than this month?

These simple questions set the stage for my next month of marketing. Sometimes I’ll make radical changes. But most of the time, it’s the small tweaks, adjustments and tests that create the lasting impact.

Are you measuring content marketing on a regular basis? If not, make plans to implement monthly check-ins such as these as soon as possible. The fate of your success depends on it.

Who’s Who in the Hillary Clinton Email Controversy,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/09/03/whos-who-in-the-hillary-clinton-email-controversy/,wsj,"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton‘s aides have been drawn into the lawsuits and investigations into her use of a private email server for government business.

Two top aides are on Capitol Hill this week testifying in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, while another has said he will invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions in the course of the investigation.

Here’s a guide to who is who in the Clinton email drama:

Ms. Mills is a longtime attorney, campaign aide and adviser to the Clinton family. She most recently served as chief of Staff to Mrs. Clinton at the State Department. Before that she served in Bill Clinton‘s White House and on Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign. She is on Capitol Hill Thursday testifying behind closed doors before the Benghazi committee.

***

Another top aide to Mrs. Clinton at the State Department, Mr. Sullivan is a foreign-policy expert and an adviser to her 2016 campaign. He also served on Vice President Joe Biden‘s national security staff. He is expected to testify in front of the Benghazi committee on Friday.

Ms. Abedin worked for Mrs. Clinton at the State Department as deputy chief of staff and currently serves on her 2016 campaign. Ms. Abedin obtained permission to work as a special State Department employee, and was also on the payroll of the Clinton Foundation and the consulting firm Teneo. The State Department’s inspector general found this year that she was overpaid by almost $10,000 by the State Department — a finding that Ms. Abedin’s attorneys are challenging.

Mr. Reines served as a senior adviser to Mrs. Clinton at the State Department, often handling her media requests. His emails are the subject of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the website Gawker seeking access to his correspondence with reporters.

Mr. Pagliano served as an information technology staffer on Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign before going to work for the State Department. He set up the server in question for Mrs. Clinton before it was later transferred to a professional IT company based in Denver. Through an attorney, he announced this week that he would invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions in the congressional investigations into the email server.

A longtime friend and political confidant of the Clinton family, Mr. Blumenthal was denied a job in the State Department under pressure from the White House. He nevertheless stayed in close contact with Mrs. Clinton during her time in office. He testified in a closed door session in front of the Benghazi committee in May.

Jeb Bush Broadens Attack on Donald Trump,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/09/03/jeb-bush-broadens-attack-on-donald-trump/,wsj,"HAMPTON, N.H. A Jeb Bush broadened his attack on Donald Trump Thursday, saying the Republican Party faces a stark choice–both on issues and worldview between himself and the real estate mogul and reality television celebrity who is the front-runner for the 2016 GOP nomination.

There's one candidate in the Republican Party that is preying on people's angst and fears that has a philosophy not about goodness and greatness of the American people, Mr. Bush said in a town hall meeting here. Donald Trump's view is that the end is near.

Mr. Bush said the party is better off with a more upbeat conservative message because when we give people hopeâ¦we can lift them up.''

I choose that path because the other path will lead to defeat, but more importantly, it will lead to more angst, more anger said Mr. Bush, drawing differences with Mr. Trump on taxes, immigration and other policies. Whatever the issue, there is one path that is aspirational and hopeful and there is one path that is negative and is not the right path for this country.”

And one day after Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Bush for speaking in Spanish on the campaign trail, the bilingual former Florida governor slipped in a Spanish phrase when he called on Republicans to campaign with our arms wide open.

Mr. Trump on Wednesday complained about Mr. Bush's use of Spanish saying that he should  set the example by speaking English while in the U.S.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Bush on ABC's Good Morning America responded to that complaint by saying, I think Donald Trump is trying to insult his way to the presidency and it’s not going to work. People want an uplifting hopeful message. People come to this country to pursue their dreams, sometimes they start without speaking English but they learn English and they add vitality to our country.

The town hall was held on a factory floor after Mr. Bush toured a plant of Foss Manufacturing, a synthetic fabric firm. Workers in attendance included fans, foes and the indifferent. Employees said attendance was not mandatory, but the plant's production line was shut down to make it easier for them and their families to attend.

One questioner attacked Mr. Bush's immigration policies, saying it amounted to appeasement to propose allowing a pathway to legal status for millions of people in the U.S. illegally,

We are pissed off right now, said Dennis Lamare of Lee, N.H. There is an air of appeasement.

Responding to Mr. Lamare, Mr. Bush took a swipe at two of Mr. Trump's signature immigration proposals A building a wall on the southern border and having Mexico pay for it, which Mr. Bush called ludicrous,  and deporting people here illegally and their families.

Rounding people up Mr. Bush said, would create real chaos and cost hundreds of billions of dollars.

"Ben Carson Wins in Matchup With Donald Trump, Poll Shows",http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/09/03/ben-carson-wins-in-matchup-with-donald-trump-poll-shows/,wsj,"If Donald Trump has an Achilles’ heel in the Republican presidential nominating contest, it just might be the candidate who is least like him: soft-spoken retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who for months was the field’s front-runner, lost with 37% to Mr. Trump’s 56%. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio‘s margin was similarly poor: 38% to 52%. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker lost 38% to 53%; Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul 27% to 60%; Ohio Gov. John Kasich 29% to  62%; and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie 30% to 63%. Former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz came the closest, losing 37% to  50% and 41% to 48%, respectively.

In a matchup with Mr. Carson, Mr. Trump didn’t even come close. He lost with 36% of GOP voters’ support, compared with 55% for Mr. Carson. Neither candidate has ever held elected office.

“The fact that the only one who can challenge Trump is the only other candidate who has never held or run for elected office speaks volumes to the low regard GOP voters have for the establishment,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, in a statement.

Mrs. Fiorina has also never held elected office, and has seen a distinct bump in polling following her widely praised performance in the second-tier debate held last month.

As Mr. Trump draws hefty crowds around the country and lands in the headlines for his bombastic, often controversial remarks, little attention has been paid to Mr. Carson, who rocketed to fame in conservative political circles after criticizing the health-care law in a 2013 National Prayer Breakfast speech while President Barack Obama sat just feet away. But Mr. Carson has been quietly building support, with a recent survey by TargetPoint Consulting, a top GOP polling and data-research firm, finding that roughly two-thirds of likely Republican voters would consider backing him—the highest level of support for any candidate in the field. Just 16% said they wouldn’t, the lowest such tally.

Mr. Carson is currently polling second among GOP voters, according to a Real Clear Politics average of recent national polls. He has 13.2% of support, to Mr. Trump’s 27.2%, according to that average.

Prosecutors plan to seek death penalty for accused Charleston church gunman Dylann Roof,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/09/03/prosecutors-plan-to-seek-death-penalty-for-accused-charleston-church-gunman/,washpo,"Dylann Roof (R), the 21-year-old man charged with the killings. (Randall Hill/Reuters) Prosecutors in South Carolina intend to seek a death sentence for Dylann Roof, the man accused of killing nine black parishioners in a Charleston, S.C., church earlier this year. Roof has been charged with nine counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder for the June massacre. Scarlett A. Wilson, the prosecutor in the case, has a news conference scheduled for Thursday afternoon to make an announcement regarding the case. Court documents filed Thursday show that the state intends to seek the death penalty for Roof. Under South Carolina law, prosecutors can seek a death sentence if there are certain aggravating factors in a case, including if someone is charged with murdering more than one person during a single act.

How To Make Gravlax (and Save Big on Cured Salmon),http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-make-gravlax-and-save-big-on-cured-salmon-1441298027,wsj,"IN BEVERLY HILLS, where I grew up, Sunday mornings meant trekking off to Nate ’n Al and stuffing myself with enough lox, bagels and cream cheese to last until dinner and beyond. I could hardly imagine anything more delicious than the deli’s lox—mildly salted, lightly cold-smoked Nova Scotia salmon. As time passed, however, I graduated to Scottish, Irish and Norwegian smoked salmons and liked them even better. But their high price relegated them to the “special occasion food” category.

The real game-changer first appeared to me on a Stockholm restaurant menu. Gravlax, thinly sliced and rosy-orange, looked like smoked salmon, but its meltingly tender texture and cleaner taste were new, and wonderful. I learned that preparing gravlax was smoke-free and dead simple, a mere matter of smothering a very fresh salmon fillet in salt, sugar and abundant fresh dill, and refrigerating it for a couple of days. Here was something even a kitchen novice could manage at home—and quite inexpensively to boot.

Guests devour my home-cured gravlax enthusiastically whether it’s served as an hors d’oeuvre, a sandwich filling, a brunch-buffet anchor or a light main course. If I’m feeling traditional, I’ll serve dark or rye bread and a sweet mustard-dill sauce as accompaniments. Sometimes, however, I go all Nordic-minimal, presenting the thinly sliced gravlax with nothing but cracked pepper and a drizzle of lemon juice or champagne vinegar.

Whether you opt to serve your gravlax naked or sauced, use only the very freshest fish to make it. Once cured, if well-wrapped and refrigerated, gravlax will last up to a week. But if you smell any off odors, discard it sooner.

This style of preparation dates back to the middle ages, when Scandinavian fishermen simply buried salted salmon on the beach to preserve it, and the process hasn’t gotten any more complicated in the intervening centuries. Once you’ve mastered the making of gravlax you may want to experiment. The salt-to-sugar ratio is a question of personal taste. And some cooks include additional spices—caraway, coriander and fennel seeds all nicely complement the fresh dill.

I’ve even dallied with versions spiked with aquavit—which, by the way, also makes a delicious and appropriately brisk drink pairing for this herbed and salty food. The curing time is not set in stone either. Longer equals a stronger flavor, and vice versa.

Making it at home not only saves you the money you’d otherwise spend on all those imported salmons; it also means you can have your gravlax just as you like it. What a luxury.

1. Combine salt, sugar, toasted fennel seeds and crushed peppercorns in a small bowl.

2. Line a deep dish or plastic container with a long piece of foil, letting ends trail out of dish. Cut salmon in half crosswise and place one half, skin-side down, on top of foil.

3. Sprinkle half of spice mix evenly over fish, top with bunch of dill and sprinkle remaining spice over dill. Place remaining salmon, skin-side up, on top.

4. Wrap with foil, place a bowl on top of foil and weight with a heavy can. Refrigerate 48-72 hours, turning foil packet periodically and replacing weight. At end of curing, unwrap, discard dill and wipe spices from fish. (Rinse fish for a less-salty result.) Sprinkle with chopped dill. To serve, thinly slice gravlax against the grain.",0.32027119441894059
Texans WR Strong learning value of sacrifice in the NFL,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/sports/~3/5mAOn3x5ZHg/,fox,"Aug 22, 2015; Houston, TX, USA; Houston Texans head coach Bill O'Brien talks with wide receiver Jaelen Strong (11) before a game against the Denver Broncos at NRG Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports

Houston Texans wide receiver Jaelen Strong has helped turn tough love from the coaching staff into a productive preseason performance.

Strong, a third-round pick out of Arizona State, has two touchdown receptions though Houston's first three exhibition games.

It's a noticeable improvement for the rookie, who was featured on 'Hard Knocks' two weeks ago being lectured by coaches. Strong credits advice he's received from veteran receiver Nate Washington and receivers coach Stan Hixon, among others, for helping him settle in during camp.

""Study, study, study, study,"" Strong said, per ESPN's Tania Ganguli. ""Sacrifice a lot of things. I'd rather give up everything just to be perfect on the football field. That's just how my mindset has changed. Before I was trying to take little pieces here, little pieces there. You've got to make that sacrifice.""

Strong, who was taken with the 70th pick in the draft, has impressed the coaching staff with his skillset in camp.

""He's improved every week,"" Texans coach Bill O'Brien said. ""I think that he's taken the coaching to heart. He's a very talented guy. He's big, he's strong, he's a very instinctive player, he makes contested catches. I think that he's improved every week. The key for Jaelen is the key for every rookie, is to keep improving.""

The 21-year-old said Washington has helped provide valuable perspective on what it takes to be successful in the NFL.

""He told me he's in his 11th year and he's still trying to make the team,"" Strong said. ""There's always somebody coming for your spot. Always somebody trying to take that food off your plate. Granted these are your teammates, you go out there to win together. But it's your job. This is how you feed your family. Everything you do you've gotta do it the right way.""

Report: Patriots don't plan to play Tom Brady in preseason finale,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/sports/~3/CdQMqflHbvg/,fox,"Tom Brady is officially available to start for the New England Patriots in Week 1 following the nullification of his four-game suspension, but fans will have to wait until next Thursday to see their quarterback on the field.

According to Jeff Howe of the Boston Herald, a source said that the Patriots are unlikely to play Brady in the preseason finale on Thursday night.

This should come as no surprise, as the majority of starters across the NFL will be relegated to being cheerleaders on the sidelines tonight.

With Brady now available to play in the regular season opener, the Patriots could now play Jimmy Garoppolo for some time in the preseason finale. He's no longer going to be the starter this season and can still benefit from extra preseason time to work on some things -- even if it is against the Giants' backup defense.

While it's disappointing Brady won't be on the field Thursday night against the Giants, Patriots fans are just a short week away from seeing the quarterback back in action against the Steelers in Week 1.

Small Business and the Secret of Big Growth,http://www.wsj.com/articles/small-business-and-the-secret-of-big-growth-1441234231,wsj,"Tired of plodding growth, stagnant wages and widening inequality, most Americans have little positive to say about the U.S. economy. With one notable exception. In a Gallup poll this summer, almost two-thirds expressed confidence in small businesses. That’s three times as many as said the same about big business. Only the U.S. military ranks consistently as high.

The faith in small business runs deep but rests on an increasingly unsure foundation. Small firms have been slow to recover from the recession, and business deaths now outpace births for the first time since the Census Bureau began keeping records more than three decades ago. A July survey by the National Small Business Association showed that only 35% of owners are optimistic about the direction of the economy.

These warning signs should light a fire under Democrats and Republicans. The health of small local firms is one of the vital signs of democracy, a key indicator of community well-being.

Small businesses continue to create most new jobs and employ about half of the private workforce, according to data from the Small Business Administration. They are launchpads for innovation and opportunity. As chairman of McLarty Cos., a fourth-generation family-owned automotive firm that began as a single car dealership in Hope, Ark., I’ve seen firsthand how small businesses can transform Main Street into an avenue to the American dream.

That avenue is now strewn with potholes and obstacles, including taxes and regulations. Despite the gilded image of startups like Uber and Airbnb, many new small firms struggle to find financing. Wendy Guillies, president of the Kauffman Foundation, reported earlier this year that more than half of young companies that applied for credit were turned down. Her conclusion: “Across the board, the American economy appears to be getting less dynamic.”

Where can we look for big thinking about small business? Neither the sweeping promises of economic populism, aimed largely at Wall Street, nor the antigovernment reflexes of some on the right, squarely address the problems of small business. But policies that help smaller firms compete, thrive and create good jobs are needed, and there are good ideas from both sides of the political aisle.

Tax reform is one such idea. Small businesses can’t compete with large corporations that find creative ways to lower their taxes. The money they must spend to comply with the complicated tax code is a heavy burden. Addressing these points last month, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton proposed a program of “tax relief and simplification” for entrepreneurs, and promised “less red tape” and “easier access to capital.”

Mrs. Clinton has said that she wants to be “the small business president.” She will not be alone on the campaign trail. Among Republicans, Gov. John Kasich pushed this year to eliminate the income tax in Ohio on most small businesses. Jeb Bush’s supporters cite his record as governor when Florida was the nation’s leader in small business creation.

In Congress, bipartisan efforts are seeking to curb some onerous regulations for small businesses. The Small Business Healthcare Relief Act is sponsored by Sens. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) and Heidi Heitkamp (D., N.D.) and Reps. Charles Boustany Jr. (R., La.) and Mike Thompson (D., Calif.). It would protect firms with fewer than 50 employees that offer health reimbursement accounts being penalized under the Affordable Care Act for providing this cost-sharing option to employees.

Congress and the White House also should rally bipartisan support for the expansion of vocational training and apprenticeships. In a recent survey by the National Federation of Independent Business, about half of small business owners seeking new employees said they had difficulty finding qualified applicants. Training costs for small businesses should be offset by tax breaks and other incentives.

A thread running through these efforts is an opportunity to find common political cause, the antithesis of today’s unfortunate division and distrust. After all, it takes cooperation to launch a small business. As the late Republican Congressman Jack Kemp once said, “You can’t create more employees without first creating more employers.” And you can’t sustain employers without a well-trained, fairly paid and engaged workforce.

Small business owners are clear about what they want from Washington. Asked in last month’s National Small Business Association survey to rank their priorities for the administration and Congress, the top responses were simplify and cut taxes, reduce the national deficit, and “end the partisan gridlock and work together.” The message to the country’s political leadership is clear: Lead, or get out of the way.

Hillary Could Lose Iowa---and New Hampshire,http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-could-lose-iowaand-new-hampshire-1441234267,wsj,"Political junkies are focused on Donald Trump, but Hillary Clinton’s weakness remains a huge story. Her support among Iowa’s likely Democratic caucusgoers has dropped to 37%, down 20 points since May, according to an Aug. 26 Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll. Meanwhile, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is up 16 points to 30%, and Vice President Joe Biden, who isn’t even running, is up six points to 14%.

The poll caused great consternation among Mrs. Clinton’s supporters, as it should have. Some of her advocates tried to claim that the survey contained good news, in that the former secretary of state’s favorable rating among Democratic caucusgoers remained at 77%.

But if Mrs. Clinton’s favorables remained high while she hemorrhaged support, then Iowa Democrats are moving to Mr. Sanders not because they dislike her but because she doesn’t excite them, and they like him more. That too was polled. Only 2% of Mr. Sanders’s backers said that their decision to support him was because they don’t support Mrs. Clinton.

But is there a Democrat who—absent something extraordinary, say, Mrs. Clinton’s indictment over mishandling classified information on her private email account—can beat her for the nomination?

If this is the field, the answer is probably no. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee are vying to avoid being asterisks in the polls.

Things will probably get worse for Mrs. Clinton in the short term. It’s possible, even likely, that she will lose both the Feb. 1 Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary eight days later. Mr. Sanders will appeal in a state like Iowa, where there is a strong left-wing sentiment, and the caucus format is dominated by more ideologically committed activists. He could carry New Hampshire in a multicandidate field.

But then the calendar becomes Mrs. Clinton’s friend. South Carolina and Nevada are next. Neither is fertile ground for Mr. Sanders, the self-proclaimed democratic socialist. On March 1 come primaries in Arkansas, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas, all states Mrs. Clinton carried in 2008. She will probably fare well on super Tuesday again, except perhaps in Massachusetts, a next-door neighbor to Mr. Sanders’s home state.

There also will be primaries that day in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, Vermont and Virginia, states that then-Sen. Barack Obama carried in 2008. Vermont will go for its favorite son, but Mrs. Clinton stands a better chance than Mr. Sanders in the others if she has the backing of black Democratic leaders who voted for Mr. Obama seven years ago.

Competing in these primaries will be expensive. A reasonable flight of three or four weeks of television ads in those states will cost north of $30 million, even at the low rates candidates are guaranteed by the FCC, and more if the ads are bought by a super PAC. Mrs. Clinton is likely to have the cash; Mr. Sanders is not, even if his fundraising gets a boost from early victories.

The contests between March 5 and March 15 appear inhospitable for Mr. Sanders as well. Mrs. Clinton carried Florida, Michigan and Ohio in 2008 and virtually tied in Missouri, even with Sen. Claire McCaskill helping out Mr. Obama. This time she will be helping Hillary. Mr. Obama carried his home state of Illinois, Kansas (where he claimed family ties), Louisiana and Mississippi. All four, especially the Southern states, seem better turf for Mrs. Clinton this time.

There are also March caucuses in Colorado, Minnesota and Nebraska. Unprepared for most caucuses in 2008, Mrs. Clinton got walloped. Even if she’s learned a lesson, Mr. Sanders could be competitive in parts of Colorado and Minnesota.

Mr. Sanders’s problem is simply that there aren’t enough left-wing enclaves like Portland and Berkeley, Madison and Ann Arbor, Burlington and Boulder for him to beat her for the nomination.

Could Vice President Joe Biden, though? Mr. Biden would do better in the blue-collar parts of Missouri and Michigan than Mr. Sanders—and maybe even Mrs. Clinton. But once the contest runs through the South, he would have to pick up a substantial part of the black vote. It’s one thing to vacation in South Carolina, as Mr. Biden does. It’s another thing to generate the level of support that Mr. Obama enjoyed there in 2008.

Still, the more candidates in the Democratic race, the more Mrs. Clinton’s numbers will drop, and the more unconventional the nominating process will become. And in this election, unconventional is doing better than expected.

Small-Business Hiring Picks Up,http://www.wsj.com/articles/small-business-hiring-picks-up-1441279409,wsj,"Hiring at small businesses increased in August, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. Its monthly employer survey finds that NFIB members added a net 0.13 workers per firm in recent months, which was better than July’s 0.05 reading and represents “a large improvement in hiring activity,” according to the NFIB’s William Dunkelberg. Morning Editorial Report reviewed the survey results, which will be released later today.

The good news is that business conditions are improving and small employers did not freak out over the August volatility on Wall Street. The bad news is that the improvement is likely not large enough to pull the economy out of “the same old 2-2.5% rut” for GDP growth in the second half of the year, according to Mr. Dunkelberg. Still, based on today’s numbers, he expects the Department of Labor’s August employment report to show job gains of 250,000 or more.

After a solid second quarter for GDP growth, your correspondent wonders if low fuel prices are finally starting to drive the economy out of the Obama-era malaise and offset Washington’s myriad policy mistakes.

Speaking of policy mistakes, Hillary Clinton is proposing an FDR-style tax distortion for investments, and Alan Reynolds describes what happened after this policy was implemented in the 1930s. “In the 12 months between February 1937 and 1938, the Dow Jones Industrial stock average fell 41%...That crash presaged one of the nation’s worst recessions, from May 1937 to June 1938, with GDP falling 10% and industrial production 32%,” writes Mr. Reynolds.

As for Mrs. Clinton’s most famous recent mistake, a Journal editorial notes her “self-serving decision to use a private email server for official communications may have resulted in far greater mishandling of classified information.”

The big mistake for Senate Democrats is giving the President enough support to sustain a veto of GOP efforts to block his Iran nuclear deal. The Democrats “now own the Ayatollahs,” notes a Journal editorial.

Next comes the “spectacle” of “the President’s party using a procedural dodge to avoid voting on the merits” of a hugely consequential international agreement. “Previous arms-control pacts of this magnitude were submitted as treaties requiring two-thirds approval by the Senate. Mr. Obama and Senate Democrats maneuvered the Iran deal as an ‘executive agreement,’ so he is able to commit America to trusting the Ayatollahs with the support of a mere partisan minority. At least ObamaCare had a partisan majority,” notes the Journal.

Also today, Daniel Henninger explains why much of the Obama crowd wants Joe Biden to run, and Karl Rove explains why Hillary Clinton could lose both Iowa and New Hampshire.
