"Washington (CNN)Marco Rubio says socialism is distinct from the communism his parents fled in Cuba and he doesn't fault Bernie Sanders for promoting it -- but that doesn't mean he agrees with his Senate colleague.
The Florida Republican corrected a questioner at a ""Life of the Party"" event in New Hampshire Wednesday who compared Sanders' brand of socialism with what Rubio's family fled when they left Cuba.
""In fairness, they fled communism,"" Rubio interjected. ""There is social democracy, right, like you see in Europe, where government provides for every aspect of your life, but there's consequence to that. They fled communism, which is beyond socialism, obviously where government controls society, but also government controls politics, life, the banning of religion, people were being executed.""
RELATED: Rubio dismisses questions about his finances
The questioner took his point, but asked him if he ever wants to tell Sanders that he's going too far.
Rubio disagreed, saying that while he's not a supporter of socialism, he praises Sanders for speaking his mind. 
""What I appreciate about Bernie is he's not trying to shirk from it,"" Rubio said. ""It's what he believes in. He's honest about it.""
He also noted that the viewpoint obviously resonates with plenty of people who support Sanders' presidential campaign and have re-elected him in Vermont.
""I don't think it works for America,"" Rubio said. ""My argument is, you want to live in a country like that -- there's like dozens of countries around the world that are socialist -- move there. We should continue to be America.""
But the beauty of democracy, Rubio added, is that the debate can happen.
""I don't personally have a problem with Bernie because he's being honest about what he believes in. I'd love to have that debate,"" Rubio said. 
While in New Hampshire, Rubio picked up a third endorsement from former Scott Walker state co-chairs, adding the support of Phyllis Woods, according to NH1.

"With no presidential election or congressional seats on the line, Tuesday’s election watchers were focused on some high-profile ballot initiatives, a governor race in Kentucky and a handful of other races. Here are some of the highlights, compiled from the Journal’s reports across the country.

San Francisco voters rejected a ballot measure that would have limited short-term housing rentals to 75 nights a year, a victory for Airbnb Inc., which waged a sophisticated political campaign to defeat it. Proposition F, dubbed the “Airbnb Initiative,” underscored the class tensions roiling San Francisco as a technology boom contributes to rising housing prices in the city. Airbnb, based in San Francisco, deployed veteran field organizers and hundreds of volunteers to defeat the measure, outraising backers 18-1 with an $8 million effort, according to campaign filings.

Republican Matt Bevin won a bitterly fought race for Kentucky governor Tuesday, handing the GOP a coveted seat that extends its hold on the South and imperiling the state’s closely watched implementation of the federal health law. The race between Mr. Bevin, a 48-year-old businessman, and Democrat Jack Conway, the 46-year-old state attorney general, was the most high-profile of three gubernatorial contests this year. The candidates were vying to succeed Gov. Steve Beshear, a popular Democrat who was barred by law from running for a third term. In another race, Republican Gov. Phil Bryant of Mississippi easily won re-election against Democrat Robert Gray, a little-known truck driver. Read the full article.

In a victory for social conservatives, voters in Houston overwhelmingly rejected a ballot measure to extend nondiscrimination protections to gay and transgender people. Known as the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, or HERO, the measure would have banned discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, race and a dozen other categories. It was backed heavily by Houston Mayor Annise Parker and a cadre of national Democratic political figures, and proponents poured more than $3 million into the push to pass it. Read the full article.

Ohio voters rejected a ballot measure legalizing marijuana for recreational and medical uses, dealing a blow to pot industry investors looking to build on a series of ballot victories across the country. The Ohio marijuana measure has been controversial from the start, and not just because it was trying to legalize marijuana in the Midwest. Local investors in the pot industry were behind the ballot initiative, spending more than $20 million to collect signatures to force a statewide vote and then funding the campaign to try to win its passage.

Former Bridgeport Mayor Joseph Ganim, who spent seven years in prison after he was convicted on corruption charges, was returned to office Tuesday, completing a stunning political comeback in the state’s most populous city. The 56-year old Democrat beat six opponents. He was the front-runner in the mayoral race, having secured the endorsement of the local Democratic Party and winning a a three-way primary in September.

Presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina will be sharing her views with Joy Behar, Raven Symone and the other co-hosts of ABC’s mid-morning talk show, “The View,” but the network allegedly tried to reschedule her Friday appearance just days before it is set to take place.
Despite a highly publicized back-and-forth between the ladies of “The View” and Fiorina during the past several days, according to Fiorina’s deputy campaign manager Sarah Isgur Flores, ABC wanted to push off Fiorina’s sit-down until the day after the next Republican debate.
Flores said during “The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson” on Wednesday that after some confusion, Friday’s appearance is set.
“As far as I know, we are still confirmed for Friday,” she said. “I hope that they'll continue to have us on. We are certainly looking forward to hearing what they have to say to Carly’s face, and hopefully they will want to talk about the issues instead of doubling down on these catty remarks.”
A rep for “The View” told FOX411 on Wednesday morning that Fiorina would appear on Friday as planned. A promo for the Fiorina appearance ran during Wednesday’s episode of “The View.”
During that episode, while speaking about Jeb Bush, host Whoopi Goldberg discussed why she feels politicians should come on “The View.”

“If you can’t handle us, you… can’t be president,” Goldberg said. “There’s all kind of folks, and we don’t necessarily agree with all your politics… so come on. We’re interested. We want to let our folks know what’s going on.”  On Oct. 29, Behar and Michelle Collins ridiculed Fiorina’s last debate appearance. The hosts branded her smile “demented” and suggested there should be a “smiling Fiorina” Halloween mask on shelves.
The presidential candidate responded to the comments on “Fox News Sunday.” She said she is “tired of being insulted by liberal feminists.”
“It will not stop me. It will not scare me,” Fiorina declared. “... Let’s see if they have the guts to say that to my face.”
During Monday’s episode of the show, Goldberg responded to Fiorina’s criticism of the show.
“Just so we’re all clear, you have to know the difference between when somebody’s coming for you, when somebody is paying you a compliment and when somebody is saying, ‘here’s my observation,’” she said. “If you can get that together, maybe you can be president.”",,"Despite a highly publicized back-and-forth between the ladies of “The View” and Fiorina during the past several days, according to Fiorina’s campaign manager Sarah Isgur Flores, ABC wanted to push off Fiorina’s sit-down until the day after the next Republican debate.",‘The View’ tried to postpone Carly Fiorina appearance?,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/entertainment/~3/ZXE3E25LA7s/,[u'personality'],"[u'Jeb Bush', u'Gretchen Carlson', u'Sarah Isgur Flores', u'Michelle Collins', u'Carly Fiorina', u'Whoopi Goldberg', u'Joy Behar']",fox,0.49648703051649634,[],2015-11-04 19:25:28,[],c6ae6e95f02f88c4ba2bf8f1542d137b,2015-11-04 19:56:40.583562

“Good Morning America” co-host Lara Spencer got flak on Tuesday when she seemed to post an Instagram pic of herself sitting on presidential candidate Donald Trump’s lap.
Comments on the shot, which appeared to show smiling Spencer and Trump with his arm around her and his own grin, included “Unprofessional,” “Gross!” and “You are a professional. Sitting on his lap. Really? I think it’s inappropriate.”
Another countered, “These comments display what is wrong with America. Lighten up people!”
But ABC reps explained the image was an optical illusion. Trump was seated on the “GMA” set on a tall chair at a table, and Spencer was standing next to him. Spencer also changed the pic’s caption to clear up any confusion.





Let’s clear this up – I’m standing next to Donald Trump. Said a quick hello and welcomed him to the GMA studio for first time since he announced his candidacy.

" (CNN)France has long been a punching bag for U.S. conservatives, but Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush has jokingly apologized for one jab he made that he says in retrospect went too far.
Bush's original comment came last week when he criticized rival Marco Rubio in a Republican debate over his poor voting record. 
""The Senate, what is it like, a French work week?"" Bush said. ""You get, like, three days where you have to show up?""
Speaking to reporters on his campaign bus on Tuesday, the former Florida governor said, ""I made the mistake of saying that the Congress operates on a French work week,"" according to Time magazine. 
""I really did a disservice to the French,"" Bush continued with a chuckle, adding shortly thereafter. ""I now know that the average French work week is actually greater than the German work week.""
""So, my God, I totally insulted an entire country -- our first ally -- that helped us become free as a nation! And I apologize. That did a huge disservice to France. It didn't really get to the magnitude of the problem: Three-day work week.""
CNN has reached to the Bush campaign for additional comment.
French media pounced on the debate statement shortly after it came out, poking holes in the description and calling it a false stereotype. 
The Bush campaign dismissed these rebuttals. 
""Not too concerned about attacks from the French media,"" Bush communications director Tim Miller told CNNMoney. ""Jeb's working far more than 40 hours a week!""
""French"" is a familiar smear in conservative circles. In the 2004 presidential election, Republicans repeatedly taunted John Kerry for being too French-like. And the GOP famously led efforts to change French fries to freedom fries in Capitol Hill cafeterias.

"Washington (CNN)Racial discrimination in America has come a long way from the days of forced segregation, but there's still a long way to go, Sen. Marco Rubio said Wednesday.
The rising GOP presidential candidate waxed about the nation's history with racism and the current state of discrimination Wednesday in response to questions at a campaign event with young professionals in New Hampshire. He noted a change that has occurred from his parents first encounter with segregation in America to his kids' interactions with their friends today.
The Florida Republican said it gives him hope to see how little his children pay attention to skin color with their predominantly African-American football team, even compared to his own awareness of race at the same age. But he acknowledged generational change takes time.
""In the short term, I believe we do need to address the reality in this country that there are millions of people who feel that because of the color of their skin, they're followed at the mall, they're treated differently,"" Rubio said. ""If a significant percentage of the American family feels this way, it's an issue. We have to talk about it.""
RELATED: Clinton protested by Black Lives Matter 
Race relations in America have been a flashpoint on the campaign trail this year, brought into sharper focus by the Black Lives Matter movement and the tension over police shootings of unarmed African-Americans.
Rubio was careful to add that he doesn't support anti-police rhetoric.
""I don't think the answer to it, however, is to demonize police officers,"" he said. 
But he said that even if people don't see discrimination themselves, they need to listen to people who do. 
""The reality of it is that there's a significant percentage of Americans, African-Americans, particularly young males, who feel discriminated against,"" Rubio said. ""And if they feel discriminated that way, whether you agree with it or not, if they feel that way, it's a problem. ... I know people that feel that way, who tell me this, and in some instances, I've actually seen it as well.""
The conversation began when a questioner asked Rubio what part of American history he would like to erase, excluding the obvious answer of slavery. He said that even after the Civil War, racial discrimination was ""pronounced.""
He told a story of how his parents once were driving to Miami when their car broke down ""somewhere in the South, they believe it was South Carolina.""
""It was the first chance they ever interacted with segregation,"" Rubio said. ""Because Cuba had cultural segregation ... but it didn't have legal segregation, so for them, that was a shocking experience.""
He said his parents asked an African-American woman about where to catch a movie and she replied she wasn't allowed in. 
""That's a period that I think took too long to resolve, that period from the end of slavery to the civil rights era, that just lingered way too long. It obviously should have never happened, but that's a period I wish we could have as a nation have avoided and dealt with much quicker,"" Rubio said.
Rubio has embraced his own minority status on the trail, speaking of his family's American Dream-like story of arriving in the U.S. after fleeing communism in Cuba.
Earlier on Wednesday, Rubio noted on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that three of the top four Republicans in the race right now are minorities: himself, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.
""(It) speaks a lot to the diversity of the Republican Party and the strength of our party,"" Rubio said.

 (CNN)On Tuesday, Donald Trump, who would like to be our President, retweeted a message about Jeb Bush.  It featured a swastika among its gallery of Bush-bashing images. And with this tweet, Trump has outdone himself in doing whatever he can to stay in the headlines through sensationalist attacks on his rivals. 
He has mocked candidate Bush before on the grounds of patriotism, painting him as somehow less American because he speaks Spanish at home and when addressing Hispanic audiences. This time, perhaps worried about his declining status after his uneven performance in the last GOP candidates' debate, Trump went for the sure shot on social media, and included the most recognizable symbol of Nazism. 
As offensive as this montage is, we can be thankful that he posted it. Images have their own way of telling stories. They are often used in political propaganda to elicit a visceral reaction -- outrage, laughter, identification -- and they reveal things their creators are not able or willing to say with words. 
A grouping of images, intended to spark certain associations, is even more useful in reading how someone thinks about a given person or subject.
So what can we learn from these pictures that can be useful in evaluating him as a potential president? First, the depth of his attachment to a politics of prejudice that disdains and distrusts all those who are not white and of European Christian heritage. 
In the logic of Trumpworld, Jeb Bush is a straw man -- he even wears a sombrero, in one image -- for all Americans who are soft on immigration and thus soft in body and character. Bush is ""Forrest Bush,"" as another image proclaims, a weak and backward man who will leave our country unprotected for ""animals"" to come through (one of the cartoons in the assemblage shows a strange, monkey-like creature featured breaching our borders). 
Hate politics, from Nazism onward, thrive on paranoia. In Trump's hands, Jeb Bush becomes that stock figure of propaganda, the internal enemy who masquerades as a patriot but whose interests are really against the nation. Trump's tabloid-style graphics to associate Bush with foreigners (his Mexican-born wife occupies a central place in the gallery), with ""the Bush criminal family"" and their campaign to reclaim, through Bush, a ruined empire (cue the image of a broken crown).  
And here we come to the swastika, which is on a flag that comes out of the barrel of a gun, flanked by portraits of Jeb Bush and his ""criminal"" family. ""Evil Runs Deep,"" the lurid font proclaims. This image is so exaggerated as to become parody. But the use of the gun, together with the swastika, also contains a reveal about which Americans Trump aims to please with his platform. 
For the swastika is not a dead symbol, but one used -- sometimes together with the Confederate flag -- by American white supremacists. Featuring a swastika and a gun on American social media just months after the Charleston church massacre --  in which Dylann Roof (shown in pictures displaying the Confederate flag) slaughtered nine people in a black church -- sends a message to those who want to hear it: Trump is not only anti-immigrant, but pro-white. 
In fact, one could conclude that Trump's relentless insults of Jeb Bush, and his depiction of Bush as a stereotypical Mexican -- witness the image of Bush playing the guitar, against a landscape of cacti, wearing a sombrero -- are a means of attacking some of his other Republican presidential rivals, who actually are Hispanic, and who are actually political threats to him: the Cuban-Americans Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. 
And that, too, is a classic operation of political propaganda, as perfected by the Nazis: Make one group, or person, stand in for the perceived faults of others. This latest retweet may remind us of Trump's mastery of social media, but his crude gallery of images is proof of his unworthiness of the presidency.

"The Republican presidential candidates were infuriated by last week's CNBC debate. They felt the tone was hostile, the questions were ""gotcha,"" and the whole thing reeked of liberal media bias. As a result, the candidates have joined forces to craft a new debate format, one that will better and more fairly allow them to expound their views to the American people. Here's an advance look at the result:
HANNITY: Hi, I'm Sean Hannity and these are my fellow moderators, Ann Coulter and 
Rush Limbaugh
. Let's get right to it. This first question calls for a show of hands. If you think America is the greatest country in the entire universe, raise your hand. [All hands go up except for Dr. 
Ben Carson
's]
HANNITY: You disagree, Dr. Carson?
CARSON: [Inaudible]
HANNITY: I'm sorry, Doctor. Could you please speak up?
CARSON: I said there's a problem with the question. I would say America is the greatest country in the entire universe and any parallel universes. [All hands go up. Applause.]
COULTER: Mr. Trump, you have said you will build a wall to keep Mexican illegals out of the country and that you will make the Mexican government pay for it. The obvious question is: How high do you think that wall should be?
TRUMP: Good question, Ann. Here's the good news. Mexicans are not very tall. That's why you don't see any in the NBA. That means a six, seven foot wall should do the job.
HUCKABEE: If I can follow up.
COULTER: I'm sorry, Governor, we need to move on. [Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, walks hurriedly on stage and whispers in Coulter's ear.] My deepest apologies, Governor, I didn't mean to interrupt.
HUCKABEE: I was just going to add that this is yet another example of how God has blessed this country. Just think if we shared a border with Africa. Then we'd need a much taller wall and the costs would soar. [Applause]
LIMBAUGH: This question is for Senator Cruz. What's your favorite color?
CRUZ: It's not one color, Rush. It's three. Red, white and blue. [Thunderous applause]
LIMBAUGH: What about you, Governor Bush?
BUSH: Gosh, brown maybe.
COULTER: Senator Rubio, you've been described as young, handsome, virile, a powerful and attractive politician with great appeal to women voters.
RUBIO: What's the question?
COULTER: No question.
HANNITY: Senator Paul, I'd like to try a word association exercise with you.
PAUL: First I want to address something very important that was discussed earlier. Cyan.
HANNITY: Pardon?
PAUL: That's my favorite color.
HANNITY: Let me try this with you, Mrs. Fiorina. When I say ""Obamacare,"" what's the first word that comes to mind?
FIORINA: A failed socialist experiment that was forced down the throats of the American people, which has resulted in thousands of lost jobs, skyrocketing insurance premiums, extreme tornadic activity in the Southwest and a tenfold rise in skin eruptions. [Applause]
COULTER: Governor Kasich, when Hillary Clinton goes to prison for her Benghazi crimes, you just know there's going to be a hue and cry from the liberal media to pardon her. Will you?
KASICH: In Ohio, we've lowered—
COULTER: What about you, Governor Christie?
CHRISTIE: Hell no, I wouldn't pardon her. I'd make sure she served every day of her sentence.
CRUZ: If I could jump in here. I agree with the governor, but I would go further. I would use all the powers of the presidency to make certain she served her entire sentence in solitary confinement.
CHRISTIE: I thought that was a given.
FIORINA: I'd also deny her visitors and reduce her food intake to water and dog kibble every other day.
HANNITY: That's all the time we have. I want to thank all the candidates for participating in tonight's debate.
BUSH: You know what? I think I may prefer beige.

Conservatives across the country issued a stinging rebuke to President Obama and the Democratic Party Tuesday night. In Kentucky, Republicans notched huge wins for governor and other statewide offices. In a race most believed leaned slightly to the Democrats, Tea Party favorite Matt Bevin pulled off the surprise easy victory despite several missteps. His win gives the Bluegrass State only its second Republican governor in the past 40 years. But the blowback didn't stop there. In Houston, voters repealed a law to protect gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination with the slogan — ""No men in women's bathrooms."" In Ohio, they rejected a referendum to legalize marijuana in the state. And in Virginia, despite millions in ads pushing gun-control measures, Democrats still failed to take back the state Senate. The results cap off yet another disappointing election cycle for Democrats ever since President Obama entered the White House. While they've managed to construct a strong coalition in presidential years, it's conservatives who have been more motivated to turn out to the polls during both midterm and off-year elections. Since 2010, Democrats have lost control of both the House and Senate. A dozen governorships have turned from blue to red, along with many state legislative chambers. Democrats have especially suffered Obama drag in the South. Even moderate, Blue Dog Democrats couldn't survive: the last white Southern Democrat in the House lost last year, and Republicans flipped four Senate seats in the region last year. The troubling sign for Democrats is that Tuesday's rebuke didn't simply come from the South — it was against liberal policies in more Democratic-friendly areas like Ohio and Houston. Here's a rundown of what happened on Election Night. Kentucky The victory of Bevin — a man despised just a year ago by the GOP establishment in the state after he tried to unseat Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the primary — shows Democrats' grip on their last remaining stronghold in the South has disappeared. Democrats had still managed to cling to the Bluegrass State, and polls even showed that Attorney General Jack Conway had the edge going into Election Day. He had hoped to ride the coattails of popular term-limited Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear and the state's successful Obamacare exchange ""Kynect"" to victory.

But the anti-Obama tide proved be too much. The Republican Governors Association spent $2.5 million in the final weeks, mostly on ads and mailers tying Conway to Obama. Though local Democrats hoped voters would be able to differentiate state races from national ones, in Kentucky Tuesday they did not. The victory came despite poor reviews for Bevin on the trail and Democrats' arguments that he was too far right for the state. Democrats tried to spin the venture capitalist's win, somewhat bizarrely arguing that Conway ""ran into the unexpected headwinds of Trump-mania, losing to an outsider candidate in the Year of the Outsider."" The loss had other reverberations, too — state Auditor Adam Edelen, who was seen as a possible challenger to Sen. Rand Paul next year — lost his reelection bid. Bevin's win also puts the future of Kynect, the state's successful health care exchange, up in the air. As NBC's Perry Bacon noted, Bevin has said he would get rid of the exchange program, which could leave thousands without insurance coverage, but he's softened his stance on allowing Medicare expansion in the state. Houston Social conservatives were successful in repealing an anti-LGBT discrimination bill with a simple slogan: ""No Men In Women's Bathrooms."" The bill extended to far more than which bathroom transgender persons could use, also protecting them from employment discrimination and housing bias, among other civil rights protections and is similar to many other measures across the country. The bill's rejection is a blow to Mayor Annise Parker, who became the first openly gay mayor of a major city when she won in 2009. Parker rallied celebrities and corporations to her side, like Apple and actress Sally Field. But opponents, who branded it the ""bathroom bill"" framed their argument as one of child safety, said it would enable sexual predators. With the backing of the faith community, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and even a former Houston Astros star, the groups opposing it ran an effective campaign with persuasive ads like this one:

The law's repeal could have other reverberations — the Super Bowl is scheduled to be in Houston in 2017. ""I don't think it's the straw that creates the imbalance where you don't get a Super Bowl or lose a Super Bowl, but it's definitely part of the equation when people make decisions,"" Ric Campo, who is chairing the city's Super Bowl host committee, told the New York Times. To that, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is against the law, said, per the Times, ""If Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner, 'would even suggest that the Super Bowl not be played here because we don't want men in ladies' bathrooms, then we need a new commissioner.'""

A statewide referendum to legalize recreational and medical marijuana overwhelmingly failed in Ohio. Advocates had launched a $20 million campaign in favor of its passage, including the creation of ""Buddie"" the marijuana mascot. The subsequent marijuana farms the measure would have produced would have been big windfalls for its backers, including former 98 Degrees frontman Nick Lachey. Opponents, however, successfully framed it as a danger to families and children. ""At a time when too many families are being torn apart by drug abuse, Ohioans said no to easy access to drugs and instead chose a path that helps strengthen our families and communities,"" Republican Gov. John Kasich, a presidential candidate, said in a statement. Virginia Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe's push to turn the state Senate blue was dashed Tuesday, despite crisscrossing the commonwealth for nearly the past month and a heavy push from outside groups over gun control. Instead, Republicans' slim one-vote advantage held in the upper chamber. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's gun-control group put $2.3 million into the state, running ads hitting two Republican candidates over the issue just weeks after two reporters had been gunned down on live TV at a Roanoke, Va., station. The National Rifle Association and other groups pushed back with their own ads. It's a blow to the progressive agenda McAuliffe, who was elected in 2013, wants to push through on education, Medicaid expansion and more. But it would have also helped his push to deliver the critical swing state for his longtime friend and close ally Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race, if she emerges as the nominee.

Presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina will be sharing her views with Joy Behar, Raven Symone and the other co-hosts of ABC’s mid-morning talk show, “The View,” but the network allegedly tried to reschedule her Friday appearance just days before it is set to take place.
Despite a highly publicized back-and-forth between the ladies of “The View” and Fiorina during the past several days, according to Fiorina’s deputy campaign manager Sarah Isgur Flores, ABC wanted to push off Fiorina’s sit-down until the day after the next Republican debate.
Flores said during “The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson” on Wednesday that after some confusion, Friday’s appearance is set.
“As far as I know, we are still confirmed for Friday,” she said. “I hope that they'll continue to have us on. We are certainly looking forward to hearing what they have to say to Carly’s face, and hopefully they will want to talk about the issues instead of doubling down on these catty remarks.”
A rep for “The View” told FOX411 on Wednesday morning that Fiorina would appear on Friday as planned. A promo for the Fiorina appearance ran during Wednesday’s episode of “The View.”
During that episode, while speaking about Jeb Bush, host Whoopi Goldberg discussed why she feels politicians should come on “The View.”

“If you can’t handle us, you… can’t be president,” Goldberg said. “There’s all kind of folks, and we don’t necessarily agree with all your politics… so come on. We’re interested. We want to let our folks know what’s going on.”  On Oct. 29, Behar and Michelle Collins ridiculed Fiorina’s last debate appearance. The hosts branded her smile “demented” and suggested there should be a “smiling Fiorina” Halloween mask on shelves.
The presidential candidate responded to the comments on “Fox News Sunday.” She said she is “tired of being insulted by liberal feminists.”
“It will not stop me. It will not scare me,” Fiorina declared. “... Let’s see if they have the guts to say that to my face.”
During Monday’s episode of the show, Goldberg responded to Fiorina’s criticism of the show.
“Just so we’re all clear, you have to know the difference between when somebody’s coming for you, when somebody is paying you a compliment and when somebody is saying, ‘here’s my observation,’” she said. “If you can get that together, maybe you can be president.”",,,'View' tried to postpone Carly,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2015/11/04/view-tried-to-postpone-carly-fiorina-appearance/,[u'personality'],"[u'Jeb Bush', u'Gretchen Carlson', u'Sarah Isgur Flores', u'Michelle Collins', u'Carly Fiorina', u'Whoopi Goldberg', u'Joy Behar']",fox,0.49648703051649634,[],2015-11-04 19:58:08,[],642bb85b700d3f3ec68d90c74f07d547,2015-11-04 20:22:49.252499
"(New throughout, adds comments from Sanders)
By Amanda Becker
WASHINGTON Nov 4 (Reuters) - Democratic presidential
contender Bernie Sanders on Wednesday unveiled a climate-change
bill that would crack down on fossil fuel extraction, a move
sure to please activists who want party front-runner Hillary
Clinton to make the same commitment.
Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, wants to halt new
leases for fossil fuel extraction on public lands and for
offshore drilling in the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico. He would
prohibit drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic Ocean.
Sanders pushed for the proposal at a rally at the U.S.
Capitol on Wednesday, alongside environmental leaders such as
Bill McKibben, co-founder of the grassroots climate group
350.org.
The bill, which Sanders introduced with a fellow Democrat,
U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, will face fierce opposition
in the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and is unlikely to
become law.
But it should help Sanders appeal to environmental activists
and could pressure Clinton, who has said that abruptly halting
extraction on federal lands would disrupt the U.S. economy.
""You can't talk the talk...and at the same time say we are
going to extract,"" Sanders said on Wednesday, adding that the
U.S. must protect workers as it moves away from fossil fuels.
Sanders, who calls himself a democratic socialist, has been
Clinton's main rival to be the party's nominee for president in
the November 2016 elections.
His liberal stances on the environment, trade and more have
pressured Clinton to move to the left on those issues. Still,
polls have shown the former U.S. secretary of state appeared to
gain ground against Sanders after a strong showing in October.
Climate activists want Clinton to commit to be tougher on
environmental issues if she is elected president.
Clinton told an activist at a New Hampshire town hall in
July that it would be irresponsible to abruptly halt oil,
natural gas and coal extraction on federal lands. She instead
called for phasing it out and increasing fees on companies
operating on public lands.
""We still have to run our economy, we still have to turn on
the lights,"" Clinton said.
Clinton in August opposed Arctic oil exploration, putting
her at odds with the Obama administration, which had just given
Royal Dutch Shell PLC final approval to resume drilling
off the coast of northern Alaska.

" (AP) â State and local elections across the country this week produced warning signs for both Democrats and Republicans as they press toward the 2016 presidential contest, now just a year away.
Democrats lost more ground in legislatures and governor's mansions, raising questions about the party's strength when President Barack Obama's name isn't at the top of the ballot. Democrats still have important demographic advantages in the states that often determine presidential elections, but the party is struggling in power centers outside Washington that influence policy and steer congressional redistricting.
The GOP is casting its victory in the Kentucky gubernatorial race as a blueprint for how Republicans can run successfully against Obama's signature health care law.
But the elections weren't all good news for the Republicans. For party leaders anxious about Donald Trump and Ben Carson's lead in the GOP presidential primary, the win in Kentucky for Matt Bevin â a wealthy businessman who has never held political office â could be a sign that many voters are serious about electing outsider candidates.
Party leaders are skeptical that outsiders' rebellious appeal will be sufficiently deep and lasting to send such a candidate to the White House.
""We're at this interesting moment where clearly there's a lot of frustration in the electorate, which means voters are going to be more volatile,"" said David Winston, a Republican pollster.
To be sure, off-year elections are imperfect predictors of presidential contests. Turnout is far lower and the voters who do show up tend to be older and less diverse, favoring Republicans.
Still, Tuesday's contests across the country are being scoured for signs of the electorate's mood less than three months before the lead-off Iowa caucuses.
For Democrats, results in Kentucky, Virginia and elsewhere were part of a troubling pattern. Since Obama was elected in 2008, the party has lost 12 governorships and more than 900 state legislative seats, ceding control of 30 legislative chambers. On Capitol Hill, Democrats have given up control of both the House and Senate.
The fresh losses raise serious questions for Democrats about how the party will fare next year when Obama isn't on the ticket. It's also raising questions about where Democrats will draw their next generation of leaders.
Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, is making specific campaign appeals to the Hispanics, blacks and young voters who helped propel Obama to victory. And she's promising she'll work to help candidates down the ballot win their races, too.
The Democratic defeats have implications for policies as well as politics. While most Democratic governors have expanded their states' Medicaid coverage under the federal Affordable Care Act, several Republicans have resisted, including in Florida and Texas. Democratic Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe tried to expand Medicaid but was blocked by Republicans.
Democrats' efforts to fully implement ""Obamacare"" got even harder Tuesday. McAuliffe failed in his campaign to put Virginia's legislature back in Democratic hands. And in Kentucky, Bevin won in part on a pledge to repeal the state's Medicaid expansion, propelling a Republican into the state's governor's mansion for just the second time in four decades.
Bevin cast himself as a political outsider, one who was self-funded and shunned by Kentucky's political establishment after he challenged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the 2014 GOP Senate primary. It's an approach that fits with the outsider appeal of Trump and Carson, who are roiling the GOP presidential primary and worrying establishment Republicans who fear neither of them could defeat Clinton in a general election.
Asked Wednesday whether Bevin's win bodes well for his own political future, Trump sounded confident. He said, ""There is something happening, folks, I will tell you. There is something happening.""
In an interview with The Associated Press, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who is struggling in the GOP presidential polls, aligned himself with Bevin's success as a political outsider.
""That's the same thing I ran on when I ran in 2010,"" Paul said of his Senate victory five years ago.
Bevin wasn't the only outsider who won this week. In Mississippi, Republican poultry and cattle farmer Vince Mangold made his political debut by ousting Democratic House Minority Leader Bobby Moak, who had been in office for 30 years.
Republicans targeted Moak with mailers displaying his photo next to Obama's under the headline, ""Bobby Moak and Barack Obama ... A Liberal Love Affair."" Mangold said he campaigned on lower taxes and a good education system, but he attributed his victory not to any particular policy stances but to his outsider status.
""As I traveled around the district, the overwhelming reply was they were ready for a change,"" Mangold said Wednesday.

"We don’t know yet whether Republican Matt Bevin, who was elected governor of Kentucky on Tuesday, will try to abolish the Medicaid expansion put in place by outgoing Gov. Steve Beshear (D.), attempt to cap enrollment, or do nothing at all. But his election sets up new discussion of Republican attitudes toward Medicaid expansion.
Thirty states have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act since the Supreme Court made it a state option in 2012. Ten of them have Republican governors, two of whom are presidential candidates, John Kasich and Chris Christie. If, however, you follow campaign commentary on cable TV you would think expanding Medicaid is a political black mark in the eyes of all Republicans. To be sure, the most activated elements of the GOP base–conservative campaign contributors, super PACs, and conservative legislators–oppose Medicaid expansion, primarily because they see it more as embracing Obamacare than providing federal funding to states to help them expand coverage for low-income residents. But the limited polling the Kaiser Family Foundation has done on the issue has found that most Republicans do not oppose Medicaid expansion. In fact, they favor it.
In a December 2014 poll, 52% of Republicans said they had a favorable view of Medicaid expansion, 44% had an unfavorable view, and 3% did not voice an opinion. In the same poll, as the chart above shows, 56% of Republicans in states that had not expanded Medicaid had a very favorable (23%) or somewhat favorable (33%) view of expansion. This survey was conducted too far in advance of the 2016 primary elections to poll likely Republican voters. Views were also different in two strongly anti-expansion states in polling Kaiser did with the New York Times in 2014. A majority of Republicans in Louisiana (66%) and North Carolina (53%) preferred that their state keep Medicaid as is.
We don’t know from the polling why most Republicans say they support expansion. Gov. Kasich has argued that expansion is a moral imperative and that he sees it as broadening Ohio’s Medicaid program rather than embracing Obamacare, which he opposes. We do know that 47% of Republicans in a May 2015 poll said Medicaid was a very important program; only 14% said it is not an important program. But that is far fewer than the 69% who said Medicare was a very important program. As might not be surprising, given their generally higher income levels, fewer Republicans (35%) than Democrats (61%) say Medicaid is important to them or their family.
That even a slim majority of Republicans favor expansion is notable given the tone of debate on this issue on the campaign trail, where expansion has become like a third rail for GOP candidates. This is not to suggest that Republican candidates or governors who oppose Medicaid expansion in conservative states will be anxious to flip any time soon. But Medicaid may not be as unpopular with Republicans overall as the conventional wisdom suggests, and other issues may be more salient for Republican voters in primary and general elections across the country than opposition to Medicaid expansion.

"NEW YORK (AP) â Pressure continued to mount on NBC to cancel Donald Trump's guest-host appearance on this weekend's ""Saturday Night Live"" as a coalition of advocacy groups delivered petitions to the network Wednesday calling for him to be dropped from the show.
The petitions delivered to 30 Rockefeller Plaza, home of NBC and ""Saturday Night Live,"" marked the latest attempts to dissuade the network from allowing the Republican presidential hopeful to host the show, with the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda earlier asking that NBC reconsider the decision.
""There's mounting evidence that Donald Trump's racist demagoguery is resulting in real-world violence and physical and verbal intimidation,"" Mushed Zaheed, deputy political director of Credo Action, one of the participating groups, said in a statement.
In advance of the show, NBC released promotional spots featuring Trump that included one in which he refers to a Republican opponent, Ben Carson, as ""a complete and total loser.""
Trump drew fire early in his campaign when, as the billionaire developer announced his candidacy, he described some Mexicans who are in the United States illegally as criminals and rapists, prompting NBC to sever its Miss Universe ties with Trump while declaring he would never again appear on ""The Celebrity Apprentice.""
""It is shameful for 'SNL' and NBC to think that racism can be repackaged as comedy,"" said Juan Escalante, digital campaigns manager for America's Voice, another group participating in the coalition.
Other participating groups included the National Hispanic Media Coalition, MoveOn.org and National Council of La Raza. About two-dozen protesters were on hand as the petitions were delivered to NBC's midtown Manhattan offices. Some chanted ""dump Trump"" and carried signs bearing the same phrase.
The coalition is accusing NBC of reversing itself for the sake of a ratings windfall while granting Trump ""a free national platform to bolster his racist and xenophobic campaign,"" Zaheed said.
Alex Nogales, president of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, said after delivering the petitions that the protest effort was not over. His group and others would use the days leading up to the broadcast to call on ""SNL"" sponsors to remove their commercials from Saturday's show, he said.
NBC declined comment on the petitions and did not immediately comment on the attempt to get ads pulled.
Meanwhile, Trump drew sharp criticism in an online letter with the names of dozens of prominent writers, filmmakers, academics and others from the United States, Spain and Latin America attached to it, including Oscar-winning writer-director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu  (""Birdman: Or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"").
""We refuse to keep silent in the face of the alarming declarations of the candidate for the presidency of the United States Donald Trump,"" the letter posted Tuesday reads. ""His hate speech appeals to the lowest passions like xenophobia, machismo, political intolerance and religious dogmatism.""
The letter calls on the American people to ""cease to tolerate his absurd positions.""
Trump has played a major role in delivering record-breaking ratings to the first three Republican debates and has been a sought-after guest on talk shows and newscasts.
Asked about the opposition to his upcoming appearance while promoting his new book in New York on Tuesday, Trump said he was pleased to hear demonstrations were already underway.
""Look, I think they should demonstrate"" he said. ""Ratings will go even higher than they are going to be. It's going to be one of their highest-rated shows ever and they're very excited about it.""
Asked specifically about the petition, he said: ""It's only going to make it hotter.""
Trump also repeated his frequent assertion that he has great relationship with Hispanics, with tens of thousands working for him over the years, he said.
Saturday's appearance will be an ""SNL"" encore for Trump, who first hosted the show in April 2004, long before his entry into politics, as the breakout star of NBC's new competition show ""The Apprentice.""
He appeared on CNN's ""New Day"" on Wednesday, where anchor Chris Cuomo voiced surprise that NBC booked him.
""I thought you were at war with them,"" said Cuomo, ""then all of a sudden they wanted to have you on. You say it's because of ratings.""
""You're never at war when you get great ratings with a network, OK?"" Trump replied. ""Nobody gets ratings like me.""
He went on to say that initially he was asked to do a single sketch on Saturday's show. Then ""SNL"" executive producer Lorne Michaels had second thoughts and asked Trump if he would host the entire 90-minute program. ""And I said, 'You know what? I would.' Because it's an honor.""
""Every single major politician in this country probably for 30 years has done 'Saturday Night Live' if they're invited,"" Trump added. ""If they're invited.""

" (CNN)One year out from the 2016 general election, voters in off-year races across the country on Tuesday offered some signs of things to come — and presented the presidential candidates with tea leaves to read as they sharpen their campaign strategies.
By evening's end, Republicans were the ones crowing, as they scored a surprise win in a hotly contested governor's race in Kentucky while keeping control of the state Senate in Virginia, despite a big spending onslaught from former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's gun-control group. 
""Tonight was another key test for Dems, Clinton, and their party's field [organization] and once again they failed to deliver,"" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tweeted shortly before midnight.
By contrast, Democrats were a little on the quiet side. A stinging defeat in Houston, where voters rolled back an ordinance that had expanded nondiscrimination protections to LGBT people, illustrated the risks attached to ballot initiative tactics that the party has increasingly used as a means of advancing its policy goals when blocked by the GOP.
Here are takeaways from Tuesday's results and what they mean for 2016: 

The tea party scored a significant win in Kentucky, where one of its own, Matt Bevin, overcame a late deficit and a series of missteps on the stump to defeat Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway by a handy margin, 53% to 44%. Bevin, who has promised to dismantle the state's successful Obamacare exchange, will now have that opportunity.
A disaster for President Barack Obama's signature initiative? Not quite. Supporters of the Affordable Care Act believe that Republicans could face a backlash if Bevin goes ahead with his pledge.
""He's the dog who caught the car,"" on Democratic strategist told CNN, ""and I think he's going to have a real problem using up all of his political capital taking health care away from 400,000 of his constituents.""
In fact, toward the end of the campaign, Bevin had already begun to soften his rhetoric against the state's Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. 
But Republican consultant Liz Mair sees the wealthy businessman's win as the latest sign that any attachment to the controversial program -- which the Democrat candidate had planned to preserve -- is still poison at the polls. 
""Last night seems to continue to evidence that Obamacare is a big liability and is a problem for people who are running on it,"" she said, ""and people who are associated with it by virtue of their partisan identity.""

The commonwealth has been caught between a Democratic governor, Clinton pal Terry McAuliffe, and a heavily Republican state House of Representatives. But its state Senate entered Tuesday very much up for grabs. 
In the end though, the GOP retained its advantage -- and its ability to handcuff the Democratic administration from pursuing its legislative agenda.
That includes a push for stricter gun-control laws, which have become a staple of Hillary Clinton's pitch to more liberal Democratic primary voters.
Bloomberg's ""Everytown for Gun Safety"" group, which sunk millions into the Virginia contests to wrest control of the state Senate, took heart from one high-profile victory. In the state's 29th district, voters tapped a Democrat, Jeremy McPike, who was backed by $1.5 million in advertisements from Everytown, including one featuring Andy Parker, the father of slain local news reporter Ashley Parker.
""Gun safety prevailed on the NRA's home turf because we made sure that every voter knew where the candidates stood on gun safety,"" Everytown president John Feinblatt said in a statement.
The win, he added, is ""just the latest example of how candidates are paying the price for being out of step with Americans who demand that their leaders take action to prevent gun violence.""

If Republicans won the most notable contest of the off-year 2015 Election Day in Kentucky, Democrats scored a number of number of lower-profile but potentially significant victories through ballot initiatives.
Democrats and supporters of campaign finance reform won hard fought and expensive battles in Seattle and Maine, where voters boosted initiatives to amp up public financing of elections.
""We as a movement have not had a great example to point to when people ask what kind of reform are you talking about, what is the actual path forward,"" said Szelena Gray, a co-founder of Run for America, which seeks to draft fresh faces into politics. ""We often have to speak in vague terms because there aren't a lot of solutions to point to and say this is working really well, let's grow this."" 
But with Tuesday's vote, she said, the sale became a whole lot easier for more liberal candidates like Clinton and Bernie Sanders. 
""With the actual first passage of the ballot for 'democracy vouchers' in Seattle, you've taken something that up until now is just a concept, a theory and turned into something we can point to very concretely and say, 'Here is what the systems looks like, here is how it's working',"" Gray said. ""We now have the ability.""

Even as Republicans dole out the virtual backslaps to Bevin in Kentucky and point to the results in Virginia as proof gun control advocacy is a dead end for Clinton, Election Day 2015 may not provide much of a crystal ball at what's to come over the next 12 months.
Case in point: The winner of Kentucky's attorney general race? Andy Beshear, a Democrat and son of the outgoing governor, a major champion of Obamacare.

"When Ted Cruz announced his run for the presidency, the big question was whether he had only a small chance to win or no chance at all. Since then, a lot has gone right for him.

Mr. Cruz still does not enjoy an easy road to the Republican nomination, not by any means. But it is a testament to just how strange this year has been that a candidate like him, who is despised by many of his own Republican colleagues in the Senate, now has a plausible path to the Republican nomination.

Some of his opportunity is the result of his own strength. He has succeeded in building a robust campaign organization, buoyed by fund-raising tallies of the sort we generally haven’t seen from anti-establishment, conservative candidates. Fund-raising isn’t everything, but it’s a big part of why candidates like Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum have not been serious contenders this time.

A lot of Mr. Cruz’s opening, however, reflects the weakness of his rivals, not his strength. Few would have guessed, for instance, that his solid but hardly astonishing $26 million in official campaign contributions (not counting outside groups) would be more than Jeb Bush’s total. By comparison, George W. Bush raised more than both candidates combined by this point 16 years ago (when a dollar was worth more). Back in the summer, I certainly would not have guessed that the combined support for Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker — Mr. Walker is now out of the race — would add up to just 16 percent in national polls, with three months to go before Iowa.

The candidates who are faring well in the polls — Ben Carson and Donald Trump — are also good news for Mr. Cruz. In just about any other year, Mr. Cruz would be the worst-case scenario for the party’s establishment. But compared with the likes of Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson, he seems reasonable and conventional. That might let him become a candidate the party could grudgingly accept. His debate performances, especially the one last week, have only helped in this regard.

Mr. Cruz hasn’t been faring particularly well in the polls, but there is a path forward. Even when he seemed to have little or no chance nationally, it was still clear that he could do well in Iowa, a state where nearly half of the Republican electorate is “very conservative,” according to the exit polls. He doesn’t lead there now, but the caucus is still three months off, and he has a large and untapped war chest. Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson might fade, which could help if a disproportionate share of their anti-establishment support goes his way.

If Mr. Cruz finishes well in Iowa, it won’t be hard to envision a serious run for the nomination. He could follow up a win in Iowa with strength in South Carolina and particularly Nevada, another caucus state where half of the G.O.P. electorate is “very conservative.” Soon after come the predominantly Southern states on Super Tuesday, where very conservative voters represent a larger share of the primary electorate than any other region of the country.

If Mr. Cruz is the only elected official who amasses many delegates by that point — which seems plausible — he will be in a good position to outmuscle relatively weak establishment candidates, particularly if those candidates prove to have fairly narrow appeal themselves, like Jeb Bush, Chris Christie or John Kasich.

For instance, if Mr. Cruz had run in 2012 and run with this strength, he might have had a real shot at defeating Mitt Romney, who struggled against underfunded opposition because of protracted resistance from the religious right. Of course, Mr. Cruz would ultimately need to broaden his appeal beyond his base of “very conservative” voters in the face of considerable resistance from party elites, hardly a sure thing, especially if Mr. Rubio continues to consolidate their support.

But in recent weeks, it has almost become a cliché to suggest that Mr. Cruz is going to win the “grass-roots” half of the G.O.P. primary once Ben Carson and Donald Trump fade, and that Mr. Cruz will then have a real shot to win.

This theory assumes, though, that Mr. Cruz could become the sole candidate of the right. Mr. Carson and Mr. Trump aren’t at all assured to fade. Even if they did, there isn’t much reason to think Mr. Cruz would gain the preponderance of their support.

The conservative wing of the G.O.P. is deceptively diverse, and the appeal of Mr. Carson and Mr. Trump comes from a lot more than their adherence to conservative doctrine. Their appeal is in part about identity politics, and they often draw from wings of the conservative base — populist, anti-immigrant, the religious right — that aren’t always unbending or ideological on other issues.

Mr. Cruz is different. He draws from voters motivated by ideology more than identity. Mr. Carson and Mr. Trump, for instance, tend to win at least 20 percent of self-identified moderate voters, but Mr. Cruz had the support of just 1 percent of moderate voters in a recent Iowa poll.

The diverse support of the various outsider candidates makes it tough to assume that supporters of Mr. Trump or Mr. Carson would shift to Mr. Cruz en masse. There’s little evidence that he’s their second choice. As two Yale professors wrote last week, there is even data that a sizable share of people favoring Mr. Trump or Mr. Carson have Mr. Bush or Mr. Rubio as their second choice.

The diversity of the G.O.P. base also helps explain how anti-establishment candidates like Mr. Carson, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump have all coexisted in drawing their support, how Mr. Carson has surged to the top of the polls without detracting much from Mr. Trump’s share of the vote, or how both have risen without any decline in Mr. Cruz’s support. And it makes it easier to imagine how the three could survive into Super Tuesday and beyond, sustained by unusually strong name recognition, considerable resources and distinct bases of support.",NATE COHN,"A victory in Iowa, which is plausible, could help him emerge as the sole leader of a conservative wing that is flexing its muscles this cycle.",Road to 2016: Ted Cruz Has a Chance to Win.

"NEW YORK The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation's flagship health project changed its mind again on Wednesday on the matter of its erroneous tax returns, saying it would refile them with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service after all.
The Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) said the decision to refile its 2012 and 2013 returns was in response to ""recent media interest."" 
Its brief statement made no mention of Republican criticism earlier in the week, when CHAI said it had decided against refiling the returns, known as form 990s. That, in turn, was a switch from the spring, when it said it would refile them after Reuters discovered it had misreported funding sources by millions of dollars.
""As previously stated, the minor errors on the 2012 and 2013 CHAI 990s are immaterial and do not require refiling, yet in response to recent media interest in the forms, CHAI has decided to refile the returns in order to be fully transparent,"" CHAI spokeswoman Maura Daley said in the statement.
With Hillary Clinton viewed as the favorite to become the Democratic nominee in the November, 2016, presidential election, Republicans have attacked her family's globe-straddling charities. 
The charities have received millions of dollars of funding from foreign governments for their work on health and environmental projects. Republicans and other critics say this is an insoluble conflict of interest for a would-be U.S. president. CHAI is best known for helping reduce the cost of HIV drugs in the developing world.
Clinton has said her family's charities do worthy work and disclose more information about the donors than the law requires, mitigating that concern. 
But she has not addressed the charities' admission to Reuters earlier this year that they did not comply with an ethics agreement Clinton signed with Barack Obama's incoming presidential administration in 2008 in order for her to become secretary of state. That agreement required the names of every donor be published annually, with the State Department ethicists screening new funding from foreign governments. The charities did not do this or did so incompletely, citing ""oversights"".
On Tuesday, Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee's chairman, sent a letter calling on the IRS to audit CHAI and to compel the charity to amend the errors. On Wednesday, he responded to CHAI's decision to refile by saying an audit remained the only way to ensure all foreign government funding had been accounted for.
""CHAI has failed to comply with federal tax rules or the ethics agreement the Clintons negotiated with the Obama Administration,"" he said in a statement, ""and re-filing erroneous returns seven months after the fact amid political pressure is hardly a show of good faith.""
The IRS is barred by law from discussing specific cases. Spokesmen for Hillary Clinton did not respond to questions about the charities.
CHAI says the total amount of donations was correctly reported to the IRS in 2012 and 2013, but that the breakdown for how much came from government sources compared to non-government donors was incorrect. 
Charities do not pay taxes on their donations, but must complete tax returns and make them public to demonstrate compliance with assurances made to get tax-exempt status.

"WASHINGTON Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders on Wednesday unveiled a climate-change bill that would crack down on fossil fuel extraction, a move sure to please activists who want party front-runner Hillary Clinton to make the same commitment.
Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, wants to halt new leases for fossil fuel extraction on public lands and for offshore drilling in the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico. He would prohibit drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic Ocean.
Sanders pushed for the proposal at a rally at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, alongside environmental leaders such as Bill McKibben, co-founder of the grassroots climate group 350.org.
The bill, which Sanders introduced with a fellow Democrat, U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, will face fierce opposition in the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and is unlikely to become law. 
But it should help Sanders appeal to environmental activists and could pressure Clinton, who has said that abruptly halting extraction on federal lands would disrupt the U.S. economy.
""You can't talk the talk...and at the same time say we are going to extract,"" Sanders said on Wednesday, adding that the U.S. must protect workers as it moves away from fossil fuels.
Sanders, who calls himself a democratic socialist, has been Clinton's main rival to be the party's nominee for president in the November 2016 elections. 
His liberal stances on the environment, trade and more have pressured Clinton to move to the left on those issues. Still, polls have shown the former U.S. secretary of state appeared to gain ground against Sanders after a strong showing in October.
Climate activists want Clinton to commit to be tougher on environmental issues if she is elected president. 
Clinton told an activist at a New Hampshire town hall in July that it would be irresponsible to abruptly halt oil, natural gas and coal extraction on federal lands. She instead called for phasing it out and increasing fees on companies operating on public lands.
""We still have to run our economy, we still have to turn on the lights,"" Clinton said.
Clinton in August opposed Arctic oil exploration, putting her at odds with the Obama administration, which had just given Royal Dutch Shell PLC final approval to resume drilling off the coast of northern Alaska.

"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump has officially filed for New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary -- and he took more shots at Marco Rubio's personal finances while he was at it. 
Trump, a Republican front-runner, and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, a Democratic long-shot, were the first two candidates to file for a primary expected to be slated for February 9, submitting their paperwork Wednesday. 
The real estate mogul used his appearance at the New Hampshire statehouse to bash one of his chief rivals: Rubio, the Florida senator who has surged in the polls on the heels of strong debate performances and is due to file in the state on Thursday. 
RELATED: Marco Rubio dismisses questions about his finances
Trump pointed to Rubio's use of a Florida GOP credit card during his tenure as the state's House speaker, as well as Rubio's personal finances, which were also the subject of a New York Times article in June.
""Marco Rubio has a disaster on his finances -- he has a disaster on his credit cards,"" Trump said. 
""When you check his credit cards, take a look at what he has done with the Republican Party when he had access, what he had to put back in, and whether or not something should have happened,"" he said. ""You'll understand it. Marco Rubio has a basic disaster on finance."" 
RELATED: Live from New York, it's Donald Trump!
Rubio defended his credit card use Wednesday on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" saying it was a charge card -- with its balance paid off each month -- and that he paid for his own expenses.
And later on Fox News, Rubio pointed out that his use of the card was also the subject of attacks in his 2010 Senate race against Charlie Crist. 
""I was secured under my personal credit and it was in conjunction with the Republican Party, and every month, I would go through the bills and if there was something on there, I'd pay it to American Express, and if it was the party's, the party paid for it,"" Rubio said. ""And the media convoluted all of this and it creates these stories.""
Trump's trip to Concord was a symbolic nod to the state's importance in the presidential nominating process. 
RELATED: With New Hampshire filing opening Wednesday, Bill Gardner is ready
Anyone can run in the state's primary -- as long as they have $1,000 plus the necessary paperwork. New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner, in office since 1976, has tentatively set February 9 as the state's election date but is waiting to be sure no other states will move their primaries earlier to challenge the Granite State's prominence.

"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump and Ben Carson continue to dominate the GOP presidential field, according to a new national poll. 
About half of those surveyed supported either Trump or Carson, with Trump earning 26% support and the prominent neurosurgeon 23%, according to a Fox News survey released Wednesday. 
Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz each earned 11% support, followed by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul each with 4% support. Former tech CEO Carly Fiorina garnered 3% and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie just 2%.
The last batch of public polling has shown similar groupings, with Carson and Trump dominating the rest of the Republican field. The Fox poll is also the second straight survey that Bush, a former front-runner, with only 4% support.
The entire Fox survey was fielded November 1-3, after the last CNBC debate, where Rubio and Cruz impressed. The poll surveyed 476 registered Republican voters has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.

" (AP) â Republican Jeb Bush's campaign revival tour is getting louder and more colorful as he charges across early voting states with a can-do slogan, a tour bus and critiques of rivals who have become threats to his claim as the GOP mainstream favorite.
""We're Americans, dammit!"" he shouted Wednesday at a pharmacy in Hollis, N.H., as he complained that the U.S. was not leading in key foreign policy disputes.
He saved special words for Donald Trump, the former reality show star who remains a leader in the unpredictable GOP nomination fight.
""A president can't say 'You're fired,' and go to commercial break,"" Bush told more than 100 people at a senior center in Raymond, New Hampshire, Tuesday night. ""A president has to roll up their damn sleeves and get to work.""
A night earlier, his voice showed signs of strain as he railed against what he called anemic economic growth.
""That means more people stuck in poverty. That means one in five children on food stamps,"" Bush said, raising his voice during an event Tuesday in Rye, N.H. ""That's the new normal. I hope you agree with this: we need to reject that out of hand. And we can do it.""
The volume and feeling reflect the urgency of Bush's drive to push his campaign into a winning position ahead of the first votes of the GOP nomination fight in Feb. Once seen as the probable favorite, Bush's viability has never really thrived in the face of unexpectedly strong support from outsiders Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who are leading the pack. Also a thorn for Bush: Marco Rubio, his onetime protege, who has approached the dynamics as an opportunity to win over the GOP establishment turned off by Trump and Carson.
Bush took a more restrained tone on Rubio, with whom he'd clashed in last week's debate.
""He hasn't changed the culture in Washington,"" Bush told reporters aboard his campaign bus. He refused to answer questions on Rubio's personal spending habits, which had had come up during last week's debate.
""It's not my job to worry about that,"" Bush said.
Priority No. 1 for Bush, acknowledged even by him, is injecting some life into his campaign. That has meant a new motto â ""Jeb Can Fix It âa heavier travel schedule to early voting states and more attention-grabbing performances. After New Hampshire this week, he'll tour South Carolina.
Traveling in a blue tour bus with the slogan plastered on its side, Bush stopped Wednesday at a Manchester area school in the morning, the pharmacy in Hollis later and was headlining a law enforcement and drug abuse roundtable in Goffstown in the early afternoon. He was headed north to the lake country for two events later in the day. Bush plans to wrap up the three-day visit Thursday.
During a Republican debate in Colorado last week, Bush criticized Rubio for missing Senate action as he campaigns for president. Bush joked that the Senate's schedule was hardly demanding by suggesting it was akin to ""a French workweek.""
Traveling with reporters in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Bush joked that comparing the French to Congress was really unfair to the French. ""I really did a disservice to the French,"" he said, according to multiple press reports.",,"MANCHESTER, N.H.

It is hard to overstate the importance of New Hampshire for the presidential hopes of Jeb Bush. He entered the year as the clear frontrunner. Now, after months of unfocused answers in interviews, unimpressive performances in the three GOP debates, and a general lack of enthusiasm on the campaign trail, he's in the middle of the pack in polls and stunned to be looking up at the likes of Donald Trump and Ben Carson. And with the New Hampshire primary barely three months away, he arrives in the state knowing that it's his best chance to re-establish his credibility and get his campaign back on track. Unlike other moments in recent weeks and months when Bush needed to demonstrate to voters and his donors, that he wants to be president and is ready to fight for the nomination, Tuesday was marked by a Jeb Bush who seemed relaxed, confident, substantive — even enjoying himself. At an informal town hall and BBQ in the small town of Rye, near the coast, more than 200 people packed a barn where Bush spoke. Some climbed a ladder to the upper loft to get a better view of the speech.

Bush laughed out loud when a man asked his question in a raspy voice, explaining the he's allergic to leaves, a problem in the otherwise gorgeous Fall season in New England. A couple hours later, some 30 minutes away at a town hall at a senior citizen center in Raymond there were some clear signs of a campaign looking to get back on track. When an audience member complimented Bush's father, President George H.W. Bush, the candidate remarked ""If I could have all of the people that love my dad and I could have half of the people who don't like me, I'd probably come out ahead on that pretty good."" He described his opponents in the race not by name, but as ""the big personalities on the stage"" who ""think they have it all figured out"" when it comes to the nation's problems. He said our politics are a mirror image of our culture, before adding ""It's a circus mirror, okay."" He said that the nation can again have an approach to politics where people who disagree can work together to build consensus. 

It's a circus mirror, okay.


Jeb Bush, on politics being a mirror image of culture


One of those ""big personalities"" is Donald Trump, of course, who belittles Bush as ""low energy"" or as someone who falls asleep at the microphone. At the Raymond event, 66-year-old retiree Richard Caron stood up and asked about entitlements, and punctuated his question with a cheeky ""by the way, good energy tonight."" The crowd — and Bush — laughed, before the candidate retorted that he actually has good energy every night. For the record, Caron said his line was a joke. He doesn't think Bush's performance in debates and on the trail has been low energy.

No political consultant could write an ad as glowing as billionaire Paul Singer's email for Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio. ""He is ready to be an informed and assertive decision-maker,"" Singer wrote in the email, which was first published by the New York Times. He went on for nearly two pages about Rubio: ""his youth and vigor.... his unmatched ability to articulate a public argument.... the best explainer of conservatism in public life today."" What makes Singer's email noteworthy is its author. Singer was the Republicans' top individual donor in the 2014 elections, giving $11.5 million, based on federal data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. A cornerstone of Wall Street conservatism, he founded the cautious and successful hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. So far this year, the Federal Election Commission has logged $3.4 million in Singer money. He's given to dozens of congressional campaigns, plus $250,000 to Future 45, a new anti-Clinton superPAC, and another $250,000 to the opposition-research superPAC America Rising. Most notably, Singer this year has sent more than $1 million to American Unity PAC, which he established three years ago as a pioneering voice among conservatives for LBGT rights. But there's something he hasn't done, nor have many other top donors. He hasn't started pumping money into the superPAC of a chosen presidential contender. Now, however, the crowded field of candidates has begun to thin out, and the Iowa caucuses are less than three months away. Singer's endorsement of Rubio may mark the awakening of the upper-echelon donor class. ""Paul Singer is a real opinion leader,"" said Darrell West of the Brookings Institution, author of the book Billionaires. ""He's someone with lots of political experience. People respect him within Republican circles. He's been very active."" And he has that email list, reaching others in the Republican establishment. Singer declined to comment for this story. But his move isn't a complete surprise. Last April he gave Rubio's campaign committee $2,700, the legal limit for the primaries. Other top donors from the 2014 cycle have also given small sums to presidential candidates. Marlene Ricketts, wife of Joe Ricketts, founder of AmeriTrade, gave $4.9 millon to a superPAC for Scott Walker, who has since withdrawn. Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam have written checks to Lindsey Graham and Rubio, plus an earlier PAC for Rubio – just over $20,000 in all. Their totals from the last presidential race, in 2012, give a hint of what might come: The Adelsons gave $93 million, mainly to the superPAC backing Newt Gingrich's White House bid, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Joe and Marlene Ricketts gave $13 million. Singer's more cautious giving totaled $3.7 million.

"Paul Sracic is chair of the Department of Politics and International Relations at Youngstown State University in Ohion and co-author of ""Ohio Government and Politics."" The views expressed are his own.
 (CNN)Commentators were virtually unanimous in their praise of Marco Rubio's performance at last week's Republican debate. In particular, the freshman senator from Florida was lauded for more than holding his own in a testy exchange with his former friend and mentor, Jeb Bush, over his poor voting attendance record in the U.S. Senate. 
But was his evening-defining comeback as smart as many have said?
The key moment came early in the debate, when Bush accused Rubio of shirking his responsibilities to his constituents, suggesting that he ought to resign. Rubio shot back that Bush hadn't been critical of John McCain's 2008 presidential run, which had seen the Arizonan senator missing numerous Senate votes.
On one level, this was a clever response by Rubio (and probably one he had ready in advance -- Bush had telegraphed the attack in interviews before the debate). 
The response allowed the Florida senator to attack Bush for attacking him (in the world of politics this somehow makes sense). And, having established that Bush did not really have a problem with absentee senators, Rubio stated that Bush only brought the issue up because he wanted to score political points. Rubio then pivoted to the high ground, suggesting that he himself is only interested in attacking Democrats.
Yet despite the plaudits, Rubio's response was actually pretty terrible. 
The first and most obvious problem with Rubio's answer is that it was no answer at all. Pointing out that ""everybody else does it"" is more a childish retort than a valid explanation. If the senator worked for a company and his supervisor criticized him for not showing up, would it be sufficient for him to answer that other employees had missed work in the past and no one had said anything?  
Whether he likes it or not, Rubio agreed to be the voice for Florida residents on the floor of the Senate. But keep in mind that Rubio was often absent from the Senate even before he announced that he was running for president. 
For example, in 2014, Rubio missed 36 votes, or about one out of every 10 votes that were taken. In comparison, Rubio's fellow senators on the main debate stage, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, missed, respectively, 28 votes and 7 votes. 
Even as the campaign has heated up for all the candidates, Rubio's absences have still outstripped those of his colleagues -- Rubio has missed over half of the 76 votes that have occurred since the start of July. In comparison, Ted Cruz has missed just under a quarter of the votes, and Rand Paul about 15% of them.
This should matter to Republican voters, who have been throwing their support behind nontraditional candidates such as Donald Trump and Ben Carson largely out of fatigue with the ""political class."" Those who are in the government are thought to be out of touch with everyday Americans. What better evidence could there be of this that politicians -- and senators being paid $174,000 per year -- can simply decide they are too busy with other things to turn up to work?
Rubio's chronic absence from Senate votes is also directly tied to his biggest weakness as a candidate: his thin and completely political resume. 
Rubio is a career politician -- a ""man in a hurry,"" as one of the moderators prefaced a question on Wednesday -- and so his only real argument for higher office is his brief performance in his current and previous offices. True, Rubio did serve as speaker for the Florida House of Representatives. But this hardly seems adequate training to be the next leader of the free world.  
So Rubio's incomplete Senate term is what we have to judge him on, including all those missed votes. 
Of course, his defenders will note that from 2011 until 2013, Rubio missed only about 5% of votes, but this is still above the median of less than 2% for all senators now serving, and it doesn't change the fact that Rubio missed 36 votes last year, presumably as he geared up to run. In contrast, in 2006, the year before launching her first campaign for president, Hillary Clinton missed only four votes, while her opponent for the nomination, Barack Obama, missed only three votes. 
If Rubio had been in the Senate longer, perhaps 2014 could be dismissed as an anomaly. As it stands, however, it is nearly a quarter of the record that we have for him. It is therefore understandable that other candidates might want to make this an issue during the primaries. 
Next Tuesday, during the next Republican debate, Sen. Rubio's colleagues will have an opportunity to challenge him again. Let's see whether they do a better job of it than Jeb Bush.

"Donald J. Trump has mockingly accused Sheldon Adelson, a casino developer and one of the biggest Republican megadonors, of wanting a “puppet” to back when it was reported that Mr. Adelson was considering throwing his support to Senator Marco Rubio. 

But Mr. Trump, many weeks ago, called Mr. Adelson to talk about the state of the race, according to a person told of the discussion, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to characterize the conversation publicly. 

Mr. Adelson has told associates in the weeks since that conversation, which took place over the summer, according to the person briefed, that he considered the outreach an effort by Mr. Trump to secure his support. 

Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said he could neither confirm nor deny any private conversations that Mr. Trump might have had. A spokesman for Mr. Adelson did not respond to requests for comment. 

During the conversation, the person briefed on the discussion said, Mr. Adelson told Mr. Trump that his most important issue when considering a candidate is the safety of Israel. Mr. Trump then emphasized his personal and family ties to the Jewish community in New York.

Mr. Adelson could be a troublesome foe for Mr. Trump, or anyone, should he line up behind a rival candidate. He spent more than $20 million backing the former House Speaker Newt Gingrich’s presidential bid in 2012. 

But when a report in Politico late last month indicated that Mr. Adelson was leaning toward Mr. Rubio, Mr. Trump took to Twitter, his preferred medium, and wrote: “Sheldon Adelson is looking to give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet. I agree!” 

Mr. Adelson remains uncommitted to a  candidate, and people with whom he has spoken recently say he is not immediately planning on an endorsement. But Mr. Adelson is known as being  mercurial about his political leanings.",MAGGIE HABERMAN,"This summer, Mr. Trump called Mr. Adelson, who spent more than $20 million backing Newt Gingrich’s presidential campaign in 2012, to talk about the state of the race, according to a person told of the discussion.",First Draft: Donald Trump Is Said to Have Reached Out to the Megadonor Sheldon Adelson,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/04/donald-trump-is-said-to-have-reached-out-to-the-megadonor-sheldon-adelson/,"[u'immigration', u'personality', u'foreign policy/national security']","[u'Corey Lewandowski', u'Sheldon Adelson', u'Donald Trump', u'Marco Rubio', u'Donald J.

"In a fascinating (and, for some, frustrating) year in politics, the latest polls, including this week’s Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey, provide some telling insights into the trajectory of the 2016 presidential race. I see five key points that give us a sense of where things are going:
1. While Hillary Clinton has solidified her lead and standing among Democratic primary voters, she remains unlikeable to and distrusted by most Americans. Those likeability and trustworthy numbers didn’t move despite all the “success” she has had in the last month. Add to that the fact that two-thirds of the country believe we are on the wrong track, with an incumbent Democratic president with a 49% disapproval at the helm, and it appears she is a weak November candidate (in some ways weaker than a Bernie Sanders candidacy).
2. Donald Trump and Ben Carson continue to solidify their positions as dominant players in the GOP primary. Between the two of them, they represent more than 50% of Republican voters. My question from August still stands: Is the GOP on the verge of nominating an unelectable November candidate as Republicans did in 1964 with Barry Goldwater?
3. This GOP race is coming into a much firmer structure, with three dominant candidates running in the outsider lane (Mr. Trump, Mr. Carson, and Ted Cruz) and three or four in the more establishment lane (Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, and John Kasich). Someone will emerge as the leader in each lane and ultimately face off against the other in the spring of 2016. Today it looks like that will be Sen. Rubio for the establishment; right now, Mr. Carson is leading the outsider lane, but Mr. Cruz could come on strong soon. Sen. Rubio is highly popular among Cruz and Carson voters so if their numbers drop he is likely to be the beneficiary.
4. Jeb Bush is in an incredibly difficult position. He has campaigned everywhere, has a huge organization, and spent millions on television ads–and the numbers haven’t moved. This goes to a simple point: Money matters much less this year, and TV ads are ineffective. And when you look at head-to-head numbers in a GOP primary, the only person Mr. Trump beats one on one is Mr. Bush by 18 points. In addition, Mr. Bush is very unpopular among Carson, Trump, and Cruz voters. He has no real way to grow support.
5. Americans are very frustrated with our government and political institutions, and a majority think the systems are stacked against them. Voters are upset with both political parties, and it looks like each party may be on the verge of nominating “unelectable” candidates to face off next November. And so, having only a choice between the two parties, the generic ballot for president and for Congress is tied. Right now, no one is getting rewarded in this debate.
While the recent polling begins to give us a shape for this presidential contest, a number of twist and turns are likely before the Iowa caucuses are held in 90 days. So far, debates seem to have had more impact than any other events in the campaign. With several GOP and Democratic debates on the horizon, candidates have an opportunity to shift the trajectory with their performance on-stage. Fasten your seat belt.

"Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House. He is a consultant to the pro-Hillary Clinton super-PAC Priorities USA Action. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.
 (CNN)Back in July, when Donald Trump was first insulting his way to the top of the polls, I told CNN's Anderson Cooper, ""He speaks for a lot of people.  The Republican base: the technical term [is] they're crazy.  And he speaks to the crazy base voters.""    
That description of the GOP base has been borne out.  I believe what's driving the GOP base crazy is anger.  Anger at stagnant wages, anger at immigration and the changing demography of the U.S., anger at losing the culture wars, at seeing gay marriage enshrined in the Constitution.  These people are ticked off.
They are, as Howard Beale said in Network ""as mad as hell, and ... not going to take this anymore.""  For some, this anger crosses into despair: Hence the study released this week about the spike in mortality rates for middle-aged white people, primarily those with a high school degree or less. The study showed a spike in diseases of despair: alcoholism and alcohol-related liver disease, drug addiction and poisoning and suicide.  When a sizeable chunk of America is driven to deadly despair, attention must be paid.
Some of those not driven to the point of drugs and death are driven to, umm, eccentric political expression:  
-- Matt Bevin was a fringe nut a few years ago, getting creamed by Mitch McConnell (whose spokesman called him an ""East Coast con man""). Now he's governor-elect of the great Commonwealth of Kentucky after a campaign in which he embraced Kim Davis, the controversial anti-gay-marriage county clerk, and promised to eliminate the expanded Medicaid program under Obamacare.  Bevin once spoke at a rally in support of -- get this -- cockfighting.  He later apologized, but the message was sent: If you're into cockfighting, I'm your man. 
-- Ben Carson compares pretty much everything he doesn't like to slavery and Hitler. He's leading in the national polls.   
-- Donald Trump says America is ""crippled,""  has asserted that many Mexican migrants are murderers and rapists, and that John McCain is not a war hero because he was a POW.  And he has led in the polls for months, now basically tied with Carson.  I am old enough to remember when Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, was a right-wing crackpot leading the charge to impeach my boss, President Bill Clinton. Today he isn't even crazy enough to make it onto the main stage at the debates.  
-- In my beloved hometown of Houston, anti-gay, anti-transgender zealots prevailed in a referendum to repeal the city's equal rights ordinance.  Never mind that most major cities have such an ordinance. The conspiratorial right told Houstonians that equal rights would mean men could pee in the ladies room.  I am not kidding.  Worse, a sizeable majority of Houston voters fell for it.  They could have called their cousin in, say, Dallas (hardly a hotbed of PC excess) and asked him, ""Hey, Buford, y'all got any guys peein' in front of your daughters?  No?  OK.  Just wonderin'.""
I know it is fashionable -- actually, required -- to pretend that both parties' bases are equally crazy.  But that is simply not the case.  Sure, there are some loopy lefties out there, but even Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders is not, for example, calling for nationalizing the oil companies or socializing the banks.  
No Democratic presidential candidate is saying Ted Cruz can't be president because he was born in Canada.  No progressive is attacking Ben Carson's profound faith.   That is why both Hillary Clinton and Sanders are succeeding by addressing some pretty mainstream issues: raising the minimum wage, equal pay protections for women, paid family leave, making college affordable, and universal background checks for gun purchases.  
The Democrats are not insulting each other and they are not spinning fantastic conspiracy theories.  They also aren't getting their voters out.  The impressive -- stunning, really -- victory of Bevin in Kentucky, paired with the overwhelming victory of the anti-gay forces in Houston teaches Republicans a sobering lesson:  crazy sells.  
So here's my prediction:  It's about to get a whole lot crazier.  How crazy?  Consider this:
 
• 44% of Republicans believe the President was not born in the USA; 
• 54% think our President is a Muslim. (Never mind the fact that they were freaking out about his Christian minister back during the 2008 campaign -- only 14% of Republicans think the President is a Christian.)  
• And, perhaps most ominous: According to a September YouGov poll, 43% of Republicans could imagine supporting a military coup in the United States.

Tough night for Democrats last night in several key elections.
In Kentucky, Matt Bevin won the statehouse. He’s only the 2nd Republican in four decades to be a governor there. Ohio rejected a measure to legalize marijuana. In Virginia, Democrat Terry McAuliffe lost his battle to have Democrats control the state Senate. The Republicans will control both houses of the Virginia statehouse. In Houston, an anti-discrimination measure failed. And in San Francisco, a crackdown on Airbnb failed to pass.  
Today is the deadline for filing in New Hampshire to run for President. Lots of candidates are there today and holding campaign events including Jeb Bush, Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, and Martin O’Malley.
There are new Quinnipiac polls out today. There’s good news for Carson and Trump. Carson gets 23%, Trump gets 24%. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz rising. Rubio gets 14%, and Cruz gets 13%. Not such great news for Jeb Bush who has dropped to 4%.
On the Dem side, Clinton gets 53% to Bernie Sanders’ 35%. But the news isn’t great for Clinton in head to head matchups where Clinton loses to Carson, Rubio, Cruz and even Chris Christie. She does beat Trump.  
New Fox polls come out at 6pm tonight.

Donald Trump was on CNN today complaining about his treatment in the press. He also took more shots at Carson and Rubio. He describes Carson as having no chance and Rubio as being overrated.
China has been using up to 17% more coal than reported.. a huge blow to efforts to control the rise of carbon dioxide. The New York Times reports the amount is greater than all of Germany’s emissions!
Volkswagen shares are falling again today after the company revealed it under-reported the carbon dioxide emissions from another 800,000 cars. Up to 11 million of its vehicles had software installed design to fool regulators and drastically under-reported emissions. U.S. officials say now that more cars including Audi and Porsche brand are also implicated.
The investigation into the crash of that Russian jet in the Sinai desert continues today.. it remains unclear just what happened, but the black boxes are being analyzed now.
Another plane crash of a Russian jet. A Soviet-era plane crashed in South Sudan killing at least 25 people. It’s reported it was overloaded.
It was 36 years ago today that the U.S. Embassy in Tehran was seized and Americans taken hostage. Iranians burned U.S. flags and chanted anti-U.S. slogans at an annual state-sanctioned rally.

" (CNN)Another retweet has landed Donald Trump in hot water — but this time, the campaign isn't blaming an intern. 
Trump, a prolific Twitter user, retweeted a message Tuesday that read: ""ADIOS, JEB aka JOSÉ."" Unfortunately for the Republican presidential candidate, that tweet was accompanied by more than a dozen images seeming to attack his rival Jeb Bush and his family, and one of those graphics featured a swastika next to Bush's face.
One of the other pictures showed Bush standing next to cactus plants wearing a sombrero. 
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement to CNN that Trump retweeted the tweet in question ""like hundreds of others,"" confirming that the candidate himself had personally sent out the retweet. 
""He did not see the accompanying image and the retweet has since been deleted,"" Hicks said. 
Trump's latest retweet drew sharp condemnation from Bush's campaign. His national spokesperson, Kristy Campbell, wrote on Twitter: ""Trump tweets swastika as part of latest attack on Jeb. T-minus 8 hours until another 'young intern' is fired.""
Tuesday is not the first time that Trump has stirred up controversy on the social media site. This summer, Trump's twitter account posted a photo showing men wearing Nazi uniforms. At the time, the campaign blamed a ""young intern"" for the mistake. 
And last month, Trump retweeted an insult to Iowans that read: ""Too much #Monsanto in the #corn creates issues in the brain?"" The campaign also deleted this retweet, before, again, blaming a ""young intern.""
Though Trump's retweet has been deleted, the original tweet by user @AndreaWeslien was still live on Wednesday morning.

"Hollis, New Hampshire (CNN)Jeb Bush didn't weigh in on questions about Marco Rubio's finances, saying Wednesday that it's the media's job to vet his presidential rival, though the former Florida governor continued to criticize the first-term senator's legislative record.
Speaking to reporters on his new campaign bus while driving through New Hampshire, Bush was pressed repeatedly about reports that Rubio misused a Republican Party credit card in Florida.
""It's not my job to worry about that. It's your job,"" Bush said. ""A candidate running for president that has a chance to be president will be thoroughly vetted.""
Bush, in an apparent effort to look more transparent, pointed to the 33 years of tax returns and thousands of emails that he released this year.
""I'm probably the most vetted so far. My past has been discussed in all sorts of ways -- sometimes comfortable, sometimes not so,"" he continued. ""And Marco and every other candidate who is a viable candidate will go through that same process. That's up to you guys, not me.""
Rubio hit back on attacks of his financial history on Wednesday, describing them as inaccurate. ""I only have one debt in the world, which is my mortgage on the home that me and my family live in in Miami,"" Rubio said on ""Good Morning America,"" adding, ""I obviously don't come from a wealthy family.""
Tensions between the two candidates have escalated as Rubio has surged in the polls, while his former mentor, Bush, has fallen to the middle of the pack.
Bush continued to say Wednesday that Rubio lacks much of a legislative record and argued that he's done little to bring reform to the nation's capital. 
""He hasn't changed the culture in Washington,"" Bush said, when asked whether Rubio has lived up to expectations since he rode the tea party wave into the Senate in 2010.
As he has in the past, Bush pointed out that Rubio, along with Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, have only sponsored a total of two bills that have actually become law.
""That's one path,"" Bush said. ""The other path is a path of public service where you accomplish things and that's my lane. And I'm going to talk about my lane.""
Pressed on whether he'd support Rubio should he become the nominee, Bush said, ""Absolutely.""
""I will support every person on the stage running against Hillary Clinton,"" he said. ""I'll be the nominee, though.""

"Washington (CNN)Sen. Marco Rubio on Wednesday dismissed attacks on his financial history as inaccurate, and pushed back on reports that he misused a Republican Party credit card in Florida. 
In fact, the Florida Republican said, the card in question was a charge card -- not a credit card at all. 
The freshman senator has enjoyed climbing poll numbers at the early state as well as national level, buoyed by a positively reviewed debate performance, but with his rise, has come increased scrutiny. 
Speaking with ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Wednesday, Rubio answered questions about his financial history brought up by his opponents and media investigations. 
He refuted GOP front-runner Donald Trump's attacks that he has a poor personal financial record and responded to a Tampa Bay Times story that found he charged personal expenses to a Republican Party of Florida card.
""It wasn't a credit card, it was an American Express charge card secured under my personal credit in conjunction with the party,"" Rubio said.
RELATED: Rubio rises in N.H. poll
The primary difference between a charge card and a credit card is that charge cards must be paid off each month, while credit cards allow a balance to be rolled over.
Rubio said bills were sent to his home and he determined what was personal and what wasn't.
""If there was a personal expense, I paid it. If it was a party expense, the party paid it,"" Rubio said. ""Now, I recognize in hindsight, I would do it different to avoid all this confusion. But the Republican Party never paid a single expense of mine -- personal expense.""
According to the Tampa Bay Times story, Rubio has failed to release information about two years of using the card, and two years of records that were analyzed by the Times during his Senate campaign found that he ""routinely"" charged personal expenses on the card, sending about $16,000 to American Express to cover charges.
Rubio said Wednesday his campaign will release records ""soon.""
He called the story ""not accurate"" and said all the records are out there, even if they're not under his name.
""Every expense on that card is detailed in the Republican Party accounts that they file every month,"" Rubio said. ""It doesn't say who they belong to, but every expense is on there, and as we've said, we'll release those soon.""
He also rejected Trump's recent onslaught of comments saying his finances are a ""disaster.""
""I only have one debt in the world, which is my mortgage on the home that me and my family live in in Miami,"" Rubio said, adding, ""I obviously don't come from a wealthy family.""

"Donald J. Trump is buying radio air time in three early states, his campaign manager confirmed, marking the billionaire candidate’s first foray into paid advertising since he began his presidential campaign in June. 

The 60-second radio ads will run in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina over the next two weeks, said Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager.

The ads are not expected to feature attacks on any of Mr. Trump’s rivals, despite his penchant for such criticism in interviews and stump speeches. 

And they are not television ads, which are substantially more expensive than radio spots. Those are the types of ads that some political watchers assumed Mr. Trump was referring to when he told Fox News on Tuesday evening that he planned to begin small advertising buys in early states over the coming days. 

The purchase for a week of radio ads usually costs only several thousands of dollars, as opposed to the hundreds of thousands of dollars that television spots could cost a campaign to air at this point in the race. 

Mr. Trump is making the move after seeing his poll numbers begin to sag in Iowa and nationally, although he has maintained his lead in recent public polls in New Hampshire. 

Pundits and people who have long been involved with national races have been skeptical about whether Mr. Trump would ultimately spend his own money on advertisements to try to regain his lead. Mr. Trump has ridden a wave of so-called earned media, meaning all of his television publicity so far has come at no cost to him. 

It remains to be seen whether Mr. Trump will buy television air time, although his aides have insisted he is prepared to do so. ",MAGGIE HABERMAN,"Donald J.

"WASHINGTON (AP) â Two of the Republican Party's rising young stars â House Speaker Paul Ryan and presidential hopeful Marco Rubio â made similar calculations on the way to political advancement: Both abandoned efforts to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul.
The about-faces by Ryan and Rubio underscore the GOP's difficulties with the issue of immigration, where policies that appeal to young and minority voters can invite a backlash from the conservative base. And in a campaign season where Donald Trump's incendiary rhetoric has seemed to drive the debate, they renew questions about whether Washington will ever be able to come up with a solution for the nation's dysfunctional immigration system.
In Ryan's case, he emerged as the unity candidate for speaker of the House last week after offering assurances to conservatives that he would not pursue comprehensive immigration legislation with President Barack Obama in the White House. Rubio, in campaigning for president, has repeatedly sworn off the bipartisan Senate immigration bill he co-authored two years ago, and he is now rising in the polls.
Both Ryan, 45, and Rubio, 44, have treaded with care on the issue, never specifically disavowing the goals of comprehensive immigration reform but instead shifting their focus to border security and enforcement, and blaming process or politics.
Ryan says immigration reform cannot happen with Obama in the White House because the president showed he could not be trusted by going around Congress to issue executive actions limiting deportations.
""He has already demonstrated he is not serious about enforcing the law. Passing comprehensive reform during his presidency would merely render it meaningless,"" the Wisconsin Republican wrote in an opinion piece Wednesday in USA Today, adding that the focus should instead be on bills to secure the border or enforce immigration rules inside the U.S.
Rubio says he's concluded that a comprehensive bill like the one he helped write, which passed the Senate in 2013 but stalled in the House, is not the way to go.
""The only way forward is through a series of steps that begins with border security,"" the Florida senator said Wednesday on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" ''This issue cannot be tackled in one massive piece of legislation.""
Both tend to downplay their past support for potential eventual citizenship for many of the 11.5 million immigrants living in this country illegally, which was the most contentious element of the Senate's immigration bill and decried as ""amnesty"" by many conservatives.
Ryan once called potential citizenship ""a very important part of immigration reform,"" but he's avoided discussing it since becoming speaker even when directly asked. For his part, Rubio emphasizes a piecemeal approach. His campaign website includes a section devoted to his opposition to ""sanctuary cities"" that shield immigrants from prosecution, but does not highlight his broader immigration policies. When asked earlier this week on Fox News Channel, Rubio said he is open to immigrants in the country illegally becoming citizens after 15 years under certain circumstances.
The maneuvering comes from lawmakers who were hailed in the past by immigration activists for their leadership roles, Rubio for taking on the Senate bill and trying to sell it to the conservative community, and Ryan for working behind the scenes in the House and trying to find a legislative solution there.
But it's against the backdrop of a presidential campaign that's been dominated by Trump, who's said immigrants who come here illegally are ""rapists"" bringing drugs and crime. Such pronouncements have pushed the GOP to the right, even as some leading Republicans insist they need a nominee who will embrace immigration legislation and win back some of the Latino and Asian voters who've been abandoning the party.
""It's an issue that as much as we would like, it's not going away,"" said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. ""If we don't do something about immigration reform and people are going around saying they're rapists and murderers, then obviously the reaction in the Hispanic community is very negative.""
Ryan's efforts to find a House GOP consensus on immigration fizzled after former Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., was upset in his primary race last year by a conservative who accused him of backing amnesty. A crisis of unaccompanied minors arriving from Central America also helped end any faint hopes for action in the House â well before Obama took the executive actions that Ryan and other Republicans now blame for congressional inaction.
Now immigration activists are bemoaning the changed focus from Ryan and Rubio.
""We all know that Ryan supports reform, yet he's letting the Steve King wing of the party call the shots, and same thing with Rubio,"" said Frank Sharry, executive director of pro-immigrant group America's Voice, naming the leading immigration hardliner in the House. ""If they want to expand the Republican Party they have to lead, and neither of them are doing that right now.""

"s
Maryland Republicans seeking to reinstate a challenge to the stateâs 2011 congressional map made headway early in Wednesdayâs Supreme Court arguments. But concern from some justices over a possible flood of political gerrymandering litigation later raised doubts whether they would prevail.
The plaintiffs claim that the remap, engineered by former Gov. Martin OâMalley to shift a Republican seat into the Democratic column, violated constitutional speech and association rights. The allegation raised âabout as important a question as you can imagine,â Justice Stephen Breyer said.
âThey want to sayâ¦that the state legislators are forbidden to draw district boundaries the way that has been done here,â he said. âAnd if they are right, that would affect congressional districts and legislative districts throughout the nation.â
A federal district judge in Baltimore had dismissed the lawsuit, shutting down the lawsuit without putting it before an expedited process Congress authorized for redistricting lawsuits. Under federal law, a three-judge district court is supposed to hear challenges to electoral maps, then bypass the appellate courts for a direct appeal before the Supreme Court.
Justice Elena Kagan suggested the district judge was too hasty in dismissing the case.
âWe’ve basically said that’s only [appropriate] when it’s completely ridiculous,â she said, not merely an unsuccessful legal theory but âa laughing stock of a case.â
While the Supreme Court never has thrown out a political map for partisan gerrymandering, neither has it foreclosed the possibility that drawing lines to favor a political party could be unconstitutional. In a 2004 concurring opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy invited litigants to propose reasons and methods for judicial review of partisan gerrymanders, a point the court underscored in June when it upheld an Arizona voter initiative transferring political map making to an independent commission from the state legislature.
âIt’s Justice Kennedy’s concurrenceâ¦ that provides the basis for the complaint in this case,â plaintiffsâ attorney Michael Kimberly told the justices. As a result, Republican voters at least were entitled to their day in three-judge court, he said.
Just as it seemed a majority had been sewn up, Chief Justice John Roberts raised a troubling implication. If practically any challenge to a political map brings an automatic appeal to the Supreme Court, the justices could find themselves flooded with gerrymandering litigation.
âThat’s a serious problem,â he said.
Marylandâs lawyer, Steven Sullivan, immediately stoked such fears, noting that seven separate challenges to the 2011 map had been filed.
âThe cases we’ve had in recent years that were dismissed by a single judge, they would have all come here. And we’re one state times 50,â Â¬ Mr. Sullivan, a state assistant attorney general, said.
âThere is this concern to control this court’s mandatory docket, which Congress cares deeply about,â he said.
âWe care even more than Congress. Trust me,â Justice Antonin Scalia said.
A decision in the case, Shapiro v. McManus, is expected before July.

"The 
Democratic Party
’s half-century of decline across the South was all but complete Wednesday after Kentucky elected a 
Republican
 governor who campaigned against abortion, gay marriage and, for a time, 
Obamacare
.
The victory of 
tea party
 favorite Matt Bevin affirmed the appeal of outsider candidates challenging the establishment in a year when real estate mogul 
Donald Trump
 and retired neurosurgeon 
Ben Carson
 are leading the party’s presidential race.
Bevin, an investment manager who has never held public office, branded Democratic rival Jack Conway as a “career politician.” He ran television commercials calling Conway, Kentucky’s attorney general, “pro-abortion,” “anti-coal” and a champion of President 
Obama
’s “liberal agenda” — reprising themes that swept many Republicans into office in last year’s midterm elections.
When Bevin is sworn in next month, Democrats will hold just two governorships in the South: Terry McAuliffe in Virginia and 
Earl Ray Tomblin
 in West Virginia. The sole legislative chamber that Democrats still control in the South is Kentucky’s House of Representatives.
“We’re sort of catching up to the rest of the South,” said Al Cross, a veteran Louisville political columnist and director of the University of Kentucky’s Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues.

The Democrats’ lock on the South began to erode after enactment of federal civil rights laws in the 1960s. The decline accelerated as the nation’s polarization over cultural issues intensified in the decades since then.
Kentucky’s shift away from Democrats has been slower than in some neighboring states, thanks partly to the 2005 indictment of its last Republican governor,

, in a political patronage scandal, Cross said.
For Bevin, Obama’s unpopularity in culturally conservative states like Kentucky proved a major asset. His advertising leaned heavily on tying Conway to the president.
Obama is also a major factor in the Nov. 21 runoff for governor of Louisiana, where Republican U.S. Sen. 
David Vitter
 is trying to use the president’s low popularity there to damage Democratic opponent John Bel Edwards.
Since 2008, when Obama won the presidency, Democrats have lost 13 governorships and more than 900 state legislative seats across the U.S.
In Kentucky, Bevin campaigned as a Christian conservative businessman who would protect coal mining, a backbone industry in the Appalachians.
Jim Cauley, a Democratic strategist in Louisville, said that timeworn tactic was especially effective in rural areas where the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is seen as a coal-mine job killer.
“There’s this feeling that the liberal Democrats are coming to get them,” Cauley said. “They don’t have Christmas because Barack’s coming at them with the EPA.”
Bevin highlighted his “pro-life” and “pro-family” stances. He stressed his opposition to Planned Parenthood and his support for Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who spent several days in jail for refusing to obey federal court orders to issue marriage licenses after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage was legal. Bevin paid her a jailhouse visit.
He also campaigned against Obamacare, a sensitive issue in a state where the Affordable Care Act has extended coverage to more than 500,000 people, mostly through an expansion of 
Medicaid
 under Democratic Gov. 
Steve Beshear
.
Bevin wound up backpedaling on his initial pledge to stop the Medicaid expansion, saying he would continue to accept federal money to keep the newly insured covered but would require some of them to pay fees.
Bevin’s pivot came as Republican White House contenders, with a few exceptions, strike a less bellicose posture against the healthcare law than they did in 2012.
 “We went from ‘repeal, repeal, repeal’ to ‘repeal and replace,’” said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. “That, to me, is shorthand for Republicans figuring out you couldn’t just talk about repeal. Maybe someone explained to them exactly what would happen if they repealed it.”
Former Kentucky Republican Chairman John McCarthy said Democrats had counted on a boost at the polls from many who gained health coverage, but “they didn’t show up to vote.”

"LONDON — Accused of French-bashing, the Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush apologized this week for making fun of France’s work ethic, saying he was sorry for insulting America’s oldest ally.

“I made the mistake of saying that the Congress operates on a French workweek,” Mr. Bush was quoted as saying by Time magazine, with jovial flourish. “I really did a disservice to the French.”

During the Republican presidential debate last week, Mr. Bush, former governor of Florida, sought to pour scorn on his opponent Marco Rubio’s attendance record in the Senate by comparing it with the perceived idleness of the French. “I mean, literally, the Senate, what is it, like a French workweek? You get like three days where you have to show up?” Mr. Bush asked.

The assault, a seemingly well-rehearsed line that fell flat both at home and in France, stirred a backlash, with more than a few irate French people taking to social media to mock Mr. Bush’s lack of diplomacy. Moreover, some critics, including France’s ambassador to Washington, Gérard Araud, noted that Mr. Bush had muddled his facts.

“A French work week of 3 days? No but a pregnancy paid leave of 16 weeks yes! And proud of it,” Mr. Araud wrote on Twitter, with Gallic defiance.

Indeed, despite having a 35-hour week, in practice the French are far from lazy. Full-time French workers last year put in an average of 38.9 hours a week, compared with the eurozone average of 39.6 hours a week, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

At the same time, French labor productivity is sufficiently robust that The Economist recently noted that “The French could take Friday off and still produce more than Britons do in a week.”

Mr. Bush, who has been seeking to revive his flagging candidacy and this week unveiled a new campaign slogan, “Jeb can fix it,” sought to mollify France, the first ally of the United States, which, historians note, provided essential military help during the American Revolutionary War.

“I now know that the average French workweek is actually greater than the German workweek,” Mr. Bush was quoted as saying by Time magazine. “So, my God, I totally insulted an entire country — our first ally, that helped us become free as a nation. And I apologize.”

Mr. Araud, for his part, appeared willing to accept the apology, called a mea culpa by Le Monde, the French newspaper.

“Everything is forgotten and forgiven,” Mr. Araud wrote on Twitter, adding: “Errare humanum.”",DAN BILEFSKY,The Republican presidential candidate said he “made a mistake” by citing the French workweek in criticizing Marco Rubio’s Senate attendance record.,Jeb Bush Apologizes to France for Workweek Remark in Debate,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/world/europe/jeb-bush-france-apology.html,"[u'economy', u'jobs/employment']","[u'Marco Rubio', u'Jeb Bush']",nyt,0.6713882540488033,"[{u'author_id': 251, u'fullname': u'dan bilefsky', u'primary_org': u'nyt'}]",2015-11-04 20:54:12,"[u'Senate', u'The Economist', u'Congress', u'Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development']",5cb2289d3df8600346499265205e5e2f,2015-11-04 21:38:11.807994

Donald Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said on the radio this week that Trump is not taking donor money and self-funding his entire presidential campaign — claims that are demonstrably false. 
""The first thing is obviously is the inside-the-beltway guys have no control over Donald Trump and I mean that in a good way,"" Lewandowski said on Breitbart News Radio on SiriusXM on Tuesday. 
""Most of those people are bought and paid for by special interests, by lobbyists, by major donors,"" added Lewandowski. ""Mr. Trump is funding his campaign on his own, he's not taking donor money. He isn't beholden to those people and can't be accountable to those people who want special interests out of the government. He's gonna do what's right for the country.""
Trump is, in fact, accepting donations and has a donation page on his campaign website. Trump is also not, as he himself continues to say in speech and debates, entirely self-funding his campaign. Though Trump donated a large amount of his own money to his campaign early on, the majority of money Trump has raised and spent recently has come from donations.
From the New York Time's blog post on Trump's FEC filing in mid-October:
Mr. Trump revealed in a filing Thursday to the Federal Election Commission that the vast majority of the money he raised and spent this summer as he rose to the top of national polls came not from his own coffers, as it had in the spring, but from about $3.7 million in what he called ""unsolicited contributions."" Some 74,000 donors pitched in an average of about $50 to help his campaign, he reported. Mr. Trump himself contributed only about $100,000 in in-kind contributions, including rent space that he donated and payroll expenses that he covered. That represented a huge drop from the spring, when Mr. Trump donated about $1.9 million to his campaign, financing the bulk of it himself.

Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson told graduates during a commencement address in the late nineties that he believed the pyramids in Egypt were built by the biblical figure Joseph to store grain, and not, as most archeologists contend, as tombs for pharaohs. 
At the 1998 commencement for Andrews University, a school associated with Seventh-day Adventist Church, Carson also dismissed the notion that aliens were somehow involved in the construction of the pyramids. 
""My own personal theory is that Joseph built the pyramids to store grain,"" Carson said. ""Now all the archeologists think that they were made for the pharaohs' graves. But, you know, it would have to be something awfully big if you stop and think about it. And I don't think it'd just disappear over the course of time to store that much grain."" 
In the Old Testament, Joseph, one of the 12 sons of Jacob, is sold into slavery in Egypt by his jealous brothers. He eventually rose to become a top aide to the Egyptian Pharaoh, advising him of a dream vision he had of coming years of famine in the ancient kingdom. Joseph's sage advise of the coming famine (and directions to store gain) helped the Egyptians survive the famine.
Carson said the design of the pyramids made clear it was for grain storage. 
""And when you look at the way that the pyramids are made, with many chambers that are hermetically sealed, they'd have to be that way for various reasons. And various of scientists have said, 'well, you know there were alien beings that came down and they have special knowledge and that's how-' you know, it doesn't require an alien being when God is with you.""

"Donald J. Trump has appeared unconcerned with the possibility of angering Latinos since declaring during the announcement of his presidential campaign in June that Mexico was sending rapists to the United States.

On Wednesday evening, in an event organized by the League of United Latin American Citizens, about two dozen protesters gathered behind metal barricades opposite NBC headquarters at Rockefeller Center in New York to demand that the network rescind an invitation that Mr. Trump had accepted to host “Saturday Night Live” this week.  

There were claps and chants of “Dump Trump” and “Fight back.” There were placards reading “SNL stop the hate.” There were people dressed in costume, including a man appearing as a cartoon-style plutocrat, replete with a black top hat and a papier-mâché mask featuring eyeballs emblazoned with dollar signs.

Among the protesters was Juan Sanchez, 45, a translator from Midtown Manhattan, who said that he believed that Mr. Trump, racial views aside, might be driven by ego.



“It’s all ‘I do, I do, me, me, me, myself, myself,’ ” Mr. Sanchez said, shaking his head. “I don’t think America deserves that kind of leadership.”

Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, declined to comment on Wednesday evening about the protest.

Xiomara Santos, 20, said she had come to New York to join the demonstration from Washington, where she is an intern with the League of United Latin American Citizens. Mr. Trump seemed most interested in spreading negativity, she said, and it would therefore be a bad idea for NBC to provide him with yet another platform.

Asked who she supported for president, Ms. Santos said quickly that she was a fan of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, adding, “He seems more truthful than all the other candidates.

Does that mean that Mr. Trump was being less than truthful when he made his inflammatory statements?

If Mr. Trump believed what he said, “he is a racist,” Ms. Santos said. “If it’s a publicity stunt, he’s just destructive.”

Nearby, Nicola DeMarco 57, from Riverdale, in the Bronx, held aloft an illustration he had drawn of Mr. Trump with his lips pursed as if whistling and featuring his trademark haircut.

“I don’t want to see people rounded up and deported,” Mr. DeMarco said, referring to a proposal of Mr. Trump. “What he’s proposing is right out of the Nazi playbook; these are Mussolini tactics, to rile up people.”

Around 6:30 p.m. several protesters walked slowly across West 49th Street holding a cardboard box that they said contained a flash drive bearing 522,080 signatures to a petition demanding that NBC revoke Mr. Trump’s invitation. The chants stopped briefly as Juan Escalante, a member of an immigration reform group called America’s Voice, was permitted to enter the Rockefeller Center lobby to deliver the cardboard box to “someone named Adam.” Then, as he emerged from the lobby, the chants resumed.",COLIN MOYNIHAN,"In an event organized by the League of United Latin American Citizens, about two dozen protesters demanded that NBC rescind an invitation that Mr. Trump had accepted to host the show this week.",First Draft: Donald Trump’s Scheduled Appearance on ‘Saturday Night Live’ Draws Protest,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/04/donald-trumps-scheduled-appearance-on-saturday-night-live-draws-protest/,[u'immigration'],"[u'Donald Trump', u'Bernie Sanders', u'Hope Hicks', u'Donald J.

"Washington (CNN)Florida Sen. Marco Rubio continues to dominate the Republican pack on CNN's Political Prediction Market, placing his odds Wednesday of winning the GOP presidential nomination at 41%.
Before the Republican CNBC debate on October 28, Rubio's odds were at 33%. His odds went up to 37% during the debate and then rose to 39% the next morning.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who was once considered a favorite for the nomination, is now at 9% following his poor performance at the last debate. Before the event, his odds were at 15% and went down to 11% by the end of the debate.
Rubio's odds for the nomination have been rising in the Prediction Market since the last debate after giving a positive performance and handling attacks from Bush, his former mentor. On Wednesday, Rubio received questions about his finances and pushed back after being asked about a charge card that he may have reportedly misused. It's unclear if this has affected his odds in the Prediction Market yet.
Carson's odds are also on the rise in the market -- they've nearly doubled in a week. He was previously at a 9% chance for the nomination on October 29. and is now at a 17% chance for the nomination. Real estate mogul Donald Trump is at third, with his odds for the nomination at 12%.
CNN's Political Prediction Market is a live online prediction game administered by a company called Pivit that factors polls and other factors, including input from online players.
It's not to be confused with polls from actual voters. The latest Quinnipiac University survey shows that Trump and Carson are neck-and-neck in the Republican primary, at 24% and 23% respectively. Rubio comes in third in the poll, with 14% support in the national survey.

"Hugh Hewitt is a lawyer, law professor, author and host of a nationally syndicated radio show. He served in the Reagan administration in posts including assistant counsel in the White House and special assistant to two attorneys general. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.
 (CNN)In his first radio interview since becoming speaker of the House (the complete audio and transcript is here), Paul Ryan told me on Monday:
""Look, I see the whole shooting match coming up in 2016. Again, one of the reasons why I chose to do this, and one of the reasons, one of the conditions, more or less, I talked to my colleagues about, which is we've got to go on offense, big and bold, specific agenda and vision in 2016, and let the country choose, because the kind of an election we have to have is a mandate election.""
The Wisconsin Republican had come to talk with me at the radio studio at Hillsdale College's Kirby Center, near Capitol Hill. In doing so he increased by one the number of times his predecessor, former Rep. John Boehner, had been interviewed by me or any other nationally broadcast conservative talk show host while he was speaker of the House. An interesting change in tactics, that one. 
Boehner dutifully made the rounds of conservative media while rising to the speakership, then promptly abandoned the effort to talk to the Republican Party's core supporters and those independents and open-minded Democrats who listen to shows like mine.  
Interviews and selling the party's agenda to an audience beyond his GOP caucus just wasn't how Boehner saw his job. Speaker Ryan promises a much-needed, night-and-day change there, one that foreshadows crucial change in the way Congress operates.
Ryan arrived early on Monday and joined Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, in a discussion of the Democratic debate and it promises regarding student loans, then stayed on after Cotton left talk about national defense, the ""regular order"" approach he is embracing for the House and, crucially, how congressional Republicans must assist the GOP field in framing the upcoming election.
Ryan used the interview to begin doing that specifically with the conservative base that listens to my show or reads the transcripts of interviews I post from it, just as he had done so for different audiences on the weekend shows the previous day.
Ryan, like his mentor, the late congressman and GOP vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp, is a gifted communicator and an ideas guy. He loves to talk policy, even with folks who disagree with him. Unlike most older Republican stalwarts on the Hill, even the ones deeply admired by conservatives, Ryan is also very, very good at it.
Ryan comes armed for the communications battles. He has been studying up for years, beginning with his undergraduate days at Miami University. His 2012 campaign as Mitt Romney's running mate infused him with name recognition no other member of the House can rival, and the speakership gives him a platform he can use every day to sell the conservative vision.  
That he began to do so on the radio with me probably had more to do with paying a compliment to Hillsdale College, which is a lighthouse institution for conservatives, and its president Larry Arnn, who is one of the very few thought leaders respected across he conservative spectrum, than it did with me.
But the key facts are that Ryan knows the importance of Hillsdale, of Arnn, of conservative talk radio generally and of center-right media and conservative institutions all across the land. The new speaker knows he must sell ideas and help build conservative ideas infrastructure, just as Kemp did, and he is about the business of doing so. All conservatives should be thrilled about Ryan's rise -- and about other recent developments.
Yesterday, Republican Matt Bevin won a shocking upset for the governorship in Kentucky. The GOP debates are drawing huge audiences no matter how well or poorly they are managed. There is good news for conservatives everywhere.
The GOP candidates are all experienced, effective communicators, and they don't have to conceal what they were doing or where they were during the Obama years. None of them has dismissed the VA scandal as ""not as widespread"" as the public has been led to believe. None of them has a scandal that is under FBI investigation. None of them lied about a video having anything to do with a terrorist attack.
Like Speaker Ryan and his friend RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, I don't have a favorite in the GOP race but, like both of them, I have an intense interest in seeing the GOP nominate its strongest candidate and in winning the presidency a year from now.
To do that, the GOP needed new voices, like Ryan's and Cotton's and Bevin's, to emerge with a message drawn from all the presidential candidates -- ""We can fix this, we can make America great again, we can speak for and on behalf of all Americans, including all working Americans or Americans who want to find work, and we can rebuild our military and return the country to global leadership and renew the world's respect for us"" -- without favoring any one candidate. Ryan especially can lead the House in crafting legislation that would await a new Republican's president's input and signature.
The GOP doesn't need a party platform when it has a platform in which to display its legislative agenda and a Speaker who can describe it with good humor, eloquence and a command of the details.
It has been a great week for the GOP, and though the mainstream media seems to have missed yet another major development in the race for the White House -- even as it mostly missed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's pratfall on the VA or her many ""admissions against interest"" in her 11 hours of testimony two weeks ago -- the reinforcements have arrived, in the Speaker's Office, in Kentucky and across the country.  
Democrats feel a chill wind blowing. A year from now they will remember it beginning with Ryan's rise and Bevin's win.

"RYE, N.H. — Jeb Bush needs a boost. He’s getting a bus.

As his presidential campaign limps through the fall, Mr. Bush invited a small group of reporters on Tuesday aboard his new ride, with “Jeb Can Fix It” etched across the side. A recap of how it played out:

6:34 p.m. Mr. Bush comes to the back, where two long black leather couches stretch beneath the windows.

“Nice boots,” he says to a television reporter, striding over in his own. They are inscribed with his name.

6:38 Mr. Bush is asked why he’s on a bus.

“You get to hang out with people,” he says. “We’ll have people off and on the bus, not just press but people from New Hampshire. Put the full court press on ‘em. Before they leave, they’ve got to say, ‘Yes, I’m for you.’ ”

Dutiful laughter fills the bus.

“Shh. It’s a secret plan,” he says. “We’ll talk about that later.”

6:43 A local television reporter, who has been covering Mr. Bush, introduces herself.

“You don’t think we notice you?” he asks. “You’re hurting my feelings that I wouldn’t recognize you.”

He crosses his legs, boot heel angled skyward.

6:48 Mr. Bush recalls last week’s debate.

“The debate, the so-called debate, is more of a performance,” he says. “It gives you an opportunity to say whatever you want. I’ve got to train myself to say what’s on my mind rather than what the question is.”

How can he master that art? “After 62 years?” he asks. He laughs at himself.

“I don’t think any question that we prepared for was a question we were asked,” he continues, knocking the CNBC moderators, “because they didn’t do anything they said they were going to do.”

6:50 Mr. Bush is asked about his nerves.

“I felt really good about the debate I screwed up on,” he says.

He clarifies that this was before the debate started: “No, I felt bad after.”

What happened? “I got shouted down when I tried to interrupt in the beginning. Then I couldn’t finish the sentence in the Marco deal,” he said, about an exchange regarding Marco Rubio’s Senate voting record.

Mr. Bush is asked if he has to stop directly answering the debate questions to succeed.

“Yeah. I’ve got to stop doing that. It’s kind of weird, but that’s why it’s not really a debate.”

6:52 Mr. Bush decides he should keep answering questions after all, to a point.

“I’ve just got to be clear about what I want to say,” he says. “I think I know what I want to say.”

6:54 Mr. Bush discusses his media consumption habits.

“I don’t read every word of what you guys record or write,” he says. “There’s a lot of stuff. Everybody’s prolific in their reporting and stuff. And it doesn’t help me get better, per se.”

6:58 Mr. Bush discusses his actual consumption habits.

“Maybe after,” he says, waving off an aide offering M&Ms. “I’ve got another gig here.”

“A little energy?” the aide, Tim Miller, says. “A little sustenance?”

Mr. Bush becomes a bit annoyed at the echo of a Trumpian insult: “You think I need a little more energy?”

He scoops up some turkey jerky.

7:01 Mr. Bush is asked about how to reconcile his campaign message with voter frustrations. 

“You’ve got to connect with that frustration,” he says, adding, “Can you rely on someone that has no proven record of getting things done?”

7:03 Mr. Bush recalls his attack on Mr. Rubio during the debate, when he likened life in Congress to a “French workweek.”

“I really did a disservice to the French,” he says. “I now know that the average French workweek is actually greater than the German workweek. And so, my God, I totally insulted an entire country, our first ally, that helped us become free as a nation. And I apologize.”

7:05 Mr. Bush mulls the groundswell of support for Donald J. Trump and Ben Carson.

“I’m not smart enough to know, to explain the Trump or Carson phenomena yet,” he says. “Carson is such a nice person. I mean, he’s really a nice guy.”

Mr. Bush is asked if someone without any government experience can succeed as president. “We might find out,” he says.

7:07 Mr. Bush, after mentioning Richard M. Nixon’s famous visit to China, wonders if his references are connecting.

“I used the Nixon-to-China analogy once in front of a group of young people who looked at me like, ‘Who’s Nixon?’” he says.

He turns to this reporter: “Do you know what the Nixon-to-China moment is?”

I do.

7:08 Mr. Bush muses on his new physique, aided by a paleo diet. 

“Does it take getting used to?” he asks, repeating a reporter’s question. “No.”

He chides those who failed to join him at Gold’s Gym in Charleston, S.C. “At 5:30, I was there,” he says.

7:09 Mr. Bush is not done musing.

“I am in good shape,” he says for emphasis.

7:10 Mr. Bush, asked a pro forma question about how he stays positive every day, waxes surprisingly philosophical.

“I’ve learned to accept the fact that I am imperfect under God’s watchful eye,” he says. “I can get better. I don’t have a self-esteem problem and I don’t have an overstated worth problem. There’s a balance that I’ve acquired in life through my journey in life that gives me serenity.”

7:13 Mr. Bush notes his staff members’ ability to overcome obstacles during his time as Florida governor. 

“We all learned how to identify — I can’t use the terms that we used — the poo bombs that were around the corner,” he says.

He extends the analogy: “They learned how to anticipate these things happening, look up, take two steps to the side, let it splat on the sidewalk and keep going.”

7:14 Mr. Bush praises his campaign’s dedication to details.

“We’ve laid out more details, scored by all the nerdy bean counters,” he says of his policy proposals.

7:15 Mr. Bush excuses himself. 

“I’ve got to get into my mind-set here,” he says, as the bus arrives in Raymond, N.H., for a town hall.

7:16 Mr. Bush teases his campaign workers for their dedication to details. 

“You’ve got 47 minutes for Q. and A.?” he asks an aide with his schedule, in earshot of the reporters. “What about 45 and a half?”

"WASHINGTON Nov 4 Democratic presidential
contender Bernie Sanders on Wednesday will unveil a
climate-change bill that would crack down on fossil fuel
extraction, a move sure to please activists who want party
front-runner Hillary Clinton to make the same commitment.
Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, wants to halt new
leases for fossil fuel extraction on public lands and for
offshore drilling in the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico. He would
prohibit drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic Ocean.
Sanders and his co-sponsor, U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley of
Oregon, will push for the legislation at a rally at the U.S.
Capitol on Wednesday, alongside environmental leaders such as
Bill McKibben, co-founder of the grassroots climate group
350.org.
The bill will face fierce opposition in the
Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and is unlikely to become
law. But it should help Sanders appeal to environmental
activists and could pressure Clinton, who has said that abruptly
halting extraction on federal lands would disrupt the U.S.
economy.
Sanders, who calls himself a democratic socialist, has been
Clinton's main rival to be the party's nominee for president in
the November 2016 elections.
His liberal stances on the environment, trade and more have
pressured Clinton to move to the left on those issues. Still,
polls have shown the former U.S. secretary of state appeared to
gain ground against Sanders after a strong showing in October.
Climate activists want Clinton to commit to be tougher on
environmental issues if she is elected president.
Clinton told an activist at a New Hampshire town hall in
July that it would be irresponsible to abruptly halt oil,
natural gas and coal extraction on federal lands. She instead
called for phasing it out and increasing fees on companies
operating on public lands.
""We still have to run our economy, we still have to turn on
the lights,"" Clinton said.
Clinton in August opposed Arctic oil exploration, putting
her at odds with the Obama administration, which had just given
Royal Dutch Shell PLC final approval to resume drilling
off the coast of northern Alaska.

"Under fire from various corners about his use of a Florida Republican Party credit card years ago, Senator Marco Rubio said Wednesday that he will “soon” release additional records that will detail those expenditures, brushing aside continued criticism about his personal finances. 

Mr. Rubio spoke in an appearance on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” after The Tampa Bay Times reported that he mingled personal expenses with his official uses of the card. 

Mr. Rubio’s top adviser, Todd Harris, told the Florida newspaper that the campaign will release detailed expenditure lists in the coming weeks. He was not more specific than that. 

Mr. Rubio took issue with the paper’s overall account, including insisting that it wasn’t actually a credit card. 

“It wasn’t a credit card, it was an American Express charge card secured under my personal credit in conjunction with the party,” Mr. Rubio said. 

Mr. Rubio added that he personally paid for anything that needed to be covered by him. 

“Every expense on that card is detailed in the Republican Party accounts that they file every month,” Mr. Rubio said. “It doesn’t say who they belong to, but every expense is on there, and as we’ve said, we’ll release those soon.”

A day earlier, Donald J. Trump seized on the issue, saying, “For years, I’ve been hearing that his credit cards are a disaster.”

The topic of Mr. Rubio’s credit cards was also raised in his 2010 campaign for the Senate, when he ran as a Tea Party favorite. It did not derail his candidacy, as he ultimately won. 

But Mr. Rubio’s critics believe that, in the context of a national election and with the senator still trying to define himself to the national electorate, the matter could be a potential liability. 

The matter came up on the campaign trail in New Hampshire on Wednesday, where former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Mr. Rubio were campaigning.

“That’s not my job to worry about that, that’s your job,” Mr. Bush told reporters on his campaign bus. 

But Mr. Bush quickly highlighted what he described as his own transparency and suggested that questions about Mr. Rubio’s personal finances were fair game.

“A candidate running for president that has a chance to be president will be thoroughly vetted,” Mr. Bush said, calling himself “the most vetted” candidate to date.

“Thirty-four years of tax returns, all the emails, my past has been discussed all sorts of way, sometimes comfortable, sometimes not so,” he said.  “And Marco and every other candidate that is a viable candidate will go through that same process.”",MAGGIE HABERMAN,"Under fire from various corners about his use of a Florida Republican Party credit card years ago, Senator Marco Rubio said Wednesday that he will “soon” release additional records that will detail those expenditures, as he brushed aside criticisms of his personal finances.",First Draft: Marco Rubio Confronts New Scrutiny Over Use of Party Credit Card,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/04/marco-rubio-confronts-new-scrutiny-over-use-of-party-credit-card/,"[u'personality', u'campaign_finance']","[u'Jeb Bush', u'Marco Rubio', u'Donald J.

" (CNN)Bernie Sanders' top strategists and advisers told CNN last month that their candidate had finally agreed to give a major speech explaining his democratic socialist views and that he would do so before the second Democratic debate on November 14.
That plan has now changed.
Tad Devine, Sanders' top strategist, told CNN on Wednesday that the speech will now come after the debate in Des Moines, citing the senator's busy schedule.
But while Sanders has started writing the speech, aides have said it has been difficult to get him to agree to give it.
Devine maintained Wednesday that the senator is ""not the least bit apprehensive"" to give the speech. 
""He's looking forward to it, but these speeches take some time,"" he added.
In the lead-up to his campaign, Sanders was routinely asked about his ""socialist"" views. He would usually rebut the questions with a quick disclaimer: He is a ""democratic socialist,"" not a socialist.
And lately he has suggested there are aspects of socialism already present in American society. 
""When you go to your public library, when you call your fire department or the police department, what do you think you're calling?"" Sanders said last month in Iowa. ""These are socialist institutions.""
At the first Democratic debate, CNN asked Sanders if he considered himself a ""capitalist.""
""Do I consider myself part of the casino capitalist process, by which so few have so much and so many have so little by which Wall Street's greed and recklessness wrecked this economy? No, I don't,"" he said forcefully. ""I believe in a society where all people do well. Not just a handful of billionaires.""
There is a difference between socialism and democratic socialism. While socialists believe in government takeover of certain large sectors of the economy, democratic socialists see government intervention -- along with private businesses -- in certain portions of the economy, like college and health care.
To date, though, Sanders has not said that outright in a major forum.
""He will reassure people he is running to be the president of the United States, on the platform of the Democratic Party, and that he will work within that system, as he has for a long time, but also will bring his own philosophy,"" Devine said last month. ""He would not be the nominee of a Democratic Socialist Party, he wants to be the nominee of the Democratic Party."" 
Sanders' Democratic rivals have subtly knocked the senator on this issue, too.
""I am a proud Democrat,"" Clinton said in Iowa in September. ""I am a true Democrat.""

"Donald Trump is taking a break from his presidential campaign this week to host “Saturday Night Live” this weekend. NBC has released a batch of promo videos for Trump’s upcoming appearance, where he appears alongside Cecily Strong. The two poke fun at his braggadocio manner, his love of the word “huge” and the equal time for candidates mandate. Trump also manages to get in a dig at Ben Carson.
This marks Trump’s second time hosting the late-night sketch show. His first time came on April 3, 2004 when his reality show “The Apprentice” was a ratings smash.
“Saturday Night Live” airs on NBC at 11:35 on Saturday night. Will you watch Trump’s appearance?

Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who is running for the Republican presidential nomination, says introducing the subject of ""gender confusion"" to children will only make those who do not have ""gender confusion"" more confused. 
Santorum, speaking on NewsMaxTV's Steve Malzberg Show last Thursday about federal officials who told a Illinois school district it broke the law by a banning a transgender student from the girls locker room, said ""I don't why children at that age are even, ya know, why this is even an issue.
""The idea that we are introducing this type of real dangerous confusion for young people at this early age. Do we really care about what we're doing to millions of children who don't have gender confusion and introducing the subject and saying, 'well maybe you should. Maybe this is something you should start thinking about.'
""At age seven, I mean this is really dangerous and it's going to far because it's gonna have — it is having — an impact on not just folks who may be in a difficult situation at an early age but many who would never have been in that situation that now are being confronted with it,"" continued Santorum.
Earlier this year, the former senator said of Caitlyn Jenner's public transition that if Jenner ""says he's a woman, then he's a woman."" He then clarified by saying two weeks later, ""I know what obviously and biologically he is. That doesn't change by himself identifying himself.""

" (AP) â GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio said Wednesday he'll release in the next few weeks all of the statements detailing his use of an American Express card he shared with the Republican Party of Florida.
Rubio, a former speaker of the Florida House, had the party-issued card from February 2005 to November 2008. During his successful 2010 bid for U.S. Senate, news broke that Rubio had charged personal items such as grocery bills, plane tickets for his wife and repairs to the family minivan to the card. Rubio says he reimbursed the party for any personal expenses. The statements from late 2006 to late 2008 are now public, but those from 2005 and most of 2006 are not.
Rubio's personal finances are gaining new scrutiny as he tries to break out of the crowded GOP nomination fight.
The American Express card is part of a litany of financial problems â from a bank moving to foreclose on a house he part-owned in Tallahassee to questionable accounting of political funds â that have dogged Rubio during his career.
GOP rival Donald Trump criticized Rubio on his personal finances on Tuesday, saying ""he is a disaster with his credit cards.""
Rubio dismissed the charges as old news and said he did nothing wrong.
""Every month I would get a bill at my home and I would review it. If there was something on it that was personal, I would pay it, and if it wasn't, the party paid it,"" Rubio told reporters in New Hampshire on Wednesday.
""What I would do differently is that I just wouldn't have done any personal things on it because I would have avoided all the confusion that it's created in the minds of some,"" he said.
During his 2010 campaign, Rubio's aides said the charges were legitimate, contending that the minivan had been damaged while being used on GOP business. They also said Rubio paid American Express more than $16,000 to cover nonparty expenses when they happened. He also sent a check to the party as reimbursement for personal airline flights he said were mistakenly charged to the GOP card. Rubio blamed an accounting error.
Rubio was among several state GOP lawmakers given access to American Express cards through the Republican Party of Florida, which offered a way for lawmakers to get around the state's strict ban on accepting gifts that was put into law in 2006. The ban prevents lawmakers from taking gifts from lobbyists, but the state party doesn't face the same restrictions. The Florida Republican Party was responsible for paying off the cards on a monthly basis.

" (AP) â Donald Trump's campaign for president will begin airing radio ads on Thursday in the three earliest-voting states, marking the first time the billionaire businessman has spent money on paid advertising since he launched his bid.
Trump's team announced Wednesday that its first two radio ads will run through the end of November in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. It says the ad buy is valued at $300,000.
The spending comes as Trump continues to adjust to the new realities of an evolving campaign in which he is no longer the undisputed front-runner of the Republican field. While he remains on top in many opinion surveys, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has surged past him in others. And candidates like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz of Texas are drawing new attention from voters and donors as the opening contests near.
On Wednesday, Trump told reporters in New Hampshire, where he officially filed to appear on the state's primary ballot, that the ads would be ""very, very positive, about good things and great things about the country.""
But he added a warning to rivals who may be considering negative ads against him. ""If they hit me, they will get smacked like they never got smacked before,"" he said.
Trump has so far spent little of his own fortune on his campaign, relying mainly on donor contributions to fund his operation and on the news media to promote his message.
Trump often brags that he'd originally expected to spend $20 million or $25 million for ads by this point in the campaign, but hasn't needed to because he's doing so well. He's continuing to holding back on television ads, which are significantly more expensive than radio.
Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski declined to discuss which firm had produced the radio ads, saying the information would be contained in the campaign's next financial disclosure report.

" (CNN)Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is set to host NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" on November 7. 
This will be the businessman's second time hosting the network's iconic sketch show -- he first hosted in 2004, while serving as the host of the NBC reality show ""The Apprentice.""  
The Donald's relationship with SNL is unique and long-running. He and his wife Melania walked the red carpet at SNL's 40th anniversary show in February. 
He's also been a consistent character — played by some of the show's most famous cast members — for more than two decades, even before his career in television and shift to politics. During the late 1980s, Phil Hartman was the first cast member to regularly play Trump. Darrell Hammond played Trump for more than a decade, and Taran Killam took the reins this season. 
Trump's adult children and all three of his wives have been characters on the show as well.
Franken predicts 'entertaining' Trump on 'SNL'
During his last hosting gig, Trump embraced SNL's portrayal by endorsing Hammond's performance during his opening monologue. He went on to play himself in a few sketches, living up to the out of touch, ratings-crazed, power-hungry, borderline-delusional character that the show's audience had come to expect. 
While most major presidential candidates and political figures are lampooned by the show's cast, it's  rarer for politicians to play themselves. President George H.W. Bush appeared on the show after leaving office, then-Senator Barack Obama made a cameo during the 2008 campaign cycle, and current Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton played a bartender on the show last month.

"The conservative Club for Growth has released a “White Paper” on Donald Trump and it’s unsurprisingly not complimentary.
The group -- which has publicly tussled with the real estate magnate -- says its conclusion is that the contender for the Republican presidential nomination “would not be a pro-growth president.”
Club for Growth President David McIntosh said Trump held “anti-growth” positions on taxes, trade, entitlements and government regulations before 2015 “and still defends a massive government role in health care, a mostly hands-off approach to entitlement reform, and protectionist policies that would likely spark trade wars and lead to higher business and consumer costs.”
Club for Growth’s political action committee announced in August it would steer donations to Sens. Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, along with former Gov. Jeb Bush and Gov. Scott Walker, who has since dropped out of the race.
Trump on the campaign trail has accused the group of writing a bad mouthing him because he wouldn’t contribute $1 million. A spokesman at the time said it was Trump who had indicated an interest in donating to the group. 
""But that doesn’t change the fact that the Club for Growth PAC thinks he’s an unserious candidate and would make a terrible president, just as we publicly pointed out during his last political publicity stunt in 2011,"" spokesman Doug Sachtleben said at the time.
In its review of Trump’s policies, the Club says, among other things, that Trump’s “hostility towards free trade is unmatched by any other major presidential candidate, with the possible exception of Bernie Sanders” who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.
It notes that Trump has frequently given to Democrats and “anti-growth Republicans who later left the party,” including former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist.
“While Trump has clearly touched a nerve with Americans who are frustrated with Washington, his approach to politics is not unlike the worst of Washington politicians,” the group says. “Instead of taking consistent and principled stands, he has jumped on popular bandwagons.”",,"Torches Trump for backing Democratic candidates

HIGHLIGHTS
WSJ/NBC POLL FINDS ANGER AT POLITICAL SYSTEM: Amy West, a 61-year-old retired schoolteacher, traces her frustration with the rest of the country to a local fight banning prayer at area schools more than a decade ago. âI have to have the Bible in my life,â she said. A Republican from Vilonia, Ark., she plans to support Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in next yearâs GOP presidential primary. She thinks he is best equipped to tackle her concerns, starting with the dwindling influence of religion in Americansâ daily lives.
Republican primary voters are overwhelmingly unsettled by societal changes transforming the country, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds, while Democratic primary voters describe themselves as proud that the country has moved further to protect the rights of minority groups and to accept gay marriage. The results show that, in many ways, Republican and Democratic presidential candidates are being forced to tailor their messages for deeply disparate groups. If there is a unifying theme, it is anger at the political system, the Journal/NBC News poll suggests. Patrick OâConnor and Janet Hook report.
More on 2016:Â Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson overtook businessman Donald Trump as the top pick of GOP presidential primary voters, the poll found, and he posted the strongest numbers in test match-ups against Hillary Clinton …Â Drug deaths are becoming a 2016 presidential election issue. Across New Hampshire, overdoses are on track to break last yearâs record of 326 deaths. The pattern is so alarming that participants in an October WMUR Granite State poll ranked drug abuse as the most important issue in the 2016 presidential campaign …Â In a new TV ad and on the stump,Â Hillary ClintonÂ vowed Tuesday to push for new gun restrictions.
ELECTION-DAY TAKEAWAYS:Â Republican Matt Bevin won a bitterly fought race for Kentucky governor, handing the GOP a coveted seat that extends its hold on the South and imperiling the state’s closely watched implementation of the federal health lawÂ â¦ In a victory for social conservatives,Â voters in HoustonÂ on Tuesday overwhelmingly rejectedÂ a ballot measure to extend nondiscrimination protections to gay and transgender peopleÂ â¦Â Former Bridgeport, Conn., Mayor Joseph Ganim,Â who spent seven years in prison, was returned to office, completing a stunning political comeback in the stateâs most populous cityÂ â¦Â Ohio voters rejected a ballot measure Tuesday legalizing marijuanaÂ for recreational and medical uses …Â San Francisco voters soundly rejectedÂ a ballot measure that would have limited short-term housing rentals to 75 nights a year, a victory for Airbnb Inc.
JANET HOOK: FEUD WITH CRUZ FOLLOWS BOEHNER OUT THE DOOR
John Boehner may have retired from Capitol Hill, but he is living on a bit longer in the airwaves of the 2016 presidential campaign. The former House speaker, who stepped down last week under pressure from conservative critics, is the villain of a new radio ad by a super PAC supporting Ted Cruz for president. Read Janet Hook’s full post in Washington Wire.
WSJ STORIES YOU SHOULDN’T MISS
SEN. CORKER PROFITS ON QUICK STOCK TRADES:Â In the course of his Senate career, Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee has made many short-term trades in shares of a little-known Chattanooga real-estate company. Until recently, he hadn’t made public a dozen stock purchases in the firm, including several that resulted in his most profitable investments. In one previously unknown purchase, Mr. Corker purchased between $1 million and $5 million in shares of the firm, CBL & Associates Properties Inc., in late 2011 and sold them five months later for a 42% gain. A pair of purchases in 2009 in accounts in the name of his daughters likely netted more than $1 million, though in that case the exact gain is impossible to calculate. The trades are among the CBL stock purchases that Mr. Corker disclosed only recently after questions from The Wall Street Journal about apparent discrepancies in his Senate financial-disclosure reports. Congressional ethics rules require lawmakers to make public their financial investments in broad ranges each year. Brody Mullins and Tom McGinty report.
WITH RYAN AT HELM, HOUSE BEGINS SCUFFLING OVER HIGHWAY BILL: The House has begun skirmishing over a multiyear highway bill that includes an extension of the Export-Import Bank and other nontransportation items, providing an early test of House Speaker Paul Ryanâs ability to manage the chamberâs disparate factions. The legislation, which sets out policies for building roads and maintaining bridges for six years, already is facing skepticism from Senate Democratic leaders, who say the $325 billion raised by the bill is too little. Some Republicans complain that the measure, a version of which has already passed the Senate, includes only three years of funding for the programs. Mr. Ryan, following through on promises to conservatives, has allowed a number of amendments, in a debate that was expected to run into Tuesday and Wednesday evenings, with a final vote set for Thursday. Siobhan Hughes and Kristina Peterson report.
Plus: The Senate fell short of advancing legislation to repeal environmental regulations that bring more waterways and wetlands under federal protection, a victory for the Obama administration on rules that have faced a series of legal and political setbacks over the past few months.

WHAT WE’RE READING AROUND THE WEB
The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg writes that “a White House exhausted and frustrated” by its relationship with Israel is asking Defense Secretary Ash Carter to take on increasing responsibility for managing Israeli ties.
The Republican Party keeps the field of contenders allowed at a debate platform so large because “the idea seems to be for everyone to keep hanging on until,Â miraculously, the Trump-Carson dynamic fundamentally changes,” writes The New Yorker’s Amy Davidson.
Michael Gerson and Peter Wehner, in a lengthy essay forÂ Christianity Today, Â explore how evangelical Christians can deal with their unease at social and political change: “Cultural retreat would betray our faith, because it would betray the call and responsibility to seek the common good. Evangelical Christians clearly require a new model of social engagement, not pious cover for disengagement.”
The Washington Post’s Dana Milbank writes that there is no such thing anymore as a moderate Democrat. “The handful of centrists in office have ceased to play a meaningful role in the party, much as moderates long ago ceased to influence the Republican Party.”
In the WSJ’s Think Tank, Peter D. HartÂ  writes thatÂ “itÂ is time at least to entertain the thought that 2016 GOP primary voters are not going to fall into the well-established patterns.”
MILESTONE
