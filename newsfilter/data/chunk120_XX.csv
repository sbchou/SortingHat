The Institute for Supply Management says that its services index slipped to 59 from 60.3 in the previous month. July's reading was the highest in a decade, and any reading over 50 indicates expansion.

The index remains at a high level despite the decline and suggests that Americans have been spending freely at retail stores, hotels, restaurants and other firms that make up the index. The ISM is a trade group of purchasing managers. Its services survey covers businesses that employ 90 percent of workers.

A measure of sales and production fell one point but remained at a solid level of 63.9. A gauge of new orders also fell slightly.",0.42098071226725675

Donald Trump hints he will sign RNC loyalty pledge,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/03/donald-trump-hints-he-will-sign-rnc-loyalty-pledge/,washpo,"Golf fans takes a ""selfie"" with presidential candidate Donald Trump during the final round of The Barclays at Plainfield Country Club on Sunday in Edison, N.J. (Photo by Ross Kinnaird/Getty Images) RICHMOND -- Donald Trump said Thursday morning that signing a loyalty pledge designed to block him from running for president as an independent would give him the best shot at winning the Republican primary. Asked by conservative radio show host John Fredericks if he would sign a statement that the Republican National Committee circulated to presidential candidates Wednesday, Trump said he would make a final decision after a meeting Thursday with RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. “It is possible. We’re going to have a meeting,” Trump said. Already leading in the polls, Trump said he believes his popularity would increase should he rule out a third-party bid. He even appeared to slip at one point and say point-blank that he would sign the pledge. “There are those that say you go up if you do, and I’m not doing it for that. I’m doing it for – I mean, we’re going to see what happens, we have a meeting – but certainly it would be advantageous to do it that way, and I think our best chance for victory is to do it that way. But I’m going to have to hear the chairman out,” he said. The RNC pledge is similar to statements some state parties routinely ask candidates at all levels of elected office to sign. The Virginia GOP has had a version of the pledge and plans to discuss a proposal for presidential hopefuls at a meeting later this month. The move is widely seen as an attempt to box in Trump, but Virginia GOP Chairman John Whitbeck said it is intended to motivate Republican activists. Trump said he’ll probably announce his decision Thursday at a 2 p.m. news conference. “Look, my number one thing is to win, and the best way to win is as a Republican,” he said. “The third party thing is a tough thing, it’s a tough route. And I believe that it can be done, but it’s a tougher route, it’s a riskier route. And certainly it would give Hillary, or whoever’s going to be running on the other side, a better shot, let’s face it. They would love it.” More on Donald Trump: How Ted Cruz wooed and won Donald Trump Here’s your daily Donald Trump interview, annotated The media’s love-hate relationship with Donald Trump",0.9999999273614304
"OTP CEO says banks ready to lend, weak demand a problem",http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/financialsNews/~3/AXe850KTtxA/story01.htm,reuters,"BUDAPEST, Sept 3 Hungary's bank sector could

lend some 8,000 billion forints and OTP alone could

lend 1,000 billion to the economy, but weak credit demand is a

problem, OTP chief executive and chairman Sandor Csanyi told a

conference on Thursday.

He said there was a fierce competition for both retail and

corporate clients in the sector.

""The problem is with credit demand,"" Csanyi said, adding

that a planned reduction in banks' special tax from next year

was largely offset by new payment burdens due to recent

collapses of brokerages.

Csanyi also said that he believed that the state's capital

injection into state-owned savings banks in 2013 was forbidden

PAI picks banks for listing of Sweden's Perstorp -sources,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/financialsNews/~3/77JMLgtsroE/story01.htm,reuters,"STOCKHOLM/FRANKFURT, Sept 3 Private equity firm

PAI is stepping up preparations to sell Swedish chemicals firm

Perstorp to take advantage of still-buoyant corporate valuations

and has completed its line-up of advisers, several people

familiar with the transaction said.

The buyout group has picked Morgan Stanley, Nordea

and Carnegie to lead a potential stock market listing

of Perstorp, people familiar with the matter said, while it has

hired HSBC to sound out potential industrial and

private equity buyers.

Reuters reported in July that PAI was mulling a listing of

Perstorp which could take place later this year and value it at

more than 1.5 billion euros ($1.69 billion) including debt.

Perstorp makes feed additives, biodiesel and chemical

products for plastics and for coatings, including films for

shatterproof car windshields and scratch-resistant coatings for

cellphones.

One of the sources said China's Sinochem and some private

equity firms had made tentative bids. Another source said the

sales process had been put on hold since PAI had concluded a

listing would mean a higher valuation than a straight sale.

PAI and Perstorp declined to comment. The banks either

declined to comment or did not immediately respond to a request

for comment. Sinochem could not immediately be reached for

comment. The sources declined to be identified because the

details of the plans are not public.

Perstorp said last week it was looking at strategic options

together with its owners, including a listing, as it posted a 45

percent rise in second-quarter core earnings, boosted by a new

plant and an acquisition, its eighth straight quarter of profit

growth.

In the year to June 30, earnings before interest, tax,

depreciation and amortisation were 1.67 billion Swedish crowns

($198 million), excluding non-recurring items.

Rep. Elijah Cummings (second from right), the ranking member of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, said it's ""certainly understandable"" that Bryan Pagliano would be advised not to appear before the committee.

J. Scott Applewhite/AP

A former aide to Hillary Clinton said he will invoke his fifth amendment right to remain silent and not answer questions from Congress. The aide, Bryan Pagliano, helped set up Clinton's private email server. Clinton has faced months of scrutiny for using her home server and a private email address to conduct State Department business. The Select Committee on Benghazi had asked Pagliano, a former State Department employee to field questions next week. His lawyer has declined, sending a letter to Congress citing the negative political environment. Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, ranking member of the committee, said it was ""certainly understandable"" that Pagliano's attorneys ""advised him to assert his Fifth Amendment rights, especially given the onslaught of wild and unsubstantiated accusations by Republican presidential candidates, Members of Congress, and others based on false leaks about the investigation."" Former Clinton State Department Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills is being interviewed by the Benghazi committee today. Another close aide to Clinton is also scheduled to meet with the committee this week and the former secretary of state said she will testify in October. The FBI is investigating the possible compromise of secrets in Clinton's emails. Her presidential campaign said it's confident her email set up was allowed at the time, though Clinton has said she wised she had used a second email account and carried a separate phone. Clinton's campaign responded that ""she has made every effort to answer questions and be as helpful as possible, and has encouraged her aides, current and former, to do the same, including Bryan Pagliano.""",0.97189453742479115

Lions RB Ameer Abdullah: 'It's great having Joique back',http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/sports/~3/gqmkdrwSUP0/,fox,"There's plenty of talent in the Detroit Lions' offensive backfield, but that doesn't mean the running backs are unwilling to share the spotlight. In a blog on the team's official website, second-round rookie Ameer Abdullah celebrated Joique Bell's return from the physically unable to perform (PUP) list earlier this week.

""It's great having Joique back,"" Abdullah wrote on DetroitLions.com. ""He's like the spirit lifter in the group. He's always joking around, goofy. To have someone on the field who can calm your nerves sometimes when things may be going crazy, it's good. It's always good to have a veteran there to help you out when you need that experience. Theo [Riddick] and George [Winn] have been great, but Joique definitely has a lot of experience in this league. Getting him back has really helped us with our spirits and we have been more confident.""

The Lions have an interesting blend of ability at running back, starting with the veteran starter. Bell (5-11, 231 lbs.) is the biggest of the backs and has the most experience with over 3,000 yards from scrimmage through five NFL seasons. Abdullah looks like the team's featured back of the future, though, and Riddick will get his reps as a third-down back.

Abdullah writes that the Lions' running backs can be ""one of the best units in the league"" in his blog. The key will be to make strategic use of the diverse personnel. It'll be interesting to see how Detroit mixes up the touches between Bell, Abdullah and Riddick in 2015.

Detroit Lions defensive tackle Haloti Ngata is getting used to his new home, but he hasn't forgotten the team that dealt him away this offseason. The Baltimore Ravens traded Ngata away in the spring, leaving a little bit of a chip on the big lineman's shoulder.

""Yeah, a little bit,"" Ngata said, per Carlos Monarrez of the Detroit Free Press. ""You want to kind of show your old team they're missing out.

""But it is a business and so they had to do what they had to do and I got traded. So you've just got to look forward to the new opportunity and do the most with it that you can.""

Ngata, 31, was a force for nine years with the Ravens. He anchored one of the league's fiercest defenses at 6-foot-4 and 345 pounds, making five consecutive Pro Bowls from 2009-2013. A former first-round draft pick (2006, 12th overall), Ngata has started 133 of a possible 144 games and collected 25.5 sacks along the way.

This week, Ngata returned to the practice field after spending most of the summer on the non-football injury (NFI) list with a hamstring injury. Although he is entering the twilight of his career, there may be just enough fuel in the tank to make Baltimore regret the decision to trade him.

Bush says he'd back Trump as Republican presidential candidate,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/4oCnw98Ff_Y/story01.htm,reuters,"WASHINGTON Jeb Bush said on Thursday he would back fellow Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump if the businessman-turned-politician wins the party's nomination for the 2016 presidential election and Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee.

Asked if he would support Trump as Republican nominee over Clinton in the November 2016 contest, Bush said, ""I would, of course.""

""We need to be unified. We need to win,"" Bush, the former Florida governor, said in an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" television program, one day after Trump told the same show he would back Bush over Clinton.

Bush and Trump have been engaged in public attacks on each another as they vie for the party's nomination.

Trump has spent weeks taunting Bush, one of his closest rivals in public opinion polls in the large Republican field. The real estate mogul and television personality has mocked Bush as ""low-energy,"" and this week criticized him for answering a question in Spanish.

The Bush campaign initially had avoided engaging in a war of words with Trump. But on Wednesday, Bush's advisers signaled a new effort to fight back with campaign ads and social media efforts.

On Thursday, Bush took issue with Trump's tactics and called on his rival to tone down his attacks. Trump has made controversial remarks about immigration and Latinos. Bush, whose wife was born in Mexico, told ABC that diversity adds vitality to the country.

""I think Donald Trump trying to insult his way to the presidency is not going to work. People want an uplifting, hopeful message,"" he said.

Bush added that Trump should ""figure out a way to lessen the divisive language, the hurtful language and talk about the aspirations of the American people, rather than trying to prey on their fears.""

Reuters/Ipsos polling shows Trump with support among nearly 31 percent of self-identified Republicans as of Sept. 1, with Bush garnering support among nearly 12 percent, behind former neurosurgeon Ben Carson.

We're just one week away from the start of the NFL regular season as teams and fans prepare for Week 1.

The Miami Dolphins kick off their season against the Washington Redskins on Sunday, Sept. 13, where Ndamukong Suh will make his team debut. Before he gets the chance to wreak havoc on the Redskins' offensive line, he'll be terrifying readers with his front page photo for the Miami Herald's football preview section.

Whether Suh is actually standing in the Atlantic Ocean or not is unclear, but it's terrifying, nonetheless. That's what Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins will see in his face early and often next Sunday as he'll be doing his best to elude Suh all game long.

For now, Cousins should probably shy away from looking at the Miami Herald.

U.S. Trade Gap Narrows in July,http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-trade-gap-narrows-in-july-1441283529,wsj,"WASHINGTON—The U.S. trade gap narrowed in July as demand grew overseas for American-made autos and industrial supplies.

The trade deficit with other nations shrank 7.4% from June to a seasonally adjusted $41.86 billion in July, the Commerce Department said Thursday. That was slightly lower than the $42 billion gap projected by a Wall Street Journal survey of economists.

Exports increased 0.4% to $188.5 billion, despite a strong dollar and economic weakness in major trade partners like China and Europe.

Imports fell 1.1% to $230.36 billion, reflecting slowing American demand for consumer goods like pharmaceuticals and mobile phones.

Trade figures can be volatile from month to month. Broader trends suggest international trade has slowed thanks to weak global growth. The U.S. trade deficit grew 3.6% in the first seven months of this year compared to the same period a year earlier. Exports fell 3.5% over that period while imports declined 2.2%.

Exports contributed to the post-recession comeback but have been uneven in the past 18 months. Europe’s ongoing economic woes and slowing growth in Asian trading partners like China have dampened demand for U.S. goods.

The U.S. trade deficit with China grew 8.5% in the first seven months of 2015 compared to the same period last year, Thursday’s report showed. The deficit with Japan grew 2.5%.
