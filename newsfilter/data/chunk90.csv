Six Democratic Party debates are enough,http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/opinions/fowler-democratic-debates/index.html,cnn,"Donald L. Fowler, who served as the Democratic National Committee Chair from 1995 to 1997, is a political science professor at the University of South Carolina and founder of Fowler Communications. He is a current Democratic National Committee member and a member of the Rules and Bylaws Committee. The opinion expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN)Five months before the Iowa Caucus, and nearly 15 months before Election Day, excitement for the 2016 election is building among Democratic activists.

I'm not sure we could have imagined better motivation than seeing Donald Trump sitting atop the Republican polls, trailed by the prospect of yet another President Bush. It seems to have been the kick in the pants Democrats needed to get off the couch and get to work defending the considerable achievements of President Obama's time in office, especially considering the party's lackluster performance during the 2014 midterms.

At the moment, that excitement has manifested as concern over the rules governing how the Democratic Party will choose our next presidential nominee. We need to ensure that we nominate a candidate who is prepared for the rigors of a campaign, not to mention holding the highest office in the land. Thankfully, I see five such qualified candidates on the Democratic side, and potentially a few more, while I've yet to see one among the 15 or 20 Republicans vying for their nomination.

So while I understand the concerns that some Democrats have expressed concerning the debate schedule, I wholeheartedly agree with the schedule as currently structured. This schedule is best for our candidates, our supporters, and for voters. Most importantly, I believe that it puts Democrats in the best possible position to win in November 2016 with a tested nominee, operating from a position of strength.

As a former DNC chair, I'm familiar with the guiding principles that are taken into consideration when creating a debate schedule.

The goal is to set a reasonable number of debates that maximizes voters' opportunity to see the candidates side by side, while remaining manageable for all of the participants. To be clear, I haven't always seen the Democratic Party do this. Since my time as chair, several cycles have turned into unruly and out-of-control situations more hurtful than beneficial to our party.

Six debates provide multiple opportunities for voters to hear our candidates share their visions for our country's future. They also provide multiple opportunities for our candidates to engage in a rigorous discussion. But this discussion occurs not only with each other, but also with the American people. A pace of one debate per month gives candidates plenty of opportunities to engage voters at rallies, town halls, house meetings, forums, and other campaign events.

Voters need opportunities to hear the policy positions of our candidates without the constraints of a clock or the artificial limitations of a debate stage. Nobody wants our candidates focused solely on debates and debate prep at the exclusion of chances to interact directly with voters.

Another consideration is the importance of holding debates when voters are actually paying attention. Did you know that the first Republican primary debate of the 2012 election was in May 2011? Unless you're Tim Pawlenty or Gary Johnson (who participated in the debate, unlike Mitt Romney), you probably don't remember it.

Fall of 2015 was always the ideal window to begin the debate schedule, and October 13 fits squarely into this principle. And with each of the six sanctioned debates sponsored by a combination of state Democratic Parties, national media, digital platforms, local media, and civic organizations, these debates will be appealing and accessible to voters. These debates will reflect our party's -- and our country's -- diversity. They will include the first ever party-sanctioned Univision debate, especially important to our Hispanic citizens.

Debate negotiations rarely lead to all sides getting exactly what they want -- that's why they're called negotiations. But this is a schedule that meets the fundamental principles that guided the process and will benefit the Democratic Party.

Six DNC-sanctioned debates are in line with the precedent set during the 2004 and 2008 election cycles.

You probably recall a seemingly endless series of debates, including many non-DNC sanctioned ones, in those years, which I think has contributed to the confusion surrounding this year's schedule.

In fact, the reason the DNC is enforcing an ""exclusivity requirement,"" where candidates are barred from participating in non-DNC sanctioned debates under penalty of losing their access to the sanctioned and nationally televised debates, this cycle is so that we can avoid a repeat of what happened in cycles past. In both 2004 and 2008, a lack of enforcement led to more than 20 debates. This confused voters and overwhelmed our candidates, and was an experience no one had any interest in repeating.

As much as I love politics, even I don't really want to watch 20 Democratic and 20 Republican primary debates between now and March. Limiting the number should make it likely that more viewers will watch, and help our message break through.

It's worth noting that in recent election cycles, the general election has featured three debates between the parties' presidential nominees and one contest between the potential vice presidents. No one contends that three or four debates are insufficient for voters to distinguish the differences between the candidates. It is understood that the majority of campaigning will be conducted outside the debate arena, among the other events and opportunities for candidates to interact with and engage voters. This schedule enhances our candidates' ability to do that.

During the DNC's Summer Meeting, one of our outstanding candidates, Gov. Martin O'Malley reminded us that we as Democrats cannot remain silent in the face of Republican lies, Republican misogyny, Republican distortions about our President, and Republican disdain for our neighbors.

He was absolutely right.

But I hope that Democrats aren't waiting for a debate stage or a convention or a presidential nominee to speak up. Because all of us have a responsibility, each and every day, through our words and our actions, to show the American people that it is the Democratic Party that is on their side, championing their well-being.

I'm proud that our presidential candidates have spoken up to call out hateful rhetoric from Donald Trump and Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, and to hold Republicans accountable for their outdated and out-of-touch policies. And I'm proud that our party leaders, elected officials, activists, supporters, and volunteers have done the same. I expect that each of them will continue to remind people what it means to be a Democrat, using every platform they have to keep fighting for middle-class families.

That's why I'm encouraged by the debate over the debates. It's an indication that Democrats are engaged in the political process, moving past the complacency that plagued us in 2010 and 2014.

The current schedule was structured to put the Democratic nominee, whoever it eventually is, in the best position to win next November. I expect that our candidates will participate in the DNC-sanctioned debates, and capitalize on the numerous other opportunities that exist to interact with voters on the campaign trail.

And Democratic activists will channel their energy into what we do best: knocking on doors, making phone calls, registering and educating new voters, and relying on the strength of our grassroots supporters to win in 2016.

Global economic losses from drought to top $8 billion: report,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/environment/~3/b1PtAHoE-jw/story01.htm,reuters,"LONDON Global economic losses from drought are likely to reach more than $8 billion in the next few months as the El Nino weather pattern intensifies, reinsurance broker Aon Benfield said on Thursday.

Total economic losses from drought in the United States are likely to reach at least $3 billion, mainly due to agricultural damage in California, Aon Benfield said in its monthly catastrophe report.

“As we continue to see the prospect of El Nino becoming one of the strongest in decades, more and more impacts will be apparent around the world,"" Steve Bowen, associate director of Aon Benfield's catastrophe modeling team and meteorologist, said in a statement.

Experts work to save pair of melon-headed whales found struggling in waters near Gulfport,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/national/~3/jB-4AqShEss/,fox,"GULFPORT, Miss. –  Marine experts in Mississippi are working around the clock as two whales, their species unseen in South Mississippi for 40 years, fight for survival.

Moby Solangi of the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Gulfport says a fisherman Tuesday reported what he thought were two dead dolphins on the beach. Solangi tells The Sun Herald (http://bit.ly/1iiIIM1 ) when rescue teams arrived, they discovered not only were they not dead, they were not dolphins.

Solangi says the mammals are two melon-headed whales, a species native to deep waters near Hawaii. He says the whales are in critical condition — severely dehydrated, disoriented and unable to swim on their own. One also is suffering from a shark bite.

The team won't know what is ailing the whales until blood tests are completed.

State Department tries to corral e-mail FOIA cases,http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/crime/article33701748.html,mcclatchy,"Facing more than 30 Freedom of Information Act lawsuits over State Department e-mails, the Obama administration this week formally asked federal judges to consolidate all the cases in one court.

In filings dated Sept. 2, Justice Department attorneys said one judge could better coordinate the myriad FOIA cases.

“Different judges are being asked to impose a variety of search regimes, resulting in a hodgepodge of orders directing how State manages the search and production of the emails,” the Justice Department stated. “The result is confusion, inefficiencies, and advantages given to some requesters at the expense of others.”

FOIA lawsuits over the State Department’s e-mails are currently spread among 17 different federal judges. The multiple lawsuits, the Justice Department noted, tap into the trove of Hillary Clinton e-mails that are supposed to be fully disclosed by the end of January 2016.

A similar consolidation put more than 100 Guantanamo Bay detainee lawsuits under the management of one judge.

According to the Justice Department, some of the FOIA filers oppose the consolidation proposal.",0.53223228531897793
"Wonkblog: If Donald Trump followed this really basic advice, he’d be a lot richer",http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/09/03/if-donald-trump-followed-this-really-basic-advice-hed-be-a-lot-richer/?wprss=rss_business,washpo,"Real estate tycoon Donald Trump arrives on stage for the start of the Republican presidential debate on August 6 in Cleveland, Ohio. (MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images) Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner in next year's presidential primary, has been pitching voters on his experience in business. ""I'm running for office in a country that's essentially bankrupt, and it needs a successful businessman,"" he told Rolling Stone. Yet Trump has not done nearly as well as other American business magnates, or even a typical middle-class retiree following sound financial advice, as a review of the numbers over the past four decades shows. He is a billionaire today despite this poor performance because when he started his career, his father had already built a colossal real-estate empire. And the wealth Donald Trump has accumulated since then has at times come at the expense of taxpayers or the banks and investors who have lent him money. [Read more: A secret to Donald Trump’s success that you simply can’t replicate] Citing data from Forbes, The Associated Press estimates that Trump's net worth quadrupled from $1 billion to $4 billion between 1988 and today. That's an impressive gain, but it's nothing compared to the wealth produced by investors such as Warren Buffett and Bill Gates. Gates's wealth increased from about $1 billion to $80 billion over the same period. Buffett had about $2.5 billion in 1988, and has $68 billion today. Yet perhaps the most telling comparison is between Trump and his golf buddy, Richard LeFrak. The LeFraks and the Trumps have been rivals in New York's real estate business for generations. LeFrak's father, Samuel LeFrak, took a no-nonsense approach to the business. He focused on minimizing risk and making money, according to a 1992 profile in Business Week, before the magazine became Bloomberg Businessweek. ""He might be strutting around like a peacock today, but he's gonna be a feather duster tomorrow,"" the elder LeFrak told Business Week when asked about Trump. Over time, the LeFraks came out ahead of their competitors. LeFrak is worth $7 billion today, and he's 181st on Bloomberg's list of the world's richest people. Bloomberg puts Trump's wealth at just $2.9 billion -- far less than Forbes's estimate. He doesn't even make the list. The LeFraks are a family with long experience in a very competitive industry, but Trump's returns are less even than those of an ordinary investor saving for retirement. Experts on personal finance generally recommend that people saving for retirement or to pay for a child's college education buy and hold in index funds -- mutual funds that are invested in a wide range of stocks or bonds. The price of the funds will go up and down with the market, but over time, these investments will generate a reliable return as long as the investor avoids the temptation to sell in a financial panic. [Read more: It’s time to take a look at the index card with all the financial advice you’ll ever need] Citing an independent evaluation, Business Week put Trump's net worth at $100 million in 1978. Had Trump gotten out of real estate entirely, put his money in an index fund based on the S&P 500 and reinvested the dividends, he'd be worth twice as much -- $6 billion -- today, according to the calculator maintained by the blog Don't Quit Your Day Job. (In this scenario, Trump doesn't quit his day job. The calculation above does not include any allowance for living expenses, so if he had put all his money in index funds, he would have had to live off the dividends or find some other source of income.) Trump disputes the independent appraisals of his wealth by Forbes, Business Week (now Bloomberg) and others. He says he is worth about $10 billion today. Using Trump's preferred estimates of his wealth, he has still performed worse than our hypothetical Main Street retiree. He told The New York Times he was worth $200 million in 1976, an amount that would be worth $12 billion today. ""That a purely un­man­aged in­dex fund’s re­turn could out­per­form Trump’s hands-on wheel­ing and deal­ing calls in­to ques­tion one of Trump’s chief selling points on the cam­paign trail: his busi­ness acu­men,"" writes S.V. Dáte in National Journal. In a way, though, all of these comparisons are misleading. Donald Trump's father, Fred Trump, built his real-estate business on federal subsidies, as The Washington Post's Emily Badger has reported. Financing from Uncle Sam isn't available to the typical investor (although homeowners do benefit indirectly from federal subsidies and can deduct interest they pay on their mortgage from their tax bill). The younger Trump has continued that strategy, boasting about his ability to secure taxpayer dollars from local officials, as the Los Angeles Times has explained. [Read more: How Donald Trump abandoned his father's middle-class empire for luxury building] At other times, Trump has relied not on taxpayers but on banks and private concerns. Firms under his control have gone bankrupt on four occasions, but those catastrophes aren't fully reflected in Trump's net worth today, since his lenders absorbed the losses. The LeFraks, by contrast, have avoided imposing losses on their creditors, while still finding a way to turn a profit.
