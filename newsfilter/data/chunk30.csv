Larry Lessig hits the presidential campaign trail,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/03/larry-lessig-just-hit-the-presidential-campaign-trail/,washpo,"He's running. (Courtesy Lessig Equal Citizens Exploratory Committee) SALEM, N.H. -- Larry Lessig has been a Harvard Law professor, an author, an copyright innovator, and the leader of an anti-corruption ""super PAC to end super PACs."" On Wednesday night, he took on a new role: A potential candidate for president, taking a whack at a rival. Standing in an Italian restaurant's dining room, addressing two dozen local Democratic activists, Lessig argued that his Citizens Equality Amendment was the best weapon the party could take into the 2016 election. ""We have an extraordinary opportunity right now to claim a big idea that America can rally around,"" said Lessig, ""as opposed to the idea that everyone should have equal wealth. I agree with Bernie Sanders about that -- there is a terrible inequality in our society. But the reality is, in America, if you stand up and say we become Sweden, America is not going to rally around you. As much as I wish we would, that's not America. But if you stand up and say, citizens should be equal, who is on the other side of that?"" The crowd was not initially on his side. Lessig made a late, surprise entry into the presidential race, saying that he would run to become ""the first referendum president"" -- winning, passing his reform bill, then resigning -- if he raised $1 million by September 8. By the time he said that, a wave had already built behind the democratic socialist presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Sure, Lessig had literally walked through New Hampshire to raise awareness of campaign finance reform. In conversations, many of the Salem Democrats said they'd already gotten behind the Vermont senator. But Lessig, who said he had raised ""around $750,000"" of the needed Kickstarter funds, got a friendly reception. He showed up for his first New Hampshire event since the announcement in his standard traveling TED Talk outfit of black blazer, black pants and blue shirt, fiddled with a temperamental microphone, and got plenty of polite admiration. ""It was fun,"" said Cecilia Cassidy, 66. ""It was like a free lecture at Harvard Law School."" Lessig had a tougher time selling Democrats on the one-term pledge, especially as he praised everyone else running -- even Hillary Clinton. ""I think it's very promising, and it's very clear what his goals are,"" said Valerine Roman, 59. ""Whether he can actually run for president, I'm not sure. He would win, and then resign? I haven't lived my life to watch that sort of thing happen."" [Lawrence Lessig wants to run for president -- in a most unconventional way] Lessig spoke and took questions for an hour, and the topic rarely moved from campaign finance reform. A Monday trip to Ferguson, Missouri, taught Lessig that too many people were being ruined by petty fines, ""taxation by citation,"" and the lesson was that ""the people who pay the taxes are not effectively represented."" The almost-candidate cautioned Democrats not to blame all the ills of the system on the 2011 Citizens United decision. ""Democracy was already dead by then,"" Lessig said. ""The Supreme Court might have shot the body, but the body was already cold."" Everything came back to political money, and the failure of current candidates to address it before they addressed anything else. Lessig noted that former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley had issued a 15-point itinerary for a first presidential term, and ""campaign reform came in at number 15."" Exactly wrong, said Lessig. ""Bernie Sanders put it at number eight on his list,"" he added, ""and after we made our announcement it went to number two. Okay. That was a little better."" On the way into the speech, Lessig had noticed a Donald Trump bumper sticker on someone's car. The owner of the car, a man unironically wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" baseball cap, occasionally ambled over to the open dining room to hear what the fuss was about. ""I'll say this about Donald Trump,"" said Lessig. ""As much as I think his views about immigrants are vile -- immigrants are some of the hardest-working people in our country, and in my view they should be citizens -- and his views about women are outrageous; when he stands on the Republican debate stage and says 'I own you guys,' Republicans begin to acknowledge that this money is corrupting our democracy. That is progress. That is hopeful."" At 8 p.m., an hour after the presentation started, Lessig apologized -- he had to make a 9:30 train from Boston to New York. On the way to a car, accompanied by a single aide, Lessig gave a positive assessment of his audience, and said they'd proved Brookings Institution scholar Thomas Mann wrong. ""I thought that they were right there with every step,"" he said. ""They could see the value of talking about this in a more fundamental and elevated wall. Tom Mann says that what Donald Trump and I are doing is dumbing down this campaign -- I think I'm elevating it, getting out of this partisan squabble. The equality thing that Bernie Sanders is pushing -- I personally love it. But I don't think it's an idea that's going to resonate across America, the way this one will.""",0.99944993412300565
"Committee grills Clinton aides, ramps up email scrutiny",http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/hillary-clinton-bryan-pagliano-cheryl-mills/index.html,cnn,"Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton says her use of a private email server didn't break the law -- but she could be damaged by a former State Department employee's refusal to testify before Congress about it.

Two of Clinton's top State Department staffers, chief of staff Cheryl Mills and policy aide Jake Sullivan, are answering questions behind closed doors Thursday and Friday from the House's committee investigating Benghazi.

But Bryan Pagliano, who worked on Clinton's private email server, tried to fend off a subpoena by telling lawmakers Monday that he'll invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination rather testify.

In doing so, he raised the specter of criminal actions -- even if only out of caution.

That could create a fresh opening for Clinton's opponents in the 2016 presidential race to attack her, this time citing a former staffer's actions rather than leveling their own charges, like Donald Trump's suggestion that the controversy surrounding Clinton's emails could force the end of her campaign.

Clinton's aides sought to minimize the damage, saying they'd encouraged Pagliano to testify because he has nothing to hide.

RELATED: Former Clinton aide expected to plead the 5th

""We had hoped Bryan would also agree to answer any questions from the committee, and had recently encouraged him to grant the committee's request for an interview,"" a Clinton aide told CNN.

""Bryan is an utter professional and a wonderful young man who does not live in the public eye and understandably may not wish to be drawn into a political spectacle,"" the aide said. ""So his decision is both understandable and yet also disappointing to us, because we believe he has every reason to be transparent about his IT assistance.""

A Clinton aide said full cooperation has been encouraged with the Benghazi investigation.

""From the beginning, Hillary Clinton has continued to encourage cooperation even as the committee's inquiry has ventured beyond the events at Benghazi, which had been the original scope of its mandate, to also include her use of a personal email account,"" a Clinton aide said. ""Already, several of Clinton's senior-most aides from the State Department are scheduled to give interviews to the committee, as Clinton herself will do at an open hearing in October.""

Even without Pagliano's testimony, the House panel will hold several hearings connected to Clinton's private email server.

Mills is on Capitol Hill on Thursday, and Sullivan is due Friday. Both hearings are private -- a decision made by the committee's chairman, Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, despite Mills' request for hers to be made public amid fears that Republicans will selectively leak bits and pieces.

""We have not had a public interview with any other witness, and is there a myriad of reasons for that ... not the least of which is, if you're serious about getting the most amount of information, you're going to do it in a transcribed interview session not a public session,"" Gowdy told reporters Thursday outside the hearing room.

The committee's top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings, disagreed with Gowdy's decision and said he hoped that her entire transcript would be released immediately.

""This has turned into a derail Clinton mission,"" he said just outside the hearing room. ""$4 million in taxpayer money spent, and not looking at the issues we should be looking at.""

Clinton herself is due to answer the committee's questions publicly on October 22.

The contents of Clinton's emails have increasingly come into the committee's focus as it seeks evidence that members argue might have been deleted from a private server, but would have been maintained had Clinton used a government email account.

The committee's meetings with Clinton and her aides come as the Justice Department investigates whether Clinton's emails contained classified information -- and whether that information was kept secure.

Clinton has insisted she never sent or received information that was classified at the time -- though many of her emails have been classified retroactively as the State Department has prepared them for release.

Responding to dozens of open records requests, the department is releasing new batches of emails at the end of each month.

Before Clinton's emails are released, though, they are being reviewed by a team of about 12 inter-agency officials, who are making recommendations on what should and shouldn't be classified.

State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters in August that ""there's an exhaustive, extensive review process for each and every email, which includes not just State Department reviewers going through them but having intelligence community reviewers with us at the time as we go through them in real-time to help make determinations.

""Some of those determinations are fairly easy -- yes or no. Some of them require additional review and discussion,"" Kirby said.

Legion of Tech Volunteers Lead a Charge for Bernie Sanders,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/us/politics/bernie-sanders-presidential-campaign-tech-supporters.html,nyt,"Dawn crept into Daniela Perdomo’s Brooklyn apartment, her bleary eyes still focused on her bright computer screen. The founder of a nearly three-year-old communications start-up, she had been up all night again, orchestrating the work of more than 100 other developers, web designers, researchers and writers.

But they were not working for Ms. Perdomo’s company. They were not even getting paid. Instead, the all-night sessions were devoted to the Aug. 12 unveiling of FeeltheBern.org — a website they created to explain Bernie Sanders’s positions on issues in the 2016 presidential campaign.

Throughout the summer, a largely unseen legion of technology professionals across the country — software developers and designers, product managers and more — have been moonlighting online on Mr. Sanders’s behalf. They have been applying their initiative, creativity, organizational skills and, above all, technical prowess in their off hours to support an underdog candidate who has been more than grateful for the help.

They have built interactive maps of campaign events and are working on an automated flier generator to spit out polished promotional materials with a few clicks. They have set up an app to let volunteers and staff members at Mr. Sanders’s huge rallies use iPads to collect donations by swiping supporters’ credit cards. They have pioneered a tool to pair volunteers with lists of voters to call, automating what otherwise requires many paid campaign workers. And they have built dozens of websites for supporters of Mr. Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, like Ms. Perdomo’s FeeltheBern.org.

Like so many online minutemen, they have given Mr. Sanders an enormous lift in his campaign for the Democratic nomination. But this is no ragtag militia: The people who have enlisted include top-flight digital talent.

“It really blows me away,” Mr. Sanders said of the coders donating their services. “The volunteers we’ve mobilized all over this country, especially all the young people, are helping our campaign move to the next level.”

Indeed, while every political campaign relies on the enthusiasm of youthful volunteers, Mr. Sanders has quickly — and effortlessly — tapped into an unexpectedly large and capable cadre of computer jockeys with years and years of experience. They came forward of their own volition, with hundreds joining a Coders for Sanders thread on Reddit. And they organized themselves so thoroughly that one built an Internet “bot” to help match newcomers to tasks appropriate to their skills.

They are a diverse bunch, too: Ms. Perdomo said FeeltheBern.org grew to 125 volunteers “from every demographic I could imagine.” They include former aides to Mitt Romney, self-described libertarians, high school students (“Because I’m young, I can’t vote, so this is a great way to get involved,” said Justin Zheng, 14, of San Mateo, Calif.) and even an Australian programmer, Jordie Bodlay, who said that a Sanders administration would indirectly improve his own life in Sydney. Nearly everyone interviewed had never been politically involved before, and most cited Mr. Sanders’s views on issues like income inequality or his unconventional style of campaigning.

Most are younger than 35, members of the so-called millennial generation, one that has been dismissed at times as too focused on “hashtag activism,” lazily posting harangues on social media while shying away from the difficult work of organizing. But several who described themselves as introverted to begin with said the chance to do valuable political work from the sanctuary of their computers was irresistible.

“When the opportunity came along to do something I love doing anyway, to make a difference somewhere, I’ll always jump on that boat,” said Rob Pieta, 23, a mobile developer in Illinois.

Kenneth Pennington, the digital director for the Sanders campaign, said features like the donation app, which incorporates the Square credit card processing software, were “the kind of tech that other organizations would pay expensive app developers for.”

But Federal Election Commission regulations treat donated tech work like “the 21st-century equivalent of having volunteers build a stage for a campaign event,” said Brett G. Kappel, a partner at the law firm Akerman LLP and an expert on campaign law. “As long as the volunteers aren’t compensated for their services by anyone, their work is not considered an in-kind contribution.”

Other gifts to the Sanders campaign that could have cost tens of thousands of dollars on the open market include a custom interactive map of events and rallies, which wound up on the campaign website to promote a national organizing day and continues to be highlighted there.

“They asked, ‘What do you want for it?’ and I said, ‘Nothing,’ ” said Ralph Castillo, a software engineer from Queens who built the map over one weekend. “ ‘I just want my husband and me to meet Bernie.’ ”

The stampede of coders to Mr. Sanders’s aid can be traced to Kyle Pierce, a mobile software developer who, on a whim, created the Coders for Sanders thread on Reddit in June.

“I have a decent amount of free time, and I can put together a website in a few hours,” Mr. Pierce said. He said he was curious to see if he had much company. Within weeks, hundreds more had joined in.

Their buzzing nerve center is not on Reddit, though, but on Slack, an online chat program popular in the tech world, where the volunteers brainstorm at all hours, ask for help on projects, swap code and design mock-ups.

To help speed the integration of new volunteers, Atticus White, a 26-year-old developer from Boston, built a bot — an app programmed to respond to chat commands — that points users in the right direction. The tuxedo-avatared-app, @butler, begins a conversation with new arrivals (often peppered with an encouraging “Awesome” or “Great”) about their skills and points them toward suitable projects.

Slack is also the volunteers’ pipeline back to the campaign. Sanders aides check in regularly there, offering feedback, encouragement, requests and guidance, like asking those building the flier generator to make sure that union shops were hired to do the printing. Aides also ask that new sites be designed differently from the campaign’s own and include disclaimers saying they have no official tie to Mr. Sanders.

Unaffiliated or not, builders of those websites are free to amplify on Mr. Sanders’s campaign message: “We’re regular people, unassociated with any super PACs or billionaires,” says the fine print at FeeltheBern.org.

Ms. Perdomo said she had been spurred to seek out coders who shared her admiration for Mr. Sanders after she contributed to his campaign and was laughed at. “I was telling friends that I donated this money and they should do it, too, and I got a bunch of L.O.L.’s back saying, ‘He’s great and everything, but I don’t see it happening,’ ” she said.

Her website had more than a million page views in its first two weeks.

As their projects take off, or become absorbed by the Sanders campaign, the coders keep coming back for more. The volunteers who worked with Ms. Perdomo, for example, now are putting together a message board to help people car-pool to campaign events.

“There were too many nights when I would go to sleep with the sun coming up, and I felt like a zombie and would question my sanity,” Ms. Perdomo said with a laugh. “But now, it’s so worth it.”",0.99714927310130486
