"Officer who shot two unarmed black men won't face criminal charges, prosecutor says",http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/09/03/officer-who-shot-two-unarmed-black-men-wont-face-criminal-charges-prosecutor-says/,washpo,"A protester holds a sign that reads “Justice 4 Andre and Bryson!” as a police car drives past Olympia City Hall on Wednesday. (Ted S. Warren/AP file) A white police officer who shot and wounded two unarmed black men in Olympia, Wash., earlier this year will not face criminal charges, according to a prosecutor who has said that the officer’s actions were justified. Ryan Donald, of the Olympia Police Department, shot stepbrothers Bryson Chaplin and Andre Thompson while responding to an early-morning call on May 21 that the pair had tried to shoplift beer and then threw beer bottles at a grocery store employee. Donald, 35, said he struggled with the stepbrothers and opened fire in self-defense. Chaplin, 21, was paralyzed from the waist down after the shooting, according to the Seattle Times. “Officer Donald indicated that his primary fear was that his handgun could be taken away from him and used against him, and I find that that was reasonable under the circumstances,” Thurston County Prosecutor Jon Tunheim told reporters at a Wednesday news conference, according to Seattle NBC affiliate KING. Olympia Police Chief Ronnie Roberts acknowledged that the May shooting  — and the decision not to criminally charge Donald — came amid an ongoing national debate over police brutality and race. Roberts said Wednesday in a statement that the “issues of bias, power, privilege and race are challenging communities across this nation.” [Analysis: Fatal shootings by on-duty police officers] But earlier this year, the chief said there was “no indication to me that race was a factor in this case at all.” Roberts said Wednesday that his department will conduct its own internal review over the next couple weeks. Chaplin, 21, and Thompson, 23, have been charged with assault; the stepbrothers are scheduled to appear in court Sept. 22. Donald’s attorney told the Olympian that the office “reacted as one might expect” to the news that he won’t face criminal charges. “He’s really happy, and he’s looking forward to this all being over,” Saxon Rogers said. Rodgers added to the newspaper that he and Donald haven’t ruled out the possibility of a civil suit filed by Chaplin and Thompson. “It they do, they’ll lose,” Rodgers told the newspaper. “Just look at the evidence.” [Police shooting of two unarmed black men accused of stealing beer prompts protests] An employee at Westside Safeway called 911 at about 1 a.m. on the morning of the shooting to report an attempted theft and assault. Surveillance footage from the store showed the men walking out with a case of Corona and, when confronted, hurling the bottles at the employee’s feet on their way out the door. Donald responded to the call and later told investigators that he spotted Chaplin and Thompson, who matched the description from the store employee. When he confronted them near the store, one of the stepbrothers grabbed Donald’s shirt sleeve to pull him to the ground, he said, and the other tried to hit him with a skateboard. Donald said he then pulled his gun and opened fire, striking one of them before the two men fled into some nearby woods. Donald said he reloaded his weapon and waited for backup. The officer said the men then reappeared and moved toward him in a hostile manner. He said he ordered them to get down on the ground — and, when they continued, he opened fire again, striking both men. Donald called dispatchers, saying the men were “aggressive” and had “assaulted me with a skateboard.” Both men to rushed to nearby hospitals. Later that morning, hundreds of protesters flooded Olympia’s city hall, marching with “Black Lives Matter” signs and chanting: “No justice, no peace.” Olympia Mayor Stephen Buxbaum pleaded with community members to remain patient — and peaceful — during the formal investigation. “It deeply saddens me that we have two young people in the hospital as a result of an altercation with an officer of the law,” Buxbaum said at the time. “Let’s come together to support their needs, the officer’s needs, the needs of the families and our community’s needs. Let’s not be reactive.” [Ex-S.C. police chief charged with killing black man pleads guilty, will serve no time] The uproar resumed Wednesday, after Tunheim said that Donald had not broken the law because he was “acting without malice” and had a “good faith fear” when he opened fire earlier this year. Noting the skateboard attack, Tunheim said: “I believe [Donald] was at risk of being seriously injured.” David Beninger, an attorney for the stepbrothers, has said previously that “there wasn’t an assault with the skateboard.” Beninger did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Near the end of the police chief’s conference at City Hall, demonstrators broke into chants of “Fire Officer Donald!” “This has been a difficult few months for the community and the Olympia Police Department,” Roberts said, according to the Olympian. He added: “We recognize there are members of the public that feel vulnerable and distrust the police. We are committed to improving those relationships.” Caro Gonazles, center, and Rafael Ruiz, right, shout “Fire Officer Donald!” at the end of a police press conference Wednesday. (Ted S.

The PGA had been looking for a replacement golf course with suitable dates. But on Thursday the PGA announced it would cancel the event because of the timing and logistics required to stage the exhibition at the ""highest standards.""

Titans DB McCourty: Dorial Green-Bechkam is 'a beast',http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/sports/~3/-rYtr4FaDZo/,fox,"By Jesse Reed

Tennessee Titans rookie receiver Dorial Green-Beckham has impressed his teammates this summer.

Green-Beckham wowed NFL scouts this past winter during the draft process with his combination of size, crazy athleticism and soft hands. After spending the past few months watching the rookie work during practice, his own teammates are now in awe of Green-Beckham's abilities on the field.

""He is a beast,"" cornerback Jason McCourty said of Green-Beckham, via the team's official website. ""There's certain things you can't teach, and you can't teach a guy to be that big, and to be physical. With Dorial, it's just a matter of how fast can he learn it, and know it, so he can just go out there and play football. If he can get to the point where he can run free and be comfortable, he'll really start to develop more.""

The rookie has struggled to stay on the practice field for the Titans with a slew of minor injuries. If he can stay healthy, then he and fellow rookie Marcus Mariota will develop into one of the most exciting young quarterback/receiver duos in the NFL.

During his tenure at Missouri, Green-Beckham put up big-time numbers before off-field troubles got him kicked out of the program. He caught 59 passes for 883 yards (15 yards per reception) and 12 touchdowns in his sophomore season, showing off incredible athleticism to go along with his prototypical size.

At 6-foot-5 and 237 pounds, Green-Beckham towers over defensive backs -- no matter how big they are. College football has yet to begin manufacturing 6-foot-5 cornerbacks, and it's not likely we'll see any secondary defenders who fit this description any time soon.

As a rookie, Green-Beckham should find immediate success as a red-zone threat, given his size and given the fact that Mariota is one of the most accurate passers to come out of college in a long, long time. Once the talented receiver masters the subtle art of route-running (assuming it does happen), it's going to be awfully fun to watch him dominate all over the field -- not just in the red zone.

Explaining a remarkable view of Tropical Storm Fred,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2015/09/03/explaining-a-remarkable-view-of-tropical-storm-fred/,washpo,"Seldom does a two-dimensional image of a storm reveal so much about its three-dimensional structure. In this striking satellite image of Tropical Storm Fred from Thursday morning, you see the characteristic low-level swirl of clouds associated with Tropical Storm Fred. But you’re eye is also drawn to single thunderstorm exploding over the center, with its icy anvil whisked off to the east by strong upper-level winds. Thanks to the low sun angle near sunrise, the towering thunderstorm casts a shadow on the swirling clouds below – allowing us to see its high altitude and low altitude structure simultaneously. Tropical Storm Fred has defied the forecasts that predicted it to dissipate by Wednesday morning.  The ocean temperature under the storm is 79 degrees (26 Celsius) – just warm enough to sustain it. There is still some thunderstorm activity over the center and satellites have measured winds of minimal tropical storm intensity. But it’s in a hostile zone of 40 mph wind shear and mid-level relative humidity of just 40 percent. Surface wind vectors from the ASCAT scatterometer. These data are from early Wednesday morning.

New England's fall colors expected to be 'patchy',http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/nZXZImRCtas/,fox,"Money really will grow on trees in New England this fall, as millions of “leaf peepers” flock to the region to view its colorful foliage and inject billions of tourism dollars into local and state economies.

Vermont’s 3.5 million foliage tourists spend about $460,000 — a quarter of the overall annual visitor spending — during the six-week foliage season, according to the Vermont Department of Tourism and Marketing. The haul is even bigger in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, where state officials estimate that combined visitor-spending totals more than $4.6 billion during foliage season.

“You can’t get great foliage without a good setup in spring or summer. This year the setup is not terrible, but it’s also not ideal.”

- Jim Salge, foliage expert, Yankee magazine

But just having exceptional foliage is not enough. All the New England states — Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island — invest in foliage marketing, and some create special apps and websites.

This year Vermont is spending $280,000 to advertise its “World’s Best Foliage” campaign, and the state’s tourism website, VermontVacation.com, will provide weekly foliage reports, best bets for driving tours and a foliage tracker.

Leaf peeping is akin to a sport in New England, and no two seasons are alike.

“To get really vibrant colors, we need a great setup,” said Jim Salge, foliage expert at Yankee magazine. “We need a nice, reasonably mild, reasonably rainy spring. We need a summer that has ample rainfall. And the biggest factor is a fall season that has a lot of sunshine, warm days and cool nights.

 “The nice thing about New England is that’s what is normal. So in an average year in New England, we get pretty spectacular foliage.”

Still, nobody knows for sure where and when the colors will peak. “Predicting fall’s color changes is part science and part luck,” said Michael Snyder, commissioner of Vermont’s Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation. “We know the science of color change and the factors that influence it, but we don’t know exactly how it will unfold in any given year. The good news is, our foliage is like a day on the slopes — when it’s good, it’s great. And even when it’s a bit off, it’s still really good.”

So what’s the forecast this year? “I’m expecting that it’s going to be patchy,” said Salge. “You can’t get great foliage without a good setup in spring or summer. This year the setup is not terrible, but it’s also not ideal.”

“Much of New England had a really dry spring, and then we had variable rainfall this summer,” he said. “Some areas have gotten rainfall that’s well above normal, and we have some areas where rainfall has been below normal. Some places are still running a huge deficit for rainfall, while 10 miles away they are right on target or ahead. So it’s going to be a patchy year.”

Want to maximize your chances of finding the best fall colors? Follow these tips:

• Time it right. Hitting the colors at their peak is a crapshoot, but you can up your chances. “If people give themselves a nice window in early October in the northern part of New England or mid- to late October in the southern part of New England, they’ll be perfectly fine — this year or any year,” Salge said.

• Be flexible. “It’s only a half a day’s drive from the earliest peak to the latest peak in New England,” Salge said. “So if you have the ability to get in a car, and some flexibility in your plans, you can find the peak.”

• Follow the crowd. Classic foliage routes include Route 7 in Vermont, coast road U.S. Hwy. 1 in Maine, Kancamagus Highway in New Hampshire and Route 2 through the Pioneer Valley in Massachusetts.

• Get off the beaten path. “Really, there’s great foliage everywhere, as well as fine country stores and great New England farms,” said Salge. “That’s why people come here; there’s something for everybody and it’s really easy to do.”

• Download Yankee Magazine’s free LeafPeepr app, which uses crowdsourced foliage reports to tell you where color is about to peak, at peak or past peak.Suzanne Rowan Kelleher is the family vacations expert at About.com.",0.32177496462944832
Trump to sign Republican loyalty pledge,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/09/03/trump-to-sign-republican-loyalty-pledge/,washpo,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at the National Federation of Republican Assemblies on Saturday, Aug. 29, 2015, in Nashville, Tenn. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey) Donald Trump will pledge to support the Republican presidential nominee in the general election on Thursday afternoon, effectively ruling out a third-party bid, the Post’s Robert  Costa reports. The move will calm some nerves within the GOP about Trump’s unusual approach to campaigning for the White House, if only temporarily. As the party’s current 2016 frontrunner, Trump has defied expectations and continues to experience a healthy polling lead over his rivals despite a series of controversial remarks that might sink a more traditional candidate. Whether Trump will abide by the pledge is another question, and his trustworthiness on the matter was greeted by skepticism Thursday. Here’s how Costa described his decision: The promise, which Trump has long avoided making, brings him closer to a party whose rank-and-file activists he has thrilled this summer but whose leadership has at times viewed his rapid ascent with alarm, especially the prospect of an outside bid that could siphon away votes from the eventual standard-bearer. The Republicans familiar with Trump’s decision requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. They also said that Trump may have caveats or conditions upon signing that have not yet been shared beyond the businessman’s tight-knit inner circle. These Republicans said that even as Trump wants to be a team player and plans to abide by the pledge, his priority is to be treated with he often refers to as “respect” by the national GOP. If that relationship should ever sour, he could consider changing his mind.",0.9999525277753315

Donald Trump has responded to a newspaper column accusing him of bullying and insulting the media -- by personally insulting the writer.

That's the charge from none other than basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who penned a column for the Washington Post on Wednesday that caught the attention of the GOP candidate.

In his column, Abdul-Jabbar criticized what he portrayed as Trump's disregard for the media's First Amendment rights, and cited a series of incidents involving Fox News' Megyn Kelly, Univision anchor Jorge Ramos and the Des Moines Register newspaper.

Later Wednesday, Abdul-Jabbar, who in the years since his retirement as the NBA's all-time leading scorer and six-time MVP has become a bestselling author and frequent columnist on social and political issues, published a note he said he got from Trump.

It reads: ""Now I know why the press always treated you so badly -- they couldn't stand you. The fact is that you don't have a clue about life and what has to be done to make America great again! Best wishes, Donald Trump.""
