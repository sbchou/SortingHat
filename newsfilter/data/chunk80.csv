"Officer who shot two unarmed black men won&#8217;t face criminal charges, prosecutor says",http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/09/03/officer-who-shot-two-unarmed-black-men-wont-face-criminal-charges-prosecutor-says/,washpo,"A protester holds a sign that reads “Justice 4 Andre and Bryson!” as a police car drives past Olympia City Hall on Wednesday. (Ted S. Warren/AP file) A white police officer who shot and wounded two unarmed black men in Olympia, Wash., earlier this year will not face criminal charges, according to a prosecutor who has said that the officer’s actions were justified. Ryan Donald, of the Olympia Police Department, shot stepbrothers Bryson Chaplin and Andre Thompson while responding to an early-morning call on May 21 that the pair had tried to shoplift beer and then threw beer bottles at a grocery store employee. Donald, 35, said he struggled with the stepbrothers and opened fire in self-defense. Chaplin, 21, was paralyzed from the waist down after the shooting, according to the Seattle Times. “Officer Donald indicated that his primary fear was that his handgun could be taken away from him and used against him, and I find that that was reasonable under the circumstances,” Thurston County Prosecutor Jon Tunheim told reporters at a Wednesday news conference, according to Seattle NBC affiliate KING. Olympia Police Chief Ronnie Roberts acknowledged that the May shooting  — and the decision not to criminally charge Donald — came amid an ongoing national debate over police brutality and race. Roberts said Wednesday in a statement that the “issues of bias, power, privilege and race are challenging communities across this nation.” [Analysis: Fatal shootings by on-duty police officers] But earlier this year, the chief said there was “no indication to me that race was a factor in this case at all.” Roberts said Wednesday that his department will conduct its own internal review over the next couple weeks. Chaplin, 21, and Thompson, 23, have been charged with assault; the stepbrothers are scheduled to appear in court Sept. 22. Donald’s attorney told the Olympian that the office “reacted as one might expect” to the news that he won’t face criminal charges. “He’s really happy, and he’s looking forward to this all being over,” Saxon Rogers said. Rodgers added to the newspaper that he and Donald haven’t ruled out the possibility of a civil suit filed by Chaplin and Thompson. “It they do, they’ll lose,” Rodgers told the newspaper. “Just look at the evidence.” [Police shooting of two unarmed black men accused of stealing beer prompts protests] An employee at Westside Safeway called 911 at about 1 a.m. on the morning of the shooting to report an attempted theft and assault. Surveillance footage from the store showed the men walking out with a case of Corona and, when confronted, hurling the bottles at the employee’s feet on their way out the door. Donald responded to the call and later told investigators that he spotted Chaplin and Thompson, who matched the description from the store employee. When he confronted them near the store, one of the stepbrothers grabbed Donald’s shirt sleeve to pull him to the ground, he said, and the other tried to hit him with a skateboard. Donald said he then pulled his gun and opened fire, striking one of them before the two men fled into some nearby woods. Donald said he reloaded his weapon and waited for backup. The officer said the men then reappeared and moved toward him in a hostile manner. He said he ordered them to get down on the ground — and, when they continued, he opened fire again, striking both men. Donald called dispatchers, saying the men were “aggressive” and had “assaulted me with a skateboard.” Both men to rushed to nearby hospitals. Later that morning, hundreds of protesters flooded Olympia’s city hall, marching with “Black Lives Matter” signs and chanting: “No justice, no peace.” Olympia Mayor Stephen Buxbaum pleaded with community members to remain patient — and peaceful — during the formal investigation. “It deeply saddens me that we have two young people in the hospital as a result of an altercation with an officer of the law,” Buxbaum said at the time. “Let’s come together to support their needs, the officer’s needs, the needs of the families and our community’s needs. Let’s not be reactive.” [Ex-S.C. police chief charged with killing black man pleads guilty, will serve no time] The uproar resumed Wednesday, after Tunheim said that Donald had not broken the law because he was “acting without malice” and had a “good faith fear” when he opened fire earlier this year. Noting the skateboard attack, Tunheim said: “I believe [Donald] was at risk of being seriously injured.” David Beninger, an attorney for the stepbrothers, has said previously that “there wasn’t an assault with the skateboard.” Beninger did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Near the end of the police chief’s conference at City Hall, demonstrators broke into chants of “Fire Officer Donald!” “This has been a difficult few months for the community and the Olympia Police Department,” Roberts said, according to the Olympian. He added: “We recognize there are members of the public that feel vulnerable and distrust the police. We are committed to improving those relationships.” Caro Gonazles, center, and Rafael Ruiz, right, shout “Fire Officer Donald!” at the end of a police press conference Wednesday. (Ted S.

Titans DB McCourty: Dorial Green-Bechkam is 'a beast',http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/sports/~3/-rYtr4FaDZo/,fox,"By Jesse Reed

Tennessee Titans rookie receiver Dorial Green-Beckham has impressed his teammates this summer.

Green-Beckham wowed NFL scouts this past winter during the draft process with his combination of size, crazy athleticism and soft hands. After spending the past few months watching the rookie work during practice, his own teammates are now in awe of Green-Beckham's abilities on the field.

""He is a beast,"" cornerback Jason McCourty said of Green-Beckham, via the team's official website. ""There's certain things you can't teach, and you can't teach a guy to be that big, and to be physical. With Dorial, it's just a matter of how fast can he learn it, and know it, so he can just go out there and play football. If he can get to the point where he can run free and be comfortable, he'll really start to develop more.""

The rookie has struggled to stay on the practice field for the Titans with a slew of minor injuries. If he can stay healthy, then he and fellow rookie Marcus Mariota will develop into one of the most exciting young quarterback/receiver duos in the NFL.

During his tenure at Missouri, Green-Beckham put up big-time numbers before off-field troubles got him kicked out of the program. He caught 59 passes for 883 yards (15 yards per reception) and 12 touchdowns in his sophomore season, showing off incredible athleticism to go along with his prototypical size.

At 6-foot-5 and 237 pounds, Green-Beckham towers over defensive backs -- no matter how big they are. College football has yet to begin manufacturing 6-foot-5 cornerbacks, and it's not likely we'll see any secondary defenders who fit this description any time soon.

As a rookie, Green-Beckham should find immediate success as a red-zone threat, given his size and given the fact that Mariota is one of the most accurate passers to come out of college in a long, long time. Once the talented receiver masters the subtle art of route-running (assuming it does happen), it's going to be awfully fun to watch him dominate all over the field -- not just in the red zone.

New England's fall colors expected to be 'patchy',http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/nZXZImRCtas/,fox,"Money really will grow on trees in New England this fall, as millions of “leaf peepers” flock to the region to view its colorful foliage and inject billions of tourism dollars into local and state economies.

Vermont’s 3.5 million foliage tourists spend about $460,000 — a quarter of the overall annual visitor spending — during the six-week foliage season, according to the Vermont Department of Tourism and Marketing. The haul is even bigger in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, where state officials estimate that combined visitor-spending totals more than $4.6 billion during foliage season.

“You can’t get great foliage without a good setup in spring or summer. This year the setup is not terrible, but it’s also not ideal.”

- Jim Salge, foliage expert, Yankee magazine

But just having exceptional foliage is not enough. All the New England states — Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island — invest in foliage marketing, and some create special apps and websites.

This year Vermont is spending $280,000 to advertise its “World’s Best Foliage” campaign, and the state’s tourism website, VermontVacation.com, will provide weekly foliage reports, best bets for driving tours and a foliage tracker.

Leaf peeping is akin to a sport in New England, and no two seasons are alike.

“To get really vibrant colors, we need a great setup,” said Jim Salge, foliage expert at Yankee magazine. “We need a nice, reasonably mild, reasonably rainy spring. We need a summer that has ample rainfall. And the biggest factor is a fall season that has a lot of sunshine, warm days and cool nights.

 “The nice thing about New England is that’s what is normal. So in an average year in New England, we get pretty spectacular foliage.”

Still, nobody knows for sure where and when the colors will peak. “Predicting fall’s color changes is part science and part luck,” said Michael Snyder, commissioner of Vermont’s Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation. “We know the science of color change and the factors that influence it, but we don’t know exactly how it will unfold in any given year. The good news is, our foliage is like a day on the slopes — when it’s good, it’s great. And even when it’s a bit off, it’s still really good.”

So what’s the forecast this year? “I’m expecting that it’s going to be patchy,” said Salge. “You can’t get great foliage without a good setup in spring or summer. This year the setup is not terrible, but it’s also not ideal.”

“Much of New England had a really dry spring, and then we had variable rainfall this summer,” he said. “Some areas have gotten rainfall that’s well above normal, and we have some areas where rainfall has been below normal. Some places are still running a huge deficit for rainfall, while 10 miles away they are right on target or ahead. So it’s going to be a patchy year.”

Want to maximize your chances of finding the best fall colors? Follow these tips:

• Time it right. Hitting the colors at their peak is a crapshoot, but you can up your chances. “If people give themselves a nice window in early October in the northern part of New England or mid- to late October in the southern part of New England, they’ll be perfectly fine — this year or any year,” Salge said.

• Be flexible. “It’s only a half a day’s drive from the earliest peak to the latest peak in New England,” Salge said. “So if you have the ability to get in a car, and some flexibility in your plans, you can find the peak.”

• Follow the crowd. Classic foliage routes include Route 7 in Vermont, coast road U.S. Hwy. 1 in Maine, Kancamagus Highway in New Hampshire and Route 2 through the Pioneer Valley in Massachusetts.

• Get off the beaten path. “Really, there’s great foliage everywhere, as well as fine country stores and great New England farms,” said Salge. “That’s why people come here; there’s something for everybody and it’s really easy to do.”

• Download Yankee Magazine’s free LeafPeepr app, which uses crowdsourced foliage reports to tell you where color is about to peak, at peak or past peak.Suzanne Rowan Kelleher is the family vacations expert at About.com.",0.32177496462944832
Trump to sign Republican loyalty pledge,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/09/03/trump-to-sign-republican-loyalty-pledge/,washpo,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at the National Federation of Republican Assemblies on Saturday, Aug. 29, 2015, in Nashville, Tenn. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey) Donald Trump will pledge to support the Republican presidential nominee in the general election on Thursday afternoon, effectively ruling out a third-party bid, the Post’s Robert  Costa reports. The move will calm some nerves within the GOP about Trump’s unusual approach to campaigning for the White House, if only temporarily. As the party’s current 2016 frontrunner, Trump has defied expectations and continues to experience a healthy polling lead over his rivals despite a series of controversial remarks that might sink a more traditional candidate. Whether Trump will abide by the pledge is another question, and his trustworthiness on the matter was greeted by skepticism Thursday. Here’s how Costa described his decision: The promise, which Trump has long avoided making, brings him closer to a party whose rank-and-file activists he has thrilled this summer but whose leadership has at times viewed his rapid ascent with alarm, especially the prospect of an outside bid that could siphon away votes from the eventual standard-bearer. The Republicans familiar with Trump’s decision requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. They also said that Trump may have caveats or conditions upon signing that have not yet been shared beyond the businessman’s tight-knit inner circle. These Republicans said that even as Trump wants to be a team player and plans to abide by the pledge, his priority is to be treated with he often refers to as “respect” by the national GOP. If that relationship should ever sour, he could consider changing his mind.",0.9999525277753315

Donald Trump has responded to a newspaper column accusing him of bullying and insulting the media -- by personally insulting the writer.

That's the charge from none other than basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who penned a column for the Washington Post on Wednesday that caught the attention of the GOP candidate.

In his column, Abdul-Jabbar criticized what he portrayed as Trump's disregard for the media's First Amendment rights, and cited a series of incidents involving Fox News' Megyn Kelly, Univision anchor Jorge Ramos and the Des Moines Register newspaper.

Later Wednesday, Abdul-Jabbar, who in the years since his retirement as the NBA's all-time leading scorer and six-time MVP has become a bestselling author and frequent columnist on social and political issues, published a note he said he got from Trump.

It reads: ""Now I know why the press always treated you so badly -- they couldn't stand you. The fact is that you don't have a clue about life and what has to be done to make America great again! Best wishes, Donald Trump.""

Six Democratic Party debates are enough,http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/opinions/fowler-democratic-debates/index.html,cnn,"Donald L. Fowler, who served as the Democratic National Committee Chair from 1995 to 1997, is a political science professor at the University of South Carolina and founder of Fowler Communications. He is a current Democratic National Committee member and a member of the Rules and Bylaws Committee. The opinion expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN)Five months before the Iowa Caucus, and nearly 15 months before Election Day, excitement for the 2016 election is building among Democratic activists.

I'm not sure we could have imagined better motivation than seeing Donald Trump sitting atop the Republican polls, trailed by the prospect of yet another President Bush. It seems to have been the kick in the pants Democrats needed to get off the couch and get to work defending the considerable achievements of President Obama's time in office, especially considering the party's lackluster performance during the 2014 midterms.

At the moment, that excitement has manifested as concern over the rules governing how the Democratic Party will choose our next presidential nominee. We need to ensure that we nominate a candidate who is prepared for the rigors of a campaign, not to mention holding the highest office in the land. Thankfully, I see five such qualified candidates on the Democratic side, and potentially a few more, while I've yet to see one among the 15 or 20 Republicans vying for their nomination.

So while I understand the concerns that some Democrats have expressed concerning the debate schedule, I wholeheartedly agree with the schedule as currently structured. This schedule is best for our candidates, our supporters, and for voters. Most importantly, I believe that it puts Democrats in the best possible position to win in November 2016 with a tested nominee, operating from a position of strength.

As a former DNC chair, I'm familiar with the guiding principles that are taken into consideration when creating a debate schedule.

The goal is to set a reasonable number of debates that maximizes voters' opportunity to see the candidates side by side, while remaining manageable for all of the participants. To be clear, I haven't always seen the Democratic Party do this. Since my time as chair, several cycles have turned into unruly and out-of-control situations more hurtful than beneficial to our party.

Six debates provide multiple opportunities for voters to hear our candidates share their visions for our country's future. They also provide multiple opportunities for our candidates to engage in a rigorous discussion. But this discussion occurs not only with each other, but also with the American people. A pace of one debate per month gives candidates plenty of opportunities to engage voters at rallies, town halls, house meetings, forums, and other campaign events.

Voters need opportunities to hear the policy positions of our candidates without the constraints of a clock or the artificial limitations of a debate stage. Nobody wants our candidates focused solely on debates and debate prep at the exclusion of chances to interact directly with voters.

Another consideration is the importance of holding debates when voters are actually paying attention. Did you know that the first Republican primary debate of the 2012 election was in May 2011? Unless you're Tim Pawlenty or Gary Johnson (who participated in the debate, unlike Mitt Romney), you probably don't remember it.

Fall of 2015 was always the ideal window to begin the debate schedule, and October 13 fits squarely into this principle. And with each of the six sanctioned debates sponsored by a combination of state Democratic Parties, national media, digital platforms, local media, and civic organizations, these debates will be appealing and accessible to voters. These debates will reflect our party's -- and our country's -- diversity. They will include the first ever party-sanctioned Univision debate, especially important to our Hispanic citizens.

Debate negotiations rarely lead to all sides getting exactly what they want -- that's why they're called negotiations. But this is a schedule that meets the fundamental principles that guided the process and will benefit the Democratic Party.

Six DNC-sanctioned debates are in line with the precedent set during the 2004 and 2008 election cycles.

You probably recall a seemingly endless series of debates, including many non-DNC sanctioned ones, in those years, which I think has contributed to the confusion surrounding this year's schedule.

In fact, the reason the DNC is enforcing an ""exclusivity requirement,"" where candidates are barred from participating in non-DNC sanctioned debates under penalty of losing their access to the sanctioned and nationally televised debates, this cycle is so that we can avoid a repeat of what happened in cycles past. In both 2004 and 2008, a lack of enforcement led to more than 20 debates. This confused voters and overwhelmed our candidates, and was an experience no one had any interest in repeating.

As much as I love politics, even I don't really want to watch 20 Democratic and 20 Republican primary debates between now and March. Limiting the number should make it likely that more viewers will watch, and help our message break through.

It's worth noting that in recent election cycles, the general election has featured three debates between the parties' presidential nominees and one contest between the potential vice presidents. No one contends that three or four debates are insufficient for voters to distinguish the differences between the candidates. It is understood that the majority of campaigning will be conducted outside the debate arena, among the other events and opportunities for candidates to interact with and engage voters. This schedule enhances our candidates' ability to do that.

During the DNC's Summer Meeting, one of our outstanding candidates, Gov. Martin O'Malley reminded us that we as Democrats cannot remain silent in the face of Republican lies, Republican misogyny, Republican distortions about our President, and Republican disdain for our neighbors.

He was absolutely right.

But I hope that Democrats aren't waiting for a debate stage or a convention or a presidential nominee to speak up. Because all of us have a responsibility, each and every day, through our words and our actions, to show the American people that it is the Democratic Party that is on their side, championing their well-being.

I'm proud that our presidential candidates have spoken up to call out hateful rhetoric from Donald Trump and Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, and to hold Republicans accountable for their outdated and out-of-touch policies. And I'm proud that our party leaders, elected officials, activists, supporters, and volunteers have done the same. I expect that each of them will continue to remind people what it means to be a Democrat, using every platform they have to keep fighting for middle-class families.

That's why I'm encouraged by the debate over the debates. It's an indication that Democrats are engaged in the political process, moving past the complacency that plagued us in 2010 and 2014.

The current schedule was structured to put the Democratic nominee, whoever it eventually is, in the best position to win next November. I expect that our candidates will participate in the DNC-sanctioned debates, and capitalize on the numerous other opportunities that exist to interact with voters on the campaign trail.

And Democratic activists will channel their energy into what we do best: knocking on doors, making phone calls, registering and educating new voters, and relying on the strength of our grassroots supporters to win in 2016.

“As we continue to see the prospect of El Nino becoming one of the strongest in decades, more and more impacts will be apparent around the world,"" Steve Bowen, associate director of Aon Benfield's catastrophe modeling team and meteorologist, said in a statement.

The current El Nino weather phenomenon is expected to peak between October and January and could turn into one of the strongest on record, experts from the World Meteorological Organisation said this week. [ID:nL5N1172KW]

Experts work to save pair of melon-headed whales found struggling in waters near Gulfport,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/national/~3/jB-4AqShEss/,fox,"GULFPORT, Miss. –  Marine experts in Mississippi are working around the clock as two whales, their species unseen in South Mississippi for 40 years, fight for survival.

Moby Solangi of the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Gulfport says a fisherman Tuesday reported what he thought were two dead dolphins on the beach. Solangi tells The Sun Herald (http://bit.ly/1iiIIM1 ) when rescue teams arrived, they discovered not only were they not dead, they were not dolphins.

Solangi says the mammals are two melon-headed whales, a species native to deep waters near Hawaii. He says the whales are in critical condition — severely dehydrated, disoriented and unable to swim on their own. One also is suffering from a shark bite.

The team won't know what is ailing the whales until blood tests are completed.

State Department tries to corral e-mail FOIA cases,http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/crime/article33701748.html,mcclatchy,"Facing more than 30 Freedom of Information Act lawsuits over State Department e-mails, the Obama administration this week formally asked federal judges to consolidate all the cases in one court.

In filings dated Sept. 2, Justice Department attorneys said one judge could better coordinate the myriad FOIA cases.

“Different judges are being asked to impose a variety of search regimes, resulting in a hodgepodge of orders directing how State manages the search and production of the emails,” the Justice Department stated. “The result is confusion, inefficiencies, and advantages given to some requesters at the expense of others.”

FOIA lawsuits over the State Department’s e-mails are currently spread among 17 different federal judges. The multiple lawsuits, the Justice Department noted, tap into the trove of Hillary Clinton e-mails that are supposed to be fully disclosed by the end of January 2016.

A similar consolidation put more than 100 Guantanamo Bay detainee lawsuits under the management of one judge.

According to the Justice Department, some of the FOIA filers oppose the consolidation proposal.",0.53223228531897793
"Wonkblog: If Donald Trump followed this really basic advice, he’d be a lot richer",http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/09/03/if-donald-trump-followed-this-really-basic-advice-hed-be-a-lot-richer/?wprss=rss_business,washpo,"Real estate tycoon Donald Trump arrives on stage for the start of the Republican presidential debate on August 6 in Cleveland, Ohio. (MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images) Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner in next year's presidential primary, has been pitching voters on his experience in business. ""I'm running for office in a country that's essentially bankrupt, and it needs a successful businessman,"" he told Rolling Stone. Yet Trump has not done nearly as well as other American business magnates, or even a typical middle-class retiree following sound financial advice, as a review of the numbers over the past four decades shows. He is a billionaire today despite this poor performance because when he started his career, his father had already built a colossal real-estate empire. And the wealth Donald Trump has accumulated since then has at times come at the expense of taxpayers or the banks and investors who have lent him money. [Read more: A secret to Donald Trump’s success that you simply can’t replicate] Citing data from Forbes, The Associated Press estimates that Trump's net worth quadrupled from $1 billion to $4 billion between 1988 and today. That's an impressive gain, but it's nothing compared to the wealth produced by investors such as Warren Buffett and Bill Gates. Gates's wealth increased from about $1 billion to $80 billion over the same period. Buffett had about $2.5 billion in 1988, and has $68 billion today. Yet perhaps the most telling comparison is between Trump and his golf buddy, Richard LeFrak. The LeFraks and the Trumps have been rivals in New York's real estate business for generations. LeFrak's father, Samuel LeFrak, took a no-nonsense approach to the business. He focused on minimizing risk and making money, according to a 1992 profile in Business Week, before the magazine became Bloomberg Businessweek. ""He might be strutting around like a peacock today, but he's gonna be a feather duster tomorrow,"" the elder LeFrak told Business Week when asked about Trump. Over time, the LeFraks came out ahead of their competitors. LeFrak is worth $7 billion today, and he's 181st on Bloomberg's list of the world's richest people. Bloomberg puts Trump's wealth at just $2.9 billion -- far less than Forbes's estimate. He doesn't even make the list. The LeFraks are a family with long experience in a very competitive industry, but Trump's returns are less even than those of an ordinary investor saving for retirement. Experts on personal finance generally recommend that people saving for retirement or to pay for a child's college education buy and hold in index funds -- mutual funds that are invested in a wide range of stocks or bonds. The price of the funds will go up and down with the market, but over time, these investments will generate a reliable return as long as the investor avoids the temptation to sell in a financial panic. [Read more: It’s time to take a look at the index card with all the financial advice you’ll ever need] Citing an independent evaluation, Business Week put Trump's net worth at $100 million in 1978. Had Trump gotten out of real estate entirely, put his money in an index fund based on the S&P 500 and reinvested the dividends, he'd be worth twice as much -- $6 billion -- today, according to the calculator maintained by the blog Don't Quit Your Day Job. (In this scenario, Trump doesn't quit his day job. The calculation above does not include any allowance for living expenses, so if he had put all his money in index funds, he would have had to live off the dividends or find some other source of income.) Trump disputes the independent appraisals of his wealth by Forbes, Business Week (now Bloomberg) and others. He says he is worth about $10 billion today. Using Trump's preferred estimates of his wealth, he has still performed worse than our hypothetical Main Street retiree. He told The New York Times he was worth $200 million in 1976, an amount that would be worth $12 billion today. ""That a purely un­man­aged in­dex fund’s re­turn could out­per­form Trump’s hands-on wheel­ing and deal­ing calls in­to ques­tion one of Trump’s chief selling points on the cam­paign trail: his busi­ness acu­men,"" writes S.V. Dáte in National Journal. In a way, though, all of these comparisons are misleading. Donald Trump's father, Fred Trump, built his real-estate business on federal subsidies, as The Washington Post's Emily Badger has reported. Financing from Uncle Sam isn't available to the typical investor (although homeowners do benefit indirectly from federal subsidies and can deduct interest they pay on their mortgage from their tax bill). The younger Trump has continued that strategy, boasting about his ability to secure taxpayer dollars from local officials, as the Los Angeles Times has explained. [Read more: How Donald Trump abandoned his father's middle-class empire for luxury building] At other times, Trump has relied not on taxpayers but on banks and private concerns. Firms under his control have gone bankrupt on four occasions, but those catastrophes aren't fully reflected in Trump's net worth today, since his lenders absorbed the losses. The LeFraks, by contrast, have avoided imposing losses on their creditors, while still finding a way to turn a profit.
