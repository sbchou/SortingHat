A new battleground survey, conducted for the pro-GOP group American Crossroads by pollsters Vox Populi, found that 59 percent of voters in seven battleground states said they were less likely to support Clinton in light of her comment that problems at the Veterans Administration were not as \u201cwidespread\u201d as Republicans suggested.  And she doesn\u2019t need any more headaches with the voters in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, Ohio, and Virginia.  Clinton\u2019s deficit to a generic Republican nominee stands basically unchanged at 12 points and her net favorability remained low at negative 22 points. On the question of whether those polled felt Clinton would say or do anything to get elected, 61 percent agreed at least to some degree.  Another danger zone for Clinton in the poll: Her support for allowing illegal immigrants to get insurance benefits under ObamaCare and a promised expansion of Obama\u2019s executive amnesty program. Fully 50 percent said they would be much less likely to back Clinton because of her policies.  The telephone survey included 1,028 registered voters. You can get the full results here.  Postal workers endorse Bernie - AP: \u201cVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders secured the endorsement of the 200,000-member American Postal Workers Union on Thursday, marking the largest labor union to back his Democratic presidential campaign. The union\u2019s decision gives Sanders a boost heading into the second Democratic debate in Iowa on Saturday and comes as the Vermont senator has sought to halt a string of labor endorsements to Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton.\u201d  [But with voters, Clinton keeps crushing Sanders, according to the latest NYT/CBS News poll.]  THE JUDGE\u2019S RULING: OBAMA\u2019S PEN IS OUT OF INK Citing a federal appeals court ruling this week in favor of states battling\u00a0President Obama\u2019s temporary executive amnesty for certain illegal immigrants, Senior Judicial Analyst\u00a0Judge Andrew Napolitano says the president\u2019s rule by the pen has\u00a0run\u00a0out of ink.

The Atlantic: \u201cIt\u2019s November, and salmon are currently leaving the oceans and returning to the rivers where they were born. During these epic waterfall-leaping, bear-dodging migrations, their bodies change. Their color darkens and reddens. The males develop hooked jaws, and sometimes humps. The red muscles that are so useful for long-distance swimming are replaced by fast-acting white muscles that can power sprints and jumps. And one of the most dramatic changes, and perhaps the least obvious one, happens in their eyes. In rivers, flecks of mud and algae shift the underwater light away from the clear blue of the ocean and towards the red end of the spectrum. The salmon compensate for this: A simple biochemical switch in their retinas gradually enhances their ability to see infrared light.\u201d  Got a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

Marco Rubio focused his debate comments on taxes about the need to bolster families. Donald Trump keeps bashing Ben Carson on character issues.  And it\u2019s no mystery why: Everyone knows conservative Christian voters are the key bloc for the GOP nomination.  But a close-up look at the composition of electorates in February and early March from the University of Virginia Center for Politics shows just how influential evangelicals are.  Here\u2019s the key part: \u201cwe found that about two-thirds (64%) of the total delegates in states with contests on or before March 8 will come from states with electorates that may be at least 50% white evangelical.\u201d  While we know that blue-state, moderate Republicans have lots of clout at the end of the GOP nominating process, it is conservative, evangelical Christians who hold sway in the early going when candidates need wins to build momentum. And their clout is increasing this cycle.  The role of Iowa and South Carolina Christian conservatives have been well documented for years, the more compact primary calendar this year gives even more influence to the members of Team Jesus. States voting in the new March 1 \u201cSEC Primary\u201d include those with the highest concentrations of evangelicals, including Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and Mississippi.  Who do they like best? Carson, by a long shot.\u00a0 He holds a 10-point lead on his nearest competitor, Trump, in the latest Fox News poll. Running third in the key demographic was Cruz with 12 percent. Rubio is tied for fourth among evangelicals with 7 percent.  But when evangelicals were asked their second choice, Rubio jumped up to 15 percent, close to Trump and Carson.  If Rubio remains broadly palatable to Christian voters, he could have the makings of the same coalition that propelled the last Republican to the White House: George W. Bush and his alliance between the GOP establishment and social conservatives.  Cruz, on the other hand, is looking to build a coalition that fuses evangelical support with the more libertarian-minded voters who fueled the original Tea Party movement.  But with both, expect to hear lots of discussion from them about their faiths and families.  GOP insiders worry about attacks on Rubio - WaPo: \u201cMany Republican elites are once again celebrating [Sen. Marco Rubio] as the party\u2019s golden boy, if not its strongest general-election candidate, and fear seeing him bruised too badly during the primary season. \u2018He\u2019s articulate, attractive and young. His rivals don\u2019t want him to win, but no one wants to lose him,\u2019 said Vin Weber, a prominent Jeb Bush supporter.\u201d\nBut Jeb keeps up backhands - NYT: \u201c\u2018I\u2019m a better bet,\u2019 Mr. Bush said. \u2018I\u2019ve got a proven record, and I campaign in a way that is based on that record and based on the ideas that I have that are about the future,\u2019 he said. \u2018And I\u2019ve been vetted. I\u2019ve been tested. I\u2019m an open book.\u2019\u201d  [Just ahead of facing major donors in Miami next month, Bush plans to host a fundraising event in Washington on Dec. 3 targeting K Street, reports Politico.

I don\u2019t think he necessarily is the representation of the Republican Party \u2014 far from it.\u201d  [AP probes Carson\u2019s friendship with an oral surgeon who pleaded guilty to insurance fraud.]  Prickly politics on Trump\u2019s claim that wages are \u2018too high\u2019 - National Journal: \u201cOne of the most over\u00adlooked mo\u00adments in Tues\u00adday\u00a0night\u2019s Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan de\u00adbate came at the very be\u00adgin\u00adning.

Michael Bennet on the failure of his state's consumer operated and oriented plan. The group, backed partly by influential GOP donors and industrialists Charles and David Koch, said that it could do more attacks on the co-op failures. The ad says Colorado HealthOp caused more than 80,000 state residents to lose their health insurance. It also cites a Colorado NBC affiliate that reported some doctors turned away HealthOp policyholders for fear they won't get reimbursed\u201d  [Bennet brushed aside questions from Politico about his reported support of a Colorado plan to replace ObamaCare with a single-payer model long sought by liberals.]  More DC dough for Strickland - Wash Free Beacon: \u201cDemocrat Ted Strickland attended a fundraiser for his Ohio Senate campaign in Washington, D.C., Tuesday evening\u00a0that was held\u00a0by a top executive at the Center for American Progress, his former employer\u2026According to a\u00a0Washington Free Beacon\u00a0analysis, the Democratic candidate\u00a0raised\u00a0over\u00a0$170,000 from donors in the Washington area in the first three-quarters of 2015, much of it coming from wealthy consultants, lobbyists, and attorneys.\u201d  Infighting liberally in Maryland - The Hill: Three influential Maryland progressives announced their support Tuesday for Rep.

David Vitter, R-La., and Democratic state Rep. John Bell Edwards could have consequences for control of Senate in 2016 as the NYT reports.  [National Journal has the jaw-dropping details on this week\u2019s Edwards/Vitter\u00a0 debate.]  Vets want respect - Edwards, who used a picture of Arlington National Cemetery in attack ads aimed at Vitter, is drawing fire from veterans.

Michigan's 6-foot-6, 248-pound junior was named the John Mackey Award tight end of the week Wednesday. Butt had four receptions for a career-best 102 yards during the team's 49-16 win over Rutgers. Through nine games, Butt leads all Big Ten tight ends with 31 receptions for 418 yards. He's also caught one touchdown.
