"{""body"": "" (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Republican presidential candidates agree that Islamic extremists are running rampant", the Mideast is on fire and Russia, China and Iran are flexing their muscles, yet they are far from reaching consensus on how much is enough when it comes to spending on defense.\nIt's a political divide that has dogged the GOP since 2010 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 defense hawks versus deficit hawks born in the tea party movement. It also reflects a war-weary nation as conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan drag on with no end in sight and President Barack Obama decides to deploy up to 50 Special Operations forces to Syria.\nThe divisions were on stark display during Tuesday's night debate. In a heated exchange, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio called for raising defense spending significantly. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz wants more robust spending, too," but he doesn't want to make the deficit larger. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul's isolationist bent makes him less willing for the U.S. to get involved abroad and he wondered aloud how spending more money on defense qualifies a candidate as a conservative.\n\""Defense spending has fallen dramatically on President Obama's watch", and our forces have been reduced and suffered readiness challenges even as threats abroad increase,"\"" Rubio said. \""Our military therefore needs a serious program of reinvestment and modernization.\""\nHe failed to mention that the cuts to defense spending as well as to domestic spending were largely the result of the 2011 budget pact between Obama and congressional Republicans", who were intent on reducing the nation's deficit.\nPaul, who has proposed a budget in the past that would have cut spending across the board to curb deficits, said he wants a strong national defense," \""but I don't want us to be bankrupt.\""\nCongress just approved spending $607 billion on defense next year"," and the United States is still the world's largest military spender \""at nearly three times the level of second-placed China","\"" according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Russia and Saudi Arabia are third and fourth", respectively.\nHowever," the bipartisan National Defense Panel released a report last year that strongly condemned the current state of the U.S. military. It said U.S. military strength has been weakened by deep budget cuts that started with the 2011 budget law. \""Budget cuts have left the military in disrepair","\"" the panel's report said. The Budget Control Act has created a \""readiness crisis\"" and has caused shortfalls in present and future capabilities.\nThat has prompted U.S. allies to question the United States' resolve on the world stage", the report said. If the budget cuts are not stopped, the U.S. military will become a hollow force, the report said. Several candidates have embraced the panel's findings in their campaign rhetoric, but few have provided their desired price tag for the Pentagon budget.\nWhat some of the other GOP candidates have said about defense spending:\n___\nJEB BUSH\nIn his June speech announcing his presidential campaign," the former Florida governor called the Obama administration \""risk averse\"" and said that Obama was leading America into a state of \""military inferiority.\n\""We need to increase defense spending significantly if we are to carry out our global responsibilities today and modernize our armed forces for the future","\"" said Bush.\n___\nBEN CARSON\nThe retired neurosurgeon told conservative radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt that the U.S. is no longer just cutting fat from the Pentagon budget"," but is \""cutting into the muscle and cutting into the bone.\""\nCarson said he thinks the United States needs to be able to respond to at least three areas of the world simultaneously and will be in jeopardy if it can't.\n___\nLINDSEY GRAHAM\nThe South Carolina senator is a defense hawk who has repeatedly clashed with deficit hawks.\n\""Our ballooning national debt poses a serious threat to our national security", but failed attempts to address it by blindly and recklessly slashing military funding are equally dangerous,"\"" Graham says on his campaign website.\n____\nDONALD TRUMP\nThe wealthy businessman said other nations are beating the U.S. economically and militarily.\n\""We have to make our military bigger", better, stronger than ever before so that nobody messes with us, and in the long run, it's going to save us,"\"" Trump says.\nAt the same time", Trump says," \""We can't continue to be the policeman of the world. ...

"{""body"": ""\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nToo many of the men and women I have met on the campaign trail are disillusioned with a government that they believe no longer works for them. Indeed", 75 percent of Americans now believe that our government is corrupt. They believe that it favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy, and the well-connected\u2014and they are right.\nFor decades, under both Democrat and Republican leadership, the government has continued to grow in size, in power, and in complexity.\nSpending increased to $3.5 trillion in 2014. Our national debt is over $18 trillion. Since 2001, there have been over 4,500 changes to the tax code\u2014an average of more than one per day. There are nearly 1,000 rules governing the operation of small businesses, more than at any point in the last decade.\nAs the government grows more bloated and more complex, it naturally favors the big, the powerful, and the well-connected\u2014because only they can afford to hire armies of lawyers, accountants, and lobbyists to handle big government. And here's the truth: It can't be fair unless it's simple.\n\nI have spent my whole life challenging the status quo and overhauling bloated bureaucracies. It\u2019s what I did at Hewlett-Packard and it is what I will do when I lead the federal government.\n\nThat is the dirty little secret of giant, expensive regulations like ObamaCare or Dodd-Frank. They were written in part by lobbyists for big companies who want the rules to work for them. \nThe passage of ObamaCare is bringing rising premiums for many Americans\u2014and tens of millions of dollars in profits for drug companies. Dodd-Frank has crushed more than 1,500 of the community banks that provide half the loans to small businesses\u2014while the ten banks too big to fail have simply become five banks too big to fail.\nAs government grows, it also becomes much more difficult to hold people and agencies accountable and to root out this type of corruption. \nIt is how Lois Lerner was able to get away with her illegal, partisan attacks on conservatives. \nIt is how the Department of Veterans Affairs became a stain on our nation\u2019s honor, with hundreds of thousands of veterans dying awaiting health care. \nIt is how Hillary Clinton has been able to repeat her lies about Benghazi.\nBut there is an opportunity here, if our next president is prepared to seize it. \nAll of our wounds are self-inflicted\u2014and all of our problems are fixable. \nIt will take citizenship and it will take leadership, but together, we can fix them.\nThere\u2019s an old saying that if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. For politicians, regulations and bureaucracy are their hammer. For too long, they have been in the business of managing problems and they have forgotten that leadership is about envisioning solutions.\nWe need a proven, tested leader in the White House\u2014someone who has challenged the status quo and who is not afraid to make enemies. \nShe must be prepared to change the order of things because she hasn\u2019t spent her whole life in the system. \nWe need a president of courage and conviction, who is committed to citizen government and who will engage you to solve our nation\u2019s problems.\nI have spent my whole life challenging the status quo and overhauling bloated bureaucracies. It\u2019s what I did at Hewlett-Packard and it is what I will do when I lead the federal government.\nFirst, we have to move to zero-based budgeting. Every agency must justify every dollar that they spend. We have to roll back the regulations that are crushing the small businesses that create two thirds of the jobs in our country.\nWe must also shrink the size of our bloated bureaucracy. Over the next five years, hundreds of thousands of federal employees are expected to retire. \nI would not replace a single one. At the same time, we must move to a pay-for-performance system and turn the federal government into a meritocracy.\nWe must examine every regulation on the books today. Congress should pass the REINS Act, which will require every major regulation from the White House to be reviewed and voted up or down.\nFinally and most importantly, we must engage the American people. Technology allows us to do this easily. \nI will use that technology to engage you and put pressure on the political class to actually get something done.\nPoliticians have gotten us into this mess. It will take a proven leader and citizens to get us out of it. \nIt's time to take our government back. \n\nCarly Fiorina is a candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.

"{""body"": ""EXETER", N.H.\u2014Ohio Gov. John Kasich, playing the sensible establishment candidate in a race that has favored conservative\u00a0outsiders, on Thursday defended his stances on\u00a0bank bailouts and a pathway to citizenship for illegal\u00a0immigrants.\n\u201cThe idea that we are going to ship 11 million people out of this country and go into neighborhoods and round them up is simply not practical,\u201d Mr. Kasich said after speaking to senior citizens here Thursday afternoon. \u201cI just think the practical solution is that if they haven\u2019t violated the law, they have a path to legalization.\u201d\nMr. Kasich has sought to contrast his\u00a0views on immigration with those of hardliners such as Donald Trump and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, highlighted most recently in Tuesday\u2019s Wall Street Journal/Fox Business debate. Mr. Kasich\u00a0and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush are the only Republicans running who currently support some route to legal status\u00a0for undocumented\u00a0immigrants.\nMr. Trump has pledged to round up millions of illegal immigrants and deport them. Also Thursday,\u00a0Mr. Cruz said that \u201cmillions\u201d of Republicans will stay home in November if they believe the GOP nominee is soft on immigration.\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Kasich sparred with Mr. Cruz during the debate over what should have been done about financial institutions that neared collapse in 2008. The Ohio governor Thursday stood by his view that the Obama administration\u2019s bailout was necessary to protect people\u00a0of modest means.\n\u201cThey are the folks who have to be looked out for,\u201d Mr. Kasich said of depositors. \u201cI\u2019m not for bailing out the investors in the banks.\u201d\nMr. Kasich\u2019s strategy has yet to pay off. He was on the bubble for being included in Tuesday\u2019s Republican primetime debate based on his national poll numbers, and he could be knocked off the main stage by the time of next month\u2019s forum. He\u00a0has focused his campaigning almost exclusively on New Hampshire, while the polls used so far to determine top-tier candidates haven\u2019t been state specific.\nMr. Kasich said he felt good about his debate performance, and that it helped highlight a growing divide between candidates who have tangible policies to help the American people as opposed to ones that will increase the U.S. deficit, endanger entitlement programs or have \u201cnumbers that don\u2019t add up.\u201d\nThose policies won\u2019t stand up during a general election fight, Mr. Kasich said.\n\u201cI want to make sure we have conservative solutions with a conservative candidate who can actually get things done for our country,\u201d Mr. Kasich said.\nSpeaking before a crowd of more than 100 seniors Thursday, Mr. Kasich said he stood by his view that Ohio\u2019s minimum wage increase was helpful to the state\u2019s economy and wouldn\u2019t negatively impact small business owners.\nHe also said that Planned Parenthood should be defunded, a response that several of the seniors loudly booed. The crowd wasn\u2019t of any one party affiliation.\nMore\nFor John Kasich, Medicaid Expansion Is Both an Accomplishment and Liability\n* * *\nDebate Video:\u00a0Cruz v.Kasich on Bank Bailouts\n______________________________________________________\n2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll Standings\n\n\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops. \r\n\nCapital Journal Daybreak Newsletter: Sign up to get the latest on politics, policy and defense delivered to your inbox every morning.\r\nFor the latest Washington news, follow @wsjpolitics\r\nFor outside analysis," follow @wsjthinktank"""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": ""Ohio Gov.

"{""body"": """""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": ""\nBen Carson isn't only challenging Donald Trump's frontrunner status in the Republican presidential primaries \u2014 he's beating him in book sales", too.Trump's new book, Crippled America, will debut on the New York Times hardcover nonfiction bestseller list at #5 \u2014 one spot below Carson's book, A More Perfect Union. The yet-to-be-released list was sent to BuzzFeed News by a publishing industry source," and will appear in the Nov. 22 edition of the New York Times Book Review.Trump's title does edge out Carson's in the less-closely-followed \""combined print and e-book\"" category: On that list", Crippled America is at #4 and A More Perfect Union is at #5. But many industry observers expected Trump's book to dominate the bestseller list.As BuzzFeed News recently reported, the celebrity billionaire's proposal was passed over earlier this year by some publishers, who were skeptical of his staying power in the 2016 race, and then came to regret their decision.Carson's performance on the Times list is particularly impressive given that his book has already been out for more than a month: This will be A More Perfect Union's fifth week as a bestseller. By contrast, Cripple America is benefitting from the surge of publicity and sales that typically accompany a book's first week on the shelves.Carson and Trump \u2014 currently locked in a dead heat for first place in the 2016 primary polls \u2014 are both prolific bestselling authors. Carson became the country's most famous neurosurgeon, and an icon in the African-American community, thanks largely to his bestselling 1996 memoir Gifted Hands. And Trump has spent much of this year touting his popular 1987 business book The Art of the Deal," which he calls his second favorite book (behind only the Bible).\n\n\n"""," ""title"": ""Donald Trump's New Book To Debut Behind Ben Carson's On New York Times Bestseller List"""," ""url"": ""http://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/donald-trumps-new-book-to-debut-behind-ben-carsons-on-new-yo"""," ""topics"": [""personality"""," ""foreign policy/national security""]"," ""people"": [""Donald Trump"""," ""Ben Carson""]"," ""orgs"": [""The Art""]"," ""election_confidence"": 0.946306694033898"," ""authors"": [{""author_id"": 6681"," ""fullname"": ""mckay coppins"""," ""primary_org"": ""buzzfeed""}]"," ""date_written"": ""2015-11-12 19:42:46"""," ""org"": ""buzzfeed"""," ""article_id"": ""c6cf8c9b9333e4099db688469b50f74a"""," ""date_access"": ""2015-11-12 20:10:48.306284""}",
