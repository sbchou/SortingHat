We look forward to hearing from you!\nHIGHLIGHTS\nPOPULISM ON THE RISE IN GOP RACE FOR PRESIDENT: The latest presidential debate vividly captured how the 2008 financial crisis has reshaped the Republican Party by unleashing a potent populist strain that could further scramble an already unpredictable primary contest. Candidates vying for the 2016 GOP nomination have grown distinctly more leery of big banks, corporations and international trade deals, and outright hostile toward the Federal Reserve.\nSome of these impulses gave rise to the tea-party movement in 2009 and flared in the 2012 GOP primary contest, but they faded with the nomination of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a private-equity executive. The debate in Milwaukee didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appear to fundamentally alter the state of the race. But with candidates heading off to Iowa and New Hampshire on Wednesday, it showed how their jockeying to carry the populist banner could intensify in the run-up to those states\u00e2\u0080\u0099 early nominating contests next February. Nick Timiraos reports.\nMore on 2016: Republican presidential candidates worked to turn debate moments into campaign momentum after a GOP showdown that highlighted policy differences but did little to shuffle the standings\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Donald Trump and Marco Rubio won Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s night primetime Republican debate, according to an overnight poll of Internet users who watched the contest, but Mr. Trump came out as the favorite among Republicans and left the best impression about his ability to serve as president\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The Trump show may be fading on social media.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 For those wondering how Mr. Trump will go about deporting millions of\u00c2\u00a0 illegal immigrants if elected president, they got their answer in Tuesday night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debate. His plan: follow the model used in the 1950s whereby people living in the U.S. illegally were rounded up and sent back to Mexico en masse.\nLAURA MECKLER: POSTAL UNION GIVES BERNIE SANDERS A BOOST\nThe union representing postal workers endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders for president on Thursday, giving the underdog candidate a much-needed boost in his effort to topple Hillary Clinton, who remains far ahead in the race for union support. Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s views and record typically line up more closely with unions\u00e2\u0080\u0099 priorities, and the American Postal Workers Union said his years of work on their causes won members over. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPolitics as usual has not worked. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time for a political revolution,\u00e2\u0080\u009d union president Mark Dimondstein said in a statement, echoing Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battle cry.

With the next Democratic debate set for Saturday in Iowa, the three candidates planning to take part\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Malley\u00e2\u0080\u0094are competing for who can be tougher on Wall Street. Bob Davis reports.\nU.S. URGES BODYCAMS FOR LOCAL POLICE, BUT NIXES THEM ON FEDERAL TEAMS: The Justice Department is publicly urging local police departments to adopt body cameras, saying they are an important tool to improve transparency and trust between officers and citizens. But privately, the department is telling some of its agents they cannot work with officers using such cameras as part of joint task forces, according to people familiar with the discussions. The reason: The federal government hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet adopted guidelines on how and when to use body cameras, rules that would be important to determining how any footage could be used in court, released publicly, or stored by law-enforcement agencies. Devlin Barrett reports.\nU.S. ARRESTS KIN OF VENEZUELA PRESIDENT ON DRUG CHARGES: U.S. agents have arrested two relatives of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00c3\u00a1s Maduro on charges they conspired to transport 800 kilograms of cocaine to the U.S., according to two people familiar with the matter.The arrests come amid U.S. accusations that the top echelon of the government in Caracas is involved in the narcotics trade. The two men, Efra\u00c3\u00adn Antonio Campo Flores and Francisco Flores de Freitas, were first arrested in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Tuesday by local police, turned over to U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents and flown the same day to New York in a DEA jet, these people said. The two were scheduled to go before a federal judge in New York on Thursday, they said. A spokesman for the federal district court declined to comment. Jos\u00c3\u00a9 de C\u00c3\u00b3rdoba reports.\n\nREPUBLICANS LOOK FOR VOTES TO DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD, REPEAL PARTS OF HEALTH LAW: Republicans are having difficulty unifying around legislation to carry out two top GOP priorities: defunding Planned Parenthood and repealing part of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. GOP lawmakers debated for months about what measures to pass under a special procedure tied to the budget process, known as reconciliation, which enables legislation to pass with just a simple majority. But there is a problem with the combination they settled on: It may go too far for some Republicans and not far enough for others. Kristina Peterson reports.\nRUSSIAN PROPOSAL ON SYRIA FAILS TO GAIN TRACTION AT UN: A proposal by Russia for a settlement of the conflict in Syria sparked criticism from Western and Arab officials concerned that it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t address President Bashar al-Assad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fate. The proposal lists eight steps toward ending the conflict: establishing an 18-month constitutional reform period; creating a united delegation from the hodgepodge of opposition groups; identifying terrorist factions; coordinating international military strikes on Islamic State; and holding simultaneous presidential and parliamentary elections. But the proposal doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t clarify how or when Mr. Assad might step down and leaves open the possibility that he could continue to rule Syria if he were to be re-elected. Farnaz Fassihi and Jay Solomon report.\nPlus:\u00c2\u00a0The Syrian regime and its allies boasted Wednesday about a Russia-backed operation that broke a long-running siege by Islamic State militants on an air base near the northern city of Aleppo\u2026 A military operation by Kurdish forces against Islamic State began Thursday morning, according to a Kurdish government announcement, as thousands of fighters converged on the northern Iraqi town of Sinjar and sought to choke off a supply line to the militants.\nALSO IN THE NEWS\nWorld leaders will gather later this month in Paris to set new targets for greenhouse-gas emissions.
