Rand Paul on Wednesday continued his attack on Florida Sen. Marco over military spending. \nThe two candidates for the Republican presidential nomination clashed at Tuesday's GOP debate over defense spending and the budget in one of the night's more heated exchanges. \n\"I went right at Marco Rubio, because I frankly don't think he's a conservative,\" Paul said of his presidential rival. \"He offered a trillion dollars, with a t, for new spending for the new military, with no explanation about how he was going to pay for it. But then he also offered a trillion dollars of a new entitlement program which will be refundable tax credits.\"\nEarlier in the interview, Paul said of his opponents, \"They all want unlimited funds for the military and they think the military can't have enough.\"\n\"I don't want us to be hallowed out by debt,\" added Paul, saying he understood and felt the nationalism calling for a strong military but the nation couldn't survive mounting debt.\nTake a listen:\n\nw.soundcloud.com", "title": "Rand Paul On Marco Rubio: \"I Frankly Don't Think He's A Conservative\"", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/rand-paul-on-marco-rubio-i-frankly-dont-think-hes-a-conserva", "topics": ["surveillance/privacy", "health"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Scott Olson", "Marco Rubio"], "orgs": [], "election_confidence": 0.7576723679043297, "authors": [{"author_id": 6682, "fullname": "andrew kaczynski", "primary_org": "buzzfeed"}], "date_written": "2015-11-12 16:37:41", "org": "buzzfeed", "article_id": "a015c79835a52904b72ef965f1fff557", "date_access": "2015-11-12 17:11:35.640118"}
