"Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, a New America fellow and author of ""The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.
 (CNN)Until now, Donald Trump has defied all the expectations. Most of the political experts predicted he would be one of the media-fueled candidates who have emerged in last few primary seasons, propped up by intense coverage and then deflated when reporters turned their attention to another candidate. 
The Donald has proven to be a much more durable candidate than they expected, maintaining a strong position in national polls as well as in local polling in key primary states such as New Hampshire. He has demonstrated tremendous savvy in keeping the media's attention for a sustained period of time, which is not a total surprise given his deep experience on ""The Apprentice"" as well as the dynamics of what I have called the click-bait primary, where incendiary statements are more likely to win attention than to receive widespread rebuke. 
But the Republican campaign is starting to enter a new phase where there are a number of questions about how Trump will fare. Now that the early phase of the competition will soon wind down -- a free-for-all primarily revolving around televised debates -- Trump will have to prove his chops if he is to win in Iowa, New Hampshire and the primaries that follow. 
The most pertinent question has to do with grass-roots organization. In less than three months, the voting will actually begin. When it comes to the caucuses and primaries, old-fashioned retail politics still matters. As Barack Obama proved in 2008, the winner of these contests needs to put together a formidable grass-roots organization to mobilize and bring out the vote.
In a few states like Iowa, Trump's campaign has given indications that it understand this. It has brought on some talented figures and started to put together a campaign. In Iowa, Trump scored a success by hiring Chuck Laudner, the grass-roots campaign operative who put together Rick Santorum's surprise victory there in 2012, to handle his operations. 
But it is not yet clear whether Trump is willing to devote the money or can devote the kind of day-to-day appearances that the campaign will require, and how well-organized his strategic voter mobilization plan will be. Tim Fernholz reported, for instance, that Trump had not even purchased some of the basic voter information databases that are prerequisites for victory. 
Trump has made a point of saying he is self-funding his campaign, trying to draw a contrast with his rivals. While it is true he used some of his money, donations are still funding a lot of his campaign, and it's not clear how much of his fortune he is willing to commit to this effort, particularly if his odds of winning start to diminish.  
Soon Trump will also have to contend with an actual establishment candidate. The leaders of the Republican Party are starting to coalesce around a main candidate, very likely Sen. Marco Rubio. Trump has thrived in part because the GOP did not yet have a central candidate upon whom to shower its resources and energy. The divisions and uncertainty that have resulted from Jeb Bush's poor run have opened up room in the campaign for some of the ""outsiders"" who have gained support. 
If party leaders settle on Rubio, or Bush somehow engineers a miraculous comeback, the pressure against outsiders such as Trump will intensify. The party leaders will do much more, through their candidate, to unload blistering political and personal attacks on opponents within the party. Most recently, The Wall Street Journal, a scion of the Republican establishment, published a scathing editorial about how little Trump seemed to know about what was in the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal.  When Trump responded by calling the editors ""dummies"" through a tweet, the paper stood by its comments. 
If Trump is able to transition to the next phase with his standing in the polls intact, the media still have a lot of exposing to do. Everyone who has followed him since he made a splash on the national scene in 1980s New York as a ""greed is good"" real estate mogul knows there is a long record to explore.
Despite all the attention he has received thus far, the scrutiny has been relatively contained. Ironically, the fame with which he entered into the contest has diminished the incentive of some reporters to dig more deeply into his life. It is a contrast with candidates such as Ben Carson about whom the media didn't really know much. That made reporters more curious to figure it out. With Trump, and the assumption we know everything there is about him, there has not been as much investigation as we might expect. But if he remains a serious candidate, more scrutiny will focus on his failed business ventures and his rocky marriages. 
There are a number of important issues that have barely made it onto the radar. For example, a handful of reports have surfaced on how little Trump has given to charity over the years, a measure for the values of a wealthy person who has not been in public service, and the ways in which he has greatly exaggerated and misconstrued the money that he has donated.
The Associated Press produced a scathing report in August showing how he has overstated his contributions, how they are small compared with others of his income status, and that they advance his personal interests. This record would not sit well with some voters, who are seeking a populist voice, especially from a billionaire candidate who is now insisting that the wages of workers are too high. 
His recent attacks on Carson, such as comparing what he called the neurosurgeon's ""pathological temper"" to the sickness of a ""child molester"" have offered a reminder as to just how nasty the thin-skinned businessman can become against his opponents.
There are also questions about Trump himself. Thus far he has clearly enjoyed the ride. Yet it is not evident how he will feel as the campaign slog really gets going, with the brutal hours that it requires, and if he starts to fall from his plateau. It is not clear how passionate Trump is about the job and the kind of commitment winning a presidential race requires. 
He has already made some comments about his willingness to quit if he is not doing well. In October, he told ""Meet the Press"": ""I'm not a masochist. And if I was dropping in the polls, where I saw that I wasn't going to win, why would I continue?"" 
He gives off a different sentiment than some of the other candidates, such as Rubio, who are clearly willing to invest everything they have for as long as they are still viable. 
For those who have always doubted whether this is about promoting his brand name as opposed to promoting a vision for the White House, there are doubts about whether he might just be willing to fire himself if this process turned unpleasant. 
The brutal terrorist attacks in Paris this weekend are also a stark reminder of the immense security challenges that the United States and the world faces. These are serious times that call for extraordinary leaders. In this context, Trump's yelling and insults, combined with questions about whether he would really be up for this job, are likely to become bigger liabilities among voters.
It is clear Trump has the potential to survive over the long run, and the state of the Republican Party might give him room to make it much further than anyone suspected. But the going is about to get a lot tougher, and the challenges Trump will have to overcome will intensify in the next few months.

"Jeb Bush said the United States “should declare war” as it responds to the Paris attacks and the rise of ISIS generally.

“You take it to them in Syria and Iraq,” Mr. Bush said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” when asked how the United States could expect to “defeat an ideology.”

“You destroy ISIS,” he continued. “And then you build a coalition to replace this radical Islamic terrorist threat to our country and to Europe and to the region with something that is more peace-loving.”

The host, Chuck Todd, asked Mr. Bush what he would tell an American public wary of foreign entanglements after wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. (Mr. Todd left unsaid the fact that those wars began under Mr. Bush’s brother.)

“I tell the American public that a caliphate the size of Indiana garners strength each and every day if it’s not taken out,” Mr. Bush replied.

Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, has long sought to establish himself as the adult in a raucous Republican field, and his supporters are hopeful that a greater focus on national security issues could provide an opening for a campaign that has badly struggled.

On Sunday, Mr. Bush hinted at the shifting tenor of the race, with some prodding from Mr. Todd, arguing that “as we get closer to the primaries, people are going to want to know who can sit behind the big desk.”

He was asked if he would trust Donald J. Trump or Ben Carson as commander-in-chief.

“I don’t know,” Mr. Bush said. “The words that I hear them speaking give me some concern. “

But he turned quickly to Hillary Rodham Clinton, seizing on comments she made during Saturday night’s Democratic debate. Mrs. Clinton said the fight against ISIS “cannot be an American fight,” before adding that “American leadership is essential.”

“I’m more concerned about Hillary Clinton thinking that the United States doesn’t have a leadership role in this,” Mr. Bush said, after the question about his Republican rivals. “That’s my big concern.”",MATT FLEGENHEIMER,"Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, warned that the caliphate was gaining strength “every day” and insisted the United States must take the lead in fighting it in Syria and Iraq.","First Draft: ‘We Should Declare War’ in Fight Against Islamic State, Jeb Bush Says",http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/15/we-should-declare-war-in-fight-against-islamic-state-jeb-bush-says/,[u'foreign policy/national security'],"[u'Hillary Rodham Clinton', u'Jeb Bush', u'Hillary Clinton', u'Chuck Todd', u'Donald J.

"Here’s the latest:

• What is the status of the investigation?

The French authorities have released no information since a news conference by the Paris prosecutor on Saturday, and no updates are scheduled for Sunday.

The death toll holds at 129, but the number of critically wounded — nearly 100 — signaled that figure was certain to grow.

Investigators were hunting down information about the first of the suspects to be publicly identified, Ismaël Omar Mostefaï, 29, a French citizen who was one of three hostage takers at the Bataclan concert hall.

In the eastern Paris suburb of Montreuil, the authorities found three Kalashnikov rifles in an abandoned vehicle, a sign that some of the attackers may have escaped.

The authorities in Belgium made seven arrests that left open the possibility that the plot had roots there.

Fundamental questions remain: How did the terrorists, who acted in three synchronized teams, pull off the deadliest terrorist attack in Western Europe since 2004?

And did they receive direction from Islamic State leaders in Iraq and Syria, who until now had never taken responsibility for such a large-scale attack in the West?

• What’s happening in Paris?

Paris is still by and large shuttered, even for a Sunday, and France remains under a state of emergency.

Museums and other cultural centers are closed for a second day. A star-crossed movie opening about a terrorist attack in France was canceled.

But small crowds congregated at the Place de la République — as they did after the Charlie Hebdo massacre in January — to show solidarity on Saturday, ignoring government advice to stay home. And French flags are appearing in Parisian apartment windows.

The archbishop of Paris officiates at a Mass at the Cathedral of Notre-Dame today. And schools are to reopen on Monday.

• What about elsewhere?

From Vatican City to Seoul, law enforcement authorities are on heightened alert.

Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari of Iraq said his country’s intelligence services obtained information indicating that, besides France, the United States and Iran were among countries being targeted for attack.

• What’s next for policy makers?

As France deals with the aftermath in Paris, global attention turns to policy and politics. President Obama and other world leaders are in Turkey for a Group of 20 summit meeting today, where the terrorist attacks are already a focus.

Migration is, too, because one of the assailants entered the European Union through Greece with other refugees last month and then passed through Serbia, where he sought asylum.

That is sure to complicate the vexing problem of how to handle the unceasing flow of people from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere in Europe. Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, said today that Europe should not react by rejecting refugees.

European Union justice and interior ministers will hold a special meeting on the Paris attacks Friday.

• How is Paris playing in the U.S. presidential campaign?

Candidates for the Democratic nomination, in their debate Saturday night in Des Moines, agreed that America is determined to fight terrorism, dedicated to responsibilities to refugees and devoted to diplomacy.

But Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont sought to tie the rise of the Islamic State to Hillary Rodham Clinton’s vote as a senator to authorize the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.

By contrast, leading Republicans like Donald J. Trump, Ben Carson and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas called on the Obama administration to halt plans to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees next year.

Although they broadly agreed that the Paris attacks should be the catalyst for a new military strategy against the Islamic State, most of the Republicans were still tentative about committing more American ground troops to that effort.

• Who were the victims?

Little seemed to tie the dead at the six attack sites, except that they were out having fun. And that was the point for the Islamic State militant group, which said that it struck France’s symbols of “perversity.”

“Bars, a concert, a great game,” Bernard-Henri Lévy, a French author and philosopher, wrote on Twitter. “This is the French art of living together that has been targeted.”

Several foreigners, including people from Belgium, Britain, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United States, were killed in the attacks.

An American student from California State University in Long Beach, Nohemi Gonzalez, 23, also died in the Paris attacks. She was spending a semester at the Strate School of Design in Paris.

Valentin Ribet, a 26-year-old lawyer, was killed at the Bataclan concert hall during a sold-out show by the American rock band Eagles of Death Metal.

Guillaume B. Decherf, 43, a critic at a French cultural magazine and a father of two, was killed as well. Three employees from Universal Music France also died, as did Nick Alexander, a British citizen who sold merchandise for the band, and Aurélie De Peretti, 33.

“Yesterday, the victims weren’t journalists or famous. They were civilians,” Maxim Ferron, manager of a Paris tea shop, said on Saturday.

" Hillary Clinton talked tough and played defense Saturday at the second Democratic presidential debate, as rivals questioned her record and plans to fight the Islamic State.
A day after a terrorist attack in Paris, terrorism and foreign policy took center stage in the two-hour debate with questions from the moderator and criticisms from rivals often focusing on her record as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first four years in office.
Clinton remains the Democrats’ clear front-runner, but the debate illustrated how she will have to answer for administration policy on terrorism and foreign policy. Clinton last month broke with the White House, urging a no-fly zone in Syria and doing more to help rebels there. But she can’t shed her ties to the administration, and Republicans are hitting her hard on her role.
The debate also showed how Clinton retains considerable advantages. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, can’t match her foreign policy experience or command of world politics. Perhaps most important, neither is drawing sharp distinctions with her on anti-terrorist policies.
Highlights:
The three opened with a moment of silence for the victims in Paris, then talked about their approach to the Islamic State terror group.
“It cannot be contained. It must be defeated,” Clinton said, a slight jab at Obama who said just before the Paris attacks that ISIS had been contained.
“But it cannot be an American fight,”she added. “This cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.”
Her two rivals were more assertive about U.S. leadership.
“I would disagree with Secretary Clinton,” said O’Malley. “This actually is America’s fight. It cannot solely be America’s fight. ... America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.
“Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of ... ISIS,” said Sanders.
Republicans complain that Democrats won’t use the words Muslim or Islam in describing terrorists.
Saturday, the Democratic candidates appeared to rally to the term Jihadi or Jihadist, which derive from the word for a holy war by Muslims.
Clinton Saturday referred to a “radical jihadist ideology.” 
“I don’t think we’re at war with Islam,” she added. “I don’t think we’re at war with all Muslims.”
O’Malley used the term “radical jihadis,” but also warned against labeling terrorists with the broad term of Muslim, saying that would unfairly brand the majority of American Muslims who are needed to help fight back violent extremism.
Said Sanders: “I don’t think the term is what’s important.”
EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
O’Malley proposed allowing 65,000 Syrian refugees into the country, more than the 10,000 proposed by Obama, though he said they need “proper screening.” 
Clinton also argued for a higher number, adding “I said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine.”
EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM
Hillary Clinton: “I don’t think we’re at war with Islam, I don’t think we’re at war with all Muslims.”
Bernie Sanders: “I’m not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,” referring to the 91 percent top income tax rate in the 1950s.
Martin O’Malley: “You will never heard this from that immigrant-bashing carnival barker Donald Trump”

Clinton
Clinton had to defend her years as secretary of state. Moderator John Dickerson asked if the Obama administration underestimated the Islamic State threat. Clinton didn’t answer at first, then tried to tie the current crisis to President George W. Bush’s decision to end American involvement in Iraq. Each time she was challenged, Clinton would launch into detailed histories of the region’s turmoil and American involvement. Backers will praise her command of detail; opponents will contend she’s avoiding responsibility for being part of a team that didn’t take the Islamic threat seriously enough.
Sanders 
He got off to a rocky start. He only briefly touched on the Paris terrorist attacks in his opening remarks before turning to his standard speech assailing income inequality and the corrosive nature of money in politics. Viewers then watched as Clinton and O’Malley devoted their entire opening statement to the attacks. Viewers may also have been puzzled when Sanders said that climate change is the country’s greatest threat and a contributor to the spread of terrorism. He also failed to gain traction out of his criticism that Clinton had voted for the Iraq War that he opposed.
O’Malley 
O’Malley, who has languished in single digits in the polls, performed ably, holding his own with the former Secretary of State and U.S. senator on foreign and domestic policy, including health care and taxes. How would he pay for his policies? He explained. Can a former governor lead the U.S. in a time of global terror? Yes, he said. But he needed a breakthrough performance to attract new attention and enthusiasm to his campaign and his performance fell short.

Wall Street. The term came up often, as Sanders and O’Malley challenged Clinton over her ties to the financial industry.

" (CNN)Hillary Clinton began the second Democratic debate by calling for the U.S. to bring the world together ""to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS.""
Clinton described ISIS, which has claimed responsibility for the terror attacks in Paris on Friday, as ""a barbaric, ruthless, violent, jihadist, terrorist group.""
She did not use the term ""radical Islam"" during an early exchange with CBS News moderator John Dickerson, who asked if she was uncomfortable with it.
""I don't think we are at war with Islam,"" Clinton said. ""I don't think we're at war with all Muslims. I think we're at war with jihadists.""
The former secretary of state said it is ""not particularly helpful"" to use the term, given the U.S. government's need to manage relationships in the Middle East.
President Barack Obama as roiled conservatives by not using strong language to characterize the terrorists. Donald Trump has been among his most vocal critical and he chimed in late tonight:
Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders said during the debate that the description of the terrorists isn't that important.
