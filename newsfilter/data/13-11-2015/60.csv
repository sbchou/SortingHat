Macho Jeb!\nThe former Florida governor has been reinventing himself as he seeks to calm his \""nervous Nellie\"" donors concerned about his flailing poll numbers and a series of underwhelming debate performances. \nStory Continued Below\nHis campaign has rebooted with a \""Jeb Can Fix It\"" slogan", and the self-described introvert has gone on a bro spree, trying to prove to voters that he has the guts and determination to dominate the still-unwieldy GOP field. \nHere are just a few ways Macho Jeb has made his mark in recent days:\n1. When a voter told Bush he was switching his support from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to Bush, the 6-foot-3 presidential candidate responded with an awkward chest bump. Bush didn't stop there. He's now offering chest bumps to any converts.\nCruz supporter tells Bush he's now backing him instead.

"{""body"": "" White evangelical Christians are well-positioned to have a strong say in early 2016 Republican primaries and caucuses", a new analysis by Geoffrey Skelley of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball found Thursday. But they could face trouble later in the campaign season.\nVoting starts February 1 in Iowa, where in 2012 exit poll data showed 56 percent of caucus voters were white evangelicals. Rick Santorum, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, had a strong appeal to those voters, and inched out a win.\nSkelley, using data from exit polls in 2008 and 2012, as well as information from the Census Bureau and the Public Religion Research Institute\u2019s American Values Atlas, found that 64 percent of total delegates in states with primaries or caucuses prior to March 8 will come from states with likely white evangelical majorities. South Carolina votes later in February, and on March 1, states with primaries or caucuses, and sizable evangelical populations, include Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. Three more such states, Kentucky, Louisiana and Kansas, vote March 5.\nThat means that candidates with special appeal to those groups could get an early boost, but it doesn\u2019t mean that will last. A majority of convention delegates will be chosenafter March 8.\n\u201cAll this is to say that white evangelical Christians are going to impact the 2016 Republican nomination contest, just as they have in previous cycles,\u201d Skelley found.\nBut because early delegates will be awarded proportionately, it will be hard for any single candidate in a multi-candidate field to get a huge early lead. And after March 15, some states will have winner take all primaries. And more states with smaller evangelical communities, such as Florida and Ohio, will be voting.\n\u201cThis is not to say that a white evangelical-oriented outsider candidate won\u2019t win the Republican nomination,\u201d Skelley said. \u201cBut many states with large numbers of conservative born-again Christians will vote when many candidates may still be in the race, possibly splintering their delegate hauls. \n\u201cNonetheless, if the white evangelical Iowa lane of the field winnows a great deal between now and March 1, it\u2019s possible that someone could take advantage and rack up a solid delegate take. Only time will tell, but there\u2019s little question that white evangelical Christians are going to be an important factor in determining the GOP nominee, particularly in the early going.\u201d\nSo far, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has attracted a strong evangelical following. Also in the mix are real estate mogul Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas; Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana; Mike Huckabee, former governor of Arkansas and 2008 Iowa caucus winner, and Santorum.\nDavid Lightman: 202-383-6101," @lightmandavid"""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": ""Analysis shows early states with big evangelical blocs\nAppeal could fade as race moves to bigger states\nSeveral candidates vying for evangelical vote\n\u2026\nClick to Continue \u00bb"""," ""title"": ""White evangelicals: Early influence on GOP race"," but prospects then get shakier"""," ""url"": ""http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article44352246.html"""," ""topics"": [""personality"""," ""campaign_finance""]"," ""people"": [""Geoffrey Skelley"""," ""Crystal Ball"""," ""Rick Santorum"""," ""Donald Trump"""," ""David Lightman"""," ""Marco Rubio"""," ""Mike Huckabee"""," ""Bobby Jindal"""," ""Ben Carson"""," ""Ted Cruz""]"," ""orgs"": [""Census Bureau"""," ""Public Religion Research Institute"""," ""GOP""]"," ""election_confidence"": 0.9998866749436447"," ""authors"": [{""author_id"": 33909"," ""fullname"": ""david lightman"""," ""primary_org"": ""mcclatchy""}]"," ""date_written"": ""2015-11-12 14:26:17"""," ""org"": ""mcclatchy"""," ""article_id"": ""c317cc8cc1cd3d9dd11b3878ef2eb65a"""," ""date_access"": ""2015-11-12 14:31:31.001673""}",
"{""body"": ""\u201cBen Carson just spent a week passing through an intense crucible over his biographical credibility. After Tuesday evening\u2019s good performance", I\u2019d say Ben Carson isn\u2019t going to fade,\u201d writes our columnist Daniel Henninger. Other contenders aren\u2019t fading either, which leads Mr. Henninger to conclude that none of the GOP candidates \u201clooks likely to pull away and capture the majority of primary delegates before the party\u2019s nominating convention in Cleveland next July.\u201d\nClick here to receive WSJ Opinion headlines and commentary via email.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been wondering all week what happened to the grown-ups on American university campuses, and it appears we have a sighting,\u201d writes the editorial board.

What a proud contrast to the environments that appear to prevail at places like Missouri and Yale.\u201d\nDon\u2019t believe bipartisan claims that lawmakers have reformed Social Security\u2019s disability insurance program, where beneficiaries and costs are surging.

"{""body"": "" (CNN)Ted Cruz is facing criticism on the right over a surprising issue: immigration.\nThe senator from Texas and Republican presidential candidate", who rose to national prominence because of his hard-line stands on everything from Obamacare to immigration, is under fire for his past support of the controversial H-1B visa program. \nCruz has backed quintupling the number of visas in the program," which encourages legal immigration for highly skilled foreign workers. But it's a position that's causing headaches for him as the campaign develops.  \n\""You've got Hillary Clinton", Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and even Ted Cruz, to my disappointment, who want to do everything from double to triple to quintuple -- in Ted Cruz's case -- the number of H-1B visas that are available to these largely offshore outsourcing companies from India,"\"" influential conservative pundit Michelle Malkin said in a video on her Facebook page last week. \""That is nuts.\""  \nFor Cruz", support for H-1B visas has been a way to insulate himself not just from a hot red base quick to label any moderation as amnesty, but also from his unwillingness to say what he would do with the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Sharing his father's dramatic flight from Cuba," Cruz tells reporters or town hall questioners that he \""celebrates legal immigration\"" and that he would like to \""streamline\"" the process -- even as he cracks down on illegal border crossings. \nBut Cruz appears to be changing his tune. During Tuesday night's Fox Business debate in Milwaukee", he framed illegal immigration as an economic threat, choosing the rhetoric used by conservative talk radio hosts who have raked Cruz over the coals, rather than his tried-and-true stump speech about preserving rule of law. And Cruz now no longer supports an increase in the number of visas until the program is reformed, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said Wednesday. \nTed Cruz draws immigration contrast with Marco Rubio\n\nThe U.S. currently allows only 65,"000 workers who specialize in science or technology to immigrate legally each year. But the program has come under increasing criticism from protectionists and American industries that say the country is \""outsourcing\"" labor and charge there is widespread abuse of the visa system. \nCruz has of late been more loudly voicing objections to the visa process"," telling a New Hampshire voter in a town hall on Wednesday evening that the emerging reports are \""horrifying","\"" a shift he signaled in an interview with radio host Vince Coakley last week. \n\""I have been very", very concerned at the growing abuse of the program,"\"" Cruz said. \""That's not what the H-1B program was designed to do.\"" \nThat interview made its way to Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama", perhaps the GOP's leading anti-immigration voice. Sessions said he is talking with Cruz about his current position and even hinted that Cruz could flip his position," sounding skeptical that the senator from Texas would still want to quintuple the number of legal immigrants in the future. \n\""I think a lot of our members will come out that way in the end","\"" Sessions told CNN. \nCruz is hardly the only GOP candidate who backs the program on some level. Republicans from Bush to Ben Carson have voiced some support for H-1B visas", and Rubio's push for a more ambitious, Microsoft-backed bill has drawn the ire of Sessions," who said Rubio's legislation would \""quash the dreams of more talented Americans.\"" \n\nDonald Trump has already shown a willingness to mock Rubio for his aggressive support for the Silicon Valley-backed policy. Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said the campaign is not planning to hit Cruz on the explosive issue", but Trump's hard line on immigration has helped shift the debate to the right on the campaign trail. \nTakeaways from the Republican debate\nBut given Cruz's ideological purity -- highlighted by a report on Monday from Heritage Action," a political group tied to the influential Heritage Foundation -- his support for H-1Bs may be the most attractive liability to attack. \nRepublican talkers have been Cruz's biggest gadflies. Cruz enjoys an unusually chummy relationship with conservative talk radio hosts -- joking before Tuesday night's debate that a leading trio in the industry should moderate future forums -- but some have turned on him. \nThe New Hampshire voter told Cruz that her brother in the tech industry might not vote for him because of his position -- which the brother learned about from talk radio. \n\""The rhetoric and the policy do not match","\"" Rick Santorum told CNN on Wednesday"," saying Cruz's motivation for increased legal immigration was \""purely political\"" and an attempt to win over business-friendly donors. \""This is a way of having a foot in both camps -- to sound very tough on illegal immigration", but to say," 'I'm going to take care of you by bringing in a whole bunch of people legally.'\""  \n\nThe unease with Cruz dates back to the 2013 Senate fight over immigration", when Rubio and Democratic leaders led an ill-fated push for comprehensive reform legislation that included a path to citizenship for the undocumented. Cruz fought the bill, but also argued for an amendment to increase in the cap on visas to 325,000, a position he has repeated during the 2016 race. \nBut after the 2013 bill died and the dust settled," Cruz continued to be excoriated by some of the movement's leading talkers for his stance.\n\""I don't care how many times Ted Cruz is held up by the tea party. Ted Cruz is identical to Marco Rubio","\"" radio host Michael Savage told his listeners in January 2014. \""Ted Cruz is not to be trusted. I told you he's a snake.\"" \nCruz's critics on the issue see room for hope: Cruz does not bring up the specific fivefold increase as often as he once did", opting for vaguer rhetoric. He chided donors and reporters in Tuesday night's debate for not seeing immigration as a pocketbook issue as opposed to a cultural one. And his radio interview last week could foreshadow the package of reforms that Sessions said Cruz is likely to introduce in the Senate over the coming months. \nRoy Beck, who leads NumbersUSA, a group supporting a reduction in immigration numbers," predicted that while Cruz is \""polishing some of the edges\"" with his new language"," his support for expanded H-1Bs would be used a political wedge to expose \""his real vulnerable spot.\"" \nUnless", of course," Cruz changes his position. \n\""I just see him month by month and shifting","\"" Beck said. \""As time goes on"," you could end up being in a really different place than nine months ago.\""\n \n"""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": ""Ted Cruz is facing criticism on the right over a surprising issue: immigration."""," ""title"": ""Why some conservatives are upset with Cruz on immigration"""," ""url"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/12/politics/ted-cruz-immigration-h1-b-visas/index.html"""," ""topics"": [""immigration""]"," ""people"": [""Rick Santorum"""," ""Catherine Frazier"""," ""Corey Lewandowski"""," ""Jeb Bush"""," ""Michael Savage"""," ""Hillary Clinton"""," ""Donald Trump"""," ""Marco Rubio"""," ""Roy Beck"""," ""Jeff Sessions"""," ""Michelle Malkin"""," ""Ben Carson"""," ""Ted Cruz""]"," ""orgs"": [""Heritage Foundation"""," ""Senate"""," ""Microsoft"""," ""GOP"""," ""United States.""]"," ""election_confidence"": 0.9999444621814779"," ""authors"": [{""author_id"": 23575"," ""fullname"": ""theodore schleifer"""," ""primary_org"": ""cnn""}]"," ""date_written"": ""2015-11-12 16:50:59"""," ""org"": ""cnn"""," ""article_id"": ""d971f3d0a0a46728ae572526130048fd"""," ""date_access"": ""2015-11-12 17:01:13.066404""}",

"{""body"": ""Washington  (CNN)Pledging to spend more money on the military was once an easy way for Republican presidential candidates to showcase their conservative bona fides.\nNot anymore.\nThe feud among Republicans over what it means to be a national security conservative was on clear display at this week's presidential debate", where Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator known for his libertarian leanings and non-interventionist foreign policy views," dug into Florida Sen. Marco Rubio over his plans to increase the defense budget by $1 trillion over the next 10 years without explaining how he would pay for the increase.\n\""How is it conservative to add a trillion dollars in military expenditures?\"" Rand Paul asked his opponent at Tuesday's Republican debate. \""You cannot be a conservative if you're going to keep promoting new programs that you're not going to pay for.\""\nRubio retorted swiftly: \""We can't even have an economy if we're not safe.\"" \nThe heated exchange exposed the fault lines in the GOP as conservatives grapple with a world that seems increasingly in turmoil and a country weighed down by mounting debt.\nIt also raises questions about the definition of a conservative national security policy"," where two of the ideology's traditional tenets -- a strong U.S. military and reduced government spending -- collide. Rubio and Rand are each trying to claim the mantle of being the \""true conservative\"" in an appeal to GOP primary voters", even though they take sharply opposing views on the issue.\nREAD: Takeaways from the Republican debate\nBoth senators' approaches have footholds in American conservatism, and which one ends up resonating more with voters could be as much a product of the current international security environment as ideological imperatives.\nPeter Berkowitz, a senior fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution," described \""a very difficult balancing act\"" for Republicans between the instinct for fiscal restraint and the deep-rooted conservative tradition of a strong national defense.\n\""There's something in my mind worrisome and off in declaring what the authentic conservative position is","\"" Berkowitz said. \""The better way to characterize the tradition is really an unending debate between these two sides.\""\nPaul and Rubio's views on U.S. defense spending are each aligned with two different Republican presidents: Dwight Eisenhower", who reined in defense spending, and Ronald Reagan, who ramped it up, according to fellow Hoover Institution scholar Kori Schake," a National Security Council aide in President George W. Bush's administration.\n\""There is really an enduring tension between the two", but it is certainly true that at least since Ronald Reagan, the reflexes of conservatism are for more defense spending, not less,"\"" Schake said.\nSchake said that Paul's arguments in favor of fiscal restraint might have gained more traction three years ago when conservatives accepted steep defense cuts as part of \""sequestration\"" to hold down the cost of the U.S. budget. But now", a downsized military, the rise of ISIS," instability in the Middle East and a more aggressive Russian posture are making a strong defense a priority for most conservatives.\n\""The world is looking a lot more dangerous and uncertain for America's safety in the last two", three years,"\"" Schake said. \""I do think there is an increased appreciation even among debt hawks that we want a wider margin of error"," we want a stronger military in order to deter challenges to America's security.\""\nBut Christopher Preble", the vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute," said he believes Rubio's plan to increase defense spending without offsetting the cost is simply \""not a conservative sentiment at all.\""\nAnd while the Republican foreign policy establishment has largely embraced the neoconservative belief in an aggressive American military stance abroad"," Preble said he believes that ideology represents a \""very small segment of the public at large"," including the Republican electorate.\""\nBut an August 2014 Pew Research Center poll showed that a slim majority of Americans believed Obama's foreign policy approach is \""not tough enough\"" -- a figure that soared to 81% among conservatives.\nNorman Ornstein", a political analyst at the neoconservative American Enterprise Institute, suggested Paul's argument in favor of a more scaled-down military will face significant headwinds since the GOP has pressed its message that Obama is too weak on the world stage and in confronting ISIS.\nInstead," Ornstein said Rubio probably \""had the upper hand\"" in the debate", with Rubio's hawkish position likely to be more attractive.\nREAD: Rand Paul: Clinton," Rubio both 'neoconservatives'\n\""The antipathy toward Obama is so great","\"" Ornstein said. \""If Obama's X", you want to be the opposite of X. So if the narrative in almost every case is Obama is getting taken to the cleaners by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, Obama is unable to deal with ISIS," unable to deal with China and you're out there saying I'm not going to do that -- that will probably help.\""\nIndeed", it's a calculation that most in the Republican field have made. Beyond Rubio, nearly every candidate from Jeb Bush to Chris Christie to Donald Trump has pledged to adapt a more robust posture in fighting ISIS and to build a stronger military to do so.\nBut both Rubio and his like-minded rivals as well as Paul have some claim to the conservative movement's sentiments on foreign policy. That's largely because views on foreign policy are in no way homogenous within the movement.\nIn Ornstein's word," on foreign policy there simply isn't a \""one-size-fits-all conservative mantle. \nAnd James Carafano", vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation," said Rubio and Paul's arguments are not necessarily incompatible.\n\""We had this kind of caricature of foreign policy that the choice in foreign policy is between invading everybody and every country or sitting at home and doing nothing","\"" Carafano said. \""I don't think that reflects the mainstream of where conservatives really are"," and I don't think that really reflects where the major candidates really are.\""\nHe concluded"," \""The reality of foreign policy is there is not a rule book"," and there is not a philosophical or ideological answer for every foreign policy problem.\""\n"""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": """""," ""title"": ""Can a conservative spend $1 trillion on defense?"""," ""url"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/12/politics/marco-rubio-rand-paul-conservative-debate-military-spending/index.html"""," ""topics"": [""foreign policy/national security""]"," ""people"": [""Rand Paul"""," ""Kori Schake"""," ""Chris Christie"""," ""Jeb Bush"""," ""George W.

"{""body"": ""A long-simmering debate over immigration in the Republican presidential contest boiled over on Thursday", as five contenders seized on the issue and Senator Ted Cruz accused his colleague, Senator Marco Rubio, of \u201ctrying to stuff amnesty down the throats of the American people.\u201d\n\nFrom appearances on conservative talk radio to the campaign trail in South Carolina, the candidates sought to appeal to grass-roots conservatives who are alarmed about immigration. And the eruption of open warfare between Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz, two establishment candidates who have been rising in the polls, showed the likely contours of the Republican presidential fight as it hurtles toward the Iowa caucuses in less than 90 days.\n\nImmigration is a key vulnerability for Mr. Rubio, who was initially part of an effort in 2013 to formulate a bipartisan bill in the Senate to reform the immigration system, an effort that is viewed with deep skepticism by conservatives.\n\nMr. Cruz, in an appearance with the conservative radio host Laura Ingraham, denounced Mr. Rubio without using his name, saying, \u201cYou know where someone is based on their actions. As the Scripture says, you shall know them based on their fruits.\u201d\n\nAnd three other lower-polling candidates \u2014 Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky; Rick Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator; and Carly Fiorina, a former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard \u2014 sought to join the fight, piling on Mr. Rubio or Mr. Cruz as insufficiently pure on a key litmus test for segments of the Republican base.\n\nThe long-distance exchanges illustrated the degree to which several candidates see immigration, which emerged as a key issue in the 2014 midterm elections, as the most potent weapon in their arsenal in a presidential contest that has been characterized by concerns about the direction of the country.\n\nMr. Rubio, when asked about Mr. Cruz\u2019s critique while campaigning Thursday morning, sought to turn the tables.\n\n\u201cTed is a supporter of legalizing people that are in this country illegally,\u201d Mr. Rubio said, according to a transcript provided by his aides. \u201cIn fact, when the Senate bill was proposed, he proposed legalizing people that were here illegally. He proposed giving them work permits. He\u2019s also supported a massive expansion of the green cards.\n\n\u201cHe supported a massive expansion of the H-1B program, a 500 percent increase,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo, if you look at it, I don\u2019t think our positions are dramatically different. I do believe that we have to deal with immigration reform in a serious way, and it begins by proving to people that illegal immigration is under control.\u201d\n\nIn his criticism of his Senate colleague, Mr. Cruz recalled that Mr. Rubio, the Florida senator who was a member of the so-called Gang of Eight group of lawmakers who sought to overhaul the immigration system, opposed measures to tighten border security.\n\n\u201cHe opposed every single one of them,\u201d Mr. Cruz, of Texas, said of amendments Mr. Rubio opposed that would have increased border-patrol resources, created a strong e-verify system and developed an exit-entry system for visa overstays. \u201cThe Gang of Eight voted against securing and enforcing the border.\u201d\n\nMr. Rubio now says that immigration must be handled in parts and that after the border is secured, new policies can be developed for dealing with immigrants who have entered the country illegally.

"{""body"": ""Sarah R. Coleman is a Ph.D. candidate in history at Princeton University and a fellow at the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia. \n (CNN)In Tuesday night's GOP debate", Donald Trump turned to history to provide a model for his plan to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, saying," \""Let me just tell you that Dwight Eisenhower", good president, great president. ... Moved a million and a half illegal immigrants out of this country, moved them just beyond the border. They came back. Moved them again, beyond the border," they came back. Didn't like it. Moved them way south. They never came back. Dwight Eisenhower.\""\nWhile not calling it by name"," Trump was praising Eisenhower's \""Operation Wetback","\"" which Trump claims significantly reduced unlawful immigration in the early 1950s. Here's the problem: It wasn't \""successful\"" then", by Trump's standard, and is not a model for a considered immigration policy now.  It was an inhumane program that sheds a harsh light on the supposedly tranquil Fifties and casts doubt on Trump's judgment.\nWith rising domestic political concern about illegal Mexican immigration in the early 1950s, President Eisenhower turned to his Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner, and his former West Point classmate, Gen. Joseph Swing, to undertake Operation Wetback \u2014 named for the derogatory term for Mexican immigrants that dates to the 1920s \u2014 with the cooperation and assistance of the Mexican government as historians have shown. \nIn a military-style action, beginning in June 1954 and continuing through 1955, immigration agents throughout the Southwest and, later, other parts of the United States, rounded up immigrants without legal status. The deportation program also had something Donald Trump might have loved \u2014 extensive publicity, as immigration officers were followed and photographed by journalists courted by government officials.\nINS agents began by blanketing communities with public notices encouraging undocumented workers to leave on their own accord, then soon turned to harsher methods, including sweeps and raids using jeeps, planes and ground teams. \nAs historian Mae Ngai related, while some immigrants were transported by plane or train to Mexico, a quarter of those deported were transported on cargo boats from Port Isabel, Texas, to Vera Cruz, Mexico," in an operation that a congressional investigation \u2014 convened in 1956 \u2014 compared to an \""18th century slave ship\"" and a \""penal hell ship.\""  \nCramped into inhumane sleeping spaces"," with \""filthy conditions","\"" \""crude\"" medical facilities", and no proper safety equipment, a riot broke out on one ship, and seven immigrants drowned on another.  Eighty-eight immigrants died of sunstroke during a roundup in 112-degree heat, while others were loaded tightly on trucks, driven south to Mexico and dumped in the desert. While the INS at the time claimed that the six-week operation netted 1.3 million deportations, scholars have suggested the numbers were far less.  \nDespite the U.S. government's major efforts, Operation Wetback was unsuccessful at curbing future unauthorized migration to the United States. At the same time, legal migration did increase, which was the main goal of the INS," which wanted to encourage farmers to hire workers legally through the \""Bracero\"" program", which allowed temporary contract workers to enter the United States.  \nBetween 1953 and 1955, INS more than doubled the number of Bracero visas and many of those legally contracted workers had previously worked illegally.  The Bracero program itself was marked by widespread abuse of workers. \nWhere immigration policy is concerned, Eisenhower is not the president to emulate, regardless of where one stands on the political spectrum.\nOperation Wetback is just one of many shameful episodes of forceful removal in American history, from the Trail of Tears, when members of several Native American nations were forcibly removed from their traditional lands and relocated farther west during the 19th century, to the forced relocation and incarceration of over 100,000 Japanese Americans during World War II.\n Like those events, Operation Wetback was a shameful violation of human rights," not a model for future policy.  \nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.\n"""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": """""," ""title"": ""Sorry"," Trump.
