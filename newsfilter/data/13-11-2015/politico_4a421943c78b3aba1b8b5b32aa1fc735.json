None are reported to have been invited to the new round either, although the delegations gathered are expected to try to decide which ones to invite in the future. The Syrians\u2019 exclusion prompted criticism that the world powers running the show were not accounting for the wishes of the Syrian people.\nBut deciding which Syrians to invite is not simple. There are numerous Syrian opposition and other groups, many of them not moderate by U.S. standards but acceptable to other countries. Kerry himself noted that a U.N. envoy has met with representatives of more than 230 Syrian groups, including the Syrian government of Bashar Assad.\n\u201cI want to be clear: the Syrian people will be the validators of this whole effort,\u201d Kerry said during a speech at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington, D.C. \u201cOur own special envoy, Michael Ratney, has also been in constant communication with Syrian representatives, and I have met with opposition leaders myself. So this is not about imposing anything on anyone.\u201d\nThe secretary acknowledged that Assad's future role remains a major sticking point among the U.S., Russia and Iran. All three countries now have military involvement in Syrian territory, although the U.S. says its role is restricted to battling the Islamic State terrorist network that has grabbed land there. Russia and Iran have backed Assad; the Obama administration wants him gone, as do the members of what Kerry described as the \u201cresponsible\u201d Syrian opposition.\n\u201cAsking the opposition to trust Assad or to accept Assad\u2019s leadership is simply not a reasonable request, and it is literally therefore a non-starter,\u201d Kerry said. \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The exclusion of rebel groups from recent peace talks stirred controversy.", "title": "Kerry: Syrian opposition should have a say", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/john-kerry-syrian-rebels-vienna-215802", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "trade"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Bashar Assad", "Doug Palmer", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "Steven Shepard", "Jenny Hopkinson", "Brian Mahoney", "Nahal Toosi", "Darius Tahir", "Caitlin Emma", "Rich Lowry", "Nick Gass", "Jack Shafer", "Bernie Becker", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Neera Tanden", "Noah Weiland", "Alex Isenstadt", "Jason Kander", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Paul Ryan", "Nicholas Vinocur", "Brianna Ehley", "Tim Starks", "John Kerry", "Jeremy Herb", "Tony Romm", "Daniel Strauss", "Rachana Pradhan", "Darren Goode", "Ben Carson", "Ben White", "Elena Schneider", "Rick Reed", "Eric Wolff", "Bernie Sanders", "Jeff Greenfield"], "orgs": ["Fed", "UFCW", "NAFTA", "Swift Boat", "Yale University", "U.N.", "Medal of Honor", "Drake University", "AT&T", "GOP", "WTO"], "election_confidence": 0.9428410227468178, "authors": [{"author_id": 30861, "fullname": "daniel strauss", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-12 20:28:21", "org": "politico", "article_id": "4a421943c78b3aba1b8b5b32aa1fc735", "date_access": "2015-11-12 20:44:17.479775"}
