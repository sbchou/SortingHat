You have to wait until Dec. 15 for Republicans to do it again.\nStory Continued Below\nTHE NARROWCAST DEBATE: POLITICO\u2019s Gabriel Debenedetti reports: Iowa, Iowa, Iowa. That\u2019s the not-particularly-subtle message pervading Democratic camps as the party\u2019s three remaining presidential candidates prep for their second debate Saturday night in Des Moines, a recognition that the first-caucusing state will likely play an even more outsized role than usual in 2016. \nWhile the direction of the questions may be squarely in the hands of debate host CBS News and moderator John Dickerson, each of the candidates has already started sharpening the message (and spin) that they think will specifically take them furthest with the state\u2019s influential voters. \u201cThe Nevada debate was more of a national debate,\u201d explained BERNIE SANDERS\u2019 lead strategist, Tad Devine, echoing the beliefs of other top Democrats. \u201cI do expect [this one] to be a debate that has more focus on Iowa.\"\nFor Sanders, that means heading north to his Burlington headquarters for two days starting Wednesday night to sit down with aides, and to scour briefing papers that include a deep-dive rundown on Iowa issues outlined by his staff on the ground there. He\u2019s agreed to participate in mock debate run-throughs \u2014 after being resistant to such standard pre-debate fare last time \u2014 and his staff expects that he'll prepare specific policy contrasts to unleash against front-runner HILLARY CLINTON before he flies out to Des Moines on Friday. http://politi.co/1METIPq\nTGIT, and welcome to your 2016 Blast.

Send your tips, complaints, and hottest hot takes to: hjackson@politico.com. \nTRAIL MIX: Here\u2019s what\u2019s popping on the campaign trail\nIn today\u2019s campaign news, the HILLARY CLINTON FBI probe seems to enter another stage and BERNIE SANDERS may have a photo flub to explain. On the GOP side, the cold war between MARCO RUBIO and TED CRUZ heats up, JEB BUSH gets his bro on, DONALD TRUMP picks a new fight, CHRIS CHRISTIE blames Obama and BEN CARSON\u2019s associations are questioned.\nTHE DAILY CLINTON\nFBI DIGGING IN: Fox News reports the FBI \u201chas expanded its probe of HILLARY CLINTON\u2019s emails, with agents exploring whether multiple statements violate a federal false statements statute, according to intelligence sources familiar with the ongoing case \u2026 This phase represents an expansion of the FBI probe, which is also exploring potential violations of an Espionage Act provision relating to \"gross negligence\" in the handling of national defense information.\u201d http://fxn.ws/1MDm0dc\nFASTER, PLEASE: POLITICO\u2019s Josh Gerstein reports: \u201cA federal judge issued an order Thursday that will sharply ramp up the volume of documents being release in a lawsuit demanding memos and emails from top aides to former Secretary of State HILLARY CLINTON \u2026 U.S. District Court Judge Rudolph Contreras instructed the State Department to move toward production of 2,200 pages of documents per month \u2026 The schedule virtually guarantees that a significant volume of records about Clinton, who is the leading Democratic candidate for president, will be emerging through the primary and caucus season and into the heart of the general election next fall.\u201d http://politi.co/1WPCxBz \nTHIRD TERM WATCH: Time: HILLARY CLINTON\u2019s campaign released a video on Thursday that attacks \u201cRepublican candidates for seeking to roll back President Obama\u2019s policies \u2026 The 28-second campaign video provides a window into the kind of contrast Clinton will set with the Republicans in a general election, with the campaign painting Republican candidates as backward-looking and out of touch.\u201d http://ti.me/1PEwcTN \nCURBING COAL: The Wall Street Journal: \u201cHILLARY CLINTON on Thursday released a $30 billion plan aimed at revitalizing communities dependent on coal production, seeking to mitigate the economic impact of the nation\u2019s shift from an electricity source that is both plentiful and polluting.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1SmV3ui \nUNDENTED: The New York Times: Despite amped up attacks from BERNIE SANDERS, the Vermont senator \u201chas failed to significantly dent HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON\u2019s lead \u2026 according to a New York Times/CBS News survey released on Thursday \u2026 Clinton has support from 52 percent of Democratic primary voters, while Mr. Sanders has backing from 33 percent, the poll found. In an early October CBS News poll, she led Mr. Sanders 56 percent to 32 percent.\u201d http://nyti.ms/1Ma5Jem \nTHE PROGRESSIVE RESISTANCE\nPHONY PHOTO?: Time reports that several University of Chicago alums are casting doubt on a photo that BERNIE SANDERS campaign has touted as showing his roots as an activist, leading a civil rights protest. \u201cFour University of Chicago alumni who went to school with Sanders (said) they believe that the dramatic photo of Sanders, which his campaign has featured on its website and in a promotional video, is not in fact a photograph of Sanders. An archivist at the University of Chicago agreed in January that Sanders was not the speaker in the photo.\u201d http://ti.me/1Ma6J23\nNOVEMBER SURPRISE: POLITICO\u2019s Eliza Collins reports: \u201cIn a blow to HILLARY CLINTON, former Ohio state senator and minority whip Nina Turner is throwing her support behind BERNIE SANDERS. The move is a surprise, considering how involved Turner has been with the Clintons. The former secretary of state met with Turner in October before her appearance at the Women's Leadership Forum. While she never formally endorsed Clinton, Turner was also involved in the Ready for Hillary super PAC, appeared at a Clinton organizing event, and served on the pro-Clinton super PAC Correct the Record until recently.\u201d http://politi.co/1N04G4k\nHOLLYWOOD HUNK: The Hollywood Reporter: It-guy actor Ryan Gosling, who turned 35 today, asked his Twitter followers to \u201cdo him a solid\u201d to celebrate his birthday by passing around a BERNIE SANDERS campaign video called \u201cCompassion.\u201d http://bit.ly/1WUPiWa \nTURNING THE (WOOD) SCREWS: MassLive.com reports MARTIN O\u2019MALLEY \u201ccalled on IKEA to immediately recognize Massachusetts employees' decision to unionize, stressing that he stands with the Stoughton-based workers. In a letter to IKEA U.S. President Lars Petersson, (O\u2019Malley) pointed to warehouse workers in Perryville, Md. who have formed a union \u2026 that he said \u2018allows them to share in the company's success.\u2019\u201d http://bit.ly/1PqC6sU \nTRUMP ON THE STUMP\nDARK ARTIST: POLITICO\u2019s Alex Isenstadt reports DONALD TRUMP\u2019s campaign \u201chas been in talks with Rick Reed, a veteran Republican operative known for his bare-knuckle TV ad campaigns \u2026 Reed, a mainstay of GOP politics, has served as a strategist for a number of conservative causes. During the 2004 presidential race, he was a chief architect of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth effort to take down John Kerry.\u201d http://politi.co/1WPrurY \nAWKWARD EMBRACE: Buzzfeed: \u201cWhite supremacists are praising DONALD TRUMP for citing a 1950s U.S. government policy that deported hundreds of thousands of Mexican immigrants. After Trump mentioned the policy, called \u201cOperation Wetback,\u201d at Tuesday night\u2019s Republican presidential debate, Richard B. Spencer, the president of the white nationalist National Policy Institute, tweeted, \u2018Operation Wetback, (expletive) yeah!\u2019\u201d http://bzfd.it/1lmd6Xt \nTEXAS TIE: DONALD TRUMP and home state Sen. TED CRUZ are joint leaders in a new poll of Texas by the Texas Tribune and the University of Texas. http://bit.ly/1HE7W2R \nCARSON\u2019S COURSE \nFRIEND WITHOUT BENEFITS: The Associated Press: \u201cRepublican presidential contender BEN CARSON has maintained a business relationship with a close friend convicted of defrauding insurance companies and testified on his behalf, even as the candidate has called for such crimes to be punished harshly. Pittsburgh dentist Alfonso A. Costa pleaded guilty to a felony count of health care fraud after an FBI probe into his oral surgery practice found he had charged for procedures he never performed, according to court records.\u201d http://nbcnews.to/1OGrKoR \n\u2018BEST FRIEND\u2019: Bloomberg: Carson reiterated Thursday that Costa was his \u201cbest friend\u201d and defended him in a statement. http://bloom.bg/1WUWT72 \nRUBIO\u2019S RACE\nIMMIGRATION DEFENSE: The Island Packet: \u201cMARCO RUBIO defended his proposal to combat illegal immigration and his support of a 2013 immigration reform bill during his first presidential campaign stop on Hilton Head Island on Thursday morning \u2026 \"The American people do not trust the federal government to enforce our immigration laws,\" Rubio said. \"If you want to fix the mess we have on immigration in this country, it begins with a very concrete step -- proving to the American people that illegal immigration is under control. Actually doing it and proving it to people.\" http://bit.ly/1HEjJhD \nHAPPENING NOW: POLITICO\u2019s Daniel Strauss reports: \u201cThe immigration squabble among the Republican presidential contenders has turned into an all-out brawl between TED CRUZ and MARCO RUBIO, with the two senators challenging each other's conservative credentials on the hot-button issue.\u201d Cruz took shots on Laura Ingraham\u2019s talk show while Rubio said Cruz of supported legalizing people who entered the country illegally. http://politi.co/1SmUdOn \nTHE DEBATE CRASHER: The Daily Beast wonders why David Rivera -- a controversial, scandal-soaked former congressman and friend of MARCO RUBIO\u2019s \u2013 keeps showing up at Republican debates. Rubio\u2019s campaign denies it has given him tickets. \"If he was there, he didn't get [a ticket] from us,\" Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. \"I don't know anything about his whereabouts.\" http://thebea.st/1iXLMgn \nTED\u2019S TRIP\nDUMP ON TRUMP: The Boston Herald: TED CRUZ registered for the New Hampshire primary on Thursday and took a whack at DONALD TRUMP. Cruz \u201cclaimed he\u2019s been a more consistent conservative than ... Trump. \u2026 \u2018I think the distinguishing factor that every Republican primary voter is looking for is distinguishing between campaign conservatives -- people who talk a good game on the trail, but haven\u2019t walked the walk -- and a consistent conservative,\u2019 Cruz told reporters. http://bit.ly/1PqplyL\nNO SWEETENER: The Associated Press gives more background on a potential fault line between TED CRUZ and MARCO RUBIO -- sugar subsidies. \u201cSome conservatives, like Cruz, want to get rid of the program, which supports prices and protects growers from foreign competition. But sugar supports have for decades been unassailable in Congress, partly due to wide bipartisan support from lawmakers representing states from Florida to North Dakota that grow sugar cane and sugar beets.\u201d http://bit.ly/1Lcypzy \nNOT A FAN: Gawker looks at Bob Dole\u2019s reaction when asked about TED CRUZ. \u201cDole announces jovially, \u2018There are a lot of good candidates.

He turns to the women at his right. \u2018Except\u2026\u2019 he whispers. \u2018Except for Cruz.\u2019 Then, the 92-year-old man begins to giggle. Over his deep sense of loathing for TED CRUZ, Bob Dole giggles.\u201d http://bit.ly/1WPyHIJ \nJEB\u2019S JOURNEY\nALL SYSTEMS BRO: POLITICO\u2019s Nolan McCaskill takes a look at the ways JEB BUSH has been upping the machismo of his campaign. \u201cThe self-described introvert has gone on a bro spree, trying to prove to voters that he has the guts and determination to dominate the still unwieldy GOP field.\u201d http://politi.co/1Mqn3tB \nBIG SPENDER: NBC reports that JEB BUSH and his allies are spending more than the other presidential campaigns, \u201coutpacing the nearest competition by more than 2-to-1, according to ad-spending numbers from NBC News partner SMG Delta.
