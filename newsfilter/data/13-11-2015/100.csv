"{""body"": "" (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 For months", Marco Rubio's campaign team in South Carolina operated out of a staffer's garage, plotting strategy for the first-in-the-South primary from freshly painted yard sale furniture and tiny classroom desks.\nThe shoestring budget setup was a point of pride for the Republican presidential candidate's team. Now, with Rubio enjoying a burst of momentum as the early voting contests edge closer, the Florida senator's campaign is moving beyond its lean and mean roots.\nOn Wednesday," Rubio's South Carolina team officially moved out of the garage and into a proper campaign headquarters \u00e2\u0080\u0094 though they brought some of the yard sale furniture along with them.\n\""This election could very well be decided in this state","\"" Rubio told the crowd gathered at the office in Columbia", South Carolina's capital.\nRubio's team also opened offices in Nevada a few weeks ago. His staff grew by about 30 percent in October, with more than 70 people now on the campaign payroll. The new hires include communications and digital advisers, as well as field workers to boost voter contact and advance staff to help set up larger and more frequent events in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada," the first four states to vote in the nomination contest.\nWhether Rubio can effectively build up his campaign infrastructure in those states may determine whether he can turn his natural political talents and easy appeal with GOP voters into primary victories.\n\""Everywhere I go I hear folks talking about him","\"" said Glenn McCall"," a Republican National Committeeman from South Carolina. \""So it's the right time to come into the state"," set up shop and set up more time here.\""\nWhile Rubio's advisers say they're simply executing the next phase in a carefully crafted campaign blueprint", there's no doubt the team's early penny-pinching was driven in part by necessity. The senator's fundraising has been underwhelming and his money totals trailed several rivals through summer and fall, including a lackluster $6 million haul in third financial reporting period of the year.\nBut buoyed by strong performances in the last two GOP debates, Rubio has been attracting more high-dollar donors, including billionaire investor Paul Singer and New York hedge fund manager Cliff Asness.\nWith more cash in the pipeline, Rubio is expected to spend more money on travel to early voting states and on larger events aimed at putting him in front of as many voters as possible. Rubio communications director Alex Conant pointed to a 450-person event in New Hampshire last week and a similar sized event in Davenport, Iowa, on Wednesday as examples of the type of settings the candidate will appear at more regularly.\nRubio's more robust travel plans are welcome news to some Republicans in early voting states who have griped for months that the senator wasn't spending enough time on the ground meeting with donors and wooing important backers. While some candidates have all but taken up residency in Iowa and New Hampshire," Rubio has been a more sporadic presence.\n\""He's recognizing that in order to win in New Hampshire", you need to be available to voters \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not just once or twice but more often than that,"\"" said Donna Sytek"," a prominent New Hampshire Republican. She called Rubio an \""attractive candidate\"" but said she's also still considering Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina.\nRubio's backers believe the campaign's fiscal caution has already been validated by the early money woes of other candidates. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker quickly built a large and expensive operation", but was forced to withdraw from the race after just two months when his fundraising stopped covering his bills. And despite raising more than $100 million for his super PAC, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush slashed payroll spending by 40 percent after campaign fundraising slowed.\nTo be sure," the Rubio team's tales of cheapness have helped the campaign define the Florida senator as a scrappy underdog taking on wealthier rivals. Campaign manager Terry Sullivan has bragged about sticking Rubio on budget airline Frontier \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which he called \""a special kind of hell\"" \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and touted his rule of personally approving expenses over $500.\nAt one of the campaign's Nevada offices", staffers tried to do their part to live up to the less is more mantra. After noticing a pizza place next to a campaign office had free wireless internet that required a password, a staffer walked over and bought two pieces of pizza and asked for the internet access code.\nBut the cost-cutting measure was short-lived. After about three weeks," the pizza place caught on and asked the Rubio team to stop.\n_\nPace reported from Washington.

The union was unmoved by Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent opposition to the Trans Pacific Partnership, an Asian free trade agreement that unions have fought and that Mr. Sanders has long opposed.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe should judge candidates not by their political party, not by what they say, not by what we think they stand for, but by what they do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Dimondstein said.\nHe also noted Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-time efforts to fight privatization of the U.S. Postal Service, and to keep\u00c2\u00a0post offices and mail facilities open amid budget cuts.\nWhile union membership nationally has declined, the labor movement plays an important role in elections because of its ability to turn out like-minded voters to the polls.\nMrs. Clinton still has far more labor support than her rival, owing to her longtime ties with union leaders, generally liberal positions, and a belief among many that she is the most electable Democrat running. So far, she has won endorsements of 12 national unions, including a few of the largest in the nation such as the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the American Federation of Teachers, each of which have 1.6 million members.\nBy contrast, the postal workers union has about 200,000 members. Mr. Sanders also has support of one other major national union, the National Nurses United, with nearly 185,000 members.\nMr. Sanders, a Vermont senator, had courted labor in general and the postal workers in particular, speaking to some 2,000 members at the union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s October conference in Las Vegas. In its announcement, the union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national executive board said it was encouraging members to participate in Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rallies and join Labor for Bernie, a grassroots group of supporters from unions, including some who have endorsed Mrs. Clinton and others that remain neutral.\nMore:\nOn Keystone, Obama Missed an Opportunity\nPopulism on the Rise in GOP Race\n______________________________________________________\n2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll Standings\n\n\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops. \r\n\nCapital Journal Daybreak Newsletter: Sign up to get the latest on politics, policy and defense delivered to your inbox every morning.\r\nFor the latest Washington news, follow @wsjpolitics\r\nFor outside analysis," follow @wsjthinktank"""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": ""The postal workers union is announcing its endorsement of Sen.

Kasich has made no bones about his strain of compassionate conservatism that can ring hollow to evangelical voters and those looking for a true political outsider. But as Tuesday night evolved into a contest of conservative bona fides, Kasich appeared even more out of step with the rest of the GOP field, and came off as edgy, interrupting his rivals throughout the two-hour event.\u201d http://politi.co/1kOMyh1\n \nHOW JEB COULD STILL DO IT -- \u201cBush Is 2016\u2019s John Kerry,\u201d by Bill Scher, senior writer at the Campaign for America\u2019s Future, on Politico: \u201cKerry\u2019s [2004 primary] victory was not predicated on getting a personality transplant. He stuck to his boring script, used his personal finances to keep the campaign afloat and waited for everyone else\u2019s weaknesses to become apparent. Once the others flopped, voters flocked to him as a safe harbor. Written off a few months earlier, Kerry ended up running the table, winning virtually every primary and caucus. Bush is in the same position Kerry was in November of 2003: floundering with the public yet surrounded by untested candidates and stocked with institutional resources. These are the necessary ingredients for outlasting the competition.\u201d http://politi.co/1Qk1JvJ\n \n--PEGGY NOONAN, on \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d re Jeb\u2019s debate: \u201cI think he achieved adequacy.\u201d\n \nJEB\u2019S BASE? \u201cBush plans major D.C. fundraiser,\u201d by Alex Isenstadt: \u201cThose involved with the planning of the event, which is to be held on the evening of Dec. 3 at the home of former Ambassador Boyden Gray, said it would be one of Bush\u2019s largest Washington fundraisers since he formally launched his candidacy last summer. \u2026 [T]he host committee \u2026 includes over two dozen current members of Congress and over 60 lobbyists, fundraisers and financial players.\n\u201cAmong the names listed on the invitation are Sens.

Many Republican elites are once again celebrating him as the party\u2019s golden boy, \u2026 and fear seeing him bruised too badly during the primary season. \u2026 Asked why Bush did not scrutinize Rubio during the Milwaukee exchange, campaign manager Danny Diaz said the debate \u2018was a serious one where important issues were discussed,\u2019 and he urged reporters to stay tuned for the next debate on Dec. 15.\u201d http://wapo.st/1MYBjza\n \nARTICLE OF THE DAY -- \u201cHow the Kochs created Joni Ernst: New details reveal the billionaire brothers\u2019 network efforts to reshape the GOP are more ambitious than previously reported,\u201d by Ken Vogel: \u201c[T]he network\u2019s financial support for [now-Sen. Joni] Ernst [of Iowa] \u2015 detailed here for the first time \u2015 offers the first signs of a move into GOP primaries. The Kochs and their allies are investing in a pipeline to identify, cultivate and finance business-oriented candidates from the local school board all the way to the White House, and Koch operatives are already looking for opportunities to challenge GOP incumbents deemed insufficiently hardline in their opposition to government spending and corporate subsidies.\n\u201cThe ambitious effort, spearheaded partly by a for-profit consulting firm called Aegis Strategic that\u2019s backed by the Koch network, is one of several ways in which the brothers and their allies are seeking to influence the types of candidates who carry the GOP banner. The network has taken on a vetting role in the GOP presidential primary, offering favored candidates access to its donors and activists. And some within the network have even advocated targeting from six to 12 GOP House members who have run afoul of the Koch orthodoxy on fiscal issues and who are facing 2016 primary challenges.\u201d http://politi.co/1M8QCBS\n--\u201cCharles Koch has no plans to back a candidate in Republican primary,\u201d by USA Today\u2019s Fredreka Schouten: \u201c\u2018I have no plans to support anybody in the primary now.\u2019\u201d http://usat.ly/1iWm4sp\n \n** A message from Veteran Jobs Mission: One million veterans hired.

"{""body"": ""Washington (CNN)Marco Rubio insisted he learned his lesson when he abandoned his controversial immigration bill: Congress could not tackle such an issue in a comprehensive fashion.\nBut on the campaign trail"," Rubio says he's open to the most controversial aspect of that plan: a pathway to citizenship for the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants. Rubio laid out this week a list of criteria illegal immigrants would have to meet to earn citizenship -- mirroring the controversial Gang of Eight bill that he has methodically been distancing himself from after it passed the Senate in 2013.\n\""I personally am open to that","\"" he said of a \""very long\"" path to citizenship on National Public Radio.\nThe comments drew Rubio back into the fray of an issue that has dogged him with the right wing of the party since he first tried to tackle it in 2012. He has tried to project himself as a leader trying to fix a vexing issue", while also trying to be sensitive to the anger from the GOP base.\nBut by playing to both sides, Rubio has sparked criticism from the left and right and prompted sharp charges that he's choosing his position for political expediency. It's a sign that the issue is only going to heat up as he continues to ascend in the GOP race.\nSen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, an immigration hardliner and an aggressive opponent of the 2013 bill," told CNN on Thursday that GOP candidates should drop out of the race if they back a path to citizenship.\n\""Supporting citizenship for illegal immigrants should be disqualifying","\"" Sessions said when asked about Rubio's position. \""Just like we can't have a GOP nominee who supports Obamacare"," we can't have a GOP nominee who supports amnesty.\""\nAlabama Rep. Mo Brooks said in an interview that Rubio's position on immigration would \""very significantly\"" depress conservative voter turnout in a general election if he were the nominee.\n\""When I see what Marco has said and done", along with other presidential candidates, that is: Their actions and their comments are a definite concern because they undermine the ability of American families to earn enough to take care of themselves,"\"" said Brooks", a conservative Republican who backs Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for the nomination.\nOn Thursday, Rubio tried to muddy the waters even further by telling reporters that Cruz was aligned with his position on immigration reform," citing positions on H-1B visas and other matters that the Texan took during the 2013 battle. \nREAD: Why some conservatives are upset with Ted Cruz on immigration\n\""I don't think our positions are dramatically different","\"" Rubio said. \nBut Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said the Florida senator has made clear he  now opposes moving on a bill in a comprehensive fashion"," saying Washington must enact individual pieces of immigration reform -- starting with border and interior enforcement -- before debating a path to citizenship.\n\""What he has said is that the Gang of Eight bill is dead", and it's not coming back and it has even less support now than it did two years ago,"\"" Conant said Thursday. \""It's clear that the only way that the way to fix the broken immigration system is by first securing the border.\""\n\nIn April 2012"," a 41-year-old Rubio called a small group of reporters into his conference room to announce a rather bold step: He wanted to offer some children of undocumented immigrants the opportunity to apply for \""non-immigrant\"" visas before they would be allowed to earn a more permanent legal status.\nThe plan stopped short of offering a full-blown path to citizenship", as Democrats wanted. But it elevated his stature and showcased his willingness to dive in the choppy immigration waters -- just as the GOP's presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, had veered right on the issue and was considering picking him as the party's vice presidential nominee.\nBut in June 2012, Rubio gave up on that plan. President Barack Obama, in an election-year move," took executive action to defer deportations to certain undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. Rubio said such executive actions undermined an effort to do anything legislatively.\n\""People are going to say to me", 'Why are we going to need to do anything on this now. It has been dealt with. We can wait until after the election,"'\"" Rubio told the Wall Street Journal at the time. \""And it is going to be hard to argue against that.\""\nAfter Romney was routed with Hispanic voters in the 2012 elections", a bipartisan group of senators began negotiating behind the scenes to put together a sweeping proposal that they intended to push through Congress in 2013, when Democrats controlled the Senate and occupied the White House.\nREAD: Bush on Rubio: 'I'm a better bet' against Clinton\nFor months, Rubio was flirting with the group and privately negotiating details, but hadn't made a formal decision about signing onto the legislative proposal until April 2013," when he went on all the Sunday talk shows to aggressively defend the effort.\n\""This is not blanket amnesty","\"" Rubio said at the time.\nAs the measure headed to the Senate floor", Rubio sided with fellow negotiators to defeat any controversial amendments aimed at changing the structure of the plan. He voted against an amendment by Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, to require the completion of 700 miles of\nfencing at the border before allowing the pathway to citizenship plan to move forward. And he opposed a plan by Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, requiring that the country's biometric entry-exit system of tracking people crossing the border is fully implemented before giving legal status to undocumented immigrants.\nMoments before the bill's passage, Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants," said: \""Generations of unfulfilled dreams will finally come to pass","\"" adding: \""That's why I support this reform.\""\n\nBut after the bill's passage", Rubio began to speak much less frequently about the matter. Even though the rest of the Gang of Eight was still meeting regularly to strategize over how to ratchet up pressure on House Republicans to take up the bill, Rubio refused to do so, saying that the issue was now in the hands of the GOP-led House, which never called the plan up for a vote.\nBy taking that approach, Rubio began to make amends with many conservatives who were furious at his position, but he angered fellow proponents of immigration reform who believed he was caving to political pressure.\nIn an interview with CNN last week, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., one of the co-authors of the bill," said Rubio was initially \""totally committed\"" to the Gang of Eight plan and that his fingerprints were \""all over\"" the creation of a pathway to citizenship.\n\""The fact that he abandoned the bill so quickly because a bunch of right-wing commentators came out against it will not serve him well in his presidential campaign primary or general if he ever got there","\"" Schumer said.\nBy 2014", Rubio began to blame the president for scuttling immigration reform, saying voters had lost trust with him on enforcing existing law since Obama has acted, in his opinion, illegally by the executive actions he's taken. The crisis at the Southern border, where scores of undocumented children were trying to enter the country last summer," made it even harder politically for Rubio to defend the bill. And he has increasingly said that doing anything legislatively in such a major fashion would be a mistake.\n\""Every massive piece of legislation that has passed over the last 20 years has by and large been disastrous","\"" Rubio told Politico in April.\nIn recent days", Rubio's immigration position has begun to come into sharp focus, even though he was spared from the back-and-forth during the GOP presidential debate in Milwaukee earlier this week.\nDespite being an early proponent to give relief to children who arrived in the country illegally at a young age," Rubio has made clear that the president's deferred action program must \""end.\"" He\ncosponsored a bill last month to crack down on sanctuary cities.\nREAD: Marco Rubio's quip about welders gets torched\nRubio has dismissed Donald Trump's call to round up and deport the 11 million illegal immigrants as not \""reasonable","\"" but he added that some undocumented immigrants would be deported.\n\""There are going to be people who are going to have to be deported","\"" Rubio said in Hilton Head"," South Carolina on Thursday. \""Criminals will be deported. People who have not been here long enough will be deported. We will enforce our immigration laws.\""\nYet", Rubio has signaled an openness to eventually let the 11 million undocumented apply for citizenship, after paying back taxes and fines and taking other punitive steps -- echoing the call in the Gang of Eight plan that would have created a 13-year pathway to citizenship. But that would only happen, he said, after separate individual pieces of immigration reform are enacted," including border security and fixing the existing legal immigration system.\nSome on the right are still not satisfied.\n\""Republican voters are tired of leaders who promote an immigration agenda that serves everyone's interests but theirs","\"" Sessions said.\nCNN's Sunlen Serfaty contributed to this report"""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": ""Marco Rubio insisted he learned his lesson when he abandoned his controversial immigration bill: Congress could not tackle such an issue in a comprehensive fashion."""," ""title"": ""Rubio's immigration muddle"""," ""url"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/12/politics/marco-rubio-2016-immigration/index.html"""," ""topics"": [""immigration""]"," ""people"": [""Donald Trump"""," ""Mitt Romney"""," ""John Thune"""," ""Alex Conant"""," ""Sunlen Serfaty"""," ""Chuck Schumer"""," ""Marco Rubio"""," ""Barack Obama"""," ""David Vitter"""," ""Mo Brooks"""," ""Jeff Sessions"""," ""Ted Cruz""]"," ""orgs"": [""Senate"""," ""National Public Radio"""," ""Congress"""," ""GOP""]"," ""election_confidence"": 0.9623076451890491"," ""authors"": [{""author_id"": 30737"," ""fullname"": ""manu raju"""," ""primary_org"": ""politico""}"," {""author_id"": 23293"," ""fullname"": ""senior political reporter"""," ""primary_org"": ""cnn""}]"," ""date_written"": ""2015-11-12 23:58:03"""," ""org"": ""cnn"""," ""article_id"": ""e16ea4d2b25a5f617f185acef3964eaa"""," ""date_access"": ""2015-11-13 00:19:30.420644""}",
