David Vitter's Louisiana gubernatorial campaign features \"Duck Dynasty\" star Willie Robertson offering his forgiveness to Vitter.\nVitter, wearing camouflage, stands next to Robertson throughout the 30-second spot, which continues Vitter's recent strategy of confronting his 2007 prostitution scandal, albeit indirectly, and shifting the conversation to his political conservatism. \nStory Continued Below\n\"David and I have been out in the woods today. I know he's made some mistakes, but who hasn't? The whole story of the Bible is about redemption,\" Robertson says in the ad. \"I'm concerned about our state.\" \n\"That's right, Willie,\" Vitter responds. \"What defines us in life is how we get up and earn redemption. Where we are as a state is needing to get up based on strong conservative principles, and that's what I'm leading with.\"\n\"Man, you need to grow a better beard,\" Robertson says to the clean-shaven Vitter.\n\"You'll need to talk to Wendy about that,\" Vitter replies, referring to his wife.\n\n\n\n            By \nNolan D. McCaskill\n\nThe Robertson clan's political record is mixed. They endorsed a failed congressional candidate in 2014 and have backed incumbent Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's faltering presidential bid.\nPolls show Vitter, once a heavy favorite, trailing Democratic state Rep. John Bel Edwards. Shortly after the ad's release, Edwards' campaign blasted out a 2014 Baton Rouge Advocate article where Vitter declares: \"I'm not even running to gain a cameo appearance on 'Duck Dynasty.'\"\nJohn Brabender is Vitter's long-time media consultant.\nWatch the ad, \"David and Willie,\" here.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Vitter ad stars Duck Dynasty&apos;s Willie Robertson", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/david-vitter-duck-dynasty-willie-robertson-campaig-ad-215805", "topics": ["trade", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Elena Schneider", "Richard Shelby", "Steven Shepard", "John Brabender", "Jenny Hopkinson", "Kevin Robillard", "Brian Mahoney", "Jeremy Herb", "Nahal Toosi", "Josh Gerstein", "Bobby Jindal", "Darius Tahir", "Jeff Greenfield", "Rich Lowry", "Nick Gass", "Jack Shafer", "Bernie Becker", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Neera Tanden", "Noah Weiland", "Alex Isenstadt", "Bernie Sanders", "Jason Kander", "Jake Sherman", "Darren Goode", "Paul Ryan", "Eric Wolff", "David Vitter", "Tim Starks", "Zachary Warmbrodt", "Brianna Ehley", "Tony Romm", "Daniel Strauss", "Willie Robertson", "Ben White", "Doug Palmer", "Rick Reed", "Eliza Collins", "Ben Carson", "Caitlin Emma"], "orgs": ["Fed", "Congress", "Swift Boat", "UFCW", "NAFTA", "Medal of Honor", "U.N.", "Yale University", "Drake University", "AT&T", "GOP", "WTO"], "election_confidence": 0.99645543289971, "authors": [{"author_id": 30899, "fullname": "zachary warmbrodt", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-12 22:31:33", "org": "politico", "article_id": "124ee6823f3229189500af40b3b42806", "date_access": "2015-11-12 23:00:12.563827"}
