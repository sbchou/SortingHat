Rubio's membership in the group, which unsuccessfully shepherded a comprehensive immigration reform effort in 2013, has haunted him since.\n\"Talk is cheap,\" Cruz continued, saying Rubio's actions disprove any claim that he's as conservative as Cruz on the topic. Cruz later added that the Florida senator opposed a set of amendments introduced by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and himself. \n\"He opposed every single one of them, every single amendment,\" Cruz said. \"The 'Gang of Eight' voted as a gang against enforcing and securing the border.\" \nRubio, in roughly the same bracket of hours Thursday morning, took a few shots at Cruz while campaigning in South Carolina, hitting the Texas senator from the right.\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\n\"Ted is a supporter of legalizing people that are in this country illegally. In fact, when the Senate bill was proposed, he proposed legalizing people that were here illegally,\" Rubio said during a campaign stop in Hilton Head, according to a readout from his campaign. \"He proposed giving them work permits. He's also supported a massive expansion of the green cards. He supported a massive expansion of the H-1B program, a 500% increase. So, if you look at it, I don't think our positions are dramatically different. I do believe that we have to deal with immigration reform in a serious way, and it begins by proving to people that illegal immigration is under control.\" \nA Cruz aide shot back that Rubio's comments were not an accurate indicator of where the Texas senator stands on immigration. \n\"Laughably FALSE. No one fought harder to prevent Gang of 8's amnesty bill than Ted Cruz. Record is remarkably clear,\" Cruz rapid response director Brian Phillips tweeted. \nThe tinder fueling the fighting between Cruz and Rubio has been growing for some time now. Cruz has styled himself as a hard-liner on immigration reform, and opponents of Rubio often accuse him of flipping back and forth on immigration reform, notably taking a rightward turn recently in throwing his support behind legislation cracking down on sanctuary cities. \nOther candidates looked to join in on the skirmishing that started during Tuesday night debate's in Milwaukee. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum tried to get into the mix by tweeting out on Thursday a link to a clip of Cruz describing how he's introduced \"two amendments to significantly expand legal immigration, to double the caps on legal immigration from 675,000 to 1.3 million and to increase temporary high skilled workers by 500 percent.\"\nIt is clear what candidate is not a real conservative on immigration. Watch @tedcruz in 2013. https://t.co/TlCUYfgOi4\n\u2014 Rick Santorum (@RickSantorum) November 12, 2015\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul, in a separate interview with Ingraham, moved to jab Rubio on his tax plan by tying it to immigration. \n\"I think Rubio's plan would explode payments to illegal aliens. And this is a real problem. Until we fix the current tax credits, do we really want to double and triple the amount of tax credits we're giving? I mean really, $4 billion to illegal aliens? I think Rubio's tax plan will extend more tax credits to illegal aliens, and I think there's no way in the world that we should be supporting something like this,\" Paul said. \n\n\n\n            By \nSeung Min Kim\n\nImmigration has become a central litmus test among conservatives this cycle, especially after billionaire Donald Trump kicked off his presidential run with a bold promise to build a massive wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and later pledged to deport more than 11 million undocumented immigrants. He noticeably pushed the field further right on the issue, after the Republican Party tried to find a more central position in the wake of Mitt Romney's bruising loss in 2012.\nThe two candidates currently leading in the polls \u2014 Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson \u2014 also tangled in the wake of Tuesday's debate. \nCarson said in an interview with The Washington Examiner on Wednesday that Trump's moves to build a wall along the border would backfire in the long run. \"I think there are enough people who know that there are others in the race that are very reasonable,\" Carson said. \"I don't think he necessarily is the representation of the Republican Party \u2014 far from it.\"\nOn Thursday, Trump hit back, tweeting: \"Wow, pres. candidate Ben Carson, who is very weak on illegal Immigration, just said he likes amnesty and a pathway to citizenship.\"\nIt wasn't the first time on Thursday that Trump banged the stronger borders drum, tweeting earlier in the day: \"We, as a country, either have borders or we don't. IF WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS, WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY!\"\nEliza Collins contributed to this report. \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Practically the entire GOP field is throwing around accusations, but the fight between the two senators got especially nasty.", "title": "Immigration brawl breaks out between Cruz and Rubio", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/ted-cruz-marco-rubio-immigration-fight-215794", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Rick Santorum", "Doug Palmer", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "Donald Trump", "Ted Cruz", "Steven Shepard", "Jenny Hopkinson", "Brian Mahoney", "Nahal Toosi", "Darius Tahir", "Caitlin Emma", "Rich Lowry", "Nick Gass", "Jack Shafer", "Bernie Becker", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Neera Tanden", "Noah Weiland", "Alex Isenstadt", "Seung Min Kim", "Laura Ingraham", "Jason Kander", "Marco Rubio", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Paul Ryan", "Nicholas Vinocur", "Brianna Ehley", "Tim Starks", "Jeremy Herb", "Tony Romm", "Mitt Romney", "Daniel Strauss", "Rachana Pradhan", "Darren Goode", "Ben Carson", "Ben White", "Elena Schneider", "Rick Reed", "Eric Wolff", "Jeff Sessions", "Bernie Sanders", "Jeff Greenfield"], "orgs": ["Fed", "UFCW", "NAFTA", "Senate", "Republican Party", "Swift Boat", "Yale University", "U.N.", "Medal of Honor", "Drake University", "AT&T", "The Washington Examiner", "GOP", "WTO"], "election_confidence": 0.9996210616233021, "authors": [{"author_id": 30861, "fullname": "daniel strauss", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-12 20:07:16", "org": "politico", "article_id": "efbfa5c58e447183976e05b032372e84", "date_access": "2015-11-12 20:44:15.424518"}
