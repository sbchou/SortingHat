But they acknowledge that doing so will require dramatically reducing consumption of coal, which has helped drive economies in key swing states including Ohio, Pennsylvania and Colorado, and elsewhere around the country. \nStory Continued Below\n\"Hillary Clinton is committed to meeting the climate change challenge as President and making the United States a clean energy superpower,\" the six-page plan says. \"At the same time, she will not allow coal communities to be left behind \u2014 or left out of our economic future.\"\nThe fact sheet outlines a $30 billion package to shore up pension benefits, fund schools and train out-of-work coal miners or utility workers to find jobs in other industries, among other proposals. It does not include an itemized breakdown of the spending. Many of the proposals would need approval from Congress, where Republicans have so far balked at President Barack Obama's request for $10 billion in aid for coalfield communities.\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\nSeveral major U.S. coal mining companies have announced this year that they would or may soon seek bankruptcy protection, including Arch Coal, Patriot Coal, Alpha Natural Resources, Walter Energy and James River Coal. The Obama administration last month announced $14.5 million in grants to help coal communities diversify their economies. \nClinton draws from several ideas already circulating on Capitol Hill, such as bipartisan pension-protection legislation from West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania senators to protect coal miner pensions. Clinton would expand that to include retirees from power plants or transportation companies who lose benefits due to a coal market-related bankruptcy. And she endorses \u201csweeping reforms\u201d proposed by Virginia and Pennsylvania Democrats for the federal black lung benefit program.\nHer plan also would create a Secure Coal Community Schools program \u2014 similar to the existing Secure Rural Schools program to offset lost revenue from a decline in Western timber sales \u2014 that would replace lost coal-industry revenue to public schools \u201cuntil alternative sources of local tax revenue arise through economic growth.\u201d \nClinton outlines goals to modernize infrastructure, repurpose mines and power plant sites, increase high-speed broadband access and expedite permitting for renewable energy projects and transmission lines. She also would offer more tax credits for low-income residents, allow companies investing in coalfield communities to avoid capital gains taxes and establish a competitive grant program.\nCarbon capture and sequestration research and development would receive more support under Clinton's plan. The technology has already received substantial federal support, but remains expensive and has struggled to gain widespread adoption. \nClinton had already teased her coal community strategy back in July when she released a set of clean power goals that would build on the Obama administration's strategy. It also partially hit goals touted by billionaire climate activist and donor Tom Steyer and earned her the endorsement of the League of Conservation Voters. \nBut Sanders has earned plaudits for pushing Clinton to the left, including in opposing the Keystone XL pipeline and Arctic drilling. His stance on stopping fossil fuel production on federal property goes further than Clinton has advocated and the longtime Vermont senator is promising to detail an aggressive climate platform that also goes further than a bill he offered in 2013 to enact a carbon tax. Sanders has also promised to propose a plan to provide education and training programs for coal workers. \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Clinton proposes $30 billion aid plan for coal communities", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/hillary-clinton-aid-coal-communities-215789", "topics": ["environment/energy"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Joe Pompeo", "Kenneth P.
