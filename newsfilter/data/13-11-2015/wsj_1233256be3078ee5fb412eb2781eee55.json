{"body": "Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz said the November 2016 general election will turn on the question of amnesty for undocumented\u00c2\u00a0immigrants in November, and described himself as\u00c2\u00a0the lone candidate able\u00c2\u00a0to unite various factions of conservative Republicans.\nAt\u00c2\u00a0a press conference after officially registering for the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Cruz said that \u00e2\u0080\u009cmillions\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Republicans will stay home in November if they believe the GOP nominee is soft on immigration, particularly working-class voters who he says would see amnesty for undocumented immigrants\u00c2\u00a0as a threat to their ability to find well-paying work.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a real socioeconomic divide,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said. He contrasted himself with \u00e2\u0080\u009celites in Washington\u00e2\u0080\u009d who look to illegal immigrants as a pool of cheap labor, driving down labor prices in the process.\nRunning with a hard line on immigration\u00c2\u00a0will also help to attract Reagan Democrats who would support presumed Democratic Hillary Clinton, Mr. Cruz said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will stand with the working men and women and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how I think we will win the general election.. we run a populist campaign,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe run that against the bipartisan corruption of Washington that Hillary Clinton embodies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe Texas senator derided\u00c2\u00a0his\u00c2\u00a0Republican rivals as\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009ccampaign conservatives,\u00e2\u0080\u009d arguing only he reflects the positions of the party\u2019s\u00c2\u00a0hard right on all issues.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am the only candidate running who has been a consistent conservative, who has been a fiscal conservative, a social conservative, a national security conservative,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cruz said.\nMr. Cruz didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t name those \u201ccampaign conservatives\u201d there, but on Laura Ingraham\u2019s radio show on Thursday, Mr. Cruz criticized\u00c2\u00a0Mr. Rubio\u2019s past support for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and for not backing Senate amendments to the legislation that would have boosted enforcement actions.\nMr. Rubio co-sponsored a bipartisan 2013 immigration overhaul bill that would have strengthened border security while also granting an eventual path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants. The measure passed in the Senate but the Republican-led House never held a vote.\n\u201cHe opposed every single one of them. Every single amendment,\u201d Mr. Cruz said about Mr. Rubio .\u201dMy reaction in all of politics is, \u00e2\u0080\u0098talk is cheap,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that you know where someone is based on their actions.\u201d\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham registered for the New Hampshire primary earlier\u00c2\u00a0Thursday, and former Sen. Rick Santorum was also slated to do the same. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is set to\u00c2\u00a0register\u00c2\u00a0on Friday.\nNew Hampshire holds its first in the nation primary election on\u00c2\u00a0Feb. 9\u00c2\u00a0next year.\n______________________________________________________\n2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll Standings\n\n\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops. \r\n\nCapital Journal Daybreak Newsletter: Sign up to get the latest on politics, policy and defense delivered to your inbox every morning.\r\nFor the latest Washington news, follow @wsjpolitics\r\nFor outside analysis, follow @wsjthinktank", "byline": "", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz said the November 2016 general election will turn on the question of amnesty for undocumented immigrants in November, and described himself as the lone candidate able to unite various factions of conservative Republicans.", "title": "Ted Cruz: General Election Will Turn on Issue of \u2018Amnesty\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/12/ted-cruz-general-election-will-turn-on-issue-of-amnesty/", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Rick Santorum", "Laura Ingraham", "Lindsey Graham", "Hillary Clinton", "Marco Rubio", "Reagan Democrats", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": ["Senate", "Capital Journal", "WSJ", "GOP"], "election_confidence": 0.9944204228042979, "authors": [{"author_id": 1098, "fullname": "heather haddon", "primary_org": "wsj"}], "date_written": "2015-11-12 20:23:01", "org": "wsj", "article_id": "1233256be3078ee5fb412eb2781eee55", "date_access": "2015-11-12 20:58:36.178882"}
