McCaskill\n\n11/12/15 06:05 PM EST\nPresident Barack Obama ridiculed Donald Trump's proposal to use a \"deportation force\" to expel millions of undocumented immigrants from the United States, calling the proposal unrealistic as well as costly. \n\u201cThe notion that we\u2019re gonna deport 11, 12 million people from this country \u2014 first of all, I have no idea where Mr. Trump thinks the money\u2019s gonna come from,\u201d Obama said in an interview with ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos at the White House. \u201cIt would cost us hundreds of billions of dollars to execute that.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\nTrump, appearing on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d this week, told co-host Mika Brzezinski he would have a deportation force to carry out his controversial immigration proposal. \"You're going to have a deportation force, and you're going to do it humanely and you\u2019re going to bring the country \u2014 and, frankly, the people, because you have some excellent, wonderful people, some fantastic people that have been here for a long period of time,\" Trump said. \"Don't forget, Mika, that you have millions of people that are waiting in line to come into this country and they\u2019re waiting to come in legally.\" \n\n\n\n            By \nDaniel Strauss\n\nObama challenged the humanity of Trump\u2019s plan. \u201cImagine the images on the screen flashed around the world as we were dragging parents away from their children, and putting them in what, detention centers, and then systematically sending them out,\u201d Obama said. \u201cNobody thinks that that is realistic. But more importantly, that\u2019s not who we are as Americans.\u201d\nThe president said some Americans back the billionaire real estate mogul's proposal because there has always been some anti-immigrant sentiment in this country \u2014 ironically, he said, from people who have immigrant roots. \n\u201cIt\u2019s the job of leaders not to play into that sentiment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want, I think, a president or any person in a position of leadership to play on those kinds of fears.\u201d\nDemocratic front-runner Hillary Clinton attacked Trump on his deportation plan Wednesday, calling it \u201cabsurd, inhumane, and un-American.\u201d\nImmigration has been an especially hot topic on the campaign trail this week, with Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio getting in a nasty back-and-forth about their records on the issue.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Obama ridicules Trump&apos;s plan for a &apos;deportation force&apos;", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/obama-trump-immigration-deportation-force-215808", "topics": ["trade", "immigration"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "George Stephanopoulos", "Elena Schneider", "Richard Shelby", "Ted Cruz", "Steven Shepard", "Jeremy Herb", "Barack Obama", "Jenny Hopkinson", "Kevin Robillard", "Brian Mahoney", "Caitlin Emma", "Mika Brzezinski", "Nahal Toosi", "Josh Gerstein", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Rich Lowry", "Bryan Bender", "Bernie Becker", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Neera Tanden", "Noah Weiland", "Alex Isenstadt", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Jeff Greenfield", "Eric Wolff", "David Vitter", "Tim Starks", "Zachary Warmbrodt", "Jason Kander", "Tony Romm", "Daniel Strauss", "Hillary Clinton", "Doug Palmer", "Rick Reed", "Brianna Ehley", "Darren Goode", "Darius Tahir", "Ben Carson", "Paul Ryan"], "orgs": ["Congress", "Swift Boat", "UFCW", "NAFTA", "Medal of Honor", "U.N.", "Yale University", "Drake University", "AT&T", "GOP", "WTO"], "election_confidence": 0.9961240467999896, "authors": [{"author_id": 30897, "fullname": "darren goode", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-12 23:05:46", "org": "politico", "article_id": "5f632292cd63632ab2004221ec2e27f1", "date_access": "2015-11-12 23:46:25.830771"}
