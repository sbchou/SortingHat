{"body": "Washington (CNN)Donald Trump insisted on Thursday that the U.S. must keep wages low in order to compete with other countries, one day after he dug in on his assertion that \"wages are too high\" in America.\n\"Whether it's taxes or wages, if they're too high we're not going to be able to compete with other countries,\" Trump said Thursday morning on Fox News.\nTrump first said he believes wages are \"too high\" during Tuesday night's Republican debate, undercutting the populist tone Trump has struck on the campaign trail as he's called for protecting U.S. manufacturing jobs from outsourcing and immigration.\nTrump's comments about wages being \"too high\" came in response to a debate question about raising the minimum wage, which Trump and other GOP candidates said they oppose.\n\"Our taxes are too high. Our wages are too high. We have to compete with other countries,\" Trump said again on Wednesday morning in an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" where he was pressed on whether people can live on the current federal minimum wage of $7.25.\n", "byline": "", "description": "Donald Trump insisted on Thursday that the U.S. must keep wages low in order to compete with other countries, one day after he dug in on his assertion that \"wages are too high\" in America.", "title": "Trump digs in on 'wages too high' comment", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/12/politics/donald-trump-explains-wages-too-high-comment/index.html", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Donald Trump"], "orgs": ["MSNBC", "GOP"], "election_confidence": 0.7665912247257382, "authors": [{"author_id": 2323, "fullname": "jeremy diamond", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-11-12 13:06:04", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "7306c0b741aada969e5d85f0a25064ca", "date_access": "2015-11-12 13:19:34.048096"}
