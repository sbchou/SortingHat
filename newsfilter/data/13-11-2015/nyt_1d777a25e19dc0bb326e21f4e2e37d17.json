{"body": "Shortly after Mayor Bill de Blasio and his national advocacy group trumpeted plans last month to hold a presidential forum in Iowa, the mayor hopped on a conference call to rev up the liberal faithful.\n\nAddressing members from around the country, the mayor spoke of girding for a sustained war on inequality \u2014 the very topic of the Dec. 6 forum, which organizers believed would be a harbinger of the group\u2019s intent to play on the national stage.\n\nThose plans collapsed this week. The de Blasio-backed group canceled its event, explaining in a statement that it would redirect its energies into other methods of tackling inequality.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio acknowledged a more humbling reality: Not a single presidential candidate had agreed to attend.\n\nThe disintegration of the Iowa conclave was the most significant setback yet for the Progressive Agenda Committee, an ambitious but halting enterprise that has prompted questions about Mr. de Blasio\u2019s political judgment, and has tested his clout as a local official with baldly ideological aspirations.\n\nMr. de Blasio and his allies say the group is a necessary vehicle to rally liberal elites behind a cohesive message. Inspired by a policy agenda that Mr. de Blasio unveiled in Washington in May, covering topics from union rights to international trade, the Progressive Agenda Committee is now incorporated as a nonprofit, with its own executive director and political director.\n\nBut the project, founded by Mr. de Blasio and backed by influential labor leaders and former City Hall aides, has faced a series of unexpected setbacks: Prominent elected officials have hesitated to commit themselves. Some leaders who endorsed Mr. de Blasio\u2019s policy manifesto have had second thoughts about promoting such a grandly ideological document.\n\nEven the rise of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the presidential race has presented a challenge for the Progressive Agenda, forcing the group to reconsider its goals now that a self-described socialist has already electrified the Democratic primary with heated rhetoric about inequality. (Mr. de Blasio endorsed Hillary Rodham Clinton last month.)\n\nThe project has also sharply divided advisers to Mr. de Blasio, some of whom counseled the mayor to reconsider the Iowa forum, concerned that it had deepened perceptions of Mr. de Blasio as excessively preoccupied with national politics, according to people familiar with their reservations.\n\nThese people, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, said Mr. de Blasio held out on having the forum until just days before the plug was pulled, convinced that the event would ultimately advance the broader cause of his liberal group.\n\nOthers in the mayor\u2019s circle remain intensely committed: John Del Cecato, one of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s closest advisers who is widely viewed as the most enthusiastic champion of the project, defended it this week as having helped move the national political debate in a liberal direction.\n\nMr. de Blasio stressed Wednesday that he was invested in making the Progressive Agenda a success, and vowed to put \u201cyears and years of effort\u201d into pressing its inequality message forward.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be doing activities all over the country and in Washington to keep pushing the issue of income inequality to the fore,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep trying new strategies until we find the ones that we think work best.\u201d\n\nAmid the public clamor over Mr. de Blasio\u2019s foray into presidential politics, other aspects of the Progressive Agenda Committee have begun to take shape.\n\nThe organization, which at first appeared aimed at shaping the 2016 election by pressuring Mrs. Clinton from the left, has sketched out a more gradual timeline for its activities, aimed at preparing to extract liberal policy achievements from the next president.\n\nGeri Prado, a former A.F.L.-C.I.O. strategist who joined the Progressive Agenda Committee over the summer as its executive director, said the group had begun to assemble a \u201cmessage calendar\u201d for the progressive movement aimed squarely at the first quarter of 2017.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that in the first 100 days of 2017, people are fulfilling their promises around income inequality,\u201d Ms. Prado said in an interview.\n\nMs. Prado, who is based in Washington, has wooed liberal leaders with a PowerPoint presentation that ticks off a series of national ills \u2014 including the \u201cCorporatization of America\u201d \u2014 and detailed tactics to address them.\n\nThe function of the committee, according to a copy of the presentation, is to help provide message discipline for a diverse array of activist communities on the left.\n\nThe presentation repeatedly invokes the image of a religious congregation, and states that this particular group\u2019s role is to provide \u201chymnals for the choir.\u201d\n\nThe Progressive Agenda intends to hold regular planning calls featuring a range of liberal leaders \u2014 not just Mr. de Blasio \u2014 outlining the elements of what it views as a successful progressive economic message, according to people familiar with the plans. (It has already held calls to highlight research by the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank, and Democracy Corps, a Democratic polling project focused on economic messaging.)\n\nIn mass emails, organizers have urged members of the group to help create a drumbeat around key liberal priorities: One message last Friday offered up sample Twitter posts, suggesting that members use social media to proclaim, \u201cWall Street and the superrich are gaming the stock market.\u201d\n\nThe group has also taken steps to reduce Mr. de Blasio\u2019s presence: The mayor\u2019s name did not appear on the invitations sent to presidential candidates, and organizers said that he would have played no speaking role at the forum.\n\nStill, Mr. de Blasio confers with Ms. Prado at least once a week about the group\u2019s activities. And if the group is aiming to channel a broader set of voices, beyond City Hall, Mr. de Blasio and the stature of his office have plainly been the animating forces behind its public activities so far.\n\nThe first glimmers of the Progressive Agenda emerged last spring, when Mr. de Blasio convened an April meeting at Gracie Mansion with other left-leaning Democrats, to discuss economic issues. By the next month, at least two City Hall aides, Stephanie Yazgi and Jonathan Viguers, were involved in efforts to recruit endorsers for the Progressive Agenda, according to emails obtained through public records requests.\n\nEarly on, Mr. de Blasio personally solicited support for the agenda from leading Democrats. Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor and presidential candidate, said he joined the group because of a direct appeal from Mr. de Blasio, and called it a useful gathering point for liberal leaders.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s basically trying to, I think, put together a counterweight to the right,\u201d Mr. Dean said, adding, \u201cThere are not that many forums where national progressives all get together and talk.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. de Blasio\u2019s back-channel recruitment efforts also revealed his limitations as a liberal field marshal. He repeatedly sought support from Edwin M. Lee, the mayor of San Francisco and a fellow Democrat, telling him in a personal email that his backing would be a \u201cgreat boost\u201d to the Progressive Agenda.\n\nWhen Mr. Lee offered a noncommittal response, Mr. de Blasio pressed the issue, asking him to consider signing on by the following day. Mr. Lee did not.\n\nOther outreach efforts have yielded only impermanent results. Mr. Sanders, whom the mayor has praised as an important spokesman for the left, agreed in a phone call with Mr. de Blasio to participate in the Iowa forum. But the Sanders campaign never ultimately made a formal commitment.\n\nEven among officials who signed on to the group, some have balked at promoting the Progressive Agenda with their own energies.\n\nMayor Steve Adler of Austin, Tex., gave his stamp of approval to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s policy manifesto, but in emails privately fretted with aides about how far to take the partnership. \u201cMuch of this is national stuff, which could be divisive here,\u201d Mr. Adler\u2019s chief of staff, John-Michael Cortez, cautioned in an email.\n\nJason Stanford, a spokesman for Mr. Adler, said there were areas of overlap between the Texas mayor\u2019s ideas and Mr. de Blasio\u2019s liberal platform. But, he added, \u201cThere are other things there that just aren\u2019t part of our agenda that are perceived as national political issues, and not what the mayor\u2019s trying to accomplish here in Austin.\u201d", "byline": "ALEXANDER BURNS and MICHAEL M.
