THE CONVERSATION -- JON MEACHAM on \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d on Dr. Carson\u2019s foreign-policy muddle at the debate: \u201cA presidential campaign cannot simply be \u2018This Is Your Life.\u2019 It has to be about OUR lives. \u2026 There has to be a core of substance. \u2026 The people I talk to understand Trump: populist-billionaire appeal, celebrity appeal. \u2026 They don\u2019t quite get Carson.\u201d\n \n--SO MARK HALPERIN gave the table a \u201cCarson 101,\u201d on his support and appeal: evangelicals and homeschoolers, plus social-media power -- \u201ca candidate of the digital age [who] goes over the head of not just the old media, but much of the new media, too.\u201d His assets are his faith, his biography and people\u2019s connection to him, \u201cwith all his flaws and lack of specificity.\u201d\n \nNEW OVERNIGHT -- \u201cCarson profits from ties with convicted felon,\u201d by AP\u2019s Michael Biesecker and Eileen Sullivan: \u201cCarson has maintained a business relationship with a close friend convicted of defrauding insurance companies and testified on his behalf \u2026 Pittsburgh dentist Alfonso A. Costa pleaded guilty to a felony count of health care fraud after an FBI probe into his oral surgery practice found he had charged for procedures he never performed ... At Costa\u2019s 2008 sentencing hearing, Carson described the dentist as \u2018one [of] my closest, if not my very closest friend. ... Next to my wife of 32 years, there is no one on this planet that I trust more than Al Costa.\u2019\u201d http://bit.ly/1OG5prp\n \nDEBATE AFTERMATH -- \u201cKasich faces conservative backlash over debate performance,\u201d by Daniel Strauss: \u201c[C]onservative media [are] thrashing the Ohio governor for soft positions on immigration and bank bailouts. Kasich has made no bones about his strain of compassionate conservatism that can ring hollow to evangelical voters and those looking for a true political outsider. But as Tuesday night evolved into a contest of conservative bona fides, Kasich appeared even more out of step with the rest of the GOP field, and came off as edgy, interrupting his rivals throughout the two-hour event.\u201d http://politi.co/1kOMyh1\n \nHOW JEB COULD STILL DO IT -- \u201cBush Is 2016\u2019s John Kerry,\u201d by Bill Scher, senior writer at the Campaign for America\u2019s Future, on Politico: \u201cKerry\u2019s [2004 primary] victory was not predicated on getting a personality transplant. He stuck to his boring script, used his personal finances to keep the campaign afloat and waited for everyone else\u2019s weaknesses to become apparent. Once the others flopped, voters flocked to him as a safe harbor. Written off a few months earlier, Kerry ended up running the table, winning virtually every primary and caucus. Bush is in the same position Kerry was in November of 2003: floundering with the public yet surrounded by untested candidates and stocked with institutional resources. These are the necessary ingredients for outlasting the competition.\u201d http://politi.co/1Qk1JvJ\n \n--PEGGY NOONAN, on \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d re Jeb\u2019s debate: \u201cI think he achieved adequacy.\u201d\n \nJEB\u2019S BASE? \u201cBush plans major D.C. fundraiser,\u201d by Alex Isenstadt: \u201cThose involved with the planning of the event, which is to be held on the evening of Dec. 3 at the home of former Ambassador Boyden Gray, said it would be one of Bush\u2019s largest Washington fundraisers since he formally launched his candidacy last summer. \u2026 [T]he host committee \u2026 includes over two dozen current members of Congress and over 60 lobbyists, fundraisers and financial players.\n\u201cAmong the names listed on the invitation are Sens. Susan Collins and Orrin Hatch and House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions. Also included are Bush family loyalists such as former Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, former Transportation Secretary Maria Cino, and former George W. Bush chiefs of staff Andy Card and Josh Bolten. Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor is also listed.\u201d http://politi.co/1NLRX3O\n \n--On Veterans Day, Bush campaign announced: \u201cBob Dole to Serve as National Veterans\u2019 Chairman for Governor Jeb Bush.\u201d http://bit.ly/1MpwGbV\n \nRUBIO VICTORY-LAP video, \u201cA Rubio Four-peat at #GOPDebate.\u201d http://bit.ly/1OG83gM\n \nRUBIO = GOP \u201cGOLDEN BOY\u201d \u2013 WashPost A1, above fold, \u201cRubio\u2019s rivals pulling their punches, for now: Reluctance to bruise GOP\u2019s golden boy helps his rise into top tier,\u201d by Phil Rucker and Bob Costa: \u201cFor Rubio, it is a return to the lofty status he had after he burst onto the national scene five years ago. Many Republican elites are once again celebrating him as the party\u2019s golden boy, \u2026 and fear seeing him bruised too badly during the primary season. \u2026 Asked why Bush did not scrutinize Rubio during the Milwaukee exchange, campaign manager Danny Diaz said the debate \u2018was a serious one where important issues were discussed,\u2019 and he urged reporters to stay tuned for the next debate on Dec. 15.\u201d http://wapo.st/1MYBjza\n \nARTICLE OF THE DAY -- \u201cHow the Kochs created Joni Ernst: New details reveal the billionaire brothers\u2019 network efforts to reshape the GOP are more ambitious than previously reported,\u201d by Ken Vogel: \u201c[T]he network\u2019s financial support for [now-Sen. Joni] Ernst [of Iowa] \u2015 detailed here for the first time \u2015 offers the first signs of a move into GOP primaries. The Kochs and their allies are investing in a pipeline to identify, cultivate and finance business-oriented candidates from the local school board all the way to the White House, and Koch operatives are already looking for opportunities to challenge GOP incumbents deemed insufficiently hardline in their opposition to government spending and corporate subsidies.\n\u201cThe ambitious effort, spearheaded partly by a for-profit consulting firm called Aegis Strategic that\u2019s backed by the Koch network, is one of several ways in which the brothers and their allies are seeking to influence the types of candidates who carry the GOP banner. The network has taken on a vetting role in the GOP presidential primary, offering favored candidates access to its donors and activists. And some within the network have even advocated targeting from six to 12 GOP House members who have run afoul of the Koch orthodoxy on fiscal issues and who are facing 2016 primary challenges.\u201d http://politi.co/1M8QCBS\n--\u201cCharles Koch has no plans to back a candidate in Republican primary,\u201d by USA Today\u2019s Fredreka Schouten: \u201c\u2018I have no plans to support anybody in the primary now.\u2019\u201d http://usat.ly/1iWm4sp\n \n** A message from Veteran Jobs Mission: One million veterans hired.
