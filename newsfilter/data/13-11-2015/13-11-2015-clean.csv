During the 2004 presidential race, he was a chief architect of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth effort to take down John Kerry. He has previously worked for a number of congressional Republicans, including South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and former Virginia Sen. George Allen. He also spent years as a top operative for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\nStory Continued Below\nIt was not clear, the sources said, whether Reed had formally signed on with the Trump campaign. \nNeither Reed nor spokespersons for Trump responded to multiple requests for comment in recent days, and neither side would confirm or deny that talks had taken place.\nDespite his personal wealth, Trump, who remains the front-runner in the Republican presidential primary contest, has yet to commit to spending a substantial amount of money on TV ads to boost his candidacy.

Rubio's membership in the group", which unsuccessfully shepherded a comprehensive immigration reform effort in 2013," has haunted him since.\n\""Talk is cheap","\"" Cruz continued"," saying Rubio's actions disprove any claim that he's as conservative as Cruz on the topic. Cruz later added that the Florida senator opposed a set of amendments introduced by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and himself. \n\""He opposed every single one of them", every single amendment,"\"" Cruz said. \""The 'Gang of Eight' voted as a gang against enforcing and securing the border.\"" \nRubio", in roughly the same bracket of hours Thursday morning, took a few shots at Cruz while campaigning in South Carolina," hitting the Texas senator from the right.\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\n\""Ted is a supporter of legalizing people that are in this country illegally. In fact", when the Senate bill was proposed, he proposed legalizing people that were here illegally,"\"" Rubio said during a campaign stop in Hilton Head"," according to a readout from his campaign. \""He proposed giving them work permits. He's also supported a massive expansion of the green cards. He supported a massive expansion of the H-1B program", a 500% increase. So, if you look at it, I don't think our positions are dramatically different. I do believe that we have to deal with immigration reform in a serious way," and it begins by proving to people that illegal immigration is under control.\"" \nA Cruz aide shot back that Rubio's comments were not an accurate indicator of where the Texas senator stands on immigration. \n\""Laughably FALSE. No one fought harder to prevent Gang of 8's amnesty bill than Ted Cruz. Record is remarkably clear","\"" Cruz rapid response director Brian Phillips tweeted. \nThe tinder fueling the fighting between Cruz and Rubio has been growing for some time now. Cruz has styled himself as a hard-liner on immigration reform", and opponents of Rubio often accuse him of flipping back and forth on immigration reform," notably taking a rightward turn recently in throwing his support behind legislation cracking down on sanctuary cities. \nOther candidates looked to join in on the skirmishing that started during Tuesday night debate's in Milwaukee. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum tried to get into the mix by tweeting out on Thursday a link to a clip of Cruz describing how he's introduced \""two amendments to significantly expand legal immigration", to double the caps on legal immigration from 675,"000 to 1.3 million and to increase temporary high skilled workers by 500 percent.\""\nIt is clear what candidate is not a real conservative on immigration. Watch @tedcruz in 2013. https://t.co/TlCUYfgOi4\n\u2014 Rick Santorum (@RickSantorum) November 12", 2015\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul, in a separate interview with Ingraham," moved to jab Rubio on his tax plan by tying it to immigration. \n\""I think Rubio's plan would explode payments to illegal aliens. And this is a real problem. Until we fix the current tax credits", do we really want to double and triple the amount of tax credits we're giving? I mean really, $4 billion to illegal aliens?

"{""body"": ""Shortly after Mayor Bill de Blasio and his national advocacy group trumpeted plans last month to hold a presidential forum in Iowa", the mayor hopped on a conference call to rev up the liberal faithful.\n\nAddressing members from around the country, the mayor spoke of girding for a sustained war on inequality \u2014 the very topic of the Dec. 6 forum, which organizers believed would be a harbinger of the group\u2019s intent to play on the national stage.\n\nThose plans collapsed this week. The de Blasio-backed group canceled its event, explaining in a statement that it would redirect its energies into other methods of tackling inequality.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio acknowledged a more humbling reality: Not a single presidential candidate had agreed to attend.\n\nThe disintegration of the Iowa conclave was the most significant setback yet for the Progressive Agenda Committee, an ambitious but halting enterprise that has prompted questions about Mr. de Blasio\u2019s political judgment, and has tested his clout as a local official with baldly ideological aspirations.\n\nMr. de Blasio and his allies say the group is a necessary vehicle to rally liberal elites behind a cohesive message. Inspired by a policy agenda that Mr. de Blasio unveiled in Washington in May, covering topics from union rights to international trade, the Progressive Agenda Committee is now incorporated as a nonprofit, with its own executive director and political director.\n\nBut the project, founded by Mr. de Blasio and backed by influential labor leaders and former City Hall aides, has faced a series of unexpected setbacks: Prominent elected officials have hesitated to commit themselves. Some leaders who endorsed Mr. de Blasio\u2019s policy manifesto have had second thoughts about promoting such a grandly ideological document.\n\nEven the rise of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the presidential race has presented a challenge for the Progressive Agenda, forcing the group to reconsider its goals now that a self-described socialist has already electrified the Democratic primary with heated rhetoric about inequality. (Mr. de Blasio endorsed Hillary Rodham Clinton last month.)\n\nThe project has also sharply divided advisers to Mr. de Blasio, some of whom counseled the mayor to reconsider the Iowa forum, concerned that it had deepened perceptions of Mr. de Blasio as excessively preoccupied with national politics, according to people familiar with their reservations.\n\nThese people, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, said Mr. de Blasio held out on having the forum until just days before the plug was pulled, convinced that the event would ultimately advance the broader cause of his liberal group.\n\nOthers in the mayor\u2019s circle remain intensely committed: John Del Cecato, one of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s closest advisers who is widely viewed as the most enthusiastic champion of the project, defended it this week as having helped move the national political debate in a liberal direction.\n\nMr. de Blasio stressed Wednesday that he was invested in making the Progressive Agenda a success, and vowed to put \u201cyears and years of effort\u201d into pressing its inequality message forward.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be doing activities all over the country and in Washington to keep pushing the issue of income inequality to the fore,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep trying new strategies until we find the ones that we think work best.\u201d\n\nAmid the public clamor over Mr. de Blasio\u2019s foray into presidential politics, other aspects of the Progressive Agenda Committee have begun to take shape.\n\nThe organization, which at first appeared aimed at shaping the 2016 election by pressuring Mrs. Clinton from the left, has sketched out a more gradual timeline for its activities, aimed at preparing to extract liberal policy achievements from the next president.\n\nGeri Prado, a former A.F.L.-C.I.O. strategist who joined the Progressive Agenda Committee over the summer as its executive director, said the group had begun to assemble a \u201cmessage calendar\u201d for the progressive movement aimed squarely at the first quarter of 2017.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that in the first 100 days of 2017, people are fulfilling their promises around income inequality,\u201d Ms. Prado said in an interview.\n\nMs. Prado, who is based in Washington, has wooed liberal leaders with a PowerPoint presentation that ticks off a series of national ills \u2014 including the \u201cCorporatization of America\u201d \u2014 and detailed tactics to address them.\n\nThe function of the committee, according to a copy of the presentation, is to help provide message discipline for a diverse array of activist communities on the left.\n\nThe presentation repeatedly invokes the image of a religious congregation, and states that this particular group\u2019s role is to provide \u201chymnals for the choir.\u201d\n\nThe Progressive Agenda intends to hold regular planning calls featuring a range of liberal leaders \u2014 not just Mr. de Blasio \u2014 outlining the elements of what it views as a successful progressive economic message, according to people familiar with the plans. (It has already held calls to highlight research by the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank, and Democracy Corps, a Democratic polling project focused on economic messaging.)\n\nIn mass emails, organizers have urged members of the group to help create a drumbeat around key liberal priorities: One message last Friday offered up sample Twitter posts, suggesting that members use social media to proclaim, \u201cWall Street and the superrich are gaming the stock market.\u201d\n\nThe group has also taken steps to reduce Mr. de Blasio\u2019s presence: The mayor\u2019s name did not appear on the invitations sent to presidential candidates, and organizers said that he would have played no speaking role at the forum.\n\nStill, Mr. de Blasio confers with Ms. Prado at least once a week about the group\u2019s activities. And if the group is aiming to channel a broader set of voices, beyond City Hall, Mr. de Blasio and the stature of his office have plainly been the animating forces behind its public activities so far.\n\nThe first glimmers of the Progressive Agenda emerged last spring, when Mr. de Blasio convened an April meeting at Gracie Mansion with other left-leaning Democrats, to discuss economic issues. By the next month, at least two City Hall aides, Stephanie Yazgi and Jonathan Viguers, were involved in efforts to recruit endorsers for the Progressive Agenda, according to emails obtained through public records requests.\n\nEarly on, Mr. de Blasio personally solicited support for the agenda from leading Democrats. Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor and presidential candidate, said he joined the group because of a direct appeal from Mr. de Blasio, and called it a useful gathering point for liberal leaders.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s basically trying to, I think, put together a counterweight to the right,\u201d Mr. Dean said, adding, \u201cThere are not that many forums where national progressives all get together and talk.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. de Blasio\u2019s back-channel recruitment efforts also revealed his limitations as a liberal field marshal. He repeatedly sought support from Edwin M. Lee, the mayor of San Francisco and a fellow Democrat, telling him in a personal email that his backing would be a \u201cgreat boost\u201d to the Progressive Agenda.\n\nWhen Mr. Lee offered a noncommittal response, Mr. de Blasio pressed the issue, asking him to consider signing on by the following day. Mr. Lee did not.\n\nOther outreach efforts have yielded only impermanent results. Mr. Sanders, whom the mayor has praised as an important spokesman for the left, agreed in a phone call with Mr. de Blasio to participate in the Iowa forum. But the Sanders campaign never ultimately made a formal commitment.\n\nEven among officials who signed on to the group, some have balked at promoting the Progressive Agenda with their own energies.\n\nMayor Steve Adler of Austin, Tex., gave his stamp of approval to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s policy manifesto, but in emails privately fretted with aides about how far to take the partnership. \u201cMuch of this is national stuff, which could be divisive here,\u201d Mr. Adler\u2019s chief of staff, John-Michael Cortez, cautioned in an email.\n\nJason Stanford, a spokesman for Mr. Adler, said there were areas of overlap between the Texas mayor\u2019s ideas and Mr. de Blasio\u2019s liberal platform. But, he added, \u201cThere are other things there that just aren\u2019t part of our agenda that are perceived as national political issues," and not what the mayor\u2019s trying to accomplish here in Austin.\u201d"""," ""byline"": ""ALEXANDER BURNS and MICHAEL M.

The accusation has yet to go before a judge.\nBut it added to the pressure on Vanoli after opposition\npresidential candidate Mauricio Macri, the business-friendly\nmayor of Buenos Aires who is leading the opinion polls ahead of\nthe Nov. 22 election," urged him to resign.\n\""My term ends in 2019 and I intend to stay until then","\""\nVanoli told radio station Vorterix", saying the accusation \nagainst him was baseless and politically motivated.\nHe was appointed by outgoing President Cristina Fernandez,\nwho was revered by the poor for strengthening the social safety\nnet and reviled by investors for her interventionist policies.\nShe is constitutionally barred from running for a third term\nthis year. Fernandez has endorsed Buenos Aires Governor Daniel\nScioli for president, but his platform of mixing Fernandez's\ngenerous social spending with gradual free-market reforms has\nnot won popularity with voters.\nMacri is campaigning on a mandate to unwind state controls\non the currency and trade that critics blame for stunted\ninvestment and stalled growth in Latin America's No. 3 economy.\nIf Macri wins the presidency," his public show-downs with\nVanoli may continue. Macri blames Argentina's double-digit\ninflation rate on Fernandez's and Vanoli's unorthodox policies.\nThe central bank chief denies any wrongdoing in the selling\nof dollars and said in a statement on Wednesday he would\ncooperate with investigators.\n\""The accusation from certain sectors of the opposition about\nthe sale of dollars in the futures market is without merit and\nmotivated purely by electoral politics","\"" the statement said.\nA Macri spokesman could not be immediately reached.\nWith Argentina's official exchange rate of 9.6 to\nthe U.S. dollar 61 percent stronger than the black market rate","\nthe pace of the peso's devaluation next year is a hot point of\ncontention in the presidential campaign.\nMacri would unify Argentina's exchange rates at a stronger\nlevel than the current official rate.

The schedule virtually guarantees that a significant volume of records about Clinton, who is the leading Democratic candidate for president, will be emerging through the primary and caucus season and into the heart of the general election next fall.\nThe order (posted here) came in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by Vice News reporter Jason Leopold. It originally sought virtually all records the State Department possessed pertaining to Clinton's four-year tenure as secretary.\nThe State Department already agreed to release redacted versions of about 30,"000 emails Clinton kept in a private account and returned to her former agency last December at its request. Leopold has now narrowed the request to a variety of topics ranging from WikiLeaks to the Keystone XL pipeline and to emails and other records used by top aides to Clinton.\nMore details on the dispute are here.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC"""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": ""A federal judge issued an order Thursday that will sharply ramp up the volume of documents being release in a lawsuit demanding memos and emails from top aides to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton."""," ""title"": ""Judge ramps up releases in FOIA suit for Clinton aides&apos; records"""," ""url"": ""http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2015/11/judge-ramps-up-releases-in-foia-suit-for-clinton-aides-records-215803"""," ""topics"": [""trade"""," ""campaign_finance""]"," ""people"": [""Isaac Arnsdorf"""," ""Burgess Everett"""," ""Elena Schneider"""," ""Richard Shelby"""," ""Steven Shepard"""," ""Jenny Hopkinson"""," ""Kevin Robillard"""," ""Brian Mahoney"""," ""Jeremy Herb"""," ""Nahal Toosi"""," ""Josh Gerstein"""," ""Darius Tahir"""," ""Nick Gass"""," ""Bernie Becker"""," ""Jennifer Scholtes"""," ""Noah Weiland"""," ""Alex Isenstadt"""," ""Bernie Sanders"""," ""Jason Kander"""," ""Jake Sherman"""," ""Darren Goode"""," ""Paul Ryan"""," ""Eric Wolff"""," ""David Vitter"""," ""Tim Starks"""," ""Zachary Warmbrodt"""," ""Brianna Ehley"""," ""Tony Romm"""," ""Daniel Strauss"""," ""Jason Leopold"""," ""Hillary Clinton"""," ""Ben White"""," ""Doug Palmer"""," ""Rick Reed"""," ""Eliza Collins"""," ""Ben Carson"""," ""Rudolph Contreras"""," ""Caitlin Emma""]"," ""orgs"": [""Courts ", Transparency ," & More"""," ""Fed"""," ""State Department"""," ""Congress"""," ""Swift Boat"""," ""Freedom of Information Act"""," ""UFCW"""," ""NAFTA"""," ""Medal of Honor"""," ""U.N."""," ""Yale University"""," ""Drake University"""," ""AT&T"""," ""GOP"""," ""WTO""]"," ""election_confidence"": 0.9824986892406062"," ""authors"": [{""author_id"": 30899"," ""fullname"": ""zachary warmbrodt"""," ""primary_org"": ""politico""}]"," ""date_written"": ""2015-11-12 21:55:43"""," ""org"": ""politico"""," ""article_id"": ""f1599f56a2e00895a86c971d3256ae5e"""," ""date_access"": ""2015-11-12 23:00:06.056148""}",

He's gaining ground in the race for the Republican Presidential nomination, and he's positioning himself to capture supporters from Donald Trump or Ben Carson, should they falter. There's still a long way to go in this contest but Cruz and his campaign are well funded, well organized and confident in his ability to outlast and overtake his rivals. Cruz's success is rooted in the idea that there's no such thing as too conservative, both inside electoral politics and in governing. Or if need be, not governing \u2014 history's shown he's fine with shutting the federal government down if it helps him acquire leverage over the opposition, be it Democrat or Republican. And when he runs for office, nobody gets to the right of Ted Cruz. That's how he's won. The senator likes very much where he's positioned now. In most prior elections," he told NPR \""there has been a consensus moderate candidate early on and all the money gets behind that candidate.\"" Conservatives", on the other hand, are more plentiful," \""nobody has any money"," and we fight like cats and dogs.\"" \n\nThey're gonna spend millions ripping each other apart. To be honest", right now," the moderates are acting like conservatives usually do in a Republican primary.\n\n\nTed Cruz\n\n\n\""What's remarkable about this cycle is the entire situation is inverted","\"" Cruz said. He has enjoyed watching enjoyed watching candidates in the moderate wing of the party slug it out. \""They're gonna spend millions ripping each other apart. To be honest", right now, the moderates are acting like conservatives usually do in a Republican primary,"\"" he said. On the economy", immigration and Obamacare On the economic front, a President Cruz would abolish the IRS, institute a 10 percent flat tax across the board and retie the value of the dollar to the gold standard. The U.S. stopped trading gold for dollars in 1933 and while the supply of gold has grown, there isn't enough gold in the world to match the $18 trillion U.S GDP. The money supply, the availability of credit and the nation's economy would necessarily have to contract to match the supply of bullion. Nevertheless, Cruz says returning to the gold standard deserves serious consideration. If you look at most of the history of America, he said," \""we've had a gold standard. Including through some of the greatest economic booms known to mankind.\"" Unpredictability in the country's currency", he added," \""has a profoundly negative effect.\"" If elected president", Cruz would order the FBI and the Department of Justice to investigate Planned Parenthood for fraud. The Texas senator doesn't believe in climate change science and would veto any legislation that would raise taxes or fees to inhibit global warming. He would like to institute term limits for U. S. Supreme Court justices. He opposes any minimum wage increase. And he would deport the millions of undocumented immigrants in this country, all of them. \n\nYou know, my view on immigration is simple. Legal, good. Illegal," bad.\n\n\nTed Cruz\n\n\n\""You know", my view on immigration is simple,"\"" he said. \""Legal", good. Illegal, bad. ... You know, if you start from the proposition that rule of law matters," it answers a whole lot of questions.\"" In foreign policy"," Cruz is a hawk with limitations. He's less a \""boots on the ground\"" man than a \""bomb them from the skies\"" guy. He deplores the Obama administration's agreement to slow down Iran's nuclear capabilities and believes the next president will have to bomb. \""When the next president enters the White House", the odds are significant that he or she will encounter an Iran on the verge of having nuclear weapons,"\"" Cruz said. \""And it may be that the only option at the point to preventing Iran from having nuclear weapons is military force. And of course Cruz"," who was a catalyst in closing the federal government for two weeks in 2013 during the Showdown at the Obamacare Corral remains firmly against the Affordable Care Act. \""If I am elected president", mark my words, we will repeal every single word of Obamacare,"\"" he said. At war with the GOP establishment So what are the chances the Ted Cruz is the next Republican nominee for president? In the past", a rogue Republican senator at war with the leadership of his own party would have zero chance. But as if to demonstrate that we're not in Kansas anymore, Cruz's first radio spot emphasizes that the Texas senator is hated by the GOP establishment. In it, a young mother explains she voted for Cruz to keep America safe," stop the debt from growing and to keep her religious freedoms intact. \""The media and even some in his own party like Speaker John Boehner attacked Ted Cruz referring to him as a pain in the you know what","\"" the ad goes. \""Because of his bold actions fighting to keep the promises he made to me. That was the Ted Cruz I trust.\"" Among the Tea Party and other insurgent Republican voters that Cruz is courting", being made an object of ridicule by the leaders of your own party is something you want to advertise. In this world," moderates are squishy \""Republicans In Name Only\"" and right-wing true believers are the only Republican politicians that can be trusted to stand up and fight. \""There are a handful of consultants who relentlessly push what I call the Washington fallacy","\"" Cruz said. \""Which is that the way Republicans win a general election is to run in the middle. To run as Democrat light. Every time we do that"," we lose.\"" Cruz has assembled both an impressive campaign war chest and a solid network of state organizations across the South and Midwest. He's capturing both billionaire and Republican grass roots financial support. His strategy is to persevere and thrive while other candidates fall"," eventually emerging as the default favorite of Republican right. Cruz cites the millions of evangelicals in American \u2014 he says more than half of them didn't vote in 2012. \""I think I'm in the best position to energize and mobilize and inspire the millions of conservatives who've been staying home","\"" Cruz said. Super Tuesday comes early in this Republican primary", just 10 days after South Carolina. Georgia, Alabama, Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma and the big prize of Cruz's home Texas are among the conservative states that go to the polls. On Wednesday March 2, Ted Cruz is counting on the GOP race looking a lot different than the day before. And what of the other son of a Cuban immigrant, the Floridian who is also well positioned and a growing favorite with Republican voters? Cruz says he would be delighted if it came down to him and Marco Rubio," two quintessential American success stories writ large. He calls Rubio a \""friend\"" and \""fellow son of Cuban immigrants","\"" but said he still has the upper hand. \""I will say this. If the race becomes head to head. A battle between a clear conservative to a clear moderate", we win,"\"" Cruz said.

"{""body"": "" (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz says he wants to do away with government support for the sugar industry \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a veiled dig at rival Marco Rubio", the Florida senator who has long supported sugar growers.\nSome conservatives like Cruz want to get rid of the program, which supports prices and protects growers from foreign competition. But sugar supports have for decades been unassailable in Congress, partly due to wide bipartisan support from lawmakers representing states from Florida to North Dakota that grow sugar cane and sugar beets.\nIn Tuesday night's GOP debate," Cruz listed assistance for sugar as among government programs he'd like to eliminate to allow more spending for the military.\n\""Among them are corporate welfare", like sugar subsidies,"\"" said the Texas senator. \""Let's take that as an example. Sugar subsidies. Sugar farmers farm under roughly 0.2 percent of the farmland in America"," and yet they give 40 percent of the lobbying money.\"" On Wednesday", Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier clarified that Cruz meant 40 percent of crop industries' total lobbying expenditures.\nU.S. assistance to sugar growers is not really direct subsidies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 unlike some other agricultural commodities. The government does not offer cash payments to processors and growers. Instead, it props up prices through loans, limits the amount domestic processors can sell and restricts sugar imports.\nRubio, who has received campaign donations from the sugar industry, has consistently voted to maintain the sugar program. On Wednesday," he told ABC's \""Good Morning America\"" that he supports getting rid of sugar supports"," but only if countries that export sugar to the United States also get rid of their government sugar aid. The sugar industry has made a similar argument.\n\""I'm not going to wipe out an American industry that happens to have a lot of workers in Florida by unilaterally disarming","\"" Rubio said.\nBut another Republican candidate", former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, has distanced himself from sugar producers as some conservative groups have focused on overhauling the program," calling it \""crony capitalism.\"" A Bush spokeswoman", Kristy Campbell," said Wednesday that Bush supports phasing out the sugar program.\n\""Gov. Bush believes we should constantly be moving to reduce government interference and create a level playing field for all commodities on the world market","\"" she said.\nIn 2014", the sugar industry spent almost $10 million on lobbying, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The group's calculations show the industry contributed more than $5 million to congressional candidates during the 2014 campaign cycle, split almost evenly between Republicans and Democrats.\nWhen Frazier clarified Cruz's remark about lobbying expenditures, she cited a 2014 Heritage Foundation report. It's unclear how that report calculated the numbers, but the Center for Responsive Politics puts the percentage of sugar industry lobbying dollars closer to 8 percent of all agribusiness lobbying dollars so far this year.\nStill, the sugar industry's influence is undeniable.\nCongressional votes to reform or do away with the program have consistently failed. A 2013 amendment to the farm bill in the Senate to scale back the program garnered 45 votes, with many of the most conservative Republicans voting with Democrats to maintain the status quo. While sugar cane produces jobs in Florida, Louisiana and even Cruz's home state of Texas, sugar beets are grown and create jobs in at least 14 states," many in the Great Plains and the northern tier of the country.\n\""The bipartisan efforts in Congress to reform this program have been undermined by the sugar industry which doesn't want to give up these generous taxpayer subsidies","\"" said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen", a New Hampshire Democrat who sponsored the 2013 amendment.\nSome of the most ardent opponents have been candy companies, who see the prices they pay for domestic sugar inflated by the program. Members of Congress from Illinois, home to Wrigley and other candy companies, and Pennsylvania, home to Hershey, have fought for years to overhaul the program.\nJennifer Cummings, a spokeswoman for The Coalition for Sugar Reform, an alliance of candy companies, and other food industries and taxpayer watchdog organizations," says they believe there is momentum building for reform.\n\""America should be a leader on this issue and we shouldn't wait for other countries to reform their subsidies","\"" she says.\n___\nFind Mary Clare Jalonick on Twitter: """," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": ""WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz says he wants to do away with government support for the sugar industry \u2014 a veiled dig at rival Marco Rubio"," the Florida senator who has long supported sugar growers."""," ""title"": ""Sugar program draws Cruz's ire"," remains popular in Congress"""," ""url"": ""http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-11-12-US--GOP%202016-Sugar/id-08a1061d0e5a4144ac113d6039bb41af"""," ""topics"": [""foreign policy/national security"""," ""campaign_finance""]"," ""people"": [""Catherine Frazier"""," ""Kristy Campbell"""," ""Mary Clare Jalonick"""," ""Jeb Bush"""," ""Jeanne Shaheen"""," ""Marco Rubio"""," ""Ted Cruz""]"," ""orgs"": [""Senate"""," ""Heritage Foundation"""," ""Congress"""," ""Center for Responsive Politics""]"," ""election_confidence"": 0.9519732218017437"," ""authors"": [{""author_id"": 39409"," ""fullname"": ""mary clare jalonick"""," ""primary_org"": ""ap""}]"," ""date_written"": ""2015-11-12 09:22:00"""," ""org"": ""ap"""," ""article_id"": ""b9f10d77533467a6e4b91da57ae779d9"""," ""date_access"": ""2015-11-12 15:00:06.031664""}",

Send your questions to editor Kate Milani at kate.milani@wsj.com. We look forward to hearing from you!\nHIGHLIGHTS\nPOPULISM ON THE RISE IN GOP RACE FOR PRESIDENT: The latest presidential debate vividly captured how the 2008 financial crisis has reshaped the Republican Party by unleashing a potent populist strain that could further scramble an already unpredictable primary contest. Candidates vying for the 2016 GOP nomination have grown distinctly more leery of big banks", corporations and international trade deals, and outright hostile toward the Federal Reserve.\nSome of these impulses gave rise to the tea-party movement in 2009 and flared in the 2012 GOP primary contest, but they faded with the nomination of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a private-equity executive. The debate in Milwaukee didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appear to fundamentally alter the state of the race. But with candidates heading off to Iowa and New Hampshire on Wednesday, it showed how their jockeying to carry the populist banner could intensify in the run-up to those states\u00e2\u0080\u0099 early nominating contests next February. Nick Timiraos reports.\nMore on 2016: Republican presidential candidates worked to turn debate moments into campaign momentum after a GOP showdown that highlighted policy differences but did little to shuffle the standings\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Donald Trump and Marco Rubio won Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s night primetime Republican debate, according to an overnight poll of Internet users who watched the contest, but Mr. Trump came out as the favorite among Republicans and left the best impression about his ability to serve as president\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The Trump show may be fading on social media.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 For those wondering how Mr. Trump will go about deporting millions of\u00c2\u00a0 illegal immigrants if elected president, they got their answer in Tuesday night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debate.

But privately, the department is telling some of its agents they cannot work with officers using such cameras as part of joint task forces, according to people familiar with the discussions. The reason: The federal government hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet adopted guidelines on how and when to use body cameras, rules that would be important to determining how any footage could be used in court, released publicly, or stored by law-enforcement agencies.

The two men, Efra\u00c3\u00adn Antonio Campo Flores and Francisco Flores de Freitas, were first arrested in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Tuesday by local police, turned over to U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents and flown the same day to New York in a DEA jet, these people said.

GOP lawmakers debated for months about what measures to pass under a special procedure tied to the budget process, known as reconciliation, which enables legislation to pass with just a simple majority. But there is a problem with the combination they settled on: It may go too far for some Republicans and not far enough for others.

The proposal lists eight steps toward ending the conflict: establishing an 18-month constitutional reform period; creating a united delegation from the hodgepodge of opposition groups; identifying terrorist factions; coordinating international military strikes on Islamic State; and holding simultaneous presidential and parliamentary elections. But the proposal doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t clarify how or when Mr. Assad might step down and leaves open the possibility that he could continue to rule Syria if he were to be re-elected.

"{""body"": "" (CNN)It's official. Sen. Ted Cruz is now a citizen of the United States -- and the United States only.\nIf you remember", the Texas Republican was born in Canada to an American mother and a Cuban father.  As such, he was a dual citizen -- an American because of his mother, and Canadian because the country, like America, grants automatic citizenship to anyone born there. \nNo harm in that, except Cruz is considered a potential candidate for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. And when the news of his dual citizenship surfaced last year, thanks to a Dallas Morning News piece, some began to question his eligibility to become president. (In truth," that was never in jeopardy. Most legal experts said Cruz qualifies as a \""natural born citizen","\"" a requirement for the White House job"," as stated in the Constitution.)\nThe newspaper piece came as a revelation to Cruz as well. \n\""Because I was a U.S. citizen at birth", because I left Calgary when I was 4 and have lived my entire life since then in the U.S., and because I have never taken affirmative steps to claim Canadian citizenship, I assumed that was the end of the matter,"\"" Cruz said at the time. \nThen he took immediate steps to renounce his Canadian citizenship. \nWell", that process was formally completed last month, and he received a letter in the mail this week telling him so," the newspaper reported Tuesday. \n\""This is to certify that the person named above has formally renounced Canadian citizenshp and pursuant to the Citizenship Act will cease to be a citizen on\"" May 14", 2014," the letter read. \n\""it's official y'all","\"" tweeted his spokeswoman Catherine Frazier.\nCruz wins presidential straw poll at Republican Leadership Conference\nCNN's Tina Burnside contributed to this report."""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": """""," ""title"": ""It's official: Ted Cruz a citizen of the U.S. - and the U.S. only"""," ""url"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/11/politics/ted-cruz-canada-citizenship/index.html"""," ""topics"": [""personality""]"," ""people"": [""Catherine Frazier"""," ""Ted Cruz""]"," ""orgs"": [""GOP""]"," ""election_confidence"": 0.6798350773385569"," ""authors"": [{""author_id"": 2946"," ""fullname"": ""saeed ahmed"""," ""primary_org"": ""cnn""}]"," ""date_written"": ""2015-11-12 23:36:08"""," ""org"": ""cnn"""," ""article_id"": ""2d53ac1cb5985f625a5214e01dcfd6d6"""," ""date_access"": ""2015-11-13 01:01:16.883377""}",

"{""body"": ""\n2016\n\n                        Like the voters they hope to represent", the drug epidemic has touched them too.\n\n            By \n                    Jeff Greenfield\n\nNovember 12, 2015\n\n                Getty\nThree Republican candidates, three surprising, highly personal revelations\u2014all within days of each other. \nGov. Chris Christie, well-known for his in-your-face, confrontational style, riveted a town meeting in New Hampshire with a double-barreled story that recounted the death of his tobacco-addicted mother and the death of a law school friend from a prescription drug overdose.\nStory Continued Below\n \u201cWhen I sat there as the governor of New Jersey at his funeral, and looked across the pew at [my friend\u2019s] three daughters, sobbing because their dad is gone\u2014there but for the grace of God go I,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can happen to anyone. And so we need to start treating people in this country, not jailing them.\u201d\n The video of Christie was well on its way to viral status when Jeb Bush, whose family is famously resistant to personal revelations, sat down with the Huffington Post on his campaign bus in New Hampshire to talk about the most painful part of his life: his daughter\u2019s drug addiction. \u201cI visited her in jail. Never expected to see my beautiful daughter in jail,\u201d he said. \u201cShe went through hell.\u201d\nWithin a day, Sen. Ted Cruz, as polished a wordsmith as anyone in politics, was telling CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper about the crippling drug habit of his half-sister and his futile efforts to persuade her to leave a crack house. \u201cI sometimes found it hard to reconcile the bright, fun and charismatic sister I adored with the person who would lie to me without hesitation and who stole money from her teenage brother to feed her various addictions.\u201d\nListening to these candidates, it\u2019s hard to detect the strident moralizing of the party that gave us \u201cJust say no.\u201d The GOP\u2019s softening on drug addiction has quickly become one of the most striking themes of the 2016 campaign, even if it gets less attention than illegal immigration or repealing Obamacare. Suddenly, in a crowded and topsy-turvy primary season that seems to be rewarding outsiders who have torn up the political script, a number of Republicans are dispensing with the antiseptic bios and have found that voters are engaging with the messiest episodes of their lives.\nWhat\u2019s going on here? This is not a coincidence, or parallel \u201cmessaging.\u201d In fact, if you look under the hood, you\u2019ll find this is a convergence of important trends in both political style and demographics that could signal a rewrite of the American playbook on drugs and crime.\nViolent crime, the urban kind that fixated voters in the 80s and 90s has dropped precipitously. But at the very same time a wave of drug crime driven by prescription drugs and now heroin has swept into every corner of American society, respecting now geographic, social or political boundaries. Hollow-eyed addicts were suddenly just as much a feature of red state back roads as they were on the boulevards of big cities. Heroin use has climbed among all demographic groups, but it has skyrocketed among whites; nearly 90 percent of those who tried heroin for the first time in the last decade were white. \nAll this has changed the way GOP politicians are engaging with their voters. Multimillionaires like the ones who make up most of the presidential field might not have a lot in common economically with most voters, but when it comes to addiction they are discovering points of empathy with a wide cross section of the electorate. \n***\nRemember when FDR told America that he would beat the Depression the way he beat polio? Remember when JFK told us how he learned to endure pain during his ordeal in the Pacific and his life-threatening surgeries? Remember when Reagan talked of putting his alcoholic father to bed?\n Of course you don\u2019t\u2014because they never said those things. In earlier days (and Reagan was very much a product of earlier times) that\u2019s not how politicians talked. Today, a personal \u201cnarrative\u201d is as crucial an element of a campaign as a super-PAC and a micro-targeter. \n \u201cI see it as one of the more positive movements in our political culture,\u201d says longtime Republican consultant Stu Stevens, who is unworried about the possibility of artifice on the part of candidates, \u201cPeople have a good bullshit detector to pick up whether people are being sincere or not.\u201d\n Maybe the seeds were planted in Nixon\u2019s 1952 \u201cCheckers\u201d speech when he answered charges of financial misconduct with a detailed account of his assets and debts, including his wife\u2019s \u201cgood Republican cloth coat.\u201d Maybe it was fed by Jimmy Carter\u2019s intensely personal case for his candidacy\u2014the peanut farmer/evangelical who would never lie to us. Maybe Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 acceptance speech blazed a path (\u201cI never knew my father\u201d). Or Al Gore\u2019s two vice-presidential acceptance speeches-one invoking his son\u2019s near-fatal auto accident, the other his sister\u2019s harrowing death from lung cancer. Maybe it was Bush the father painting himself as a risk-taking entrepreneur or Bush the son\u2019s story of his meeting with juvenile offenders, or guardedly acknowledging his own struggles with substance abuse.\n Whatever the sources, the need for prospective presidents to connect on a visceral, personal level is profound. And there\u2019s no more effective tool than recounting some personal travail. Indeed, when linked to the policy proposals that accompany such testimonials, they act as enhancers of credibility: I know what drugs can do because I have seen it firsthand.\n Christie\u2019s viral video notwithstanding, the effectiveness of these personal revelations is hard to measure. Christie has fallen to the second-tier debate and Bush remains mired in the single digits in many polls. But there is no sign that they, or the rest of the crowded GOP field, are going to stop sharing. And that might say more about the electorate than it does the candidates.\n There was a time when it was possible for Middle America to think of drugs as something that happened to \u201cthem\u201d\u2014to the black and brown urban poor. Today, there is no \u201cthem.\u201d Drugs are in Our Town, Pleasantville, Farmville. \n The evidence is in the statistics. Drug overdoses are the leading cause of \u201cinjury death\u201d among Americans\u2014greater than from motor vehicle crashes and firearms. And of those overdoses, more than half were from heroin or prescription drugs. Substance abuse is one key reason why the death rate among less educated white Americans has risen over the last several years. The evidence is also anecdotal: In January 2014, Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin devoted his entire State of the State address to the epidemic of addiction in the Green Mountain State. \u201cThe time has come for us to stop quietly averting our eyes from the growing heroin addiction in our front yards,\u201d Shumlin said," \u201cwhile we fear and fight treatment facilities in our backyards.\u201d\n\nJeff Greenfield is a five-time Emmy-winning network television analyst and author.\nWHAT WORKS\nPolitics\n\n                    By \n                            Jason Zengerle\n\nThe Big Idea\n\n                    By \n                            POLITICO Magazine\n\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC"""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": ""Like the voters they hope to represent"," the drug epidemic has touched them too."""," ""title"": ""Why the GOP Candidates Are Hooked on Addiction Stories"""," ""url"": ""http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/11/gop-2016-candidates-drug-addiction-213352"""," ""topics"": [""campaign_finance""]"," ""people"": [""Chris Christie"""," ""Jeb Bush"""," ""Bill Clinton"""," ""Peter Shumlin"""," ""Jeff Greenfield"""," ""Jake Tapper"""," ""Jason Zengerle"""," ""Al Gore"""," ""Jimmy Carter"""," ""Ted Cruz""]"," ""orgs"": [""FDR"""," ""GOP""]"," ""election_confidence"": 0.929837790868098"," ""authors"": [{""author_id"": 33762"," ""fullname"": ""jeff greenfield"""," ""primary_org"": ""politico""}]"," ""date_written"": ""2015-11-12 23:23:14"""," ""org"": ""politico"""," ""article_id"": ""8cf8c20a106f2ea98a1ea4cfbb7d1590"""," ""date_access"": ""2015-11-12 23:46:25.680972""}",

"{""body"": ""Four of the eight Republican presidential contenders in the prime-time debate on Tuesday were asked their views on raising the federal minimum wage.\n\nDonald Trump", who went first, set the tone when he said that the current minimum of $7.25 an hour was already too low when it took effect in 2009 and should be doubled.\n\nJust kidding!\n\nHere\u2019s what the candidates really said and why they\u2019re all wrong.\n\nMr. Trump said that American businesses can\u2019t compete because \u201cwages too high\u201d and, for that reason, he would keep the minimum wage where it is.\n\nIf American businesses can\u2019t compete \u2013 a dubious assertion in itself \u2013 it is not because wages are too high. Most working people can\u2019t remember their last raise. And the minimum wage is certainly not too high. Raising it to $12 an hour would simply bring it into line with historical wage-and-price benchmarks. Raising it to $15 an hour would bring it closer to where it would be if it had kept up in recent decades with productivity gains.\n\nAll of which makes a higher minimum wage, what\u2019s the word . . . fair? Sensible?\n\nBut in Mr. Trump\u2019s view, wages for low-paid workers in America are too high because they are higher than those in, say, Pakistan. If you take that thought to its logical conclusion, he is saying that if he were president, he would lead the nation in a race to the bottom with countries whose economies are built on poverty wages.\n\nBen Carson was off base, too. Earlier in the campaign, he said he favored increasing the minimum, to an unspecified amount. On Tuesday, he said he did not support raising the minimum, because \u201cevery time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases.\u201d\n\nNo, it doesn\u2019t. To give just one example, the minimum wage was raised by nearly 12 percent in 1996 (to $4.75 an hour) and by another eight percent in 1997 (to $5.15). The late 1990s were a period of full employment and rising wages for everyone.\n\nThe question of whether a higher minimum wage leads to higher unemployment isn\u2019t one of those issues on which reasonable people disagree. It has been exhaustively studied, in theory and in real world conditions, since 1938, when the United States first enacted a minimum wage (at 25 cents an hour). The weight of evidence shows that increases in the minimum wage have lifted pay without hurting employment.\n\nMr. Carson also said that high unemployment among black teenagers was \u201cbecause of those high wages.\u201d Even for a teenager, $7.25 an hour is not a lot. Nor is $2.13 an hour, which is the federal minimum wage for tipped workers. Does he really want to let employers hire teenagers (and adults, for that matter) at wages that are not enough to provide pocket change, let alone cover real expenses, like getting back and forth to work?\n\nMarco Rubio was next, warning as he has for months that \u201cif you raise the minimum wage, you\u2019re going to make people more expensive than a machine. And that means all this automation that\u2019s replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated.\u201d\n\nPlaying on fears is not the hallmark of a leader. \u201cFear the robots\u201d is not an economic policy. Automation, by another name, is capital investment, and keeping wages low to discourage capital investment is a path to economic decline. It also ignores history, in which new technology has both replaced and created jobs.\n\nMr. Rubio went on to extol vocational training for welders as a way to lift wages. As if robots can\u2019t weld?\n\nThen there was John Kasich, who seemed to be trying to set himself apart from his scroogy opponents by noting that in Ohio, \u201cWe do have a moderate increase in the minimum wage.\u201d The minimum in Ohio is $8.10 an hour, except for employers grossing $283,000 a year or less, who can pay as little as $7.25 an hour.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t so serious," it would be laughable."""," ""byline"": ""TERESA TRITCH"""," ""description"": ""Here\u2019s what the candidates said at the debate on Tuesday \u2014 and here are the facts."""," ""title"": ""Taking Note: Republicans Sound Off on the Minimum Wage"""," ""url"": ""http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/12/republicans-sound-off-on-the-minimum-wage/"""," ""topics"": [""jobs/employment""]"," ""people"": [""Donald Trump"""," ""Marco Rubio"""," ""Ben Carson"""," ""John Kasich""]"," ""orgs"": []"," ""election_confidence"": 0.8083537910154293"," ""authors"": [{""author_id"": 2728"," ""fullname"": ""teresa tritch"""," ""primary_org"": ""nyt""}]"," ""date_written"": ""2015-11-12 20:53:37"""," ""org"": ""nyt"""," ""article_id"": ""01fd6ecd05292172651b0f1d6742215a"""," ""date_access"": ""2015-11-12 21:44:49.772354""}",

Biden Jr.\u2019s decision not to enter the race, and a steely, well-received face-off with congressional Republicans investigating the 2012 attack on the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. \n\nMr. Sanders, in turn, has been drawing more contrasts with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s positions on trade, Social Security, the death penalty and marijuana legalization since the October debate, but his attacks have not been memorably effective.\n\nA third Democratic candidate, former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland, will also take part in Saturday\u2019s debate, but he is trailing far behind his rivals. He received 5 percent of the vote in the Times/CBS News poll.\n\nMr. Sanders and Mr. O\u2019Malley do appear to have room to grow if they can find a way, the poll found: Half of Democratic primary voters said it was still too early to say for sure who they would support.\n\nSanders supporters stand out as especially engaged with the presidential race. Fifty-four percent of them said they were paying a lot of attention to the campaign, compared with 38 percent of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s backers.\n\nBut Mrs. Clinton enjoys a firmer base of voters than Mr. Sanders, according to the poll. Fifty-four percent of her supporters said their minds were completely made up, while 58 percent of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters said they had not made a final decision.\n\nAnd 43 percent of Democrats said they would enthusiastically support Mrs. Clinton as their presidential nominee, compared to 35 percent for Mr. Sanders. Slim majorities of women, nonwhites and older voters said they would enthusiastically back Mrs. Clinton as the party\u2019s choice, while just three in 10 male Democrats said they would feel that way about her as their standard-bearer in 2016.\n\nA strong majority of Democratic primary voters say they are paying at least some attention to the presidential campaign; 26 percent of Democrats say they have not been paying much attention," compared with 11 percent of Republican primary voters.\n\nThe nationwide telephone poll was conducted Nov. 6 to 10 on cellphones and landlines with 418 Democratic primary voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus six percentage points. Additional findings from the full poll will be published on Thursday at 6:30 p.m."""," ""byline"": ""PATRICK HEALY and GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO"""," ""description"": ""Despite a month of sharpened attacks from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont", Mrs. Clinton has support from 52 percent of Democratic primary voters, according to a New York Times/CBS News survey released on Thursday," compared with Mr. Sanders\u2019s 33 percent."""," ""title"": ""First Draft: Poll Shows Hillary Clinton Maintaining Lead Over Bernie Sanders"""," ""url"": ""http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/12/poll-shows-hillary-clinton-maintaining-lead-over-sanders/"""," ""topics"": [""personality"""," ""budget/taxation""]"," ""people"": [""Bernie Sanders"""," ""Joseph R.

The school has been a staple for primary debates: It has hosted nationally televised debates every presidential cycle since 2007. Sheslow Auditorium, where the debate will occur, is a part of the National Register of Historic Places. It holds just 775 seats and has striking stained glass windows. If you\u2019re eager to look like an insider, refer to the campus neighborhood as \u201cDogtown.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\nWhat time and how long is the debate?\nThe debate will last two hours and begin at 9 p.m. Eastern time. It should look markedly different than the last Democratic debate: With just three candidates, each participant should be able to speak for a length of time equivalent to a stump speech. \nCBS News says there will be no opening statements. Candidates will have 60 seconds to respond, 30 seconds for rebuttals and follow ups, and 60 seconds for closing statements.\nHow can I watch the debate?\nThe debate will air on CBS and stream for free at www.cbsnews.com/live/. No cable subscription is necessary. CBS will also air the debate on its radio affiliates, meaning anyone with network TV, radio or Internet access can take it in. Those already tuned in to the live broadcast of the Midwest favorite Prairie Home Companion can simply switch the radio dial to listen.\nThe debate competes with a local football game as regional adversary Minnesota comes to Iowa City to play the fifth-ranked Iowa Hawkeyes in a critical matchup just more than 100 miles away. The winner of the Democratic debate will not receive the Floyd of Rosedale pig trophy awarded to the winner of the game.\nDoes this debate have a theme?\nCBS News\u2019 John Dickerson told The Des Moines Register he plans to focus the debate on the economy \u2014 especially wages and income inequality. Even health care, education and retirement issues will revolve on the axis of finance. \u201cThe goal of the moderator is to illuminate the views of the candidates on the issues that matter the most to voters, and you don\u2019t need to be on the side of the party to do that,\u201d Dickerson told the newspaper.\nWho will participate in the debate?\nAfter Lincoln Chafee and Jim Webb dropped out shortly after the last debate, the field was left with three candidates: Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley. In April, President Barack Obama joked that even attendees at an O\u2019Malley campaign event wouldn\u2019t recognize O\u2019Malley, but after two debates, he seems to have earned at least a modest following. Just two days before the debate, he\u2019ll dine with a family in Austin, Texas, headed by an illegal immigrant.\nWhere will they stand on the stage?\nIt would be an understatement to say Clinton has a commanding lead, which means she\u2019ll stand center stage, flanked by Sanders and O\u2019Malley. \nWho will moderate the debate?\nThere will be four people involved in moderating the debate, with Dickerson taking the lead as the principal moderator. Dickerson--known for acerbic questions asked on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d every Sunday--will get help from his CBS News colleague Nancy Cordes, the network\u2019s congressional correspondent. Two local journalists will also pitch in on the panel with Cordes: KCCI\u2019s Kevin Cooney and the Des Moines Register\u2019s Kathie Obradovich. Cooney has been a stalwart of local politics and breaking news for decades and is retiring this month.\nHow will Sanders go after Clinton?\nIn the last debate\u2019s most memorable moment, the Ronda Rousey-endorsed Sanders seemed to put the issue of Clinton\u2019s email scandal(s) to rest. But he soon backed off his backing off the topic, telling The Wall Street Journal that the controversies involve \u201cvalid questions.\u201d Sanders continues his implicit anti-Clinton campaign in a state that could decide his fate as a self-appointed revolutionary.\nWill Clinton continue to be haunted by Iowa?\nAfter losing to Barack Obama in a wrenching defeat in the 2008 Iowa caucuses, Clinton has spent the past few years building another sturdy following in the state. Any feelings of betrayal don\u2019t appear to affect her in this less-competitive race. She has the endorsement of the beloved former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, and she\u2019s convincing undecided Iowa Democrats that she is indeed, the best choice for the nomination.\nWhen is the fifth Republican debate?\nThe fifth Republican debate is scheduled for Tuesday, Dec. 15 in Las Vegas \u2014 the last Republican debate of the calendar year. It will be hosted by CNN and Salem Radio and moderated by Wolf Blitzer. Hugh Hewitt will return to contribute questions.\nWhen is the next Democratic debate?\nIn another Saturday night bout, the candidates will next take the stage Saturday, Dec. 19 in Manchester, New Hampshire. The debate will be hosted by ABC News, the New Hampshire Democratic Party," WMUR-TV and the Union Leader.\nNoah Weiland is a researcher at Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC"""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": """""," ""title"": ""Everything you need to know about Saturday&apos;s Democratic debate"""," ""url"": ""http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/second-democratic-2016-debate-iowa-when-is-it-215792"""," ""topics"": [""ethics"""," ""trade"""," ""income inequality""]"," ""people"": [""Isaac Arnsdorf"""," ""Burgess Everett"""," ""Eliza Collins"""," ""Nancy Cordes"""," ""Jim Webb"""," ""Doug Palmer"""," ""Hugh Hewitt"""," ""Jacopo Barigazzi"""," ""Steven Shepard"""," ""Kathie Obradovich"""," ""Barack Obama"""," ""Jenny Hopkinson"""," ""Brian Mahoney"""," ""Hillary Rodham Clinton"""," ""Darius Tahir"""," ""Caitlin Emma"""," ""Rich Lowry"""," ""Nick Gass"""," ""Jack Shafer"""," ""Bernie Becker"""," ""John Dickerson"""," ""Jennifer Scholtes"""," ""Martin O'Malley"""," ""Neera Tanden"""," ""Noah Weiland"""," ""Alex Isenstadt"""," ""Seung Min Kim"""," ""Jason Kander"""," ""Jake Sherman"""," ""Darren Goode"""," ""Paul Ryan"""," ""Nicholas Vinocur"""," ""Brianna Ehley"""," ""Tim Starks"""," ""Jeremy Herb"""," ""Tony Romm"""," ""Jennifer Haberkorn"""," ""Rachana Pradhan"""," ""Tom Harkin"""," ""Hillary Clinton"""," ""Ben Carson"""," ""Ben White"""," ""Elena Schneider"""," ""Wolf Blitzer"""," ""Rick Reed"""," ""Eric Wolff"""," ""Lincoln Chafee"""," ""Bernie Sanders"""," ""Jeff Greenfield""]"," ""orgs"": [""New Hampshire Democratic Party"""," ""National Register of Historic Places"""," ""Fed"""," ""NAFTA"""," ""Union Leader"""," ""UFCW"""," ""Yale University"""," ""U.N."""," ""Swift Boat"""," ""Medal of Honor"""," ""Des Moines Register"""," ""Salem Radio"""," ""Drake University"""," ""AT&T"""," ""GOP"""," ""The Des Moines Register"""," ""WTO""]"," ""election_confidence"": 0.9413362945875061"," ""authors"": [{""author_id"": 32625"," ""fullname"": ""eliza collins"""," ""primary_org"": ""politico""}]"," ""date_written"": ""2015-11-12 19:10:24"""," ""org"": ""politico"""," ""article_id"": ""527e2a85ade022bc40921859db5d0cc9"""," ""date_access"": ""2015-11-12 19:44:17.684409""}",

Join her on Facebook and follow her on Twitter @drpeggydrexler. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. \n (CNN)This week", the election season took a turn for the predictable as Hillary Clinton's hair became the topic of conversation in a Donald Trump media appearance. \nTrump was chatting with Mark Levin, a conservative talk radio host who wanted to know what Trump suspected voters liked most about Clinton. Trump's response was characteristically provocative," if entirely off-point: \""Well", she has a new hairdo,"\"" Trump replied. \""Did you notice that today?\""\nThat wasn't all. He then went on to call Clinton's hair \""shocking","\"" \""massive\"" and agreeing with Levin's suggestion that the pile of hair atop his opponent's head \""must be\"" a wig. \nPolitics as usual", right? \nWhat a woman looks like -- her weight, her clothes, how much makeup she does or doesn't wear --has remained stubbornly front and center in the world of working women, and especially those in, or aiming for, public office. Despite being one of history's most successful female political figures, Clinton has been judged for decades on how she looks: for those pantsuits, for her choice of hair accessories, for her weight, you name it. \nThroughout, many have argued that such comments are directed at Clinton, and her female cohorts, simply because they're women; that no male candidate would be subjected to such constant analysis of hair, skin, wardrobe, weight. And, in the wake of Trump's comments last night, it would be easy to say that things haven't really changed; that even when talking about one of the world's most powerful women, matters still come down to how good we think she looks.  \nExcept it's not entirely true that women are on the receiving end of all the focus on appearance.\nHillary Clinton, for example," made fun of Trump's hair in a bit on Jimmy Fallon (\""just one strand that he twirls over his head like a soft serve at Dairy Queen\"")  And let's not forget all the girl talk about Mitt Romney's good looks or judgment of his expensive haircut as a signal of \""wealthy privilege.\"" Meanwhile", President Barack Obama's personal style continues to garner praise -- that is," when he's not taking heat over his \""mom jeans.\"" \nDonald Trump", we well know by now, has no filter. He says what he thinks, seemingly as soon as he thinks it, and it's not always appetizing. That's why people love him, and also why people don't. It's certainly why he's still generating headline news.  \nAnd yet, in his conversation with the Levin -- which, given that Levin is a well-known conservative, had an agenda from the get-go -- Trump doesn't actually say anything negative or positive about Clinton's hair. He brings it up out of context, sure. But he never actually says it doesn't look good. \nBut so what if he did? The truth is that appearance is part of life, and a pretty big one. \nIn politics, it may not be something to celebrate, necessarily -- certainly not a legitimate reason to elect or not elect someone to office -- but it needn't be something to entirely ignore, either. That's just not how the rest of the world works; why should politics be any different? \nMore importantly, the way to end sexism isn't to stop acknowledging a woman's appearance altogether. That's not evolution; that's just forced silence, which is quite possibly as damning, and as damaging, as making appearance the only thing that matters. \nIn fact, let's consider that the greatest amount of attention put on Clinton's new hairstyle wasn't Trump's doing; it was the doing of everyone else who took his comments and ran with them, turning a blowhard's observation into something resembling an attack. \nClinton may very well be wearing a wig. It seems unlikely, but who cares? Many women do. So do many men.\nDoes Trump? Well, the world continues to marvel at his odd locks. Perhaps enduring many years of public taunting about them has encouraged him to do the same to others or at least sent him the message that the topic isn't off-limits. That, after all, is how bullies become bullies -- they've been subject to the teasing themselves.\nLet's make sure that from now on, if anyone's going to do the bullying," it's Trump.

"{""body"": ""With the Democratic presidential nomination contest all but officially a two-person race", Hillary Rodham Clinton appears vastly better positioned than Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to persuade party primary voters that she would be more effective at passing her agenda and dealing with international crises, according to a New York Times/CBS News survey released Thursday.\n\nMrs. Clinton even undercuts Mr. Sanders on his core political message, with 62 percent of Democratic primary voters saying she could bring about real change in Washington, compared with 51 percent for Mr. Sanders.\n\nThe promise of change, always a popular lure in politics, is at the heart of a striking paradox in the Democratic race. Democratic primary voters say that the ability to deliver needed change is the most important quality they seek in a candidate, and Mr. Sanders\u2019s popularity is highest with voters who want change. Yet 60 percent of Democrats also want their nominee to continue President Obama\u2019s policies, and these voters support Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Sanders by about a 2-to-1 margin.\n\nThis advantage for Mrs. Clinton may reflect all-around skepticism that Mr. Sanders\u2019s leftist candidacy can prevail: Her party\u2019s primary voters expect Mrs. Clinton to be their eventual nominee by more than a 4-to-1 margin over Mr. Sanders.\n\nHis chief indictment against Mrs. Clinton, that she is an establishment politician who is captive to big-money special interests and inconsistent on liberal priorities, simply has not persuaded many Democrats to abandon her. While 84 percent of them see Mrs. Clinton as under the sway of special interests, she is still the heavy favorite among Democratic primary voters seeking a candidate who is a strong leader with the right experience to be president.\n\nAnd while Mr. Sanders is running as an unwavering liberal, three-quarters of Democratic primary voters prefer a nominee who would compromise with Republicans in Congress to get things done.\n\nAfter a month of sharpened attacks by Mr. Sanders against her, Mrs. Clinton has support from 52 percent of Democratic primary voters, while Mr. Sanders has backing from 33 percent, the poll found. The numbers are virtually unchanged from an early October CBS News poll, in which she led Mr. Sanders, 56 percent to 32 percent.\n\nThe nationwide telephone poll was conducted Nov. 6 to 10 on cellphones and landlines with 1,495 adults, including 418 Democratic primary voters, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus six percentage points for Democratic primary voters.\n\nMrs. Clinton inspires more confidence among party members on a range of issues than the lesser known Mr. Sanders, who is only now starting to run biographical advertisements on television. On a signature Sanders issue, regulating large banks and financial institutions, Mrs. Clinton inspired confidence in 70 percent of primary voters, compared with 65 percent for Mr. Sanders. On gun laws, 76 percent of Democratic primary voters think she would make the right decisions compared with 57 percent for Mr. Sanders, whose votes against some gun-control measures have been highlighted by Mrs. Clinton.\n\nOn foreign conflicts, too, Democrats overwhelmingly expressed more faith in the decision-making of Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state, than of Mr. Sanders, a longtime antiwar figure.\n\n\u201cShe knows all the players, all the world leaders,\u201d Jan Lyles, 52, a consultant in Reno, Nev., said in an interview after the poll was completed. She added, approvingly, \u201cShe has her husband behind her for advice.\u201d Three-quarters of Democrats view Bill Clinton favorably.\n\nBut support for Mrs. Clinton lags in some groups of Democratic primary voters, particularly men and younger voters. Among the misgivings is one that has surfaced before in her political career: Fifty-two percent of Democratic primary voters think that Mrs. Clinton says what she actually believes, compared with 62 percent who think Mr. Sanders is genuine in his remarks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much I don\u2019t trust her, but she seems to me to say what she thinks people want to hear,\u201d said Jack Bernblum, 68, a self-employed Democrat from East Haven, Conn., who is leaning toward Mr. Sanders. \u201cShe has recently said something about legalizing marijuana, which is a brand new position for her. I don\u2019t think she means anything she says.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Sanders, who is attracting bigger crowds than Mrs. Clinton and is running notably close to her in fund-raising, the overarching challenge is to transform an insurgent primary campaign aimed at two must-win states, Iowa and New Hampshire, into a formidable movement with broad national appeal. He will face his greatest test yet on Saturday night at the second Democratic debate, which will be televised nationally from Des Moines. Nearly half of Democratic primary voters say they are very likely to watch the debate, and an additional three in 10 said they were somewhat likely.\n\nMrs. Clinton will take the stage after a run of positive developments since their Oct. 13 debate, including strong reviews of her performance there; Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s decision not to enter the race; and a steely, well-received face-off with congressional Republicans investigating the 2012 attack on the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nMr. Sanders has been trying to undercut her political momentum by drawing more contrasts on policy, noting that he has been more liberal for far longer than her on issues like free trade, the death penalty and a single-payer health care system. Yet his attacks have not been memorably potent.\n\nA third Democratic candidate, former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland, will also take part in Saturday\u2019s debate, but he is trailing far behind his rivals. He received 5 percent support in the Times/CBS News poll.\n\nMr. Sanders and Mr. O\u2019Malley have room to grow if they can find a way: Half of Democratic primary voters say it is still too early to say for sure whom they will support. And while Mr. Sanders is running closest behind Mrs. Clinton, four in 10 voters still do not have an opinion of him \u2014 and many hold views that suggest they would be open to his platform.\n\nWhile some Sanders allies worry that his decades-long identification as a democratic socialist will hurt him, 56 percent of Democratic primary voters say they hold a positive view of socialism. About nine in 10 think that the gap between rich and poor is an urgent problem, and most would support raising taxes on the wealthy to deal with it \u2014 one of Mr. Sanders\u2019s major positions \u2014 and 78 percent oppose unlimited campaign contributions to fund-raising committees known as \u201csuper PACs,\u201d as does Mr. Sanders. (Mrs. Clinton is supported by a such a fund-raising arm.)\n\nSue Moon, a Seattle Democrat and a retired teacher, said she did not like Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ties to wealthy donors and Wall Street executives, some of whom Ms. Moon blames for the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\u201cI am much more in favor of the wing of the party that thinks a lot of these people should have gone to jail,\u201d said Ms. Moon, a Sanders supporter.\n\nWhile the Republican presidential race is far more unsettled, with 15 candidates, Democrats think that Donald J. Trump, whose tough talk and outsize personality have energized many disaffected conservatives, would be the toughest to beat in a general election. Thirty-one percent of Democrats said Mr. Trump would be the most formidable opponent next November, while 15 percent named the retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and 13 percent each picked former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas lagged far behind.\n\nLuke Cottrill, a junior high school teacher and a Democrat in San Francisco, said that Mr. Trump would be the most dangerous foe in a general election because he is not only a political outsider but also speaks pointedly in ways that resonate deeply with some people, while offending others. Mr. Trump is also famous in a nation that worships celebrity, Mr. Cottrill said.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is a TV star, and Ronald Reagan was a movie star \u2014 people know who he is,\u201d said Mr. Cottrill, 60. \u201cHe also is a demagogue," and sometimes we Americans are impressed by demagogues and forget about their power over people.\u201d"""," ""byline"": ""PATRICK HEALY and MEGAN THEE-BRENAN"""," ""description"": ""In a new poll", 62 percent said Mrs. Clinton could bring about real change in Washington," compared with 51 percent for Mr. Sanders."""," ""title"": ""Poll Shows Hillary Clinton Is Seen as More Likely Than Bernie Sanders to Be Effective"""," ""url"": ""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/13/us/politics/poll-shows-hillary-clinton-is-seen-as-more-likely-than-bernie-sanders-to-be-effective.html"""," ""topics"": [""foreign policy/national security""]"," ""people"": [""Martin O'Malley"""," ""Bill Clinton"""," ""Jeb Bush"""," ""Hillary Clinton"""," ""John Kasich"""," ""Donald Trump"""," ""Hillary Rodham Clinton"""," ""Marco Rubio"""," ""Donald J.

You have to wait until Dec. 15 for Republicans to do it again.\nStory Continued Below\nTHE NARROWCAST DEBATE: POLITICO\u2019s Gabriel Debenedetti reports: Iowa, Iowa, Iowa. That\u2019s the not-particularly-subtle message pervading Democratic camps as the party\u2019s three remaining presidential candidates prep for their second debate Saturday night in Des Moines, a recognition that the first-caucusing state will likely play an even more outsized role than usual in 2016. \nWhile the direction of the questions may be squarely in the hands of debate host CBS News and moderator John Dickerson, each of the candidates has already started sharpening the message (and spin) that they think will specifically take them furthest with the state\u2019s influential voters. \u201cThe Nevada debate was more of a national debate,\u201d explained BERNIE SANDERS\u2019 lead strategist, Tad Devine," echoing the beliefs of other top Democrats. \u201cI do expect [this one] to be a debate that has more focus on Iowa.\""\nFor Sanders", that means heading north to his Burlington headquarters for two days starting Wednesday night to sit down with aides, and to scour briefing papers that include a deep-dive rundown on Iowa issues outlined by his staff on the ground there. He\u2019s agreed to participate in mock debate run-throughs \u2014 after being resistant to such standard pre-debate fare last time \u2014 and his staff expects that he'll prepare specific policy contrasts to unleash against front-runner HILLARY CLINTON before he flies out to Des Moines on Friday. http://politi.co/1METIPq\nTGIT, and welcome to your 2016 Blast.

An archivist at the University of Chicago agreed in January that Sanders was not the speaker in the photo.\u201d http://ti.me/1Ma6J23\nNOVEMBER SURPRISE: POLITICO\u2019s Eliza Collins reports: \u201cIn a blow to HILLARY CLINTON, former Ohio state senator and minority whip Nina Turner is throwing her support behind BERNIE SANDERS. The move is a surprise, considering how involved Turner has been with the Clintons. The former secretary of state met with Turner in October before her appearance at the Women's Leadership Forum. While she never formally endorsed Clinton, Turner was also involved in the Ready for Hillary super PAC, appeared at a Clinton organizing event, and served on the pro-Clinton super PAC Correct the Record until recently.\u201d http://politi.co/1N04G4k\nHOLLYWOOD HUNK: The Hollywood Reporter: It-guy actor Ryan Gosling, who turned 35 today, asked his Twitter followers to \u201cdo him a solid\u201d to celebrate his birthday by passing around a BERNIE SANDERS campaign video called \u201cCompassion.\u201d http://bit.ly/1WUPiWa \nTURNING THE (WOOD) SCREWS: MassLive.com reports MARTIN O\u2019MALLEY \u201ccalled on IKEA to immediately recognize Massachusetts employees' decision to unionize, stressing that he stands with the Stoughton-based workers.

But sugar supports have for decades been unassailable in Congress, partly due to wide bipartisan support from lawmakers representing states from Florida to North Dakota that grow sugar cane and sugar beets.\u201d http://bit.ly/1Lcypzy \nNOT A FAN: Gawker looks at Bob Dole\u2019s reaction when asked about TED CRUZ. \u201cDole announces jovially, \u2018There are a lot of good candidates.

"{""body"": "" (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Republican presidential rivals Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are backpedaling furiously as they try to outmaneuver each other on immigration.\nRubio co-wrote a massive 2013 immigration bill that passed the Senate. He disavows it now", but Cruz won't stop talking about it.\nCruz opposed the bill, but he offered amendments to massively increase legal immigration. Now he says that's not a good idea after all, but Rubio won't let him off the hook.\nBoth senators are maneuvering to appeal to conservative GOP presidential primary voters in a campaign shadowed by Donald Trump, who wants to deport all 11.5 million immigrants in this country illegally. Trump's hard-line stance has pushed the entire GOP field to the right and may create problems for the eventual GOP nominee facing a more diverse general election electorate. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush pointed to that possibility in Tuesday night's GOP debate when he said that Hillary Rodham Clinton's Democratic campaign would be doing high-fives at such talk.\nOn Thursday Cruz did a complete about-face on one of his long-held immigration stances," telling conservative talk host Laura Ingraham when asked whether he would increase the numbers of legal immigrants to the U.S.: \""I don't believe that's a good idea.\""\nBut during the Senate immigration debate two years ago the Texas senator was an outspoken advocate for increasing legal immigration"," particularly for highly skilled immigrants. He called legal immigration \""a pillar of our nation's heritage and strength\"" and introduced amendments to double the cap on legal immigration and increase the number of high-skilled immigrant visas by 500 percent.\nCruz also proposed an amendment to eliminate the path to citizenship in the Senate bill", allowing immigrants in the country illegally to end up with legal status short of citizenship instead.\nRubio highlighted those stances in a campaign appearance in South Carolina on Thursday," saying: \""Ted is a supporter of legalizing people that are in this country illegally. ... If you look at it"," I don't think our positions are dramatically different.\""\nBrian Phillips", Cruz's rapid response director, disputed that over Twitter, arguing in a series of tweets that Cruz was not seeking to support legal status for immigrants in the country illegally," only to oppose citizenship. \""For the 1000th time"," his amdt had nothing to do with legalization. He intentionally focused on citizenship only ... to illustrate that Dems weren't serious about passing real reform.\""\nFor his part", Cruz sought to use his appearance on Ingraham's show to highlight Rubio's role authoring the Senate immigration bill with its divisive path to citizenship for many of the immigrants in this country illegally. The legislation passed the Senate on a bipartisan vote in 2013 but ended up dying in the House, and President Barack Obama ultimately addressed the issue through executive actions now tied up in court.\nWhen asked about Rubio, Cruz said," \""You know where someone is based on their actions", as the Scripture says, you shall know them by their fruits,"\""\nSpeaking of Rubio and the other authors of the Senate bill", Cruz also said," \""They fought tooth and nail to try to jam this amnesty down the American people's throat over and over and over again.\""\nRubio now says that a single", comprehensive immigration bill is not the way to go and he would not address the status of the people in this country illegally before securing the border and remaking the legal immigration system. Ultimately he would still allow people here illegally to qualify for citizenship," but only after 15 years."""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": ""WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Republican presidential rivals Sens.

When a voter told Bush he was switching his support from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to Bush, the 6-foot-3 presidential candidate responded with an awkward chest bump. Bush didn't stop there. He's now offering chest bumps to any converts.\nCruz supporter tells Bush he's now backing him instead.

"{""body"": "" White evangelical Christians are well-positioned to have a strong say in early 2016 Republican primaries and caucuses", a new analysis by Geoffrey Skelley of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball found Thursday. But they could face trouble later in the campaign season.\nVoting starts February 1 in Iowa, where in 2012 exit poll data showed 56 percent of caucus voters were white evangelicals. Rick Santorum, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, had a strong appeal to those voters, and inched out a win.\nSkelley, using data from exit polls in 2008 and 2012, as well as information from the Census Bureau and the Public Religion Research Institute\u2019s American Values Atlas, found that 64 percent of total delegates in states with primaries or caucuses prior to March 8 will come from states with likely white evangelical majorities. South Carolina votes later in February, and on March 1, states with primaries or caucuses, and sizable evangelical populations, include Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. Three more such states, Kentucky, Louisiana and Kansas, vote March 5.\nThat means that candidates with special appeal to those groups could get an early boost, but it doesn\u2019t mean that will last. A majority of convention delegates will be chosenafter March 8.\n\u201cAll this is to say that white evangelical Christians are going to impact the 2016 Republican nomination contest, just as they have in previous cycles,\u201d Skelley found.\nBut because early delegates will be awarded proportionately, it will be hard for any single candidate in a multi-candidate field to get a huge early lead. And after March 15, some states will have winner take all primaries. And more states with smaller evangelical communities, such as Florida and Ohio, will be voting.\n\u201cThis is not to say that a white evangelical-oriented outsider candidate won\u2019t win the Republican nomination,\u201d Skelley said. \u201cBut many states with large numbers of conservative born-again Christians will vote when many candidates may still be in the race, possibly splintering their delegate hauls. \n\u201cNonetheless, if the white evangelical Iowa lane of the field winnows a great deal between now and March 1, it\u2019s possible that someone could take advantage and rack up a solid delegate take. Only time will tell, but there\u2019s little question that white evangelical Christians are going to be an important factor in determining the GOP nominee, particularly in the early going.\u201d\nSo far, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has attracted a strong evangelical following. Also in the mix are real estate mogul Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas; Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana; Mike Huckabee, former governor of Arkansas and 2008 Iowa caucus winner, and Santorum.\nDavid Lightman: 202-383-6101," @lightmandavid"""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": ""Analysis shows early states with big evangelical blocs\nAppeal could fade as race moves to bigger states\nSeveral candidates vying for evangelical vote\n\u2026\nClick to Continue \u00bb"""," ""title"": ""White evangelicals: Early influence on GOP race"," but prospects then get shakier"""," ""url"": ""http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article44352246.html"""," ""topics"": [""personality"""," ""campaign_finance""]"," ""people"": [""Geoffrey Skelley"""," ""Crystal Ball"""," ""Rick Santorum"""," ""Donald Trump"""," ""David Lightman"""," ""Marco Rubio"""," ""Mike Huckabee"""," ""Bobby Jindal"""," ""Ben Carson"""," ""Ted Cruz""]"," ""orgs"": [""Census Bureau"""," ""Public Religion Research Institute"""," ""GOP""]"," ""election_confidence"": 0.9998866749436447"," ""authors"": [{""author_id"": 33909"," ""fullname"": ""david lightman"""," ""primary_org"": ""mcclatchy""}]"," ""date_written"": ""2015-11-12 14:26:17"""," ""org"": ""mcclatchy"""," ""article_id"": ""c317cc8cc1cd3d9dd11b3878ef2eb65a"""," ""date_access"": ""2015-11-12 14:31:31.001673""}",

"{""body"": "" (CNN)Ted Cruz is facing criticism on the right over a surprising issue: immigration.\nThe senator from Texas and Republican presidential candidate", who rose to national prominence because of his hard-line stands on everything from Obamacare to immigration, is under fire for his past support of the controversial H-1B visa program. \nCruz has backed quintupling the number of visas in the program," which encourages legal immigration for highly skilled foreign workers. But it's a position that's causing headaches for him as the campaign develops.  \n\""You've got Hillary Clinton", Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and even Ted Cruz, to my disappointment, who want to do everything from double to triple to quintuple -- in Ted Cruz's case -- the number of H-1B visas that are available to these largely offshore outsourcing companies from India,"\"" influential conservative pundit Michelle Malkin said in a video on her Facebook page last week. \""That is nuts.\""  \nFor Cruz", support for H-1B visas has been a way to insulate himself not just from a hot red base quick to label any moderation as amnesty, but also from his unwillingness to say what he would do with the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Sharing his father's dramatic flight from Cuba," Cruz tells reporters or town hall questioners that he \""celebrates legal immigration\"" and that he would like to \""streamline\"" the process -- even as he cracks down on illegal border crossings. \nBut Cruz appears to be changing his tune. During Tuesday night's Fox Business debate in Milwaukee", he framed illegal immigration as an economic threat, choosing the rhetoric used by conservative talk radio hosts who have raked Cruz over the coals, rather than his tried-and-true stump speech about preserving rule of law. And Cruz now no longer supports an increase in the number of visas until the program is reformed, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said Wednesday. \nTed Cruz draws immigration contrast with Marco Rubio\n\nThe U.S. currently allows only 65,"000 workers who specialize in science or technology to immigrate legally each year. But the program has come under increasing criticism from protectionists and American industries that say the country is \""outsourcing\"" labor and charge there is widespread abuse of the visa system. \nCruz has of late been more loudly voicing objections to the visa process"," telling a New Hampshire voter in a town hall on Wednesday evening that the emerging reports are \""horrifying","\"" a shift he signaled in an interview with radio host Vince Coakley last week. \n\""I have been very", very concerned at the growing abuse of the program,"\"" Cruz said. \""That's not what the H-1B program was designed to do.\"" \nThat interview made its way to Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama", perhaps the GOP's leading anti-immigration voice. Sessions said he is talking with Cruz about his current position and even hinted that Cruz could flip his position," sounding skeptical that the senator from Texas would still want to quintuple the number of legal immigrants in the future. \n\""I think a lot of our members will come out that way in the end","\"" Sessions told CNN. \nCruz is hardly the only GOP candidate who backs the program on some level. Republicans from Bush to Ben Carson have voiced some support for H-1B visas", and Rubio's push for a more ambitious, Microsoft-backed bill has drawn the ire of Sessions," who said Rubio's legislation would \""quash the dreams of more talented Americans.\"" \n\nDonald Trump has already shown a willingness to mock Rubio for his aggressive support for the Silicon Valley-backed policy. Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said the campaign is not planning to hit Cruz on the explosive issue", but Trump's hard line on immigration has helped shift the debate to the right on the campaign trail. \nTakeaways from the Republican debate\nBut given Cruz's ideological purity -- highlighted by a report on Monday from Heritage Action," a political group tied to the influential Heritage Foundation -- his support for H-1Bs may be the most attractive liability to attack. \nRepublican talkers have been Cruz's biggest gadflies. Cruz enjoys an unusually chummy relationship with conservative talk radio hosts -- joking before Tuesday night's debate that a leading trio in the industry should moderate future forums -- but some have turned on him. \nThe New Hampshire voter told Cruz that her brother in the tech industry might not vote for him because of his position -- which the brother learned about from talk radio. \n\""The rhetoric and the policy do not match","\"" Rick Santorum told CNN on Wednesday"," saying Cruz's motivation for increased legal immigration was \""purely political\"" and an attempt to win over business-friendly donors. \""This is a way of having a foot in both camps -- to sound very tough on illegal immigration", but to say," 'I'm going to take care of you by bringing in a whole bunch of people legally.'\""  \n\nThe unease with Cruz dates back to the 2013 Senate fight over immigration", when Rubio and Democratic leaders led an ill-fated push for comprehensive reform legislation that included a path to citizenship for the undocumented. Cruz fought the bill, but also argued for an amendment to increase in the cap on visas to 325,000, a position he has repeated during the 2016 race. \nBut after the 2013 bill died and the dust settled," Cruz continued to be excoriated by some of the movement's leading talkers for his stance.\n\""I don't care how many times Ted Cruz is held up by the tea party. Ted Cruz is identical to Marco Rubio","\"" radio host Michael Savage told his listeners in January 2014. \""Ted Cruz is not to be trusted. I told you he's a snake.\"" \nCruz's critics on the issue see room for hope: Cruz does not bring up the specific fivefold increase as often as he once did", opting for vaguer rhetoric. He chided donors and reporters in Tuesday night's debate for not seeing immigration as a pocketbook issue as opposed to a cultural one. And his radio interview last week could foreshadow the package of reforms that Sessions said Cruz is likely to introduce in the Senate over the coming months. \nRoy Beck, who leads NumbersUSA, a group supporting a reduction in immigration numbers," predicted that while Cruz is \""polishing some of the edges\"" with his new language"," his support for expanded H-1Bs would be used a political wedge to expose \""his real vulnerable spot.\"" \nUnless", of course," Cruz changes his position. \n\""I just see him month by month and shifting","\"" Beck said. \""As time goes on"," you could end up being in a really different place than nine months ago.\""\n \n"""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": ""Ted Cruz is facing criticism on the right over a surprising issue: immigration."""," ""title"": ""Why some conservatives are upset with Cruz on immigration"""," ""url"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/12/politics/ted-cruz-immigration-h1-b-visas/index.html"""," ""topics"": [""immigration""]"," ""people"": [""Rick Santorum"""," ""Catherine Frazier"""," ""Corey Lewandowski"""," ""Jeb Bush"""," ""Michael Savage"""," ""Hillary Clinton"""," ""Donald Trump"""," ""Marco Rubio"""," ""Roy Beck"""," ""Jeff Sessions"""," ""Michelle Malkin"""," ""Ben Carson"""," ""Ted Cruz""]"," ""orgs"": [""Heritage Foundation"""," ""Senate"""," ""Microsoft"""," ""GOP"""," ""United States.""]"," ""election_confidence"": 0.9999444621814779"," ""authors"": [{""author_id"": 23575"," ""fullname"": ""theodore schleifer"""," ""primary_org"": ""cnn""}]"," ""date_written"": ""2015-11-12 16:50:59"""," ""org"": ""cnn"""," ""article_id"": ""d971f3d0a0a46728ae572526130048fd"""," ""date_access"": ""2015-11-12 17:01:13.066404""}",

Marco Rubio over his plans to increase the defense budget by $1 trillion over the next 10 years without explaining how he would pay for the increase.\n\""How is it conservative to add a trillion dollars in military expenditures?\"" Rand Paul asked his opponent at Tuesday's Republican debate. \""You cannot be a conservative if you're going to keep promoting new programs that you're not going to pay for.\""\nRubio retorted swiftly: \""We can't even have an economy if we're not safe.\"" \nThe heated exchange exposed the fault lines in the GOP as conservatives grapple with a world that seems increasingly in turmoil and a country weighed down by mounting debt.\nIt also raises questions about the definition of a conservative national security policy"," where two of the ideology's traditional tenets -- a strong U.S. military and reduced government spending -- collide. Rubio and Rand are each trying to claim the mantle of being the \""true conservative\"" in an appeal to GOP primary voters", even though they take sharply opposing views on the issue.\nREAD: Takeaways from the Republican debate\nBoth senators' approaches have footholds in American conservatism, and which one ends up resonating more with voters could be as much a product of the current international security environment as ideological imperatives.\nPeter Berkowitz, a senior fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution," described \""a very difficult balancing act\"" for Republicans between the instinct for fiscal restraint and the deep-rooted conservative tradition of a strong national defense.\n\""There's something in my mind worrisome and off in declaring what the authentic conservative position is","\"" Berkowitz said. \""The better way to characterize the tradition is really an unending debate between these two sides.\""\nPaul and Rubio's views on U.S. defense spending are each aligned with two different Republican presidents: Dwight Eisenhower", who reined in defense spending, and Ronald Reagan, who ramped it up, according to fellow Hoover Institution scholar Kori Schake," a National Security Council aide in President George W. Bush's administration.\n\""There is really an enduring tension between the two", but it is certainly true that at least since Ronald Reagan, the reflexes of conservatism are for more defense spending, not less,"\"" Schake said.\nSchake said that Paul's arguments in favor of fiscal restraint might have gained more traction three years ago when conservatives accepted steep defense cuts as part of \""sequestration\"" to hold down the cost of the U.S. budget. But now", a downsized military, the rise of ISIS," instability in the Middle East and a more aggressive Russian posture are making a strong defense a priority for most conservatives.\n\""The world is looking a lot more dangerous and uncertain for America's safety in the last two", three years,"\"" Schake said. \""I do think there is an increased appreciation even among debt hawks that we want a wider margin of error"," we want a stronger military in order to deter challenges to America's security.\""\nBut Christopher Preble", the vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute," said he believes Rubio's plan to increase defense spending without offsetting the cost is simply \""not a conservative sentiment at all.\""\nAnd while the Republican foreign policy establishment has largely embraced the neoconservative belief in an aggressive American military stance abroad"," Preble said he believes that ideology represents a \""very small segment of the public at large"," including the Republican electorate.\""\nBut an August 2014 Pew Research Center poll showed that a slim majority of Americans believed Obama's foreign policy approach is \""not tough enough\"" -- a figure that soared to 81% among conservatives.\nNorman Ornstein", a political analyst at the neoconservative American Enterprise Institute, suggested Paul's argument in favor of a more scaled-down military will face significant headwinds since the GOP has pressed its message that Obama is too weak on the world stage and in confronting ISIS.\nInstead," Ornstein said Rubio probably \""had the upper hand\"" in the debate", with Rubio's hawkish position likely to be more attractive.\nREAD: Rand Paul: Clinton," Rubio both 'neoconservatives'\n\""The antipathy toward Obama is so great","\"" Ornstein said. \""If Obama's X", you want to be the opposite of X. So if the narrative in almost every case is Obama is getting taken to the cleaners by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, Obama is unable to deal with ISIS," unable to deal with China and you're out there saying I'm not going to do that -- that will probably help.\""\nIndeed", it's a calculation that most in the Republican field have made. Beyond Rubio, nearly every candidate from Jeb Bush to Chris Christie to Donald Trump has pledged to adapt a more robust posture in fighting ISIS and to build a stronger military to do so.\nBut both Rubio and his like-minded rivals as well as Paul have some claim to the conservative movement's sentiments on foreign policy. That's largely because views on foreign policy are in no way homogenous within the movement.\nIn Ornstein's word," on foreign policy there simply isn't a \""one-size-fits-all conservative mantle. \nAnd James Carafano", vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation," said Rubio and Paul's arguments are not necessarily incompatible.\n\""We had this kind of caricature of foreign policy that the choice in foreign policy is between invading everybody and every country or sitting at home and doing nothing","\"" Carafano said. \""I don't think that reflects the mainstream of where conservatives really are"," and I don't think that really reflects where the major candidates really are.\""\nHe concluded"," \""The reality of foreign policy is there is not a rule book"," and there is not a philosophical or ideological answer for every foreign policy problem.\""\n"""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": """""," ""title"": ""Can a conservative spend $1 trillion on defense?"""," ""url"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/12/politics/marco-rubio-rand-paul-conservative-debate-military-spending/index.html"""," ""topics"": [""foreign policy/national security""]"," ""people"": [""Rand Paul"""," ""Kori Schake"""," ""Chris Christie"""," ""Jeb Bush"""," ""George W.

"{""body"": ""A long-simmering debate over immigration in the Republican presidential contest boiled over on Thursday", as five contenders seized on the issue and Senator Ted Cruz accused his colleague, Senator Marco Rubio, of \u201ctrying to stuff amnesty down the throats of the American people.\u201d\n\nFrom appearances on conservative talk radio to the campaign trail in South Carolina, the candidates sought to appeal to grass-roots conservatives who are alarmed about immigration. And the eruption of open warfare between Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz, two establishment candidates who have been rising in the polls, showed the likely contours of the Republican presidential fight as it hurtles toward the Iowa caucuses in less than 90 days.\n\nImmigration is a key vulnerability for Mr. Rubio, who was initially part of an effort in 2013 to formulate a bipartisan bill in the Senate to reform the immigration system, an effort that is viewed with deep skepticism by conservatives.\n\nMr. Cruz, in an appearance with the conservative radio host Laura Ingraham, denounced Mr. Rubio without using his name, saying, \u201cYou know where someone is based on their actions. As the Scripture says, you shall know them based on their fruits.\u201d\n\nAnd three other lower-polling candidates \u2014 Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky; Rick Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator; and Carly Fiorina, a former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard \u2014 sought to join the fight, piling on Mr. Rubio or Mr. Cruz as insufficiently pure on a key litmus test for segments of the Republican base.\n\nThe long-distance exchanges illustrated the degree to which several candidates see immigration, which emerged as a key issue in the 2014 midterm elections, as the most potent weapon in their arsenal in a presidential contest that has been characterized by concerns about the direction of the country.\n\nMr. Rubio, when asked about Mr. Cruz\u2019s critique while campaigning Thursday morning, sought to turn the tables.\n\n\u201cTed is a supporter of legalizing people that are in this country illegally,\u201d Mr. Rubio said, according to a transcript provided by his aides. \u201cIn fact, when the Senate bill was proposed, he proposed legalizing people that were here illegally. He proposed giving them work permits. He\u2019s also supported a massive expansion of the green cards.\n\n\u201cHe supported a massive expansion of the H-1B program, a 500 percent increase,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo, if you look at it, I don\u2019t think our positions are dramatically different. I do believe that we have to deal with immigration reform in a serious way, and it begins by proving to people that illegal immigration is under control.\u201d\n\nIn his criticism of his Senate colleague, Mr. Cruz recalled that Mr. Rubio, the Florida senator who was a member of the so-called Gang of Eight group of lawmakers who sought to overhaul the immigration system, opposed measures to tighten border security.\n\n\u201cHe opposed every single one of them,\u201d Mr. Cruz, of Texas, said of amendments Mr. Rubio opposed that would have increased border-patrol resources, created a strong e-verify system and developed an exit-entry system for visa overstays. \u201cThe Gang of Eight voted against securing and enforcing the border.\u201d\n\nMr. Rubio now says that immigration must be handled in parts and that after the border is secured, new policies can be developed for dealing with immigrants who have entered the country illegally.

"{""body"": ""Sarah R. Coleman is a Ph.D. candidate in history at Princeton University and a fellow at the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia. \n (CNN)In Tuesday night's GOP debate", Donald Trump turned to history to provide a model for his plan to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, saying," \""Let me just tell you that Dwight Eisenhower", good president, great president. ... Moved a million and a half illegal immigrants out of this country, moved them just beyond the border. They came back. Moved them again, beyond the border," they came back. Didn't like it. Moved them way south. They never came back. Dwight Eisenhower.\""\nWhile not calling it by name"," Trump was praising Eisenhower's \""Operation Wetback","\"" which Trump claims significantly reduced unlawful immigration in the early 1950s. Here's the problem: It wasn't \""successful\"" then", by Trump's standard, and is not a model for a considered immigration policy now.  It was an inhumane program that sheds a harsh light on the supposedly tranquil Fifties and casts doubt on Trump's judgment.\nWith rising domestic political concern about illegal Mexican immigration in the early 1950s, President Eisenhower turned to his Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner, and his former West Point classmate, Gen. Joseph Swing, to undertake Operation Wetback \u2014 named for the derogatory term for Mexican immigrants that dates to the 1920s \u2014 with the cooperation and assistance of the Mexican government as historians have shown. \nIn a military-style action, beginning in June 1954 and continuing through 1955, immigration agents throughout the Southwest and, later, other parts of the United States, rounded up immigrants without legal status. The deportation program also had something Donald Trump might have loved \u2014 extensive publicity, as immigration officers were followed and photographed by journalists courted by government officials.\nINS agents began by blanketing communities with public notices encouraging undocumented workers to leave on their own accord, then soon turned to harsher methods, including sweeps and raids using jeeps, planes and ground teams. \nAs historian Mae Ngai related, while some immigrants were transported by plane or train to Mexico, a quarter of those deported were transported on cargo boats from Port Isabel, Texas, to Vera Cruz, Mexico," in an operation that a congressional investigation \u2014 convened in 1956 \u2014 compared to an \""18th century slave ship\"" and a \""penal hell ship.\""  \nCramped into inhumane sleeping spaces"," with \""filthy conditions","\"" \""crude\"" medical facilities", and no proper safety equipment, a riot broke out on one ship, and seven immigrants drowned on another.  Eighty-eight immigrants died of sunstroke during a roundup in 112-degree heat, while others were loaded tightly on trucks, driven south to Mexico and dumped in the desert. While the INS at the time claimed that the six-week operation netted 1.3 million deportations, scholars have suggested the numbers were far less.  \nDespite the U.S. government's major efforts, Operation Wetback was unsuccessful at curbing future unauthorized migration to the United States. At the same time, legal migration did increase, which was the main goal of the INS," which wanted to encourage farmers to hire workers legally through the \""Bracero\"" program", which allowed temporary contract workers to enter the United States.  \nBetween 1953 and 1955, INS more than doubled the number of Bracero visas and many of those legally contracted workers had previously worked illegally.  The Bracero program itself was marked by widespread abuse of workers. \nWhere immigration policy is concerned, Eisenhower is not the president to emulate, regardless of where one stands on the political spectrum.\nOperation Wetback is just one of many shameful episodes of forceful removal in American history, from the Trail of Tears, when members of several Native American nations were forcibly removed from their traditional lands and relocated farther west during the 19th century, to the forced relocation and incarceration of over 100,000 Japanese Americans during World War II.\n Like those events, Operation Wetback was a shameful violation of human rights," not a model for future policy.  \nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.\n"""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": """""," ""title"": ""Sorry"," Trump.

It also reflects a war-weary nation as conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan drag on with no end in sight and President Barack Obama decides to deploy up to 50 Special Operations forces to Syria.\nThe divisions were on stark display during Tuesday's night debate. In a heated exchange, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio called for raising defense spending significantly. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz wants more robust spending, too," but he doesn't want to make the deficit larger. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul's isolationist bent makes him less willing for the U.S. to get involved abroad and he wondered aloud how spending more money on defense qualifies a candidate as a conservative.\n\""Defense spending has fallen dramatically on President Obama's watch", and our forces have been reduced and suffered readiness challenges even as threats abroad increase,"\"" Rubio said. \""Our military therefore needs a serious program of reinvestment and modernization.\""\nHe failed to mention that the cuts to defense spending as well as to domestic spending were largely the result of the 2011 budget pact between Obama and congressional Republicans", who were intent on reducing the nation's deficit.\nPaul, who has proposed a budget in the past that would have cut spending across the board to curb deficits, said he wants a strong national defense," \""but I don't want us to be bankrupt.\""\nCongress just approved spending $607 billion on defense next year"," and the United States is still the world's largest military spender \""at nearly three times the level of second-placed China","\"" according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

It said U.S. military strength has been weakened by deep budget cuts that started with the 2011 budget law. \""Budget cuts have left the military in disrepair","\"" the panel's report said. The Budget Control Act has created a \""readiness crisis\"" and has caused shortfalls in present and future capabilities.\nThat has prompted U.S. allies to question the United States' resolve on the world stage", the report said. If the budget cuts are not stopped, the U.S. military will become a hollow force, the report said.

"{""body"": ""\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nToo many of the men and women I have met on the campaign trail are disillusioned with a government that they believe no longer works for them. Indeed", 75 percent of Americans now believe that our government is corrupt. They believe that it favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy, and the well-connected\u2014and they are right.\nFor decades, under both Democrat and Republican leadership, the government has continued to grow in size, in power, and in complexity.\nSpending increased to $3.5 trillion in 2014. Our national debt is over $18 trillion. Since 2001, there have been over 4,500 changes to the tax code\u2014an average of more than one per day. There are nearly 1,000 rules governing the operation of small businesses, more than at any point in the last decade.\nAs the government grows more bloated and more complex, it naturally favors the big, the powerful, and the well-connected\u2014because only they can afford to hire armies of lawyers, accountants, and lobbyists to handle big government. And here's the truth: It can't be fair unless it's simple.\n\nI have spent my whole life challenging the status quo and overhauling bloated bureaucracies. It\u2019s what I did at Hewlett-Packard and it is what I will do when I lead the federal government.\n\nThat is the dirty little secret of giant, expensive regulations like ObamaCare or Dodd-Frank. They were written in part by lobbyists for big companies who want the rules to work for them. \nThe passage of ObamaCare is bringing rising premiums for many Americans\u2014and tens of millions of dollars in profits for drug companies. Dodd-Frank has crushed more than 1,500 of the community banks that provide half the loans to small businesses\u2014while the ten banks too big to fail have simply become five banks too big to fail.\nAs government grows, it also becomes much more difficult to hold people and agencies accountable and to root out this type of corruption. \nIt is how Lois Lerner was able to get away with her illegal, partisan attacks on conservatives. \nIt is how the Department of Veterans Affairs became a stain on our nation\u2019s honor, with hundreds of thousands of veterans dying awaiting health care. \nIt is how Hillary Clinton has been able to repeat her lies about Benghazi.\nBut there is an opportunity here, if our next president is prepared to seize it. \nAll of our wounds are self-inflicted\u2014and all of our problems are fixable. \nIt will take citizenship and it will take leadership, but together, we can fix them.\nThere\u2019s an old saying that if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. For politicians, regulations and bureaucracy are their hammer. For too long, they have been in the business of managing problems and they have forgotten that leadership is about envisioning solutions.\nWe need a proven, tested leader in the White House\u2014someone who has challenged the status quo and who is not afraid to make enemies. \nShe must be prepared to change the order of things because she hasn\u2019t spent her whole life in the system. \nWe need a president of courage and conviction, who is committed to citizen government and who will engage you to solve our nation\u2019s problems.\nI have spent my whole life challenging the status quo and overhauling bloated bureaucracies. It\u2019s what I did at Hewlett-Packard and it is what I will do when I lead the federal government.\nFirst, we have to move to zero-based budgeting. Every agency must justify every dollar that they spend. We have to roll back the regulations that are crushing the small businesses that create two thirds of the jobs in our country.\nWe must also shrink the size of our bloated bureaucracy. Over the next five years, hundreds of thousands of federal employees are expected to retire. \nI would not replace a single one. At the same time, we must move to a pay-for-performance system and turn the federal government into a meritocracy.\nWe must examine every regulation on the books today. Congress should pass the REINS Act, which will require every major regulation from the White House to be reviewed and voted up or down.\nFinally and most importantly, we must engage the American people. Technology allows us to do this easily. \nI will use that technology to engage you and put pressure on the political class to actually get something done.\nPoliticians have gotten us into this mess. It will take a proven leader and citizens to get us out of it. \nIt's time to take our government back. \n\nCarly Fiorina is a candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.

The only question now is whether we have the will to do it.\""\nA photo of President Dwight Eisenhower pointing at the reader ran at the bottom of the post declaring"," \""Ike wants you to help Make America Great Again.\""\nUnder \""Operation Wetback","\"" which was implemented under Eisenhower", the government deported hundreds of thousands of Mexicans (the exact total has been called into question) via buses and ships," depositing them in various places in Mexico. The operation has since been widely condemned for violating human rights.\nTrump previously referred to Eisenhower's policy in an interview for CBS' 60 Minutes as an example of how he planned to round up undocumented immigrants in a \""very humane way"," a very nice way.\"" At the Republican presidential debate on Tuesday night"," Trump suggested Eisenhower's popularity shows that mass deportation could be done humanely. \n\""Let me just tell you that Dwight Eisenhower. Good president. Great president","\"" Trump said at the Fox Business debate. \""People liked him. I liked him. I Like Ike", right? The expression, 'I like Ike.' Moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country. Moved them just beyond the border, they came back. Moved them again beyond the border, they came back. Didn't like it. Moved 'em waaaay south, they never came back. Dwight Eisenhower. You don't get nicer," you don't get friendlier. They moved 1.5 million people out. We have no choice. We. Have. No. Choice.\""\nJared Taylor"," who runs the site American Renaissance (which says that \""one of the most destructive myths of modern times is that people of all races have the same average intelligence\"")"," wrote in an email to BuzzFeed News that the policy was a \""useful model.\""\n\""If jobs dry up and illegals realize the feds will come for them eventually", they won't wait.

When the neighborhood or the school turns Mexican," they move. I'm different from other whites only because I say it out loud: I'd rather live in a white society.\""\nTrump's citing of the policy was also well received on StormFront.org", the white nationalist Internet forum site founded by former Ku Klux Klan leader and white supremacist Don Black.\nOn his radio program," Black called Trump \""the alpha male\"" on the debate stage"," and his co-host Don Advo said he was happy that Trump \""evoked Dwight Eisenhower","\"" on immigration. \n\""Trump is holding firm on his anti-immigration policy","\"" said Advo\n\""Donald Trump is to be commended.

"{""body"": ""EXETER", N.H.\u2014Ohio Gov. John Kasich, playing the sensible establishment candidate in a race that has favored conservative\u00a0outsiders, on Thursday defended his stances on\u00a0bank bailouts and a pathway to citizenship for illegal\u00a0immigrants.\n\u201cThe idea that we are going to ship 11 million people out of this country and go into neighborhoods and round them up is simply not practical,\u201d Mr. Kasich said after speaking to senior citizens here Thursday afternoon. \u201cI just think the practical solution is that if they haven\u2019t violated the law, they have a path to legalization.\u201d\nMr. Kasich has sought to contrast his\u00a0views on immigration with those of hardliners such as Donald Trump and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, highlighted most recently in Tuesday\u2019s Wall Street Journal/Fox Business debate. Mr. Kasich\u00a0and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush are the only Republicans running who currently support some route to legal status\u00a0for undocumented\u00a0immigrants.\nMr. Trump has pledged to round up millions of illegal immigrants and deport them. Also Thursday,\u00a0Mr. Cruz said that \u201cmillions\u201d of Republicans will stay home in November if they believe the GOP nominee is soft on immigration.\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Kasich sparred with Mr. Cruz during the debate over what should have been done about financial institutions that neared collapse in 2008. The Ohio governor Thursday stood by his view that the Obama administration\u2019s bailout was necessary to protect people\u00a0of modest means.\n\u201cThey are the folks who have to be looked out for,\u201d Mr. Kasich said of depositors. \u201cI\u2019m not for bailing out the investors in the banks.\u201d\nMr. Kasich\u2019s strategy has yet to pay off. He was on the bubble for being included in Tuesday\u2019s Republican primetime debate based on his national poll numbers, and he could be knocked off the main stage by the time of next month\u2019s forum. He\u00a0has focused his campaigning almost exclusively on New Hampshire, while the polls used so far to determine top-tier candidates haven\u2019t been state specific.\nMr. Kasich said he felt good about his debate performance, and that it helped highlight a growing divide between candidates who have tangible policies to help the American people as opposed to ones that will increase the U.S. deficit, endanger entitlement programs or have \u201cnumbers that don\u2019t add up.\u201d\nThose policies won\u2019t stand up during a general election fight, Mr. Kasich said.\n\u201cI want to make sure we have conservative solutions with a conservative candidate who can actually get things done for our country,\u201d Mr. Kasich said.\nSpeaking before a crowd of more than 100 seniors Thursday, Mr. Kasich said he stood by his view that Ohio\u2019s minimum wage increase was helpful to the state\u2019s economy and wouldn\u2019t negatively impact small business owners.\nHe also said that Planned Parenthood should be defunded, a response that several of the seniors loudly booed. The crowd wasn\u2019t of any one party affiliation.\nMore\nFor John Kasich, Medicaid Expansion Is Both an Accomplishment and Liability\n* * *\nDebate Video:\u00a0Cruz v.Kasich on Bank Bailouts\n______________________________________________________\n2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll Standings\n\n\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops. \r\n\nCapital Journal Daybreak Newsletter: Sign up to get the latest on politics, policy and defense delivered to your inbox every morning.\r\nFor the latest Washington news, follow @wsjpolitics\r\nFor outside analysis," follow @wsjthinktank"""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": ""Ohio Gov.

The yet-to-be-released list was sent to BuzzFeed News by a publishing industry source," and will appear in the Nov. 22 edition of the New York Times Book Review.Trump's title does edge out Carson's in the less-closely-followed \""combined print and e-book\"" category: On that list", Crippled America is at #4 and A More Perfect Union is at #5. But many industry observers expected Trump's book to dominate the bestseller list.As BuzzFeed News recently reported, the celebrity billionaire's proposal was passed over earlier this year by some publishers, who were skeptical of his staying power in the 2016 race, and then came to regret their decision.Carson's performance on the Times list is particularly impressive given that his book has already been out for more than a month: This will be A More Perfect Union's fifth week as a bestseller. By contrast, Cripple America is benefitting from the surge of publicity and sales that typically accompany a book's first week on the shelves.Carson and Trump \u2014 currently locked in a dead heat for first place in the 2016 primary polls \u2014 are both prolific bestselling authors.

"{""body"": "" (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 For months", Marco Rubio's campaign team in South Carolina operated out of a staffer's garage, plotting strategy for the first-in-the-South primary from freshly painted yard sale furniture and tiny classroom desks.\nThe shoestring budget setup was a point of pride for the Republican presidential candidate's team. Now, with Rubio enjoying a burst of momentum as the early voting contests edge closer, the Florida senator's campaign is moving beyond its lean and mean roots.\nOn Wednesday," Rubio's South Carolina team officially moved out of the garage and into a proper campaign headquarters \u00e2\u0080\u0094 though they brought some of the yard sale furniture along with them.\n\""This election could very well be decided in this state","\"" Rubio told the crowd gathered at the office in Columbia", South Carolina's capital.\nRubio's team also opened offices in Nevada a few weeks ago. His staff grew by about 30 percent in October, with more than 70 people now on the campaign payroll. The new hires include communications and digital advisers, as well as field workers to boost voter contact and advance staff to help set up larger and more frequent events in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada," the first four states to vote in the nomination contest.\nWhether Rubio can effectively build up his campaign infrastructure in those states may determine whether he can turn his natural political talents and easy appeal with GOP voters into primary victories.\n\""Everywhere I go I hear folks talking about him","\"" said Glenn McCall"," a Republican National Committeeman from South Carolina. \""So it's the right time to come into the state"," set up shop and set up more time here.\""\nWhile Rubio's advisers say they're simply executing the next phase in a carefully crafted campaign blueprint", there's no doubt the team's early penny-pinching was driven in part by necessity. The senator's fundraising has been underwhelming and his money totals trailed several rivals through summer and fall, including a lackluster $6 million haul in third financial reporting period of the year.\nBut buoyed by strong performances in the last two GOP debates, Rubio has been attracting more high-dollar donors, including billionaire investor Paul Singer and New York hedge fund manager Cliff Asness.\nWith more cash in the pipeline, Rubio is expected to spend more money on travel to early voting states and on larger events aimed at putting him in front of as many voters as possible. Rubio communications director Alex Conant pointed to a 450-person event in New Hampshire last week and a similar sized event in Davenport, Iowa, on Wednesday as examples of the type of settings the candidate will appear at more regularly.\nRubio's more robust travel plans are welcome news to some Republicans in early voting states who have griped for months that the senator wasn't spending enough time on the ground meeting with donors and wooing important backers. While some candidates have all but taken up residency in Iowa and New Hampshire," Rubio has been a more sporadic presence.\n\""He's recognizing that in order to win in New Hampshire", you need to be available to voters \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not just once or twice but more often than that,"\"" said Donna Sytek"," a prominent New Hampshire Republican. She called Rubio an \""attractive candidate\"" but said she's also still considering Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina.\nRubio's backers believe the campaign's fiscal caution has already been validated by the early money woes of other candidates. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker quickly built a large and expensive operation", but was forced to withdraw from the race after just two months when his fundraising stopped covering his bills. And despite raising more than $100 million for his super PAC, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush slashed payroll spending by 40 percent after campaign fundraising slowed.\nTo be sure," the Rubio team's tales of cheapness have helped the campaign define the Florida senator as a scrappy underdog taking on wealthier rivals. Campaign manager Terry Sullivan has bragged about sticking Rubio on budget airline Frontier \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which he called \""a special kind of hell\"" \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and touted his rule of personally approving expenses over $500.\nAt one of the campaign's Nevada offices", staffers tried to do their part to live up to the less is more mantra. After noticing a pizza place next to a campaign office had free wireless internet that required a password, a staffer walked over and bought two pieces of pizza and asked for the internet access code.\nBut the cost-cutting measure was short-lived. After about three weeks," the pizza place caught on and asked the Rubio team to stop.\n_\nPace reported from Washington.

"{""body"": ""The union representing postal workers is announcing its endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders for president\u00c2\u00a0on Thursday", giving the underdog candidate a much-needed boost in his effort to topple Hillary Clinton, who remains far ahead in the race for union support.\nMr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s views and record typically line up more closely with unions\u00e2\u0080\u0099 priorities, and the American Postal Workers Union said his years of work on their causes won members over.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPolitics as usual has not worked. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time for a political revolution,\u00e2\u0080\u009d union president Mark Dimondstein said in a statement, echoing Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battle cry.\nHis statement appeared to dismiss concerns from some that Mr. Sanders has been a political independent for decades, not a Democrat. The union was unmoved by Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent opposition to the Trans Pacific Partnership, an Asian free trade agreement that unions have fought and that Mr. Sanders has long opposed.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe should judge candidates not by their political party, not by what they say, not by what we think they stand for, but by what they do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Dimondstein said.\nHe also noted Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-time efforts to fight privatization of the U.S. Postal Service, and to keep\u00c2\u00a0post offices and mail facilities open amid budget cuts.\nWhile union membership nationally has declined, the labor movement plays an important role in elections because of its ability to turn out like-minded voters to the polls.\nMrs. Clinton still has far more labor support than her rival, owing to her longtime ties with union leaders, generally liberal positions, and a belief among many that she is the most electable Democrat running. So far, she has won endorsements of 12 national unions, including a few of the largest in the nation such as the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the American Federation of Teachers, each of which have 1.6 million members.\nBy contrast, the postal workers union has about 200,000 members. Mr. Sanders also has support of one other major national union, the National Nurses United, with nearly 185,000 members.\nMr. Sanders, a Vermont senator, had courted labor in general and the postal workers in particular, speaking to some 2,000 members at the union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s October conference in Las Vegas. In its announcement, the union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national executive board said it was encouraging members to participate in Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rallies and join Labor for Bernie, a grassroots group of supporters from unions, including some who have endorsed Mrs. Clinton and others that remain neutral.\nMore:\nOn Keystone, Obama Missed an Opportunity\nPopulism on the Rise in GOP Race\n______________________________________________________\n2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll Standings\n\n\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops. \r\n\nCapital Journal Daybreak Newsletter: Sign up to get the latest on politics, policy and defense delivered to your inbox every morning.\r\nFor the latest Washington news, follow @wsjpolitics\r\nFor outside analysis," follow @wsjthinktank"""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": ""The postal workers union is announcing its endorsement of Sen.

He stuck to his boring script, used his personal finances to keep the campaign afloat and waited for everyone else\u2019s weaknesses to become apparent. Once the others flopped, voters flocked to him as a safe harbor. Written off a few months earlier, Kerry ended up running the table, winning virtually every primary and caucus. Bush is in the same position Kerry was in November of 2003: floundering with the public yet surrounded by untested candidates and stocked with institutional resources.

The Kochs and their allies are investing in a pipeline to identify, cultivate and finance business-oriented candidates from the local school board all the way to the White House, and Koch operatives are already looking for opportunities to challenge GOP incumbents deemed insufficiently hardline in their opposition to government spending and corporate subsidies.\n\u201cThe ambitious effort, spearheaded partly by a for-profit consulting firm called Aegis Strategic that\u2019s backed by the Koch network, is one of several ways in which the brothers and their allies are seeking to influence the types of candidates who carry the GOP banner. The network has taken on a vetting role in the GOP presidential primary, offering favored candidates access to its donors and activists.

"{""body"": ""Washington (CNN)Marco Rubio insisted he learned his lesson when he abandoned his controversial immigration bill: Congress could not tackle such an issue in a comprehensive fashion.\nBut on the campaign trail"," Rubio says he's open to the most controversial aspect of that plan: a pathway to citizenship for the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants. Rubio laid out this week a list of criteria illegal immigrants would have to meet to earn citizenship -- mirroring the controversial Gang of Eight bill that he has methodically been distancing himself from after it passed the Senate in 2013.\n\""I personally am open to that","\"" he said of a \""very long\"" path to citizenship on National Public Radio.\nThe comments drew Rubio back into the fray of an issue that has dogged him with the right wing of the party since he first tried to tackle it in 2012. He has tried to project himself as a leader trying to fix a vexing issue", while also trying to be sensitive to the anger from the GOP base.\nBut by playing to both sides, Rubio has sparked criticism from the left and right and prompted sharp charges that he's choosing his position for political expediency. It's a sign that the issue is only going to heat up as he continues to ascend in the GOP race.\nSen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, an immigration hardliner and an aggressive opponent of the 2013 bill," told CNN on Thursday that GOP candidates should drop out of the race if they back a path to citizenship.\n\""Supporting citizenship for illegal immigrants should be disqualifying","\"" Sessions said when asked about Rubio's position. \""Just like we can't have a GOP nominee who supports Obamacare"," we can't have a GOP nominee who supports amnesty.\""\nAlabama Rep. Mo Brooks said in an interview that Rubio's position on immigration would \""very significantly\"" depress conservative voter turnout in a general election if he were the nominee.\n\""When I see what Marco has said and done", along with other presidential candidates, that is: Their actions and their comments are a definite concern because they undermine the ability of American families to earn enough to take care of themselves,"\"" said Brooks", a conservative Republican who backs Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for the nomination.\nOn Thursday, Rubio tried to muddy the waters even further by telling reporters that Cruz was aligned with his position on immigration reform," citing positions on H-1B visas and other matters that the Texan took during the 2013 battle. \nREAD: Why some conservatives are upset with Ted Cruz on immigration\n\""I don't think our positions are dramatically different","\"" Rubio said. \nBut Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said the Florida senator has made clear he  now opposes moving on a bill in a comprehensive fashion"," saying Washington must enact individual pieces of immigration reform -- starting with border and interior enforcement -- before debating a path to citizenship.\n\""What he has said is that the Gang of Eight bill is dead", and it's not coming back and it has even less support now than it did two years ago,"\"" Conant said Thursday. \""It's clear that the only way that the way to fix the broken immigration system is by first securing the border.\""\n\nIn April 2012"," a 41-year-old Rubio called a small group of reporters into his conference room to announce a rather bold step: He wanted to offer some children of undocumented immigrants the opportunity to apply for \""non-immigrant\"" visas before they would be allowed to earn a more permanent legal status.\nThe plan stopped short of offering a full-blown path to citizenship", as Democrats wanted. But it elevated his stature and showcased his willingness to dive in the choppy immigration waters -- just as the GOP's presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, had veered right on the issue and was considering picking him as the party's vice presidential nominee.\nBut in June 2012, Rubio gave up on that plan. President Barack Obama, in an election-year move," took executive action to defer deportations to certain undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. Rubio said such executive actions undermined an effort to do anything legislatively.\n\""People are going to say to me", 'Why are we going to need to do anything on this now. It has been dealt with. We can wait until after the election,"'\"" Rubio told the Wall Street Journal at the time. \""And it is going to be hard to argue against that.\""\nAfter Romney was routed with Hispanic voters in the 2012 elections", a bipartisan group of senators began negotiating behind the scenes to put together a sweeping proposal that they intended to push through Congress in 2013, when Democrats controlled the Senate and occupied the White House.\nREAD: Bush on Rubio: 'I'm a better bet' against Clinton\nFor months, Rubio was flirting with the group and privately negotiating details, but hadn't made a formal decision about signing onto the legislative proposal until April 2013," when he went on all the Sunday talk shows to aggressively defend the effort.\n\""This is not blanket amnesty","\"" Rubio said at the time.\nAs the measure headed to the Senate floor", Rubio sided with fellow negotiators to defeat any controversial amendments aimed at changing the structure of the plan. He voted against an amendment by Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, to require the completion of 700 miles of\nfencing at the border before allowing the pathway to citizenship plan to move forward. And he opposed a plan by Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, requiring that the country's biometric entry-exit system of tracking people crossing the border is fully implemented before giving legal status to undocumented immigrants.\nMoments before the bill's passage, Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants," said: \""Generations of unfulfilled dreams will finally come to pass","\"" adding: \""That's why I support this reform.\""\n\nBut after the bill's passage", Rubio began to speak much less frequently about the matter. Even though the rest of the Gang of Eight was still meeting regularly to strategize over how to ratchet up pressure on House Republicans to take up the bill, Rubio refused to do so, saying that the issue was now in the hands of the GOP-led House, which never called the plan up for a vote.\nBy taking that approach, Rubio began to make amends with many conservatives who were furious at his position, but he angered fellow proponents of immigration reform who believed he was caving to political pressure.\nIn an interview with CNN last week, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., one of the co-authors of the bill," said Rubio was initially \""totally committed\"" to the Gang of Eight plan and that his fingerprints were \""all over\"" the creation of a pathway to citizenship.\n\""The fact that he abandoned the bill so quickly because a bunch of right-wing commentators came out against it will not serve him well in his presidential campaign primary or general if he ever got there","\"" Schumer said.\nBy 2014", Rubio began to blame the president for scuttling immigration reform, saying voters had lost trust with him on enforcing existing law since Obama has acted, in his opinion, illegally by the executive actions he's taken. The crisis at the Southern border, where scores of undocumented children were trying to enter the country last summer," made it even harder politically for Rubio to defend the bill. And he has increasingly said that doing anything legislatively in such a major fashion would be a mistake.\n\""Every massive piece of legislation that has passed over the last 20 years has by and large been disastrous","\"" Rubio told Politico in April.\nIn recent days", Rubio's immigration position has begun to come into sharp focus, even though he was spared from the back-and-forth during the GOP presidential debate in Milwaukee earlier this week.\nDespite being an early proponent to give relief to children who arrived in the country illegally at a young age," Rubio has made clear that the president's deferred action program must \""end.\"" He\ncosponsored a bill last month to crack down on sanctuary cities.\nREAD: Marco Rubio's quip about welders gets torched\nRubio has dismissed Donald Trump's call to round up and deport the 11 million illegal immigrants as not \""reasonable","\"" but he added that some undocumented immigrants would be deported.\n\""There are going to be people who are going to have to be deported","\"" Rubio said in Hilton Head"," South Carolina on Thursday. \""Criminals will be deported. People who have not been here long enough will be deported. We will enforce our immigration laws.\""\nYet", Rubio has signaled an openness to eventually let the 11 million undocumented apply for citizenship, after paying back taxes and fines and taking other punitive steps -- echoing the call in the Gang of Eight plan that would have created a 13-year pathway to citizenship. But that would only happen, he said, after separate individual pieces of immigration reform are enacted," including border security and fixing the existing legal immigration system.\nSome on the right are still not satisfied.\n\""Republican voters are tired of leaders who promote an immigration agenda that serves everyone's interests but theirs","\"" Sessions said.\nCNN's Sunlen Serfaty contributed to this report"""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": ""Marco Rubio insisted he learned his lesson when he abandoned his controversial immigration bill: Congress could not tackle such an issue in a comprehensive fashion."""," ""title"": ""Rubio's immigration muddle"""," ""url"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/12/politics/marco-rubio-2016-immigration/index.html"""," ""topics"": [""immigration""]"," ""people"": [""Donald Trump"""," ""Mitt Romney"""," ""John Thune"""," ""Alex Conant"""," ""Sunlen Serfaty"""," ""Chuck Schumer"""," ""Marco Rubio"""," ""Barack Obama"""," ""David Vitter"""," ""Mo Brooks"""," ""Jeff Sessions"""," ""Ted Cruz""]"," ""orgs"": [""Senate"""," ""National Public Radio"""," ""Congress"""," ""GOP""]"," ""election_confidence"": 0.9623076451890491"," ""authors"": [{""author_id"": 30737"," ""fullname"": ""manu raju"""," ""primary_org"": ""politico""}"," {""author_id"": 23293"," ""fullname"": ""senior political reporter"""," ""primary_org"": ""cnn""}]"," ""date_written"": ""2015-11-12 23:58:03"""," ""org"": ""cnn"""," ""article_id"": ""e16ea4d2b25a5f617f185acef3964eaa"""," ""date_access"": ""2015-11-13 00:19:30.420644""}",
