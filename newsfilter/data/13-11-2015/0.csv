Reality Check: Sanders on vets with PTSD
By Debra Goldschmidt, CNN Health
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said, ""When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war, the 500,000 who came home with PTSD and traumatic brain injury.""
Roughly 2.6 million veterans served in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs says 11% to 20% of military members who served in Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from PTSD.
According to a Veteran Affairs independent study on traumatic brain injury, self-reported data found 15% of troops who were engaged in active combat in Afghanistan and Iraq ""may have suffered"" a mild traumatic brain injury. This falls in line with a report from the Brain Trauma Foundation, which found between 10% to 20% of Iraq veterans suffer from some level of traumatic brain disorder.
Verdict: True
Reality Check: O'Malley on net immigration from Mexico
By Sonam Vashi, CNN
Former Gov. Martin O'Malley said, ""The truth of the matter is net immigration from Mexico last year was zero."" He then challenged viewers to fact-check him, and we couldn't resist.
According to the Pew Research Center, net migration from Mexico probably reached zero in 2010, and more Mexicans have left the United States than arrived since then.
Additionally, the actual number of Mexicans living in the United States consistently declined throughout 2014. The U.S. Border Patrol also reported that in the 2014 fiscal year, the number of Mexicans apprehended along the border decreased 14% when compared to the 2013 fiscal year.
The information we have suggests that the net immigration rate is negative -- which is actually not zero -- but it is close, and probably still supports O'Malley's point.
Verdict: Mostly true

"DES MOINES, Iowa U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton was criticized in a debate on Saturday for her 2003 vote backing the U.S. invasion of Iraq, with rival Bernie Sanders linking it to regional chaos that aided the rise of Islamic State militants.
The day after a series of deadly bomb and gun attacks that killed at least 129 people in Paris, Sanders said the invasion was ""one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the modern history of the United States.”
""I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, unraveled the region immensely, and led to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS,"" said Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont.
""I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now,"" he said.
Clinton, who has frequently called the vote a mistake, said it should be placed in the historical context of years of terrorism before the invasion.
“If we’re ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extremists, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq,” she said.
The exchange came early in the second debate for Democrats seeking their party's nomination for the November 2016 presidential election, with the focus shifted to foreign policy and ways to combat terrorism after the Paris attacks.
The candidates and audience at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, observed a moment of silence at the beginning of the debate to honor those killed in France.
Clinton, the former secretary of state, has far more foreign policy experience than either Sanders or her other rival, former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley. But she was forced on the defensive early in the debate about her years of leading President Barack Obama's foreign policy team.
Clinton struck a sharp contrast to Obama's comments in an interview aired on Friday that ISIS had been contained.
""We have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network. It cannot be contained, it must be defeated,"" she said.
Republican presidential contenders have criticized Obama for what they say was an inadequate response to the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In the aftermath of the attacks, businessman Donald Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz called on the administration to reconsider plans to allow thousands of Syrian refugees to be resettled in the United States.
The White House aims to increase to 10,000 the number of Syrian refugees accepted in the United States during fiscal year 2016, from less than 2,000 accepted in the previous year.
Clinton has always been from the more hawkish wing of the Democratic Party. Her support for the 2003 Iraq invasion played a major role in her primary loss to Obama in the 2008 White House race.
The foreign policy focus was a dramatic shift in emphasis in a Democratic presidential race that so far has been dominated by domestic economic issues such as income inequality, college affordability and family leave.
The Democrats returned to that theme later in the debate, and Sanders criticized Clinton for being too cozy with Wall Street and not being in favor of reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act, the 1933 law that established a firewall between investment and commercial banking.
""Over her political career, Wall Street has been a major, the major donor to Hillary Clinton. Now maybe they’re dumb, but I don’t think so,"" said Sanders, who favors reinstatement of the act.
Clinton accused Sanders of impugning her integrity and said reinstating the law was not enough to rein in corporate influence and reform Wall Street.
""Reinstating Glass-Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough,"" she said. ""I go after all of Wall Street, not just the big banks.""
With the political clock ticking to the first nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 1, Clinton has opened a commanding lead over Sanders, her prime challenger, in national and Iowa polls. O'Malley trails well behind, in single digits in most polls.

"Here are the week’s top stories.

1. Military troops patrolled Paris as France and its allies around the world mourned 129 people killed in coordinated assaults on Friday that unfolded over three hours. More than 350 people were wounded, many seriously. The French president blamed the Islamic State, calling the attacks “an act of war that was prepared, organized and planned from abroad, with complicity from the inside.”

_______

2. France said three teams carried out the attacks, and ended them by detonating suicide belts. One attacker was identified as a man who used a Syrian passport to enter Europe along with the flow of migrants, another as a French national with a criminal record. Confirmation of the Islamic State’s involvement would mean the group has grown from a regional player in the Syrian conflict into a force waging a global terrorist war in less than two years.

_______

3. World leaders condemned the attacks and many tightened security. President Obama is at the G-20 meeting in Turkey for talks certain to be dominated by the fight against the Islamic State and terrorism in general. The U.S.-led campaign against the group had intensified in recent days in Iraq and Syria, and a bigger push is now likely.

_______

4. A new urgency pulsed through talks on a political solution to Syria’s war. Diplomats from the U.S., France, Russia, Iran and other nations met in Vienna on Saturday, facing knotty divisions on a way forward. Secretary of State John Kerry said the Paris attacks were born of “a kind of medieval and modern fascism at the same time, which has no regard for life, which seeks to destroy and create chaos and disorder and fear.”

_______

5. The second Democratic debate opened with a long discussion of the Paris attacks. Hillary Clinton deftly spun questions that invited her to blame the Obama administration for allowing the rise of the Islamic State, and defended herself from Bernie Sanders’s onslaughts on her relationship with Wall Street. Martin O’Malley may have had the most discussed single line, calling Donald Trump an “immigrant-bashing carnival barker.”

_______

6. The Republican candidates paused their criticisms of one another, particularly against Marco Rubio’s switch to a hard line on immigration. They broadly agreed that the U.S. should strengthen its military strategy against the Islamic State, and some proposed sending ground troops.

_______

7. Other developments this week were independent of international terrorism. Turmoil over racial discrimination spread to campuses across the country after protests forced top officials at the University of Missouri system to step down. Some students acknowledged they had felt only subtle signs of discrimination. “What matters,” one protester said, “is that we all need to have empathy for the experiences that people of color have even if we don’t have those experiences for ourselves.”

_______

8. A Times special report found a thriving U.S. black market that moves guns from states with lax gun laws into those with tougher measures. In New York and New Jersey, which have some of the strictest laws in the country, weapons involved in crimes often arrived via the so-called Iron Pipeline — Interstate 95 and its tributaries — from Virginia, Georgia and Florida.

_______

9. The Swiss foundation that holds the copyright to “The Diary of Anne Frank” has listed her father as a co-author. The diary, by all accounts, remains the words of a young girl hiding from the Nazis with her family. Emphasizing Otto Frank’s contributions of edits and a prologue allows the foundation to extend its copyright from 70 years after her death in 1945 at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp to 70 years after his death in 1980.

_______

10. International sports officials banned Russia from track and field competitions after a report accused Russia of running a state-sponsored doping program. And should the country fail to rapidly demonstrate compliance with anti-doping regulations, the ban could be extended to include the 2016 Olympics in Brazil.

_______

11. President Obama is scheduled to head from the G20 meeting in Turkey to Asia, for a lengthy trip to Malaysia and the Philippines. His agenda will include promoting the Trans-Pacific Partnership and attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Manila on Wednesday.

"Senator Marco Rubio, arguing that the United States is “at war with radical Islam,” sharply criticized Hillary Rodham Clinton for declining to characterize the perpetrators of the Paris attacks in that way, invoking Nazi Germany to make his point.

“That would be like saying we weren’t at war with Nazis, because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but weren’t violent themselves,” Mr. Rubio said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”

At the Democratic debate on Saturday night, Mrs. Clinton said she was wary about “painting with too broad a brush” while describing Muslims and terror.

“I don’t think we’re at war with all Muslims,” she said. “I think we’re at war with jihadists. We are at war with violent extremism. We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression.”

Republican presidential candidates have repeatedly condemned Democrats like Mrs. Clinton for their reluctance to use the term “radical Islam” while describing how they would respond to the violence wrought by ISIS.

Mr. Rubio, the Florida senator, also called on Sunday for the invocation of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which declares an attack on one member of NATO as an attack on all.

He demurred when asked about the prospect of placing American troops on the ground.

“I think it’s premature to say the exact numbers,” he said, though he called for an increase in the number of “special operators on the ground.”",MATT FLEGENHEIMER,"Attacking Mrs. Clinton, the Florida senator drew a parallel between members of the Nazi Party who did not commit acts of violence and Muslims who are not violent extremists.","First Draft: Invoking Nazis, Marco Rubio Hits Hillary Clinton for Not Saying U.S. at War With ‘Radical Islam’",http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/15/invoking-nazis-marco-rubio-hits-hillary-clinton-for-not-saying-u-s-at-war-with-radical-islam/,[u'foreign policy/national security'],"[u'Hillary Rodham Clinton', u'Marco Rubio', u'Hillary Clinton']",nyt,0.6955656874739587,"[{u'author_id': 358, u'fullname': u'matt flegenheimer', u'primary_org': u'nyt'}]",2015-11-15 15:56:02,[u'NATO'],16ad84a36862fa7f625bcbade71ca7be,2015-11-15 16:31:51.866074
"Donald Trump has dramatically escalated his attacks on his nearest rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Ben Carson. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll may explain why: the billionaire real estate magnate is bleeding support among avid church-goers and women to the retired neurosurgeon. 
While the unconstrained Trump has a comfortable double-digit lead over the soft-spoken Carson, the data points to a possible emerging threat to Trump's hopes of capturing the party's nomination for the November 2016 election. 
The poll of likely Republican primary voters also shows that Carson is drawing strong support from the rural Midwest, including Iowa, which holds the first Republican nominating contest on Feb. 1. Trump, in contrast, is drawing strong support in the northeast and southeast.
That geographical divide is significant, analysts said, because Carson's dominance in more socially conservative states like Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska reflects how his story of personal redemption is resonating strongly with evangelical voters. They traditionally play an outsize role not just in the first nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 1, but in Nevada and South Carolina, which also hold nominating votes in February.
""If Carson keeps his nose clean he could win those states and could catch lightning in a bottle,"" said Ford O'Connell, a Republican strategist not affiliated with either campaign.
Trump, who has topped national polls of likely Republican primary voters for months, has until now enjoyed strong support among the key constituency of low-income, blue-collar, church-going voters, who have been attracted by his image as a straight-talking political outsider.
But Carson's similar appeal as an outsider taking on the Republican establishment has undercut Trump's support in recent weeks, and Carson has surged to the top of a few recent national polls.
Carson's growing support with women and blue collar voters may explain Trump's recent attacks on his rival, said O'Connell. Trump has highlighted media reports questioning elements of Carson's personal story, and on Thursday he called Carson ""pathological"" and likened him to a child molester.

""OUTSIDER VOTE""
""Trump is desperate to consolidate the 'outsider' vote. The blue collar vote is very, very key to Trump's success in that. He has tried everything to shake Carson off and it hasn't worked, so he has decided to go nuclear,"" said O'Connell, an advisor to Republican Senator John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign.
To be sure, a separate rolling five-day Reuters/Ipsos poll shows Trump surging to 42 percent of likely Republican primary voters, up from 25 percent, since Nov. 6 while Carson was flat at 23 percent.
The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the polling data. 
Barry Bennett, Carson’s campaign manager, said of Trump's heightened criticism of Carson: “It’s hard to explain his remarks but clearly he’s feeling some pressure and overreacting.”
Bridget Miller, 43, from Stilwell, Kansas, said she had initially considered voting for Trump, but had switched to Carson. ""Carson is pro-life; he's pro-gun; he's saved baby's lives. He speaks to a lot of our values here,"" she said.
Other likely Republican primary voters say they initially supported Trump but his latest criticism of Carson and his ""child molester"" comments only confirmed their belief that he is unsuited to the presidency.
Janis Anderson, 54, from Fargo, North Dakota, said she had considered Donald Trump, but his latest comments about Carson were “ridiculous.”
Trump still either leads or shares the lead among most geographical and demographic groups, including wealthy and middle-income voters, people with and without college degrees, the southeast, northeast, the Upper Midwest and the American West.
But the story is different among lower-paid workers. In September, Carson had just over 14 percent of support among voters in households with an annual income of $50,000 or less, according to the broader Reuters/Ipsos data. By the end of October, that had jumped to over 23 percent support. Trump's support in the same group was flat at around 33 percent.
Among likely female Republican primary voters, Carson has seen his support jump since September from about 19 to 27 percent - the highest of any Republican candidate - while Trump's has slipped from 30 percent to 25.
Carson's support among regular churchgoers has also risen sharply, according to the Reuters/Ipsos survey, jumping 10 points between September and November to 32 percent, the highest of any Republican candidate. Trump's support with religious voters has slipped from 26 percent to 22 percent.
""As the campaign has evolved over time, Trump has begun to wear a little bit thin, especially voters who want a softer, more gentlemanly approach to politics,"" said David Gergen, an adviser to four former U.S. presidents from both parties. ""Carson is wearing better with women than Trump.""
The surveys of likely Republican voters was taken from Sept. 1 until Oct. 31. The Reuters/Ipsos poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 to 8 percent.

"An unsettling yet telling split-screen changed the view of the presidential campaign Saturday night: three Democratic candidates who had come to Iowa to talk about domestic issues found their debate hijacked by a foreign policy crisis dominating the news from a world away.
As metaphors for the last two presidencies go, the turnabout was apt: Both 
George W. Bush
 and 
Barack Obama
 came into office with domestic issues prime on their minds, only to have conflicts abroad hobble and frustrate their tenures.
Foreign policy, and specifically her vote for the Iraq War, also frustrated 
Hillary Rodham Clinton
 in her unsuccessful run for president in 2008. Not even an ad that year asserting that she was most experienced to take the 3 a.m. crisis call—the implication being that Obama wasn’t—was enough to overcome 
Democrats
' embrace of his early opposition to the war.
As much as anything, Saturday night's debate in the shocked aftermath of the Paris terrorist attack offered 
Clinton
 an opportunity to argue anew that her experience is necessary—and her opponents' is insufficient--for any 3 a.m. call. That allowed her to eclipse her rivals on stage, although in doing so, she may have created vulnerabilities a Republican could exploit next fall.
As a former senator and secretary of State, Clinton spoke with fluency about the contradictory puzzle and complicated players in the Middle East, and the tensions there that already have spilled into violence on the European continent. She recounted her experience helping downtown New York recover from the Sept. 11, 2001, attack (weirdly, however, it was in response to a criticism of her closeness with Wall Street donors).
Seeking to shake up the Democratic race and loosen Hillary Rodham Clinton's front-runner status, rivals Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley repeatedly challenged the former secretary of State on Saturday night in a debate where they largely agreed on most issues.
The session at Drake University...
Seeking to shake up the Democratic race and loosen Hillary Rodham Clinton's front-runner status, rivals Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley repeatedly challenged the former secretary of State on Saturday night in a debate where they largely agreed on most issues.
The session at Drake University...
When asked to recount a crisis that had tested her, she dramatically retold the story of advising President Obama to go after Osama bin Laden in 2011 despite concerns by many in the administration that the mission could fail. And, she noted, she offered the advice without consulting anyone, even her husband, former President Bill Clinton.
It was that question, more than any other, that demonstrated Clinton’s advantage once the focus turned to foreign policy. By contrast, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley recounted the daily tribulations of a mayor and state executive, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told of a veterans' bill, one in which he was not successful in achieving his initial goal and had to negotiate a compromise.
Indeed, discomfort on the part of Sanders and O'Malley was palpable from the start. After a moment of silence for the victims in Paris, the candidates moved to opening statements. Speaking before Clinton, Sanders jumped quickly into his familiar arguments about a ""rigged economy,"" a ""corrupt campaign finance system"" and the need for millions of Americans to stand and say that ""enough is enough.""
Speaking after Clinton, O’Malley averred that the Paris attacks showed the need for ""new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership."" But he did not offer any of the first two, and on the third, his mention that he worried about terrorism as a governor only underscored his lack of front-line international experience.
Clinton went right to the point.
""We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like 
ISIS
, the barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist, terrorist group,"" she said, adding pointedly: ""This election is not only about electing a president. It's also about choosing our next commander in chief.""
Clinton did not offer many operational details, apart from working with American allies on a united anti-jihadist front. But neither did her opponents.
The Democratic frontrunner undoubtedly would have received a rougher going-over had the debate been against a Republican free to oppose her actions as secretary of State from a perspective 180 degrees opposite hers (and all of the GOP candidates' views are.) Her weakest moment came in a muddled response to an obvious question about President Obama's failure—and hers--to anticipate the powerful rise of the Islamic State militants. That's a point Republicans are sure to hammer.
Clinton seemed intent on carefully navigating her party's shoals. She mildly distanced herself from Obama’s ill-timed assertion—delivered just before the Paris attack—that the Islamic State was contained. ""It cannot be contained, it must be defeated,"" she said.
But she immediately moved to calm the left: ""What the president has consistently said--which I agree with--is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS,"" she said, citing the U.S. forces training Arab and Kurdish militaries. ""But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential."" She mentioned the limits of American involvement twice.
The Democratic counter to Clinton was far more difficult to make, giving the debate performances of Sanders and O'Malley the feel of a collection of pulled punches.
Sanders has ridden a wave of support from the party's liberal left. Flaying Clinton for being insufficiently aggressive against the Islamic State and other terrorist groups would have inevitably risked a collision with the anti-interventionist views of his supporters, which by all evidence the senator ardently shares. O'Malley, with no clear path to the nomination besides his generational pitch, was effectively in the same fix.
Neither candidate, for example, explicitly hit Clinton on one of the most significant events of her tenure as secretary of State, the loss of four Americans at the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya. Republicans have argued that attack would have been prevented by a more aggressive posture.
The irony of terrorism and foreign policy overtaking a Democratic debate is that the party's candidates have largely avoided the subject this election cycle.
Republicans have brawled over the level of aggression each would apply in the Mideast, with several candidates advocating no-fly zones that would put the country's military in direct conflict with Russian planes operating over Syria. Several also have advocated a sharp rise in American troops overseas.
But for Democrats, the subject has been far more fraught. Obama came to office in the aftermath of Bush's intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan and vowed to disentangle America from both fights. He has since disappointed some of his followers by announcing that he would keep at least 5,500 troops in Afghanistan beyond the previously announced 2016 withdrawal. He also said recently that he would send special operations troops to Syria to assist rebels there --language that uncomfortably echoes the beginning of involvements in past military theaters.
So for the Democratic candidates there had been no real primary season rationale for a focus on foreign policy. The first Democratic debate stuck to the candidates' nuanced differences on issues like economic policy, healthcare and criminal justice, and their agreements on matters such as changing immigration policy and raising the minimum wage.
Then Paris exploded in violence.
Whether terrorism will remain at the forefront of the campaign is impossible to predict, given that nearly a year remains before the election. But if it happens, more detail will be required from both the Democrats and Republicans seeking the White House.
Ironically, as the candidates spoke to a country shaken by the Paris attack and wondering if it could happen here, one question was left unasked Saturday night: If France couldn't find a handful of terrorists in a country of 66 million people, how would the next president find them in a country of 320 million?

"Democrats and Republicans, based on their recent presidential debates, are set to offer voters a stark choice in 2016 about how the economy should be managed, with both sides moving toward the outer flanks of their parties.
In Saturday’s Democratic debate, candidates said they would seek to rein in Wall Street, raise taxes, increase the minimum wage and expand the federal government’s role in health care. Republicans, meanwhile, are competing to repeal regulations, cut taxes, keep the minimum wage as it stands and roll back President Barack Obama’s signature health-care overhaul.
The parties right now “have polar opposite analyses of how the economy works and how it should work,” said Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser in the Obama administration. “It’s obvious but underappreciated how far apart they are on the fundamentals—wages, taxes, financial markets.”

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, sparred Saturday over how to pay for new federal investments in education, infrastructure and health care. Both called for raising taxes on the wealthy, although Mrs. Clinton pledged to do so without hitting families that earn less than $250,000 or increasing deficits, which would constrain new spending ambitions.
Mr. Sanders wouldn’t say exactly how high tax rates should rise but noted the top tax rate had been 91% in the 1950s under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican. “I’m not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,” Mr. Sanders said.
Republicans have put tax-cutting proposals at the heart of their economic policy agenda, and they have largely shied away from promises made by candidates four years ago to avoid running up budget deficits.
The boldness of some proposals drew warnings from one candidate, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, at last week’s Republican presidential debate. “Hillary and the Democrats promise everything on the spending side. We’ve got to be responsible about what we propose on the tax side,” he said.
Republicans at last week’s debate also dismissed efforts to boost the federal minimum wage, now at $7.25 an hour, as an ineffective way to raise incomes. Florida Sen.  Marco Rubio and businessman  Donald Trump said it would put U.S. workers at a disadvantage. “You’re going to make people more expensive than a machine,” Mr. Rubio said.
Democrats on Saturday debated whether to target a federal minimum wage of $12 or $15 an hour. Mr. Sanders supports the higher threshold, an effort backed by labor unions. He brushed aside warnings issued recently by Alan Krueger, the Princeton University professor who served as Mr. Obama’s top economist, that a $15 minimum wage is an untested, risky level. His research contends minimum-wage increases haven’t decreased employment, and he supports raising wages to $12 an hour.
“I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously,” said Mrs. Clinton, who also has endorsed the $12 floor.
Mr. Sanders and Martin O’Malley, the third candidate at Saturday’s debate and a former Maryland governor, said they would shun anyone with Wall Street ties from top positions in their administrations, including figures such as  Robert Rubin and Larry Summers, who served as treasury secretaries for President  Bill Clinton.
Some Democrats have faulted that approach. “The idea that you have to excommunicate anybody who ever worked in the financial sector is ridiculous,” said Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist Democratic think tank. “We need people who oversee the Federal Reserve system and have high posts at Treasury that have expertise in finance.”
Both Republicans and Democrats have promised to crack down on Wall Street, but they disagree sharply over how to do it. Republicans generally have blamed government policies, from housing to Federal Reserve interest-rate decisions, for provoking the financial crisis. They say the Dodd-Frank Act in particular has restrained economic growth and should be repealed.
Democrats quarreled Saturday over whether the regulatory overhaul had gone far enough by failing to reinstate a New Deal-era law that separated commercial and investment banking, known as the Glass-Steagall Act.
The flare-up over banking laws reflected Mr. Sanders’s broader critique that Democrats and Republicans have given banks too much political power, a throwback to the “trust busting” of President Theodore Roosevelt more than a century ago. Why do big industries make “millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something,” he said in Saturday’s debate. “Everybody knows that.”
Both parties did agree in the past week on one thing: the virtues of community banks. Republicans warned that too many were going out of business. Mr. Sanders said Saturday that they needed more support. “That’s the future of banking in America,” he said.

The three Democratic candidates for president met in Des Moines on Saturday night for their second debate. The CBS debate was originally going to focus on the economy but shifted gears after the attacks in Paris on Friday.

The Democratic presidential candidates faced off for their second debate Saturday night, with the issues of terrorism and national security thrust back into the spotlight in the wake of the deadly Paris attacks.
All three candidates have weighed in on the tragedy, condemning the attacks for which the Islamic State has claimed responsibility. The attacks across multiple locations in the city killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said.  
In a primary race otherwise dominated by the economy, climate and front-runner Hillary Clinton’s personal record, the debate in Des Moines, Iowa, now is expected to focus heavily on security and foreign policy after debate host CBS News reworked the format.   
It is an area where Clinton, as former secretary of state, enters with the thickest resume – but also one that could prove problematic, given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable and chaotic nations like Libya and Syria.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, after appearing to give her a pass at the first debate over her personal email controversy, has in recent weeks shown a greater interest in criticizing her record. But his focus on issues like income inequality could be out of place in a discussion focused on global security challenges.

Clinton also enters this debate – hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register – facing a narrower field than at their first encounter in October. Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley.
Clinton is seen to have otherwise strengthened her hand since that debate, making it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and seeing one of her biggest potential political threats – a late bid by Vice President Biden – disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.
Sanders remains Clinton’s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.
Still, the FBI investigation over Clinton’s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding.",,"The Democratic presidential candidates faced off for their second debate Saturday night, with the issues of terrorism and national security thrust back into the spotlight in the wake of the deadly Paris attacks.",Democratic 2016 candidates face off for 2nd debate,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/TEOgoe910VE/,[u'foreign policy/national security'],"[u'Bernie Sanders', u'Charlie Neibergall', u'Hillary Clinton', u""Martin O'Malley"", u'Hillary Rodham Clinton']",fox,0.8547615578685663,[],2015-11-15 02:02:16,[u'FBI'],16cb890d4d44df5c90d0eef0d397081f,2015-11-15 02:15:49.625467

With the terrible tragedy in Paris Friday, the focus of the second Democratic debate on CBS changed correctly from the economy and domestic issues, to national security and immigration. However, the bickering back and forth between the two candidates going nowhere and the probable nominee -- Mrs. Clinton, really got off the subject very quickly.
Hillary said she would be tougher than President Obama. I don't doubt that she will be but that's a pretty low bar.
Bernie Sanders, in spite of Friday's terror attacks in Paris, still thinks climate warming is the world’s greatest problem and the root of all evil.
Martin O’Malley is prepared to become president because he led Baltimore for 8 years as mayor and the greatest state in the country, Maryland for another four as governor. He must have forgotten that we all got to watch Baltimore explode on national TV a few months back.
Sanders thinks Hillary is owned by Wall Street and the Super-PACS and can't be trusted. After hearing O’Malley brag about everything he did in Maryland, I don't know why everyone wouldn't want to live there.

The overall message of the night was the Democrats agree on most things. Including, if they would be honest, that Hillary's going to be the nominee. 

His great strength is that he looks like he could play a president in a TV show like “House of Cards.”  But in reality, he's lucky the Democrats don't have a junior varsity table or he'd be sitting there by himself.
The overall message of the night was the Democrats agree on most things. Including, if they would be honest, that Hillary's going to be the nominee.
On policy there is little disagreement. First they still believe in redistribution of wealth (the Robin Hood Theory). The rich are too rich and need to pay more in taxes. The upper limit was not quite the 90%  rate in the Eisenhower administration but close (thank you, Bernie Sanders) to certainly a much higher rate for the upper income earners.
The middle class is not what it used to be so therefore the government must do something to change all this.
The banks and the drug companies and the insurance companies are too big and they are all bad guys so we must regulate them and watch out for them cheating or getting rich.
We need more free programs paid for by tax payers. Free public college education for all.
To Hillary's credit she didn't buy into this because she doesn't want taxpayers to pay to educate Donald Trump’s kids.
Still, there was lots of talk about free health care for all and cheap drugs, too.
Who is going to pay for all this? The rich guys, of course.
On immigration, we should just let the 11 million immigrants who are here illegally stay because they've been here a long time.
Sanders , the avowed Socialist, who represents Vermont, the second smallest state in the Union, kept talking about how great Canada is. Maybe that's because Canada just elected a socialist prime minister.
He did waffle on guns a little from the Democratic  position but I am sure that's because nearly every voter in Vermont owns a couple of them.
The hardest working guy in the room was John Dickerson, who was the CBS moderator. His biggest task was making sure CBS got its commercial breaks every 10 minutes. About half way through, I confess, I realized that I can't wait for the next “Trump Invitational” as the Republican debates are sometimes called. At least they are not dull! This one was so dull, the network ended it 7 minutes early!

"Hillary Clinton defended herself against criticism over the money she has raised from the financial industry by invoking her job as a U.S. senator representing New York after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
“I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York,” she said, after finding herself again on the defensive over her perceived close ties to Wall Street. “It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.”
The unusual defense emerged during a feisty exchange over financial-industry regulation in Saturday’s Democratic presidential debate hosted by CBS News. Mrs. Clinton also noted that 60% of her donors are women—another effort to turn back the Wall Street fundraising attack from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who has emerged as a formidable opponent in the Democratic primary.
Just as in last month’s Democratic debate, the discussion Saturday of financial regulation turned largely on whether Congress should reinstate the New Deal-era banking law, the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated investment banking from commercial banking. President Bill Clinton played a major role ushering in legislation, signed into law in 1999, that repealed Glass-Steagall.
Some critics say Glass-Steagall facilitated the financial crisis in 2008 by allowing large banks to grow, in effect, “too big to fail,” forcing the unpopular emergency bailouts. They have pushed legislation to carve up the banks by instating aspects of Glass-Steagall, which the banking industry strongly opposes. Mr. Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley both endorsed that effort again on Saturday.
Mrs. Clinton was more restrained. “Reinstating Glass-Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough,” she said, adding that her regulatory-overhaul proposal is “tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive,” because it would target nonbank institutions as well as Wall Street banks and large depository institutions.
Mrs. Clinton implied that Glass-Steagall would have done little to forestall the bank bailouts in 2008 because many of the companies that either failed or required bailouts—including American International Group and Lehman Brothers—weren’t big deposit-taking banks. AIG is an insurance company and Lehman Brothers was a standalone investment bank.
Critics of the Glass-Steagall repeal don’t agree with this view. They say it too easily overlooks the ways in which banks, particularly Citigroup, took on greater risks that fed increased risk-taking across Wall Street. AIG, for example, got into trouble because it had insured billions of financial products issued by more than a dozen firms—some that had grown thanks to Glass-Steagall and some that, like Lehman and Bear Stearns, had remained standalone investment banks.
Stepping back from the bank-regulation arcana, there’s a broader disagreement here. At the heart of Mr. Sanders’s argument over the size of banks is the idea that they have too much political power, an idea that evokes the “trust busting” of President Teddy Roosevelt who sought to break up big industrial monopolies for some of the same reasons.
Why do big industries make “millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something. Everybody knows that,” said Mr. Sanders.
When Mrs. Clinton said that she would break up banks if they didn’t play by the rules, Mr. Sanders responded with disbelief that this might be in doubt. “The business model of Wall Street is fraud,” he said.
Mr. Sanders pledged not to have any Wall Street representatives in his cabinet. “One of the problems we’ve had…whether it’s Republican administrations or Democratic administrations, we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations,” he said.
Mr. O’Malley joined in when he said that Richard Rubin and Larry Summers, both former treasury secretaries for President Bill Clinton, wouldn’t be allowed near his administration. Mr. Rubin has been a very influential figure within Democratic policymaking for the last two decades, and many policymakers that he has mentored have served in top positions for President Barack Obama.
“They are the architects,” said Mr. O’Malley.
Mr. O’Malley was pressed to name who, exactly, would provide him with advise on financial regulation. He didn’t provide any names. “We’ll have an inclusive group,” he said.
Financial regulation also emerged as a hot topic in Tuesday’s Republican debate, and it showed how both parties have vastly different interpretations of what caused the financial crisis and, consequently, what should be done to prevent it from happening again.
Republicans generally have blamed government policies, from housing to the Federal Reserve, for provoking risk-taking, an idea that draws mixed readings from economists. They say that there is now too much government regulation, singling out for criticism the Dodd-Frank financial-regulatory overhaul, even though they have also tried to sound critical of Wall Street.
The clear winner in both the GOP debate earlier this week and in Saturday’s Democratic debate: community banks.
“Imagine America without its community banks. Well, that’s what’s happening because of Dodd-Frank,” said former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in Tuesday’s debate.
And Mr. Sanders on Saturday: “Support community banks and credit unions. That’s the future of banking in America.”

"Initially solemn, typically wonkish and monotonously polite to the moderators and one another, the three Democratic presidential candidates still managed to provide a few surprising moments during their second debate Saturday night.
Hillary Rodham Clinton
 complimented 
George W. Bush
 and accused 
Bernie Sanders
 of impugning her integrity.
Martin O’Malley called Clinton “Annie Oakley” on gun control and “weak tea” on big banks.
Sanders founded yet another T-shirt line by announcing that “Wall Street’s business model is fraud,” CBS used Twitter in a way that did not look like old-media floundering, and Dwight D. Eisenhower continued his 2016 Greatest Hits Tour.
A week after 
Donald Trump
 praised Ike for deporting more than a million Mexicans, Sanders offered him as a model of high tax rates for the rich: “I’m not much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,” he said.
Most important, however, was the moment that did not occur: Though they were resolute in their condemnation of ISIS, none of the candidates went inflammatory or ballistic.
Taking place just a day more than 120 people were killed in a series of terrorist attacks in Paris , the debate, which was held in Des Moines and aired on CBS, opened without the now-usual campaign-trail/reality-show pomp and pageantry. Instead, moderator John Dickerson, host of “Face the Nation,” solemnly reminded viewers that open debate is “a symbol of freedom.”
Then, after a moment of silence, he began asking newly added questions about the U.S. response to ISIS and unrest in the Middle East.
But those hoping for burning rhetoric, sweeping resolutions or even clear plans were probably disappointed.
While many of the Republican presidential candidates have made strong statements in the wake of Friday’s horrific attacks — Donald Trump suggested that an armed French citizenry would have prevented the tragedy, Sen. Ted Cruz called for significant air power and many if not all want to close the U.S. to Syrian refugees — the Democratic nominees chose to tread more carefully.
So carefully that it was difficult to know what any of them do in similar circumstance should she or he become president. 
Indeed, during the opening minutes of their second debate, Sanders, Clinton and O’Malley were more explicit in their arguments about what the terrorists should be called — extreme jihadists rather than Islamic extremists — than they were about their visions of an American response.
To be fair, Dickerson, for reasons of his own, never asked the obvious question — “What do you think the U.S. should do next?” Instead, he called on each of them to critique President Obama’s, and Clinton’s, handling of terrorism in general and ISIS particular. This put Clinton immediately on the defensive and Sanders and O’Malley in the unenviable position of criticizing their party’s president one day after a horrifying international crisis.
O'Malley called for more ""human intelligence"" and Sanders blamed the rise of terrorism on the Iraq war, which, he pointed out, Clinton had voted for. Clinton quickly reminded everyone that many acts of terrorism, including 9/11, had preceded the war, which she once again admitted was a mistake, and unity returned to the conversation.
Early minutes were spent agreeing that the Middle East is complicated, the world is dangerous and the enemy is not Islam, a distinction Clinton thanked George W. Bush for making in the days following 9/11.
Indeed, until the first commercial break and beyond, the three candidates spent so much time openly agreeing with one another, with minor caveats, that they seemed to have forgotten they were political rivals.
That changed when the questions returned to the economy and everyone seemed to feel on firmer ground.
As the front-runner, Clinton got the toughest questions and the brunt of the criticism, onstage and off. At one point, Sanders criticized Clinton’s reliance on “Wall Street donors” and all that implies. Clinton defended her impugned integrity in a strange and scattershot way by announcing that 60% of her donors were women and that she had stood by Wall Street, and the rest of New York, during and after 9/11.
If Dickerson, who was otherwise strong on calling out contradictions and non-answers, let her get away with evoking 9/11 in a discussion of campaign donations, Twitter didn’t. A few minutes later, co-moderator CBS News congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes asked her to respond to one negative response, marking the first use of Twitter as a real-time participant of a debate.
But even with a few mild barbs — O’Malley derided Clinton as having been “Annie Oakley” before changing her stance on gun control, or Sanders dismissed one of O’Malley’s references to his work as governor of Maryland by saying “Baltimore is not now one of the safest cities in America"" — the tenor of the remarks leaned more toward conversation than debate.
So much so that Clinton felt comfortable enough to laud the similarities she shares with her rivals. “We have our differences,” she said. “But they pale compared with what’s happening on the Republican side.”
“All of us support funding Planned Parenthood,” she continued. “All of us believe climate change is real. All of us want equal pay for equal work. They don't believe in any of that. So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.""

"AMES, Iowa – The day after a debate in which Democratic presidential candidates tangled over the causes of Islamic State terrorism but not how to confront it, Hillary Rodham Clinton offered a more forward-looking view of American leadership in response to the threat.

“We have to be rallying our partners and allies, pulling countries off the sidelines,” Mrs. Clinton said on Sunday. 

She called the Islamic State “the first Internet-fueled terrorist group,” which will require strong countermeasures to its propaganda and recruitment.

Speaking at an indoor barbecue lunch hosted by several Iowa counties’ Democratic parties, Mrs. Clinton offered no specifics. But she suggested a more proactive approach than she had in the debate, when she dodged a question about whether the Obama administration had underestimated the Islamic State and seemed to take a fatalistic view of terrorism connected to chaos in the Middle East.  

“Attacking Paris, the city of light, reminds us that there is no middle ground in going after these terrorists,’’ Mrs. Clinton said. She was notably alone in bringing up the Paris attacks. Former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland, who also spoke at the event, focused almost entirely on domestic issues. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was represented by a surrogate, the former Princeton professor Cornel West.     

Mrs. Clinton implicitly pressed her claim as the most qualified Democratic candidate for commander in chief, highlighting terrorism at a moment that the campaigns of both parties seem likely to pivot to national security and American leadership in the world. 

Although many pundits scored Saturday’s debate a draw, with Mr. O’Malley having his best night yet and Mr. Sanders more focused in his responses, a focus group of undecided Democrats in Des Moines, where the debate took place, gave Mrs. Clinton a clear win.  

All 33 likely caucus-goers in the group thought Mrs. Clinton would be the stronger commander in chief, said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic consultant who conducted the focus group.  “It was clear that Clinton’s answers on terrorism, and her improved answers on domestic issues, moved undecided Iowans in striking ways,’’ he said.       

Mr. Kofinis identified one vulnerability: Mrs. Clinton’s ties to Wall Street, exemplified by an answer to a question about accepting donations from rich bankers that has been widely mocked. 

Mr. O’Malley echoed the critique on Sunday, dismissing her explanation that she has been flooded with Wall Street donations in gratitude for her help in rebuilding the New York financial district after the terrorist attacks of 2001. 

Mrs. Clinton “sadly invoked 9/11 to try to mask’’ her ties to Wall Street bankers, Mr. O’Malley said on Sunday.    

The crowd of several hundred largely older Democrats did not respond strongly to Mr. O’Malley’s critiques of Mrs. Clinton, which  included sharper barbs than usual  about her record on guns and immigration.

The crowd, which swarmed Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton after she spoke, seemed pragmatic with less than three months before the Iowa caucuses and as Mr. Sanders’s summer surge in the state appears to be ebbing.  “Personally, I like what Sanders and O’Malley have to say,’’ Glenda Eggerling, a retiree, said.  “But I think Hillary will appeal to more voters, and I would really like to see a Democrat in the White House, because I don’t like Republicans’ platforms.’’

Sandra McJimsey, also a retiree, said, “I think Bernie has done a great service to the party,” but she declared herself “energized to vote for Hillary.’’

Despite their embrace of Mrs. Clinton’s foreign policy experience, Iowa Democrats had no interest in committing ground troops to fight the Islamic State, as several Republican candidates have advocated, or in declaring war, as Jeb Bush suggested on Sunday.

Chas Weber, a retiree who recently moved to Ames from Michigan, said the Paris attacks and confronting the Islamic State were “this week’s hot topic,’’ which he predicted would soon give way to something else.

During a conference call Saturday between representatives of CBS News and the three Democratic presidential camps, an aide to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders angrily objected to the network’s plans to change the focus of Saturday night’s debate from the economy to terror and national security, two Democratic sources confirmed to Fox News.
The Sanders camp pushed back on CBS' efforts to trim opening statements from 90 seconds to 30 seconds in order to create more time to cover terror -- in addition to the economy and other topics -- in the wake of the Paris terror attacks.
The Democratic sources said the Sanders camp argued that CBS could not change the format, agreed to long ago, at the last minute for Sanders as well as Hillary Clinton and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. The campaign’s objections were first reported by Yahoo News.
Sanders aides noted on the call that in 90-second opening statements all three candidates could choose to spend their time on terror or other topics, and in the end they prevailed on organizers to keep the longer opening statements.
However, the Sanders camp was still not pleased that CBS planned to spend significant time early in the debate on national security after the lead moderator, John Dickerson of CBS, in recent days privately told the campaigns and publicly said in media interviews that the primary focus would be on income inequality and other economic topics.

In the wake of the terror attacks, the Clinton and O'Malley camps expressed support for the topic shift on the conference call, according to the Democratic sources.
The objections by the Sanders camp fueled talk among Democrats in Iowa that the senator is worried he cannot match the former secretary of state's stature on national security.
Sanders aides reject this by saying he will focus on how judgment on national security is more important than experience. The insurgent candidate has previously tried to drum up support on the left by noting he opposed the war in Iraq while Clinton supported it.Ed Henry currently serves as Fox News Channel's (FNC) chief White House correspondent.

"DES MOINES —  The news team at station KCCI buzzed with nervous anticipation here at Drake University on Saturday night, less than two hours before the start of the Democratic candidates’ debate.

It was the first presidential debate that KCCI, the local CBS affiliate, would help present in its 60-year history, and the atmosphere had shifted dramatically in the previous 24 hours — from one charged with excitement to a grave and somber tone following the deadly terror attacks in Paris.

Behind a temporary stage erected for the event, KCCI’s news director, Dave Busiek, watched a live stream of CBS News coverage on his iPhone about the latest developments out of Paris. In a nearby workspace, the veteran anchor Kevin Cooney made final preparations for the questions he would pose later about national security as one of debate’s four moderators.

Just after 6:15 p.m., cameras flashed on the KCCI anchors Stacey Horst and Steve Karlin, who stood on the stage and welcomed viewers to an area for the news media known as the spin room; they noted how the carnage in Paris would change the focus of the debate.

“Our viewers are interested in that,” Mr. Busiek said. “That flows into what will be a very serious discussion with who could be the president of the United States.”

Broadcasting from Iowa’s capital city to 434,500 TV households in the country’s 72nd largest television market, KCCI takes on outsize importance among the nation’s local television stations every four years. Iowans are the first in the nation to vote in presidential caucuses, setting the tone for the rest of the campaign season.

As a result, presidential candidates devote significant face time to KCCI, the perennial market leader and one of 30 stations owned by Hearst, and its rival WHO-HD, the local NBC affiliate. And the stations respond in kind, adding more political coverage to the menu of news offerings.

KCCI started its own Sunday morning half-hour interview program this fall called “Close Up,” which has featured interviews with presidential candidates from both parties. And WHO boasts that it televises 25 percent more news each week than other stations in the market, thanks in large part to a 4 p.m. newscast that presents a more in-depth look at news and politics. WHO also is hosting three special one-hour forums this week featuring the Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Bobby Jindal. The stations also count on campaigns and interest groups to open their checkbooks in the months leading up to the caucuses and the general election. KCCI and its market rivals are likely to reap a disproportionate share of the $3.3 billion in political advertising dollars that analysts project will go to local television stations for 2016 races, particularly for pre-caucus spending.

“Technically, the presidential election is a national election,” said Elizabeth Wilner, a senior vice president at Kantar Media/CMAG, a company that monitors political advertising. “But in reality it is a race that occurs in about 10 states. In 2012, seven states saw 84 percent of all local TV ad spend, and we expect that same dynamic again.”

That swing in political ad spending is of huge importance to the big media conglomerates that own local television stations, particularly as other categories of advertisers shift a larger share of spending to digital outlets. “In political, TV is still king,” said Kip Cassino, executive vice president for research at Borrell Associates.

Over the last several years, a wave of consolidation has swept across the industry with station owners trying to put themselves in the path of more of political advertising dollars. In 2013, for instance, Tribune Company closed a $2.7 billion acquisition of Local TV Holdings that made it one of the country’s largest station owners; it added stations in 16 markets in the transaction, including WHO in Des Moines.

Tribune is now expecting to gross about $200 million in political advertising sales in 2016, up 25 percent from adjusted revenues in 2012. “At this point, we’re calling for it to be strong, all signs are pointing to that,” Peter Liguori, chief executive of Tribune Media, said during a recent conference call, noting the company’s strength in swing states. In Des Moines, station executives said that the sales strategy boiled down to waiting for the phones to ring and the orders to come in. “We don’t have to actively go out,” said Dale R. Woods, general manager of WHO. “They are the ones who want to obtain our real estate.”

And while ad orders have started trickling in, executives said that the deluge largely has yet to arrive, partly because of the large number of Republican candidates this year, which has prompted campaigns to hold back on paying for advertising as they wait for the field to narrow. The surprising success of Donald J. Trump, who for the most part does not use advertising, has also affected how the candidates spend.

“We’re in a decent position,” said Brian Sather, president and general manager of KCCI. “We’re open for business.”

The stations also benefit from the rise of outside political action groups. While the stations are required by law to provide equal access to candidates and to charge them the lowest unit rates, there are no laws limiting what they can charge outside groups for commercial time. Analysts project a sharp increase in spending by these groups for 2016.

“There is nothing stopping stations from charging groups five to six times as much — or even 10 times as much” as they charge candidates, Ms. Wilner of Kantar said. “Nobody weeps for the poor billionaire that has to pay 10 times as much as the candidate.”

But the influx of campaign dollars creates a delicate situation for the stations, which have to juggle their limited supply of commercial time. High demand for political ads in the Des Moines market, particularly in the weeks leading up to the caucus, can put a squeeze on inventory and push out local businesses, such as car dealerships, that are the bread-and-butter advertisers year round.

“It is a balancing act,” Mr. Sather said. “We try to do our best.”

Mike Schreurs, chief executive of Strategic America, an advertising agency in West Des Moines, said that it is common for businesses to see as many as one out of four commercial spots bumped from local TV during the peak political season. They also might have to pay at least a 30 percent increase in the rates. “It takes the inventory away from smaller retailers and advertisers, not including the fact that it creates something of a toxic environment,” he said.Already, more than 35,000 commercials adding up to more than $22.5 million in spending have aired or are scheduled to air on Iowa television stations through Feb. 2, the day after the Iowa caucuses, according to an analysis of Federal Communications Commission records by The Des Moines Register. On KCCI alone, viewers will see more than 62 ads a day in the eight days leading up to the Iowa caucuses. And at WHO, Hillary Rodham Clinton’s campaign has booked a single spot for $5,800 to air during prime time Monday night. A spot airing during another time the same week cost $60.

Back in the spin room after the debate on Saturday night, KCCI anchors wrapped up more than four hours of related coverage. During the coming 78 days leading to the Iowa caucus, the journalists plan to return to the air to cover the twists and turns of the campaign. But, for the moment, Mr. Karlin, one of the anchors, reflected on the Des Moines station’s moment in the national spotlight.

"Republican presidential candidate and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said U.S. allies should invoke the collective defense clause of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in response to terrorist attacks in Paris.
“This is clearly an act of war and an attack on one of our NATO allies, and we should invoke Article 5 of the NATO agreement, and bring everyone together to put together a coalition to confront this challenge,” Mr. Rubio said Sunday morning on ABC.
French president Francois Hollande called the attacks “an act of war” and cited Islamic State as responsible.
Former Florida governor and GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush stopped short calling for an Article 5 declaration, which is the formal recognition that an attack on one NATO member represents an attack on them all, and sets the groundwork for collective military action.
“I think the president should convene the North Atlantic Council to discuss that,” Mr. Bush said Sunday morning on CNN. “If that’s what the French want, then, our longest and strongest and most loyal ally over our entire history, we should certainly consider it.”
The only time the collective defense provision was invoked came after the Sept. 11 terror attacks in the U.S.
Later, on NBC, Mr. Bush said: “This is a threat to western civilization and we should consider it that way.”
The U.S. and France already work together in operations in Iraq and Syria, sharing intelligence and coordinating airstrikes.
Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser to President Barack Obama, agreed with Mr. Hollande that the attacks in Paris were an act of war. He said the U.S. wants “to continue to intensify that coordination” with France.
While France hasn’t invoked Article 5, NATO’s secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said members are ready to assist.

"AMES, Iowa Nov 15 A top aide to U.S. Democratic
presidential contender Hillary Clinton said on Sunday that
criticism of her remarks in Saturday's debate regarding 9/11 and
Wall Street campaign contributions would not resonate with
average voters.
""They were attacking her for being too close to Wall
Street,"" Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri said of a
tense exchange among Clinton, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders,
her chief rival for the Democratic nomination, and former
Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley at the party's debate in Iowa.
""The point she was making, is that as a senator, she did
things for Wall Street, particularly after 9/11, but she also
spoke out as a senator and now when she thought they were going
too far,"" Palmieri told reporters.
Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for
the 2016 election, was asked during the debate about
contributions she had received from the financial industry and
whether it would affect her plans to regulate it.
Sanders said Clinton's response was ""not good enough.""
""Now, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign
contributions? They expect to get something. Everybody knows
that,"" Sanders said.
Clinton said Sanders had impugned her integrity.
""I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11
when we were attacked,"" Clinton said. ""Where were we attacked?
We were attacked in downtown Manhattan, where Wall Street is. I
did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.""
Clinton's answer drew immediate criticism from Republican
operatives and on social media. Moderators cited a response
posted on Twitter when asking Clinton a follow-up question.
""I don't think that this is something that caucus-goers in
Iowa or voters are going to focus on,"" Palmieri said of the
state that in February holds the first party nominating contest.
""It's pretty clear where she stands on issues, and donations
don't play a role in how she's going to come down on that
issue.""

"Bernie Sanders’ campaign refuted reports that campaign officials were angry about changes in the format of tonight’s Democratic debate to reflect the terrorist attacks in Paris.
A top aide to the Vermont senator engaged in a “lengthy dispute with executives from CBS, the network hosting the debate, during a conference call on Saturday morning,” Yahoo News reported. The site reported a staffer for one of the other campaigns who was also on the call describing the exchange as “heated” and even “bizarre.” A second source on the call confirmed the nature of the exchange, the site said.
Sanders’ campaign, however, said the candidate was fine with the changes: “The news out of Paris was terrible and important and clearly something that was going to be the focus of the debate,” spokesman Michael Briggs said in a telephone interview.
He said changes to the format of the debate were discussed and twice changed, and “in the end the senator was totally satisfied with the changes and looking forward to a good debate.”
He added, “if some other campaign wants to make a mountain out of molehill, it’s still a molehill.”
He said there was a disagreement of “minor points” over the opening. CBS said it wanted to cut the opening statements by the candidates from 90 seconds to 30 seconds to open up with the Paris attacks -- which the Sanders’ campaign opposed, Jeff Weaver, the Vermont senator's campaign manager told CNN.
""They wanted to make some last-minute changes to the debate. We obviously wanted to keep the format to what had been agreed to and I think people on our staff argued vigorously to that and were successful,"" Weaver told CNN.
The focus on foreign policy is expected to benefit Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State. But Sanders has criticized her foreign policy approach, noting that she voted for the war in Iraq.",,"Candidates expected to address the attacks in Paris from the start of the debate
