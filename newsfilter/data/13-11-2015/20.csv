He's gaining ground in the race for the Republican Presidential nomination, and he's positioning himself to capture supporters from Donald Trump or Ben Carson, should they falter. There's still a long way to go in this contest but Cruz and his campaign are well funded, well organized and confident in his ability to outlast and overtake his rivals. Cruz's success is rooted in the idea that there's no such thing as too conservative, both inside electoral politics and in governing. Or if need be, not governing \u2014 history's shown he's fine with shutting the federal government down if it helps him acquire leverage over the opposition, be it Democrat or Republican. And when he runs for office, nobody gets to the right of Ted Cruz. That's how he's won. The senator likes very much where he's positioned now. In most prior elections," he told NPR \""there has been a consensus moderate candidate early on and all the money gets behind that candidate.\"" Conservatives", on the other hand, are more plentiful," \""nobody has any money"," and we fight like cats and dogs.\"" \n\nThey're gonna spend millions ripping each other apart. To be honest", right now," the moderates are acting like conservatives usually do in a Republican primary.\n\n\nTed Cruz\n\n\n\""What's remarkable about this cycle is the entire situation is inverted","\"" Cruz said. He has enjoyed watching enjoyed watching candidates in the moderate wing of the party slug it out. \""They're gonna spend millions ripping each other apart. To be honest", right now, the moderates are acting like conservatives usually do in a Republican primary,"\"" he said. On the economy", immigration and Obamacare On the economic front, a President Cruz would abolish the IRS, institute a 10 percent flat tax across the board and retie the value of the dollar to the gold standard. The U.S. stopped trading gold for dollars in 1933 and while the supply of gold has grown, there isn't enough gold in the world to match the $18 trillion U.S GDP. The money supply, the availability of credit and the nation's economy would necessarily have to contract to match the supply of bullion. Nevertheless, Cruz says returning to the gold standard deserves serious consideration. If you look at most of the history of America, he said," \""we've had a gold standard. Including through some of the greatest economic booms known to mankind.\"" Unpredictability in the country's currency", he added," \""has a profoundly negative effect.\"" If elected president", Cruz would order the FBI and the Department of Justice to investigate Planned Parenthood for fraud. The Texas senator doesn't believe in climate change science and would veto any legislation that would raise taxes or fees to inhibit global warming. He would like to institute term limits for U. S. Supreme Court justices. He opposes any minimum wage increase. And he would deport the millions of undocumented immigrants in this country, all of them. \n\nYou know, my view on immigration is simple. Legal, good. Illegal," bad.\n\n\nTed Cruz\n\n\n\""You know", my view on immigration is simple,"\"" he said. \""Legal", good. Illegal, bad. ... You know, if you start from the proposition that rule of law matters," it answers a whole lot of questions.\"" In foreign policy"," Cruz is a hawk with limitations. He's less a \""boots on the ground\"" man than a \""bomb them from the skies\"" guy. He deplores the Obama administration's agreement to slow down Iran's nuclear capabilities and believes the next president will have to bomb. \""When the next president enters the White House", the odds are significant that he or she will encounter an Iran on the verge of having nuclear weapons,"\"" Cruz said. \""And it may be that the only option at the point to preventing Iran from having nuclear weapons is military force. And of course Cruz"," who was a catalyst in closing the federal government for two weeks in 2013 during the Showdown at the Obamacare Corral remains firmly against the Affordable Care Act. \""If I am elected president", mark my words, we will repeal every single word of Obamacare,"\"" he said. At war with the GOP establishment So what are the chances the Ted Cruz is the next Republican nominee for president? In the past", a rogue Republican senator at war with the leadership of his own party would have zero chance. But as if to demonstrate that we're not in Kansas anymore, Cruz's first radio spot emphasizes that the Texas senator is hated by the GOP establishment. In it, a young mother explains she voted for Cruz to keep America safe," stop the debt from growing and to keep her religious freedoms intact. \""The media and even some in his own party like Speaker John Boehner attacked Ted Cruz referring to him as a pain in the you know what","\"" the ad goes. \""Because of his bold actions fighting to keep the promises he made to me. That was the Ted Cruz I trust.\"" Among the Tea Party and other insurgent Republican voters that Cruz is courting", being made an object of ridicule by the leaders of your own party is something you want to advertise. In this world," moderates are squishy \""Republicans In Name Only\"" and right-wing true believers are the only Republican politicians that can be trusted to stand up and fight. \""There are a handful of consultants who relentlessly push what I call the Washington fallacy","\"" Cruz said. \""Which is that the way Republicans win a general election is to run in the middle. To run as Democrat light. Every time we do that"," we lose.\"" Cruz has assembled both an impressive campaign war chest and a solid network of state organizations across the South and Midwest. He's capturing both billionaire and Republican grass roots financial support. His strategy is to persevere and thrive while other candidates fall"," eventually emerging as the default favorite of Republican right. Cruz cites the millions of evangelicals in American \u2014 he says more than half of them didn't vote in 2012. \""I think I'm in the best position to energize and mobilize and inspire the millions of conservatives who've been staying home","\"" Cruz said. Super Tuesday comes early in this Republican primary", just 10 days after South Carolina. Georgia, Alabama, Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma and the big prize of Cruz's home Texas are among the conservative states that go to the polls. On Wednesday March 2, Ted Cruz is counting on the GOP race looking a lot different than the day before. And what of the other son of a Cuban immigrant, the Floridian who is also well positioned and a growing favorite with Republican voters? Cruz says he would be delighted if it came down to him and Marco Rubio," two quintessential American success stories writ large. He calls Rubio a \""friend\"" and \""fellow son of Cuban immigrants","\"" but said he still has the upper hand. \""I will say this. If the race becomes head to head. A battle between a clear conservative to a clear moderate", we win,"\"" Cruz said. A year ago no political pundits were predicting Donald Trump and Ben Carson would be leading the Republican field of presidential candidates.

"{""body"": "" (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz says he wants to do away with government support for the sugar industry \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a veiled dig at rival Marco Rubio", the Florida senator who has long supported sugar growers.\nSome conservatives like Cruz want to get rid of the program, which supports prices and protects growers from foreign competition. But sugar supports have for decades been unassailable in Congress, partly due to wide bipartisan support from lawmakers representing states from Florida to North Dakota that grow sugar cane and sugar beets.\nIn Tuesday night's GOP debate," Cruz listed assistance for sugar as among government programs he'd like to eliminate to allow more spending for the military.\n\""Among them are corporate welfare", like sugar subsidies,"\"" said the Texas senator. \""Let's take that as an example. Sugar subsidies. Sugar farmers farm under roughly 0.2 percent of the farmland in America"," and yet they give 40 percent of the lobbying money.\"" On Wednesday", Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier clarified that Cruz meant 40 percent of crop industries' total lobbying expenditures.\nU.S. assistance to sugar growers is not really direct subsidies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 unlike some other agricultural commodities. The government does not offer cash payments to processors and growers. Instead, it props up prices through loans, limits the amount domestic processors can sell and restricts sugar imports.\nRubio, who has received campaign donations from the sugar industry, has consistently voted to maintain the sugar program. On Wednesday," he told ABC's \""Good Morning America\"" that he supports getting rid of sugar supports"," but only if countries that export sugar to the United States also get rid of their government sugar aid. The sugar industry has made a similar argument.\n\""I'm not going to wipe out an American industry that happens to have a lot of workers in Florida by unilaterally disarming","\"" Rubio said.\nBut another Republican candidate", former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, has distanced himself from sugar producers as some conservative groups have focused on overhauling the program," calling it \""crony capitalism.\"" A Bush spokeswoman", Kristy Campbell," said Wednesday that Bush supports phasing out the sugar program.\n\""Gov. Bush believes we should constantly be moving to reduce government interference and create a level playing field for all commodities on the world market","\"" she said.\nIn 2014", the sugar industry spent almost $10 million on lobbying, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The group's calculations show the industry contributed more than $5 million to congressional candidates during the 2014 campaign cycle, split almost evenly between Republicans and Democrats.\nWhen Frazier clarified Cruz's remark about lobbying expenditures, she cited a 2014 Heritage Foundation report. It's unclear how that report calculated the numbers, but the Center for Responsive Politics puts the percentage of sugar industry lobbying dollars closer to 8 percent of all agribusiness lobbying dollars so far this year.\nStill, the sugar industry's influence is undeniable.\nCongressional votes to reform or do away with the program have consistently failed. A 2013 amendment to the farm bill in the Senate to scale back the program garnered 45 votes, with many of the most conservative Republicans voting with Democrats to maintain the status quo. While sugar cane produces jobs in Florida, Louisiana and even Cruz's home state of Texas, sugar beets are grown and create jobs in at least 14 states," many in the Great Plains and the northern tier of the country.\n\""The bipartisan efforts in Congress to reform this program have been undermined by the sugar industry which doesn't want to give up these generous taxpayer subsidies","\"" said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen", a New Hampshire Democrat who sponsored the 2013 amendment.\nSome of the most ardent opponents have been candy companies, who see the prices they pay for domestic sugar inflated by the program. Members of Congress from Illinois, home to Wrigley and other candy companies, and Pennsylvania, home to Hershey, have fought for years to overhaul the program.\nJennifer Cummings, a spokeswoman for The Coalition for Sugar Reform, an alliance of candy companies, and other food industries and taxpayer watchdog organizations," says they believe there is momentum building for reform.\n\""America should be a leader on this issue and we shouldn't wait for other countries to reform their subsidies","\"" she says.\n___\nFind Mary Clare Jalonick on Twitter: """," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": ""WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz says he wants to do away with government support for the sugar industry \u2014 a veiled dig at rival Marco Rubio"," the Florida senator who has long supported sugar growers."""," ""title"": ""Sugar program draws Cruz's ire"," remains popular in Congress"""," ""url"": ""http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-11-12-US--GOP%202016-Sugar/id-08a1061d0e5a4144ac113d6039bb41af"""," ""topics"": [""foreign policy/national security"""," ""campaign_finance""]"," ""people"": [""Catherine Frazier"""," ""Kristy Campbell"""," ""Mary Clare Jalonick"""," ""Jeb Bush"""," ""Jeanne Shaheen"""," ""Marco Rubio"""," ""Ted Cruz""]"," ""orgs"": [""Senate"""," ""Heritage Foundation"""," ""Congress"""," ""Center for Responsive Politics""]"," ""election_confidence"": 0.9519732218017437"," ""authors"": [{""author_id"": 39409"," ""fullname"": ""mary clare jalonick"""," ""primary_org"": ""ap""}]"," ""date_written"": ""2015-11-12 09:22:00"""," ""org"": ""ap"""," ""article_id"": ""b9f10d77533467a6e4b91da57ae779d9"""," ""date_access"": ""2015-11-12 15:00:06.031664""}",

We look forward to hearing from you!\nHIGHLIGHTS\nPOPULISM ON THE RISE IN GOP RACE FOR PRESIDENT: The latest presidential debate vividly captured how the 2008 financial crisis has reshaped the Republican Party by unleashing a potent populist strain that could further scramble an already unpredictable primary contest. Candidates vying for the 2016 GOP nomination have grown distinctly more leery of big banks", corporations and international trade deals, and outright hostile toward the Federal Reserve.\nSome of these impulses gave rise to the tea-party movement in 2009 and flared in the 2012 GOP primary contest, but they faded with the nomination of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a private-equity executive. The debate in Milwaukee didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appear to fundamentally alter the state of the race. But with candidates heading off to Iowa and New Hampshire on Wednesday, it showed how their jockeying to carry the populist banner could intensify in the run-up to those states\u00e2\u0080\u0099 early nominating contests next February. Nick Timiraos reports.\nMore on 2016: Republican presidential candidates worked to turn debate moments into campaign momentum after a GOP showdown that highlighted policy differences but did little to shuffle the standings\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Donald Trump and Marco Rubio won Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s night primetime Republican debate, according to an overnight poll of Internet users who watched the contest, but Mr. Trump came out as the favorite among Republicans and left the best impression about his ability to serve as president\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The Trump show may be fading on social media.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 For those wondering how Mr. Trump will go about deporting millions of\u00c2\u00a0 illegal immigrants if elected president, they got their answer in Tuesday night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debate.

But privately, the department is telling some of its agents they cannot work with officers using such cameras as part of joint task forces, according to people familiar with the discussions. The reason: The federal government hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet adopted guidelines on how and when to use body cameras, rules that would be important to determining how any footage could be used in court, released publicly, or stored by law-enforcement agencies.

The two men, Efra\u00c3\u00adn Antonio Campo Flores and Francisco Flores de Freitas, were first arrested in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Tuesday by local police, turned over to U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents and flown the same day to New York in a DEA jet, these people said.

GOP lawmakers debated for months about what measures to pass under a special procedure tied to the budget process, known as reconciliation, which enables legislation to pass with just a simple majority.

The proposal lists eight steps toward ending the conflict: establishing an 18-month constitutional reform period; creating a united delegation from the hodgepodge of opposition groups; identifying terrorist factions; coordinating international military strikes on Islamic State; and holding simultaneous presidential and parliamentary elections. But the proposal doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t clarify how or when Mr. Assad might step down and leaves open the possibility that he could continue to rule Syria if he were to be re-elected.

"{""body"": "" (CNN)It's official. Sen. Ted Cruz is now a citizen of the United States -- and the United States only.\nIf you remember", the Texas Republican was born in Canada to an American mother and a Cuban father.  As such, he was a dual citizen -- an American because of his mother, and Canadian because the country, like America, grants automatic citizenship to anyone born there. \nNo harm in that, except Cruz is considered a potential candidate for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. And when the news of his dual citizenship surfaced last year, thanks to a Dallas Morning News piece, some began to question his eligibility to become president. (In truth," that was never in jeopardy. Most legal experts said Cruz qualifies as a \""natural born citizen","\"" a requirement for the White House job"," as stated in the Constitution.)\nThe newspaper piece came as a revelation to Cruz as well. \n\""Because I was a U.S. citizen at birth", because I left Calgary when I was 4 and have lived my entire life since then in the U.S., and because I have never taken affirmative steps to claim Canadian citizenship, I assumed that was the end of the matter,"\"" Cruz said at the time. \nThen he took immediate steps to renounce his Canadian citizenship. \nWell", that process was formally completed last month, and he received a letter in the mail this week telling him so," the newspaper reported Tuesday. \n\""This is to certify that the person named above has formally renounced Canadian citizenshp and pursuant to the Citizenship Act will cease to be a citizen on\"" May 14", 2014," the letter read. \n\""it's official y'all","\"" tweeted his spokeswoman Catherine Frazier.\nCruz wins presidential straw poll at Republican Leadership Conference\nCNN's Tina Burnside contributed to this report."""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": """""," ""title"": ""It's official: Ted Cruz a citizen of the U.S. - and the U.S. only"""," ""url"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/11/politics/ted-cruz-canada-citizenship/index.html"""," ""topics"": [""personality""]"," ""people"": [""Catherine Frazier"""," ""Ted Cruz""]"," ""orgs"": [""GOP""]"," ""election_confidence"": 0.6798350773385569"," ""authors"": [{""author_id"": 2946"," ""fullname"": ""saeed ahmed"""," ""primary_org"": ""cnn""}]"," ""date_written"": ""2015-11-12 23:36:08"""," ""org"": ""cnn"""," ""article_id"": ""2d53ac1cb5985f625a5214e01dcfd6d6"""," ""date_access"": ""2015-11-13 01:01:16.883377""}",

"{""body"": ""\n2016\n\n                        Like the voters they hope to represent", the drug epidemic has touched them too.\n\n            By \n                    Jeff Greenfield\n\nNovember 12, 2015\n\n                Getty\nThree Republican candidates, three surprising, highly personal revelations\u2014all within days of each other. \nGov. Chris Christie, well-known for his in-your-face, confrontational style, riveted a town meeting in New Hampshire with a double-barreled story that recounted the death of his tobacco-addicted mother and the death of a law school friend from a prescription drug overdose.\nStory Continued Below\n \u201cWhen I sat there as the governor of New Jersey at his funeral, and looked across the pew at [my friend\u2019s] three daughters, sobbing because their dad is gone\u2014there but for the grace of God go I,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can happen to anyone. And so we need to start treating people in this country, not jailing them.\u201d\n The video of Christie was well on its way to viral status when Jeb Bush, whose family is famously resistant to personal revelations, sat down with the Huffington Post on his campaign bus in New Hampshire to talk about the most painful part of his life: his daughter\u2019s drug addiction. \u201cI visited her in jail. Never expected to see my beautiful daughter in jail,\u201d he said. \u201cShe went through hell.\u201d\nWithin a day, Sen. Ted Cruz, as polished a wordsmith as anyone in politics, was telling CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper about the crippling drug habit of his half-sister and his futile efforts to persuade her to leave a crack house. \u201cI sometimes found it hard to reconcile the bright, fun and charismatic sister I adored with the person who would lie to me without hesitation and who stole money from her teenage brother to feed her various addictions.\u201d\nListening to these candidates, it\u2019s hard to detect the strident moralizing of the party that gave us \u201cJust say no.\u201d The GOP\u2019s softening on drug addiction has quickly become one of the most striking themes of the 2016 campaign, even if it gets less attention than illegal immigration or repealing Obamacare. Suddenly, in a crowded and topsy-turvy primary season that seems to be rewarding outsiders who have torn up the political script, a number of Republicans are dispensing with the antiseptic bios and have found that voters are engaging with the messiest episodes of their lives.\nWhat\u2019s going on here? This is not a coincidence, or parallel \u201cmessaging.\u201d In fact, if you look under the hood, you\u2019ll find this is a convergence of important trends in both political style and demographics that could signal a rewrite of the American playbook on drugs and crime.\nViolent crime, the urban kind that fixated voters in the 80s and 90s has dropped precipitously. But at the very same time a wave of drug crime driven by prescription drugs and now heroin has swept into every corner of American society, respecting now geographic, social or political boundaries. Hollow-eyed addicts were suddenly just as much a feature of red state back roads as they were on the boulevards of big cities. Heroin use has climbed among all demographic groups, but it has skyrocketed among whites; nearly 90 percent of those who tried heroin for the first time in the last decade were white. \nAll this has changed the way GOP politicians are engaging with their voters. Multimillionaires like the ones who make up most of the presidential field might not have a lot in common economically with most voters, but when it comes to addiction they are discovering points of empathy with a wide cross section of the electorate. \n***\nRemember when FDR told America that he would beat the Depression the way he beat polio? Remember when JFK told us how he learned to endure pain during his ordeal in the Pacific and his life-threatening surgeries? Remember when Reagan talked of putting his alcoholic father to bed?\n Of course you don\u2019t\u2014because they never said those things. In earlier days (and Reagan was very much a product of earlier times) that\u2019s not how politicians talked. Today, a personal \u201cnarrative\u201d is as crucial an element of a campaign as a super-PAC and a micro-targeter. \n \u201cI see it as one of the more positive movements in our political culture,\u201d says longtime Republican consultant Stu Stevens, who is unworried about the possibility of artifice on the part of candidates, \u201cPeople have a good bullshit detector to pick up whether people are being sincere or not.\u201d\n Maybe the seeds were planted in Nixon\u2019s 1952 \u201cCheckers\u201d speech when he answered charges of financial misconduct with a detailed account of his assets and debts, including his wife\u2019s \u201cgood Republican cloth coat.\u201d Maybe it was fed by Jimmy Carter\u2019s intensely personal case for his candidacy\u2014the peanut farmer/evangelical who would never lie to us. Maybe Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 acceptance speech blazed a path (\u201cI never knew my father\u201d). Or Al Gore\u2019s two vice-presidential acceptance speeches-one invoking his son\u2019s near-fatal auto accident, the other his sister\u2019s harrowing death from lung cancer. Maybe it was Bush the father painting himself as a risk-taking entrepreneur or Bush the son\u2019s story of his meeting with juvenile offenders, or guardedly acknowledging his own struggles with substance abuse.\n Whatever the sources, the need for prospective presidents to connect on a visceral, personal level is profound. And there\u2019s no more effective tool than recounting some personal travail. Indeed, when linked to the policy proposals that accompany such testimonials, they act as enhancers of credibility: I know what drugs can do because I have seen it firsthand.\n Christie\u2019s viral video notwithstanding, the effectiveness of these personal revelations is hard to measure. Christie has fallen to the second-tier debate and Bush remains mired in the single digits in many polls. But there is no sign that they, or the rest of the crowded GOP field, are going to stop sharing. And that might say more about the electorate than it does the candidates.\n There was a time when it was possible for Middle America to think of drugs as something that happened to \u201cthem\u201d\u2014to the black and brown urban poor. Today, there is no \u201cthem.\u201d Drugs are in Our Town, Pleasantville, Farmville. \n The evidence is in the statistics. Drug overdoses are the leading cause of \u201cinjury death\u201d among Americans\u2014greater than from motor vehicle crashes and firearms. And of those overdoses, more than half were from heroin or prescription drugs. Substance abuse is one key reason why the death rate among less educated white Americans has risen over the last several years. The evidence is also anecdotal: In January 2014, Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin devoted his entire State of the State address to the epidemic of addiction in the Green Mountain State. \u201cThe time has come for us to stop quietly averting our eyes from the growing heroin addiction in our front yards,\u201d Shumlin said," \u201cwhile we fear and fight treatment facilities in our backyards.\u201d\n\nJeff Greenfield is a five-time Emmy-winning network television analyst and author.\nWHAT WORKS\nPolitics\n\n                    By \n                            Jason Zengerle\n\nThe Big Idea\n\n                    By \n                            POLITICO Magazine\n\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC"""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": ""Like the voters they hope to represent"," the drug epidemic has touched them too."""," ""title"": ""Why the GOP Candidates Are Hooked on Addiction Stories"""," ""url"": ""http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/11/gop-2016-candidates-drug-addiction-213352"""," ""topics"": [""campaign_finance""]"," ""people"": [""Chris Christie"""," ""Jeb Bush"""," ""Bill Clinton"""," ""Peter Shumlin"""," ""Jeff Greenfield"""," ""Jake Tapper"""," ""Jason Zengerle"""," ""Al Gore"""," ""Jimmy Carter"""," ""Ted Cruz""]"," ""orgs"": [""FDR"""," ""GOP""]"," ""election_confidence"": 0.929837790868098"," ""authors"": [{""author_id"": 33762"," ""fullname"": ""jeff greenfield"""," ""primary_org"": ""politico""}]"," ""date_written"": ""2015-11-12 23:23:14"""," ""org"": ""politico"""," ""article_id"": ""8cf8c20a106f2ea98a1ea4cfbb7d1590"""," ""date_access"": ""2015-11-12 23:46:25.680972""}",

"{""body"": ""Four of the eight Republican presidential contenders in the prime-time debate on Tuesday were asked their views on raising the federal minimum wage.\n\nDonald Trump", who went first, set the tone when he said that the current minimum of $7.25 an hour was already too low when it took effect in 2009 and should be doubled.\n\nJust kidding!\n\nHere\u2019s what the candidates really said and why they\u2019re all wrong.\n\nMr. Trump said that American businesses can\u2019t compete because \u201cwages too high\u201d and, for that reason, he would keep the minimum wage where it is.\n\nIf American businesses can\u2019t compete \u2013 a dubious assertion in itself \u2013 it is not because wages are too high. Most working people can\u2019t remember their last raise. And the minimum wage is certainly not too high. Raising it to $12 an hour would simply bring it into line with historical wage-and-price benchmarks. Raising it to $15 an hour would bring it closer to where it would be if it had kept up in recent decades with productivity gains.\n\nAll of which makes a higher minimum wage, what\u2019s the word . . . fair? Sensible?\n\nBut in Mr. Trump\u2019s view, wages for low-paid workers in America are too high because they are higher than those in, say, Pakistan. If you take that thought to its logical conclusion, he is saying that if he were president, he would lead the nation in a race to the bottom with countries whose economies are built on poverty wages.\n\nBen Carson was off base, too. Earlier in the campaign, he said he favored increasing the minimum, to an unspecified amount. On Tuesday, he said he did not support raising the minimum, because \u201cevery time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases.\u201d\n\nNo, it doesn\u2019t. To give just one example, the minimum wage was raised by nearly 12 percent in 1996 (to $4.75 an hour) and by another eight percent in 1997 (to $5.15). The late 1990s were a period of full employment and rising wages for everyone.\n\nThe question of whether a higher minimum wage leads to higher unemployment isn\u2019t one of those issues on which reasonable people disagree. It has been exhaustively studied, in theory and in real world conditions, since 1938, when the United States first enacted a minimum wage (at 25 cents an hour). The weight of evidence shows that increases in the minimum wage have lifted pay without hurting employment.\n\nMr. Carson also said that high unemployment among black teenagers was \u201cbecause of those high wages.\u201d Even for a teenager, $7.25 an hour is not a lot. Nor is $2.13 an hour, which is the federal minimum wage for tipped workers. Does he really want to let employers hire teenagers (and adults, for that matter) at wages that are not enough to provide pocket change, let alone cover real expenses, like getting back and forth to work?\n\nMarco Rubio was next, warning as he has for months that \u201cif you raise the minimum wage, you\u2019re going to make people more expensive than a machine. And that means all this automation that\u2019s replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated.\u201d\n\nPlaying on fears is not the hallmark of a leader. \u201cFear the robots\u201d is not an economic policy. Automation, by another name, is capital investment, and keeping wages low to discourage capital investment is a path to economic decline. It also ignores history, in which new technology has both replaced and created jobs.\n\nMr. Rubio went on to extol vocational training for welders as a way to lift wages. As if robots can\u2019t weld?\n\nThen there was John Kasich, who seemed to be trying to set himself apart from his scroogy opponents by noting that in Ohio, \u201cWe do have a moderate increase in the minimum wage.\u201d The minimum in Ohio is $8.10 an hour, except for employers grossing $283,000 a year or less, who can pay as little as $7.25 an hour.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t so serious," it would be laughable."""," ""byline"": ""TERESA TRITCH"""," ""description"": ""Here\u2019s what the candidates said at the debate on Tuesday \u2014 and here are the facts."""," ""title"": ""Taking Note: Republicans Sound Off on the Minimum Wage"""," ""url"": ""http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/12/republicans-sound-off-on-the-minimum-wage/"""," ""topics"": [""jobs/employment""]"," ""people"": [""Donald Trump"""," ""Marco Rubio"""," ""Ben Carson"""," ""John Kasich""]"," ""orgs"": []"," ""election_confidence"": 0.8083537910154293"," ""authors"": [{""author_id"": 2728"," ""fullname"": ""teresa tritch"""," ""primary_org"": ""nyt""}]"," ""date_written"": ""2015-11-12 20:53:37"""," ""org"": ""nyt"""," ""article_id"": ""01fd6ecd05292172651b0f1d6742215a"""," ""date_access"": ""2015-11-12 21:44:49.772354""}",

"{""body"": ""Despite a month of sharpened attacks", Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has failed to significantly dent Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s lead in the Democratic presidential race, according to a New York Times/CBS News survey released on Thursday.\n\nMrs. Clinton has support from 52 percent of Democratic primary voters, while Mr. Sanders has backing from 33 percent, the poll found. In an early October CBS News poll, she led Mr. Sanders 56 percent to 32 percent.\n\nMr. Sanders, whose overarching challenge is to transform his left-wing, lesser-known candidacy into a formidable national campaign with broad appeal, will face his greatest test yet on Saturday night at the second Democratic debate, which will be televised nationally from Des Moines. Mrs. Clinton will take the stage after a run of positive developments since their Oct. 13 debate, including strong reviews of her performance there, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s decision not to enter the race, and a steely, well-received face-off with congressional Republicans investigating the 2012 attack on the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. \n\nMr. Sanders, in turn, has been drawing more contrasts with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s positions on trade, Social Security, the death penalty and marijuana legalization since the October debate, but his attacks have not been memorably effective.\n\nA third Democratic candidate, former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland, will also take part in Saturday\u2019s debate, but he is trailing far behind his rivals. He received 5 percent of the vote in the Times/CBS News poll.\n\nMr. Sanders and Mr. O\u2019Malley do appear to have room to grow if they can find a way, the poll found: Half of Democratic primary voters said it was still too early to say for sure who they would support.\n\nSanders supporters stand out as especially engaged with the presidential race. Fifty-four percent of them said they were paying a lot of attention to the campaign, compared with 38 percent of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s backers.\n\nBut Mrs. Clinton enjoys a firmer base of voters than Mr. Sanders, according to the poll. Fifty-four percent of her supporters said their minds were completely made up, while 58 percent of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters said they had not made a final decision.\n\nAnd 43 percent of Democrats said they would enthusiastically support Mrs. Clinton as their presidential nominee, compared to 35 percent for Mr. Sanders. Slim majorities of women, nonwhites and older voters said they would enthusiastically back Mrs. Clinton as the party\u2019s choice, while just three in 10 male Democrats said they would feel that way about her as their standard-bearer in 2016.\n\nA strong majority of Democratic primary voters say they are paying at least some attention to the presidential campaign; 26 percent of Democrats say they have not been paying much attention," compared with 11 percent of Republican primary voters.\n\nThe nationwide telephone poll was conducted Nov. 6 to 10 on cellphones and landlines with 418 Democratic primary voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus six percentage points.

The school has been a staple for primary debates: It has hosted nationally televised debates every presidential cycle since 2007. Sheslow Auditorium, where the debate will occur, is a part of the National Register of Historic Places. It holds just 775 seats and has striking stained glass windows. If you\u2019re eager to look like an insider, refer to the campus neighborhood as \u201cDogtown.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\nWhat time and how long is the debate?\nThe debate will last two hours and begin at 9 p.m. Eastern time. It should look markedly different than the last Democratic debate: With just three candidates, each participant should be able to speak for a length of time equivalent to a stump speech. \nCBS News says there will be no opening statements. Candidates will have 60 seconds to respond, 30 seconds for rebuttals and follow ups, and 60 seconds for closing statements.\nHow can I watch the debate?\nThe debate will air on CBS and stream for free at www.cbsnews.com/live/. No cable subscription is necessary. CBS will also air the debate on its radio affiliates, meaning anyone with network TV, radio or Internet access can take it in. Those already tuned in to the live broadcast of the Midwest favorite Prairie Home Companion can simply switch the radio dial to listen.\nThe debate competes with a local football game as regional adversary Minnesota comes to Iowa City to play the fifth-ranked Iowa Hawkeyes in a critical matchup just more than 100 miles away. The winner of the Democratic debate will not receive the Floyd of Rosedale pig trophy awarded to the winner of the game.\nDoes this debate have a theme?\nCBS News\u2019 John Dickerson told The Des Moines Register he plans to focus the debate on the economy \u2014 especially wages and income inequality. Even health care, education and retirement issues will revolve on the axis of finance. \u201cThe goal of the moderator is to illuminate the views of the candidates on the issues that matter the most to voters, and you don\u2019t need to be on the side of the party to do that,\u201d Dickerson told the newspaper.\nWho will participate in the debate?\nAfter Lincoln Chafee and Jim Webb dropped out shortly after the last debate, the field was left with three candidates: Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley. In April, President Barack Obama joked that even attendees at an O\u2019Malley campaign event wouldn\u2019t recognize O\u2019Malley, but after two debates, he seems to have earned at least a modest following. Just two days before the debate, he\u2019ll dine with a family in Austin, Texas, headed by an illegal immigrant.\nWhere will they stand on the stage?\nIt would be an understatement to say Clinton has a commanding lead, which means she\u2019ll stand center stage, flanked by Sanders and O\u2019Malley. \nWho will moderate the debate?\nThere will be four people involved in moderating the debate, with Dickerson taking the lead as the principal moderator. Dickerson--known for acerbic questions asked on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d every Sunday--will get help from his CBS News colleague Nancy Cordes, the network\u2019s congressional correspondent. Two local journalists will also pitch in on the panel with Cordes: KCCI\u2019s Kevin Cooney and the Des Moines Register\u2019s Kathie Obradovich. Cooney has been a stalwart of local politics and breaking news for decades and is retiring this month.\nHow will Sanders go after Clinton?\nIn the last debate\u2019s most memorable moment, the Ronda Rousey-endorsed Sanders seemed to put the issue of Clinton\u2019s email scandal(s) to rest. But he soon backed off his backing off the topic, telling The Wall Street Journal that the controversies involve \u201cvalid questions.\u201d Sanders continues his implicit anti-Clinton campaign in a state that could decide his fate as a self-appointed revolutionary.\nWill Clinton continue to be haunted by Iowa?\nAfter losing to Barack Obama in a wrenching defeat in the 2008 Iowa caucuses, Clinton has spent the past few years building another sturdy following in the state. Any feelings of betrayal don\u2019t appear to affect her in this less-competitive race. She has the endorsement of the beloved former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, and she\u2019s convincing undecided Iowa Democrats that she is indeed, the best choice for the nomination.\nWhen is the fifth Republican debate?\nThe fifth Republican debate is scheduled for Tuesday, Dec. 15 in Las Vegas \u2014 the last Republican debate of the calendar year. It will be hosted by CNN and Salem Radio and moderated by Wolf Blitzer. Hugh Hewitt will return to contribute questions.\nWhen is the next Democratic debate?\nIn another Saturday night bout, the candidates will next take the stage Saturday, Dec. 19 in Manchester, New Hampshire. The debate will be hosted by ABC News, the New Hampshire Democratic Party," WMUR-TV and the Union Leader.\nNoah Weiland is a researcher at Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC"""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": """""," ""title"": ""Everything you need to know about Saturday&apos;s Democratic debate"""," ""url"": ""http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/second-democratic-2016-debate-iowa-when-is-it-215792"""," ""topics"": [""ethics"""," ""trade"""," ""income inequality""]"," ""people"": [""Isaac Arnsdorf"""," ""Burgess Everett"""," ""Eliza Collins"""," ""Nancy Cordes"""," ""Jim Webb"""," ""Doug Palmer"""," ""Hugh Hewitt"""," ""Jacopo Barigazzi"""," ""Steven Shepard"""," ""Kathie Obradovich"""," ""Barack Obama"""," ""Jenny Hopkinson"""," ""Brian Mahoney"""," ""Hillary Rodham Clinton"""," ""Darius Tahir"""," ""Caitlin Emma"""," ""Rich Lowry"""," ""Nick Gass"""," ""Jack Shafer"""," ""Bernie Becker"""," ""John Dickerson"""," ""Jennifer Scholtes"""," ""Martin O'Malley"""," ""Neera Tanden"""," ""Noah Weiland"""," ""Alex Isenstadt"""," ""Seung Min Kim"""," ""Jason Kander"""," ""Jake Sherman"""," ""Darren Goode"""," ""Paul Ryan"""," ""Nicholas Vinocur"""," ""Brianna Ehley"""," ""Tim Starks"""," ""Jeremy Herb"""," ""Tony Romm"""," ""Jennifer Haberkorn"""," ""Rachana Pradhan"""," ""Tom Harkin"""," ""Hillary Clinton"""," ""Ben Carson"""," ""Ben White"""," ""Elena Schneider"""," ""Wolf Blitzer"""," ""Rick Reed"""," ""Eric Wolff"""," ""Lincoln Chafee"""," ""Bernie Sanders"""," ""Jeff Greenfield""]"," ""orgs"": [""New Hampshire Democratic Party"""," ""National Register of Historic Places"""," ""Fed"""," ""NAFTA"""," ""Union Leader"""," ""UFCW"""," ""Yale University"""," ""U.N."""," ""Swift Boat"""," ""Medal of Honor"""," ""Des Moines Register"""," ""Salem Radio"""," ""Drake University"""," ""AT&T"""," ""GOP"""," ""The Des Moines Register"""," ""WTO""]"," ""election_confidence"": 0.9413362945875061"," ""authors"": [{""author_id"": 32625"," ""fullname"": ""eliza collins"""," ""primary_org"": ""politico""}]"," ""date_written"": ""2015-11-12 19:10:24"""," ""org"": ""politico"""," ""article_id"": ""527e2a85ade022bc40921859db5d0cc9"""," ""date_access"": ""2015-11-12 19:44:17.684409""}",
