The second Democratic debate was a subdued affair, where even the slights felt polite. Sanders and O'Malley attacked Clinton's record on foreign policy — especially her vote on the Iraq war — but when it came time to talk about how to fight the Islamic State, the separation felt a matter of semantics. ""This cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential,"" said Clinton. O'Malley said he disagreed: ""This is America's fight, but not America's alone."" We'll leave you with the two must-watch moments — a confrontation between Sanders and Clinton over campaign finance and Sanders cracks a joke about socialism:

GREENVILLE, S.C.–Sen. Ted Cruz brought his presidential campaign to an evangelical bastion here Saturday, travelling to a Christian college to hold a religious liberty rally that was shadowed by anxiety about the terrorist attacks in Paris.
Mr. Cruz opened the rally at Bob Jones University with a moment of silence for the victims of the attacks and called for a decisive response to the Islamic militants who claimed responsibility.
“This is an evil that will not quietly slip away,” Mr. Cruz said in his opening prayer. “We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism. This evil will no longer walk the face of the earth.”
The focus of the rally, however, was the threat to religious freedom that many conservatives see in the U.S., an issue that is central to the Cruz campaign effort to win over evangelical voters. He is reaching out to people who believe their right to act on their religious beliefs is threatened by government actions supporting such social changes as the legalization of gay marriage and limits on public religious worship.
At the rally, similar one Mr. Cruz held in Iowa in August, he shared the stage with Christians who think their religious rights were violated, such as Joe Kennedy– a high school football coach in Washington state who was placed on leave recently for kneeling in silent prayer on the field after games.
“What kind of country have we become when kneeling in prayer is regarded as an act of civil disobedience,” Mr. Cruzsaid. “These threats are real and they are growing each and every day.”
Mr. Cruz’s staff estimated that 2,500 people attended the rally at Bob Jones, a college that has a stirred controversy in the past for its treatment of blacks and gays. The school’s ban on interracial dating sparked criticism of George W. Bush when he campaigned here during the 2000 presidential campaign. That ban subsequently ended, and the college is reemerging as a destination for GOP presidential candidates seeking evangelical support.
One of Mr. Cruz’s leading rivals for support of evangelical voters, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, appeared on the campus Friday for a town hall meeting with South Carolina GOP Sen. Tim Scott.
The two presidential candidates provided the community with a study in contrast: Mr. Cruz gave a fiery, emotional speech that filled an auditorium; Mr. Carson was more measured and low key.
For some in the audience, the violence in Paris led them to focus more acutely on the candidates’ ability to lead in a world crisis and prosecute a war on terrorism. For Janessa Fortner, a Greenville Republican who is inclined to support businessman Donald Trump, those developments raised new reservations in her mind about the low key Mr. Carson.
“He’s not going to strike fear in ISIS,” Mrs. Fortner said. “Who would you want handling what happened last night?’’

"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) â With the country still reeling from deadly terrorist attacks in Paris, Hillary Rodham Clinton cast herself as America's strongest leader in a scary world, even as she found herself forced to defend her own role during the rise of the Islamic State militants.
""This election is not only about electing a president, it's also about choosing our next commander in chief,"" Clinton declared Saturday night in the Democrats' second debate of the presidential campaign. ""All of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.""
Amid the backdrop of global anxiety, Clinton found herself fending off questions about not only her foreign policy record but her economic ties, with both Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley painting the former senator from New York as a lackey for Wall Street and corporate interests.
""Let's not be naive about it,"" said Sanders, noting that Clinton collected millions in campaign donations from Wall Street bankers. ""They expect to get something. Everybody knows that.""
Clinton defended her relationship with Wall Street, citing her work in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but her statement met with criticism from Republicans who accused her of politicizing the terrorist assaults.
The barbs marked a far more aggressive shift in a primary race that has so far been notable for its civility. Democrats have spent months boasting about the substantive tone of their contest, attempting to set up a favorable early contrast with the ""carnival barker"" insults of the crowded Republican primary.
Since the Democrats' first debate a month ago, Clinton has built a lead in the early voting states, gains that have come amid other signs the party is coalescing behind her. But the nomination fight is far from over.
Saturday night, Clinton faced criticism of her national security record, when Sanders traced the current instability in the Middle East to the U.S. Senate's vote â including Clinton's â to authorize military action in Iraq in 2002. He said that U.S. invasion ""unraveled the region.""
The former secretary of state fought back, saying terrorism has been erupting for decades, specifically mentioning the Sept. 11 attacks. She said the recent unrest in Libya and other parts of the Middle East is symptomatic of an ""arc of instability from North Africa to Afghanistan.""
She rejected the idea that she and the rest of the Obama administration underestimated the growing threat of the Islamic State.
The back-and-forth revealed a foreign policy split within the Democratic Party, with Sanders playing to the anti-war activists who boosted then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama to victory in 2008.
Sanders argued for a far more hands-off approach, advocating for Muslim countries to lead the fight and declaring that the war against Islamic State militants is about the ""soul of Islam.""
Clinton has a history of advocating for more robust involvement across the globe â both as a presidential candidate eight years ago and as Obama's secretary of state. In recent weeks, she has called for a more aggressive U.S. role in the Syrian conflict, including a no-fly zone over the area, a move the Obama administration opposes. But she stood by her opposition to seeking a formal declaration of war against the Islamic State.
All the candidates denounced the attacks, and the debate began on a solemn note with a moment of silence followed by the previously unplanned foreign policy questions.
They gave some fodder to their Republican critics, who coupled condemnation of the Paris attacks during the day with sharp criticism for Obama and his former secretary of state, Clinton.
""We are at war with violent extremism, we are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression,"" said Clinton, arguing the U.S. is not at war with Islam or all Muslims. ""I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.""
Sanders and O'Malley agreed with her sentiments, saying the term ""radical Islam"" used by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and other Republican presidential candidates, is unnecessarily offensive to American Muslims.
Republicans immediately seized on the remarks. ""Yes, we are at war with radical Islamic terrorism,"" tweeted former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.
The conversation later pivoted to economic issues, with the candidates tangling over how to pay for their plans to expand college affordability, family leave and prescription drug coverage.
The conversation revealed how Sanders' message has helped shift the party to the left on some economic issues.
All three agreed that wealthy citizens and corporations should pay more in taxes to benefit the middle class. They tangled over how high to increase the minimum wage, with Clinton backing a $12-per-hour federal floor while Sanders and O'Malley said $15 an hour â the rate being pushed by a campaign of fast-food workers and labor unions. And they fought over the degree to which they would curtail large financial institutions, with Sanders describing Wall Street's business model as ""greed and fraud"" â a startling judgment for a major presidential candidate.
""I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,"" joked Sanders, saying the former president backed a 90 percent marginal tax rate.
While Clinton is wary of alienating Sanders backers whose support she'll need should she win the nomination, she did take a few shots. She attempted to cast some of Sanders major proposals, including a single payer health care system and free college, as politically unrealistic.
""The revolution never came,"" she said, in a knock on his call for a ""political revolution."" ''I waited and I got the scars to show for it.""
Sanders may have inadvertently helped her in the first debate, when he seemed to dismiss the controversy over her use of a private email account and server by saying Americans are tired of hearing about her ""damn emails.""
Saturday night, Sanders declined once again to attack:  ""I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email,"" he said.
""I agree completely,"" said Clinton, with a laugh.

"BUENOS AIRES Nov 15 Argentina's ruling party
presidential candidate, Daniel Scioli, lagging in the opinion
polls, will have to win points in Sunday night's debate against
his business-friendly rival if he hopes to revive his campaign
in time to win the Nov. 22 election.
Scioli, the governor of Buenos Aires province, has been
endorsed by outgoing President Cristina Fernandez. Barred by law
from running for a third term this year, Fernandez will leave
her successor to deal with double-digit inflation, scant central
bank reserves and a widening fiscal deficit.
At 9 p.m. (midnight GMT), in the campaign's only televised
debate, Scioli will square off against Mauricio Macri, a
free-markets proponent who is leading the polls by about 8
percentage points after a stronger-than-expected performance in
last month's first round of voting.
Macri promises to spur investment by quickly dismantling
Fernandez's trade and currency controls. Scioli's message of
gradual change toward more orthodox policies while preserving
Fernandez's generous welfare programs has failed to catch fire
with the middle-class swing voters who will decide the election.
""Scioli has to use the debate to show he is independent from
Fernandez and that he has a plan for change, concentrating on
economic issued like inflation and employment,"" said local
pollster Mariel Fornoni. ""He already has Fernandez's supporters
locked in. So he has to concentrate on undecided voters.""
Fernandez is revered by Argentina's poor for having
strengthened the social safety net during her eight years in
power. But inflation sparked by her policy of printing pesos to
finance an ever-wider fiscal deficit has pumped up household
expenses for families across the political spectrum.
Fernandez may return as a presidential candidate in 2019.
She and Scioli have never been close and her statements of
support for him have been tepid. She has given stirring speeches
in support of the continuance of her policies, but usually
without mentioning Scioli by name.

" (AP) â The Democratic presidential candidates are debating for the second time in the 2016 nomination contest, this time in Des Moines.
The latest developments (all times local):
___
10:30 p.m.
Hillary Rodham Clinton is joining a raucous audience of about 750 people in Drake University's union after the second Democratic debate for a quick campaign rally.
The event lacks any the solemnity that she and her two rivals showed at the start of the debate when they observed a moment of silence in the wake of the Paris attacks.
Clinton is imploring those in the mostly college-age audience to redouble their work for her campaign.
She says, ""Because this is just the beginning. I need you on caucus night. Then I need you in November.""
___
10:15 p.m.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is greeting roughly 500 supporters who gathered at a movie theater near the site of the second Democratic debate.
""You killed it!"" one man yelled as Sanders took the stage.
Sanders is with his wife and three of his four children. He's thanking the crowd and repeating his argument that they are working for ""real political revolution.""
He tells the cheering crowd, ""If we work hard, I believe we're going to win Iowa.""
Asked about the debate Sanders says, ""I think it went great.""
___
10 p.m.
And the second debate of the Democratic campaign for president has come to an end with closing statements.
Martin O'Malley is pitching himself as a new leader, asking voters to discard the ""divisive ideologies of our past"" and ""polarizing figures from our past.""
The former Maryland governor says he can create an economy that works for all and identify foreign threats before they ""back us into military corners.""
Hillary Rodham Clinton turns attention back to economic issues in her closing statement.
She says that, ""ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do, to lift up the people of the country.""
Sanders closes the debate by again calling for a ""political revolution,"" saying it is unacceptable for the U.S. to have a ""corrupt"" campaign finance system, no universal health care, high childhood poverty and no guaranteed paid family medical leave.
He says, ""That's not the America that I think we should be.""
___
9:51 p.m.
Asked about his greatest test, Bernie Sanders cites his work on veterans' health care in the wake of the Veterans Administration scandal â and not getting everything he wanted in his reform bill.
Sanders is the co-author of a veterans' health care reform bill with GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
The legislation has been widely praised, but Sanders says it's far from the bill he initially penned. Sanders says he was forced to go back to the drawing board after his initial legislation didn't receive enough votes.
That moment, he says, represented a challenge he overcame.
___
9:49 p.m.
Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is pointing to no single crisis during his tenure as comparing to those that a president would face.
His reason? Because he says there is no test is like what he would face as president.
O'Malley says: ""I can tell you that as a mayor and as a governor that I learned many disciplines. ... I've been tried over many emergencies.""
___
9:48 p.m.
The Democratic candidates for president are answering a question about their greatest test and how it would prepare them for the rigors of serving in the White House.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton points to the deliberations over killing Osama bin Laden.
Clinton says being ""part of a very small group"" advising President Barack Obama on the matter ""really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.""
She says she advocated pursuing the assassination mission, despite intelligence she says ""was by no means absolute.""
Clinton adds that ""there was no one to talk to"" outside the circle of advisers who had access to the intelligence and discussions. That includes her husband, former President Bill Clinton.
___
9:45 p.m.
Bernie Sanders says single-payer health insurance is the only way to go. But Hillary Rodham Clinton argues that she once thought this would happen and that ""revolution never came.""
The Vermont senator and former secretary of state are clashing over health care in the second Democratic debate.
Sanders says changing to a single-payer system would take time but that it can happen ""when millions of people stand up and agree to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies.""
Clinton retorts that Sanders' plans would put too much power in the hands of the states.
She adds at the debate in Des Moines that ""if I lived in Iowa, I would not want Terry Branstad administering my health care.""
Branstad is the Republican governor of Iowa.
___
9: 40 p.m.
Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is making an impassioned case for debt-free college and railing against high interest rates for federal student loans.
O'Malley often cites his own daughter's college debt when he talks about lowering college costs.
He says he is proud of his daughters going to college and adds, ""but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives. It doesn't need to be that way.""
He says, ""It doesn't need to be that way.""
O'Malley's debt-free college plan centers in part on getting states to contribute more to public colleges and universities.
___
9:35 p.m.
Hillary Rodham Clinton is turning a discussion about her emails into a broad-ranging attack on Republicans.
She says, ""I do think it's important to do exactly what Sen. Sanders said, and that is to start talking about the issues that the American people really care about.""
She says that there are ""differences among us"" on the Democratic debate stage. But, she adds, ""they pale compared to what's happening on the Republican side.""
Clinton then puts forth a list of what she calls ""alarming plans.""
She says, ""All of us support funding Planned Parenthood. All of us believe climate change is real. All of us want equal pay for equal work. They don't believe in any of that. So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.""
___
9:30 p.m.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders still doesn't care about Hillary Rodham Clinton's emails.
Sanders suggested in a recent interview that the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email account and server while serving as secretary of state had merit.
But asked about that interview at the second Democratic debate, he jabs the media.
Sanders says, ""That's just media stuff. I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email. I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email.""
Sanders says it's time to move on, and Clinton seizes the opening to add, ""I couldn't agree more.""
Asked if she can promise the country that another shoe won't drop in the email story, she points to her recent testimony before Congress when she was questioned about the issue.
She says, ""I think after 11 hours, that's pretty clear.""
___
9:25 p.m.
Bernie Sanders say the ""political revolution"" he's trying to create can overpower a GOP-led Congress that he argues is beholden to big-money interests.
And he's downplaying the idea that Congress doesn't always listen to what the majority of Americans want.
He says most Americans want to improve infrastructure and raise the minimum wage. He claims that if people ""stand up and fight back"" they can take on corporate lobbyists and change the tone in Washington.
He says, ""Enough is enough. This government belongs to us, not just the billionaires.""
___
9:20 p.m.
While the Democratic candidates agree on many issues, Martin O'Malley is stressing their differences on guns.
During the second Democratic debate, the former Maryland governor is highlighting his record in passing gun safety legislation.
He questions Sanders' support for a 2005 measure to give gun manufacturers immunity from lawsuits. O'Malley also says that rival Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on ""three sides of this issue.""
He says, ""When you ran in 2000, you said we needed federal robust regulation, then in 2008 you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying we don't need those regulations ... and now you've come back around here.""
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders chimes in to note that Baltimore ""is not now one of the safest cities in America.""
O'Malley is the former mayor of Baltimore, which recorded its 300th homicide of the year on Saturday.
___
9:10 p.m.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says the business model of Wall Street is ""fraud.""
He pledges that no one from Wall Street will advise him on economic policy if he's elected president.
Sanders is challenging Hillary Rodham Clinton on her ties to Wall Street as he promises to aggressively take on and break up the nation's largest banks.
He says Wall Street has dominated Republican and Democratic presidential administrations.
He is chiding Clinton for suggesting that Wall Street bankers will play by the rules. He says the big banks operate through ""greed and fraud.""
He says, ""Who are we kidding? The business model of Wall Street is fraud, that's what it is.""
___
9:05 p.m.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is saying at the second Democratic debate that Hillary Rodham Clinton is beholden to Wall Street financial institutions and will not act strongly enough to regulate them.
Of the plan Clinton is offering to regulate the nation's financial industry, Sanders says simply: ""Not good enough.""
He continues: ""Let's not be naive about it. Why over her political career has Wall Street been the major contributor to her campaign?""
Clinton replies sharply that as a senator from New York, she stood in Manhattan to help rebuild the financial heart of the nation after Sept. 11.
Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley jumps in to call Clinton's plans ""weak tea.""
O'Malley says you can't be the candidate for Main Street by being ""the candidate for Wall Street.""
___
9 p.m.
Hillary Rodham Clinton is deviating from her Democratic primary rivals on minimum wage.
Clinton says the federal wage floor should be raised to $12 per hour from the current $7.25. She says $15 is too high.
That's the wage sought by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley.
Clinton says she respects the concerns of economists and business leaders who argue such an immediate hike would lead to job losses and other negative consequences.
Sanders says he will ""apologize to no one"" for backing the $15 wage. He says that several U.S. cities already have gone to the higher level without suffering any catastrophic results.
Both Sanders and O'Malley argue that higher wages benefit the overall economy, because workers have more money to spend as consumers.
O'Malley says, ""We should stop taking our advice from economists on Wall Street.""
___
8:55 p.m.
Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley says the United States must focus on immigration reform, rather than more border security.
During the second Democratic debate, O'Malley says that that net immigration from Mexico last year was zero.
He says: ""Fact check me. Go ahead. Check it out.""
O'Malley argues that the real focus should be on providing a pathway to citizenship for those in the country illegally.
___
8:45 p.m.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says he wants public college tuition to be free for all Americans and will pay for it by raising taxes, but he won't say by how much.
Sanders says, ""There must be a tax on Wall Street speculation. ... It's their turn to bail out the middle class.""
But when asked specifically by how much he'll raise taxes, Sanders replies that ""we haven't come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent.""
He zings, ""I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.""
Sander is a longtime independent who often calls himself a democratic socialist.
___
8:40 p.m.
The Democratic presidential debate has shifted away from foreign policy and is now focused on domestic issues.
And the three Democratic candidates say they agree that wealthy citizens and corporations should pay more in taxes to benefit the middle class.
All say they support reducing the costs of college and paid family leave. Hillary Rodham Clinton says she'll close loopholes and eliminate deductions that benefit big corporations.
She says, ""I've made very clear hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase.""
Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley says he's the only one with a record of keeping college costs low.
During his tenure as governor, Maryland's university system froze tuition for four years. He says wealthier Americans should be willing to contribute more for the benefit of everyone.
___
8:35 p.m.
In the wake of the Paris attacks, French President Francois Hollande vows that his nation will wage ""merciless"" war on the Islamic State.
At the Democratic debate, Hillary Rodham Clinton is deflecting a question of whether she would declare war on the militant group.
The former secretary says the United States has to beef up its intelligence capabilities. She says, ""It is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable, but we have to keep on trying. ... There's a lot of work we need to keep doing.""
Her rival Bernie Sanders interrupts, suggesting that too little of the existing U.S. military budget of $600 billion is used to fight ""international terrorism.""
Instead, Sanders complains that too much is spent to maintain nuclear weapons that he sees as part of the U.S. military strategy of the last century.
___
8:32 p.m.
The Republican candidates for president are jumping on the refusal of the Democratic candidates to say the words ""radical Islam"" at their debate.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tweets, ""Yes, we are at war with radical Islamic terrorism.""
Rick Santorum adds on Twitter, ""@HillaryClinton how can we defeat our enemy if we cannot identify who they are and what motivates them?""
Says Carly Fiorina on Twitter: ""Hillary Clinton will not call this Islamic terrorism. I will.""
___
8:30 p.m.
All three Democratic presidential candidates are declining to use the term ""radical Islam"" at the party's second debate, a description used by many of their Republican rivals.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton says, ""I don't think we are at war with Islam. ... I think we're at war with jihadists.""
She adds that ""it's not particularly helpful"" to use language that alienates many Muslims, and she notes that Republican President George W. Bush made a similar point after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says, ""I don't think the term is important."" He says the more important issue is the ""entire world coming together"" to defeat militants.
Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley says using the term ""radical Islam"" is unnecessarily offensive to Muslims in America. He says he prefers ""radical jihadists"" and describes them as a group that is ""perverting the name of a major world religion.""
___
8:25 p.m.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says countries in the Middle East must get more involved in the fight against the Islamic State.
During a foreign policy discussion during the second Democratic debate, Sanders calls the current conflict a ""war for the soul of Islam.""
He says that other Muslim countries in the region will need to get ""deeply involved"" and lead the effort. He mentions Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey and Jordan by name.
Hillary Rodham Clinton calls the comment ""unfair"" to some counties, in particular Jordan. She says Jordan has ""put a lot on the line"" for the United States.
But Clinton says she agrees that Turkey and the Gulf nations should decide if they will stand with the United States against ""this kind of jihadi radicalism.""

Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley says simply toppling dictators is not a suitable foreign policy for the 21st century, referring to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.
O'Malley is attempting to draw a contrast with former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on foreign policy during the second Democratic debate.
He says Syria, Libya and Afghanistan are ""a mess"" and that the United States isn't doing enough to build stable democracies after toppling dictators.
He says the United States needs better ""human intelligence"" on the ground to understand what actors will step up to fill the void after dictators fall.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is criticizing former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's vote as a New York senator for the resolution to allow the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
Sanders says, ""I don't think any sensible person"" would have supported the use-of-force resolution.
He calls the invasion ""the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of the United States.""
Clinton has said the 2002 vote was a mistake, but says there were acts leading up to the invasion that suggested Islamic extremists had struck at U.S. installations.

Hillary Rodham Clinton is defending the Obama administration's initial approach to the rise of Islamic State, including her actions as secretary of state.
Clinton rejects the notion that she underestimated the militants, and she blames their rise on leaders in the Middle East and names former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.
Clinton says al-Maliki did not do enough to maintain stability in Iraq once the U.S. turned over control of the nation.
She adds that she did advocate that the U.S. do more to ""train and equip moderates"" in Syria, which has since fallen into civil war.

A look at the opening statements from the second presidential Democratic debate.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders begins with sharp language for the Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for the attack in Paris.
He says, ""Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization.""
But Sanders also pivots from the attacks to the economic issues that are the focus of his campaign.
Front-runner and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton keeps to the attacks in her statement, saying ""our prayers are with the people of France tonight.""
She adds: ""But that is not enough. We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical, Jihadist ideology that motivates organizations ISIS.""
Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley touts his executive experience in his opening remarks, and says the U.S. needs ""new thinking"" and ""new leadership"" to respond to threats like those posed by the Islamic State.

The second debate of the Democratic campaign for president is underway, and it's starting with a moment of silence for the victims of the attacks in Paris.
A coordinated gun-and-suicide bombing attack tore across Paris on Friday, leaving at least 129 people dead and 352 injured. It marked the deadliest violence on French soil since World War II.
French President Francois Hollande has vowed that his country will wage ""merciless"" war on the Islamic State group, which claimed responsibility for the carnage.
The candidates will each make an opening statement before the debate's first section focuses on the attacks and foreign policy.

7:45 p.m.
The Democratic candidates for president are gathering for the party's second debate of the 2016 campaign, a meeting that will take place in the shadow of the attacks in Paris.
The campaigns have tangled with debate host CBS over the format of the debate in the hours before the debate.
When CBS said on a conference call with the campaigns that it wanted to focus the opening statement and the first section of the debate on the Paris attacks, the campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders vigorously disagreed.
That's according to a participant on the call, who spoke on condition of anonymity and was not authorized to speak publicly.
Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver says the key issue is a proposal to shorten the opening statements from 90 seconds to 30 seconds in order to move quickly to questions in a debate unfolding a day after the Paris attacks.
The Vermont senator's campaign says it successfully argued on behalf of the longer opening statements, which all three candidates will deliver.
The debate will begin with a moment of silence in memory of the victims of the attacks.

"As 
Donald Trump
 and other 
Republicans
 talked tough on illegal immigration during last week's presidential debate, an exasperated 
Jeb Bush
 noted that 
Hillary Clinton
's campaign aides were, right then, exchanging high-fives.
He might have added: And Republican leaders in many states, like California, were once again despairing.
From the beginning of the summer of Trump, many Republicans here hoped he would disappear quickly, to limit damage to the party's image. Summer turned to fall, and Trump still dominates the presidential campaign. And so does the subject of illegal immigration, posing a mighty threat.
How mighty could be seen in a USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll published last week. It demonstrated again what California sees in every election: The party's positions on immigration and other issues, like gay marriage, have cost Republicans a generation of good will and support. Here, the poll reminded, Republicans are limited mostly to older and white voters, religious voters and residents of inland California.
The current brouhaha over illegal immigration is important because new voters will carry their views of the political parties with them for a very long time.
""The experiences people have when they enter the political system do stay with them,"" said Jon Cohen, vice president of survey research for SurveyMonkey, the firm that conducted the poll. Political views ""can shift … but those initial moments are important and do frame how they see things.""
Republican difficulties can be seen in three key areas.
Young and minority voters
There's substantial overlap in the membership of these groups, and in their reasons for siding with Democrats and the party's candidates.
According to the poll, 36% of voters ages 18 to 29 strongly approve of 
President Obama
. Another 40% approve of him more mildly, meaning three-quarters of young California voters are on Obama's side. Asked whether the country was headed in the right direction, 40% said it was — not a majority but six points above the percentage for California voters overall.
Asked whether immigrants strengthened or weakened American society, 7 in 10 of the 18- to 29-year-olds said they represented a strength. (Among those age 65 and older, a slight majority felt the same way.)
Views among Latino, African American and Asian voters were similar. All told, three-quarters of black voters, almost two-thirds of Latino voters and 70% of Asian voters supported President Obama. By strong majorities, all said immigration was positive for the country. Latino and Asian voters were about as positive about the direction of the country as were young voters.
Those voters receive a contrary message from the Republican candidates for president. To hear them, the country is falling apart, President Obama is an abject failure and immigration is a threat. (The USC Dornsife/Times poll did not test views on the president's healthcare plan, but polls taken since the measure passed showed that it is broadly popular among minority voters. The GOP presidential candidates regularly scorn it and pledge to repeal it.)
Interestingly, young Republicans are not that different in some ways from their elders — their presidential selections were quite similar — but they, too, have more moderate positions on immigration, gay marriage and other cultural issues.
The state's coastal-inland split
The traditional California fight is between north and south. The political split is between west and east, coastal and inland.
Take the Obama support rating: Along the coast, 61% supported him. Inland, only 44% did. Two of the most conservative areas of the state, the Central Valley and Inland Empire, had only a 46% and 34% support rating for him, respectively. In both places, strong opposition was by far the dominant view.
Here's the problem: The Central Valley represents 19% of the state's voters, and the Inland Empire another 10%. The two largest Democratic areas, Los Angeles County and the Bay Area, make up 44% of the state's voters.
Even inland, demography is cutting into Republican unanimity. A majority of voters in the Central Valley said that immigrants strengthen this country, and 43% of Inland Empire voters agreed. (Growing Latino voting strength everywhere in the state has pushed many inland Republican members of Congress to support changes in immigration policy opposed by their leaders.)
Religion, or lack thereof
Religion has long been a dividing line in politics — the more common attendance at services, the greater the likelihood of political conservatism. It was true in the new poll as well.
About half of Republican candidate Ben Carson's supporters said they attend church at least once a week, the highest percentage for any candidate. Only 20% of Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton's supporters reported that they attend services at least once a week.
The problem for Republicans? There aren't enough Californians who are that religious.
In California, 28% said they attend services at least once a week, and 44% said they attend seldom or never. Nationally, 35% were actively religious, while 38% seldom or never attended services.
Republicans might be tempted to write off California, but their problem is that trends that started here are spreading. In presidential elections, Nevada and New Mexico have become regularly Democratic and Colorado has turned into a toss-up state because of California-style demographic changes.
There would appear to be two solutions: a rapid influx of inland church-goers moving into the state, or a shift by the candidates toward moderation. At this early point of the presidential contest, the odds of the former seem greater than the odds of the latter.

Democratic U.S. presidential candidates Senator Bernie Sanders (L), former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley pose on stage ahead of the second official 2016 U.S. Democratic presidential candidates debate in Des Moines, Iowa, November 14, 2015.   (REUTERS/Jim Young)


Hillary Clinton was put on the defensive at the opening of Saturday night’s Democratic presidential debate over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability.
The debate in Des Moines, Iowa, came in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which thrust the issues of national security and foreign policy back to the center of the 2016 campaign. The debate format was changed to focus anew on those issues.
But, citing the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa, Clinton’s rivals criticized her Senate vote for use of force before the Iraq war and appeared to criticize her support for toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.
Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley said America’s role is not to roam the world “looking for new dictators to topple.”
He said it is also important to understand “secondary and third consequences” that come after removing a “single dictator.” O’Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a “mess.”

Clinton defended her support for toppling Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a “genocide” and America’s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support.
She also said “it is imperative” that the U.S. do more to confront the “arc of instability” in the region. And to O’Malley’s critique, she said, “I don’t think you can paint with a broad brush,” and “This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.”
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, referenced Clinton’s support for use of force in Iraq and said the “disastrous invasion” led “to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.”
Clinton again called her Iraq war vote a “mistake,” but disputed that the war is the only driver of modern terrorism.
The candidates also condemned the Paris terror attacks.
“Our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough,” Clinton said.
She called for global “resolve” to “root out” the “radical jihadist ideology” that motivates groups like the Islamic State. Clinton, a former secretary of state, said she would coordinate efforts “against the scourge of terrorism.”
“It cannot be contained. It must be defeated,” she said of ISIS.
Sanders blasted ISIS as a “barbarous organization.”
O’Malley called this the “new face” of terror threats.
The attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said. 
In a primary race otherwise dominated by the economy, climate and front-runner Clinton’s personal record, the debate in Des Moines, Iowa, now is expected to focus heavily on security and foreign policy after debate host CBS News reworked the format.  
It is an area where Clinton, as former secretary of state, enters with the thickest resume – but also one that could prove problematic, given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable and chaotic nations like Libya and Syria.
Sanders, after appearing to give her a pass at the first debate over her personal email controversy, has in recent weeks shown a greater interest in criticizing her record. But his focus on issues like income inequality could be out of place in a discussion focused on global security challenges. Sanders’ campaign objected to some of the CBS News debate tweaks, sources said.
Clinton also enters this debate – hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register – facing a narrower field than at their first encounter in October. Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O’Malley.
Clinton is seen to have otherwise strengthened her hand since that debate, making it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and seeing one of her biggest potential political threats – a late bid by Vice President Biden – disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.
Sanders remains Clinton’s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.
Still, the FBI investigation over Clinton’s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding. ",,Hillary Clinton was put on the defensive at the opening of Saturday night’s Democratic presidential debate over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability. ,Clinton on defense over Middle East policies at Dem debate,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/TEOgoe910VE/,[u'foreign policy/national security'],"[u'Bernie Sanders', u'Muammar Qaddafi', u'Hillary Clinton', u""Martin O'Malley"", u'Jim Young']",fox,0.9311865151561396,[],2015-11-15 02:02:16,"[u'Senate', u'Al Qaeda', u'FBI']",b06f7a0e9f9c60524f5011b3887f1e37,2015-11-15 03:00:12.671185
"The fight against global terrorism will take center stage Saturday night when Democrats gather in Iowa to debate after the gruesome attacks in Paris that laid bare the kinds of threats the next American president will face.

A month after the Democratic presidential candidates clashed on gun control and financial regulations in their first debate, which focused largely on domestic and economic issues, they are expected to face more questions on foreign policy and national security. Hours after the deadly attacks, CBS News, a co-host of the event, said it would refocus the debate to give candidates an opportunity to discuss how they would respond to such an international crisis.

Despite the tragic nature of the events, the new backdrop represents an opportunity for Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former secretary of state, to shine at a moment when her two remaining rivals, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Martin O’Malley — neither of whom has much foreign policy experience — will be under pressure to blunt her momentum.

Since Mrs. Clinton’s crisp debate performance in October, her poll numbers have surged, she weathered hours of congressional questioning about her handling of the Benghazi attacks, and three of her rivals for the nomination have dropped out.

“It will be interesting to see if Secretary Clinton can keep doing what she’s been doing,” said Brad Anderson, who was President Obama’s 2012 state director in Iowa. “Her steadiness is why you’re seeing her poll numbers continue to increase, especially when you look at what’s happening on the other side of the aisle.”

A New York Times/CBS News survey released this week showed Mrs. Clinton continuing to dominate the race, with more than half of Democratic primary voters backing her and 62 percent thinking she is the candidate who can bring about change in Washington. The shift in the debate’s emphasis to foreign affairs should allow Mrs. Clinton to highlight her deep experience on the international stage, providing an opportunity to extend her advantage.

For Mrs. Clinton’s opponents, the debate presents a chance to tell voters otherwise, and her Senate votes and handling of international crises as a senator and a diplomat could come under scrutiny.

Still, the event is not expected to resemble the free-for-all atmosphere that has marked Republican debates, which have featured sharp exchanges and personal attacks. While the Republican primary contest is a crowded affair, the Democrats will have considerably more time to make their cases and delve into more detailed policy arguments on Saturday with just three candidates on the stage. Since the last debate, Lincoln Chafee, the former governor of Rhode Island, and former Senator Jim Webb of Virginia have dropped out of the race. Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard professor who was running as a Democrat but was not included in the last debate, also stopped his campaign.

Mr. Sanders will get another opportunity to take a harder line against Mrs. Clinton, after he dismissed the controversy surrounding her use of a private email server as secretary of state and largely avoided attacking her directly in their first face-off. He has been preparing sharper lines against Mrs. Clinton on issues like trade, gun control and her emails, and his advisers say he has been studying her record more closely since their October meeting.

Democratic strategists say the debate will also be a significant moment for Mr. O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, whose poll numbers lag in the low single digits. Facing Mrs. Clinton’s star power and the grass-roots support behind Mr. Sanders, Mr. O’Malley needs to find a way to capture some of the spotlight.

“It’s the play that he has left in his playbook right now, to come out swinging and let people know he’s not just this nice guy and that he can be tough,” said Kevin Geiken, a Democratic political consultant for Bluprint Strategies.

Still, it will be a challenge to rattle Mrs. Clinton, who has lurched to the left on issues like trade and the environment while showing a deft ability to repel criticism of her 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq war and her warm relationship with Wall Street.

One area on the domestic front that is likely to come up is the issue of criminal justice reform, which the three candidates have been struggling to address after continuing tension between the police and African-Americans.

DeRay Mckesson, a leader of the Black Lives Matter movement, said he had a good sense of the plans from Mr. Sanders and Mr. O’Malley, but had not heard a comprehensive proposal on the issue of criminal justice from Mrs. Clinton, despite her meetings with the group.

“She’s been eking it out literally one speech at a time,” Mr. McKesson said. “With Hillary, I only have a surface-level understanding. The debate is a chance to learn what she really thinks about the core issues.”

But voters will only learn if they tune in. Some political enthusiasts have complained that because of its Saturday night time slot, the two-hour debate, which will be hosted by CBS News and The Des Moines Register and begin at 9 p.m. Eastern time, may not have the audience of previous events that have drawn millions of viewers.

Mr. Anderson, the Iowa strategist, noted that the candidates would convene at the same time that the undefeated Iowa Hawkeyes take on the Minnesota Golden Gophers in college football.

Jeb Bush has bought his struggling presidential campaign more time, even as Marco Rubio threatens to siphon off the financing that is the lifeblood of his 2016 aspirations.
The former Florida governor delivered a solid, issues-oriented performance Tuesday in the latest Republican debate, which calmed top Bush donors and bundlers who had become disenchanted with the direction of his campaign. Bush can't survive without the financial backing of his vast network of GOP insiders. Their support had wavered following Bush's disastrous showing in the previous debate 12 days earlier that included a bungled attempt to tear down Rubio.
""Everyone in Jeb World admitted that the third debate was a tough one, but he did very well this week,"" Jay Zeidman, a well-connected Bush donor from Houston, told the Washington Examiner on Friday. ""Raising money between the third and the fourth debates was certainly a challenge, but fortunately there was a short turn around.""

Nov. 14, 2015: Hillary Rodham Clinton shakes hands with Martin O'Malley after a Democratic presidential primary debate in Des Moines, Iowa. (AP)


Hillary Clinton invoked the 9/11 terror attacks as she defended herself against complaints about her Wall Street donations during Saturday night’s debate, a response that drew bipartisan criticism.
The former New York senator made the reference after Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders repeatedly criticized her for taking money from the financial sector and questioned whether she had the independence to overhaul the industry.
“I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked,” Clinton pointed out. “Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York.”
Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus slammed Clinton for the comments after the debate in Des Moines ended.
“[I]n a new low, Hillary Clinton shamefully hid behind the 9/11 terrorist attacks in a bizarre attempt to deflect attention from her ties to her wealthy donors,” he said in a statement.

The backlash also surfaced during the CBS-hosted debate itself. Shortly after Clinton made the remarks, the moderators cited social media reaction, including a tweet saying she had invoked 9/11 to justify Wall Street donations.
“Well, I'm sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild,” Clinton said.
Sanders acknowledged she was the senator from New York at the time and did help rebuild. But he also said Wall Street has too much power.
Earlier, he suggested Clinton would not be able to overhaul the industry given its support for her.
“Let's not be naive about it. Why …has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?” he said. “You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.”
Even Clinton’s former campaign manager, Patti Solis Doyle, questioned the 9/11 reference following the debate.
“I do think that the 9/11 reference was probably better used when she was talking about terrorism. She was the senator when the 9/11 attacks happened. She was the senator when we needed to rebuild that city. And it would have been more powerful talking about terrorism,” she said on CNN.

" (CNN)CNN Opinion asked a range of contributors for their take on the second Democratic presidential debate held at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. Who were the winner and loser? The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors.

This debate was more difficult for Hillary Clinton than was expected. Though she had opportunities to highlight her extensive experience and leadership skills, she was still thrown on the defense in two pivotal areas. 
On foreign policy, in the aftermath of Paris, she was forced to defend the record of the Obama administration in Syria and saw how this issue -- foreign policy -- could be turned against her. This, more than the vote in Iraq, will be a challenge.
Domestic policy also remained a concern as Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley hit harder in her ties to Wall Street and more centrist views on some economic issues. 
Clinton still exits from the debate as the most formidable candidate in the group and the one best positioned to defeat the GOP. O'Malley continues to struggle gaining any traction and Sanders still seems too left for the party.
But the debate was a warning. It brought out some of the questions that Clinton will face in the coming months. In the coming weeks, she will need to provide stronger answers if she wants a smooth victory in the primaries and the general election. 
Winner: No clear winner.
Loser: Martin O'Malley. 
Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of ""The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society"" and co-editor of a new book, ""Medicare and Medicaid at 50: America's Entitlement Programs in the Age of Affordable Care."" 

The good news for Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley was that they shared a victory in this debate by criticizing Hillary Clinton directly and to her face, pushing back against the notion that Clinton's nomination is inevitable. 
Not if Sanders and O'Malley have anything to say about it.
When asked about the role of Wall Street, Sanders, who has criticized the influence of big-money donors in American politics, said Clinton's many backers from financial corporations are seeking to curry favor with her.
""Maybe they're dumb, and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so,"" Sanders said of Clinton's Wall Street donors. ""Why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something, everybody knows it.""
Clinton, clearly stung by the statement, pointed out that Sanders ""has basically used his answer to impugn my integrity."" At issue was a call by Sanders and O'Malley to tighten regulatory controls over banking institutions by reviving elements of the now-defunct Glass-Steagall Act.  
Clinton dismissed her critics: ""My proposal is tougher, more comprehensive and more effective,"" she said. But O'Malley called her ideas ""weak tea"" and the cheers Sanders got by taking her on suggest a sizable portion of Democrats want the next president to control Wall Street rather than the other way around. 
The Sanders-O'Malley duo also scored points by pushing for a $15 minimum wage, considerably higher than the $12 Clinton advocates. The recent nationwide strikes and demonstrations in favor of a $15 minimum wage -- which translates into an annual full-time salary of $31,000 -- show that Sanders and O'Malley are riding a powerful grassroots wave. 
If Clinton sticks to her $12 proposal, she should expect more verbal slugfests with her opponents -- and a Democratic base that may jump off the Clinton bandwagon if she doesn't move in a more liberal direction.

A day after ISIS terrorized Paris in multiple coordinated attacks with guns and suicide bombs, killing over 100 and injuring hundreds more, Democrat frontrunner Hillary Clinton left doubts she's up to the task to protect America. 
In opening questions on foreign policy during the CBS-moderated debate, Clinton danced around her lack of accomplishments as secretary of state under President Barack Obama. When asked about Obama's Syria policy, Clinton said she disagreed with Obama's strategy from the start and warned him if the United States didn't intervene in Syria, our enemies would fill the void.  
Clinton said the ""Middle East is a complicated region"" and ""the arch of instability."" Americans don't vote for a president to tell them what they already know. Clinton's textbook responses to foreign policy questions were rote. More disturbing was she couldn't point to any accomplishments as secretary of state other than advising Obama on Osama bin Laden's capture. Libya, Syria, Egypt and Russia all fell apart under her tenure. If elected president, Clinton didn't convince voters she would do anything differently or make America safer, which brings us to terrorism.
When asked if she would declare war against Islam like President Francois Hollande has, Clinton replied no. ""We're not at war with Islam. We're not at war with Muslims.""  Yet, that's just the problem. Islam is at war with America and the world and we need a president who will finally acknowledges this, not one who shrinks from this challenge. Obama hasn't. In an interview with ""Good Morning America"" that aired the day of the Paris attack, Obama said ISIS had been contained.
Over the last four years since the civil war unraveled in Syria, ISIS has taken root there, training Muslims from around the world to be jihadists. France has a large population of Muslim nationals, many of whom have freely entered the country. 
America, like Germany and France, have welcomed thousands of Syrian refugees. It won't be long before what happened in Paris makes it's way to our homeland. During the second Democrat debate, Hillary Clinton revealed her biggest strength may be her biggest weakness -- her foreign policy experience.

On a very tough night to talk politics, it seemed all three candidates were a little off their game.
Hillary Clinton was well-positioned coming in to look tough -- and presidential -- on terrorism. But she didn't anticipate Martin O'Malley lurching to her right. ""It is America's fight,"" he corrected her, ""but not solely America's fight."" With Bernie Sanders attacking from the left, she was suddenly stuck in the middle, playing defense. 
On the discussion regarding banks and campaign finance, however, Sanders should have had the natural upper hand, but he couldn't land a punch. Clinton won the issue in the room. Sanders also might be the first Democrat to acknowledge raising the minimum wage will have some negative repercussions, which I think will come back to haunt him.
O'Malley had some blunders as well. He floated a frightening 70% tax rate on the wealthy, unprompted. He walked into a critique from Sanders on the safety of Baltimore, the city he ran as mayor. 
All told, they each had some unexpected highlights and some surprising misses. When Clinton loses on foreign policy but wins on the banks, you know it's a weird night.
S.E. Cupp is the author of ""Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media's Attack on Christianity,"" co-author of ""Why You're Wrong About the Right"" and a columnist at the New York Daily News.  

Two moments in tonight's debate clarified why Bernie Sanders won't assume the role of frontrunner any time soon.  In the first, Sanders reiterated his noble, but politically disastrous, appeal that we all stop talking about Hillary Clinton's (damn) emails.  It's the high road, for sure.  But by extricating her from a scandal that had bedeviled her campaign for months, Sanders has ceded the space needed for Clinton to take flight.
The second moment illustrates the difficulty Sanders has faced in winning over African Americans.  When asked about Black Lives Matter, Sanders rattled off a bunch of standard statistics about incarceration and unemployment rates. Clinton, by contrast, acknowledged the profound pain that black mothers feel when they lose their children to violence, and she then paid tribute -- by name -- to some of the young men who have lost their lives to police violence.
Winner: Hillary Clinton. She came across as shrewd, measured, and worldly.  Nothing about the debate tonight changed the fundamental dynamics of this race. 
Most improved: Martin O'Malley.  He spoke fluidly and forcefully about all manner of issues. He made a showing tonight; it just won't make much of a difference.
Lastly, a note on format.  With just a handful of Democratic contenders left in the race for president, the conversation in tonight's debate sank reasonably deep into policy details. The kinds of zingers and gaffes that separate winners from losers on a stage of ten just don't count for nearly as much on a stage of three.  May the Republicans take notice and winnow their ranks soon.

Once again, Democrats proved that they are the adults in this race by having a civilized, high-minded and respectful debate about the important issues facing our country.  They also demonstrated they are all better equipped to lead the nation going into the 21st century as we face unprecedented threats from abroad and an economy that needs continued Democratic leadership to fully recover and give middle class voters all the tools they need to succeed.
There were fireworks as both Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley tried to take the fight to Hillary Clinton, specifically on her Iraq vote and her connections to Wall Street.  She swatted away the criticisms with ease, with facts, and demonstrated she is best suited to lead the country as president and commander in chief. 
On foreign policy, her knowledge of the issues, her grasp of the nuances involved in global diplomacy and her determination to implement unparalleled American leadership to defeat ISIS and radical extremist jihadists in the Middle East, put her head and shoulders above the rest, both in the Democratic field as well as all Republicans vying for the presidency. 
On economic and domestic issues, Clinton underscored differences with Sanders and O'Malley, again showing important nuances on positions such as the minimum wage, college affordability and gun control, showing her grasp of details and the ""weeds"" of these complex issues.  She showed her policies would put middle class families first while ensuring our economy can absorb them without disruption. 
O'Malley had a great debate, showing his passionate progressive positions, at times taking the critique to both of his opponents, but mostly agreeing with them on key issues.  While his resume is impressive and he has many accomplishments to show as Maryland governor, unfortunately, he was not able to have a sufficient breakout moment that will enable him to climb out of the single digits in the polls. 
Sanders continued to show his passionate commitment to liberal positions, focusing on climate change and income inequality, both of which are tremendously important to the progressive base.  But his knowledge of foreign policy and issues going on in the Middle East came up wanting and did not inspire broad-based trust needed to be elected as commander In chief.
As an issue that is front and center, immigration brought out the best in all of the Democratic candidates -- an easy feat given the contrast with the ridiculous, unworkable, unjust and unelectable positions that are held by most Republicans. 
Importantly, Clinton was the first one to contrast all the Democrats with the Republicans and was the only one to defend President Obama's record.  A brilliant and important move to excite and mobilize the Democratic base.
Overall, Clinton outshined her Democratic opponents, showing her proposals would pay for the opportunities and the level playing field that would help create more good paying jobs and expand economic growth for those who have been left behind.  And both Sanders and O'Malley took a definitive back seat to Clinton when it came to foreign policy, defense of the homeland and what it takes to confront the challenges we face, tragically demonstrated by last night's Paris attacks.

"Ames, Iowa (CNN)Former President Bill Clinton joined Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail Sunday in Ames, Iowa, telling CNN after the event that attacks tying his wife to Wall Street are ""a stretch.""
The couple traveled to Iowa together on Saturday for the second Democratic debate in Des Moines, where challengers Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley knocked Clinton for what they said were close ties to Wall Street and big banks.
Asked about those attack lines, the former president shook his head as he signed an autograph.
""It is a stretch,"" Bill Clinton said. ""Those of us who were there know that.""
At the debate, Sanders said Clinton was tied to Wall Street because some of her biggest lifetime contributors come from employees of the nation's biggest financial institutions. 
""They expect to get something. Everybody knows that,"" Sanders said.
Sanders' campaign also blasted out a graph to reporters during the debate that showed some of the former secretary of state's top donors came from Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
Clinton responded on Saturday night by arguing that her Wall Street plan was ""tougher, more effective and more comprehensive"" the others.
Bill Clinton, who stayed on stage to watch his wife speak at a Central Iowa Democrats annual barbecue, said he thought Hillary Clinton did ""fine"" on debate night.
""It is painful time for the whole world in the aftermath to what happened in Paris,"" Bill Clinton said on the terrorist attack. ""The most important thing that happened was that our party said we are with them and we are going to work together to solve this problem and we can only solve it by working together.""
The former president did not respond to questions about Hillary Clinton's assertion that one of the reasons she has received millions of dollars in donations from Wall Street is because she ""represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked.""
O'Malley, however, was happy to hit Clinton on the issue after his speech to the same Democratic barbecue in Ames.
""Last night in the debate, Secretary Clinton, to try to mask her proximity to Wall Street, the huge amount of dollars and contributions she has received  personally from the major banks of Wall Street, sadly invoked 9/11 to try to mask that,"" he said. ""Look, she doesn't have to mask that, it is what it is.""

" (AP) â The bloody attacks in Paris are putting the Syrian refugee crisis at center stage in U.S. politics as migrants from that war-torn country surge toward the West and security concerns rise.
GOP presidential contender Marco Rubio on Sunday said the United States should no longer accept Syrian refugees because it's impossible to know whether they have links to Islamic militants â an apparent shift from earlier statements in which he left open the prospects of migrants being admitted with proper vetting.
""It's not that we don't want to, it's that we can't,"" Rubio said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week.""  ""Because there's no way to background check someone that's coming from Syria.  Who do you call and do a background check on them?""
The question of admitting Syrian refugees has for months been part of the national security discussion among 2016 candidates that cuts to the heart of the American identity as a refuge. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush on Sunday told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that the U.S. should admit Syrian Christians, after proper vetting. Other Republican candidates have called for a ban on allowing Syrians into the U.S. All three Democratic presidential candidates have said they would admit Syrians but only after thorough background checks.
But Friday night's mass killings in Paris, which left at least 129 people dead, offered evidence that may have backed up what many, including Rubio, had been warning: People with secret ties to Islamic militants could flow across borders as part of waves of refugees.
Authorities said a Syrian passport found near one of the Paris attackers that had been registered last month and traveled through three countries along a busy migrant corridor known for lax controls. It was not clear whether the document was real or forged. Officials on Sunday were still trying to identify people involved in the conspiracy. They said as many as three of the seven suicide bombers who died in the attacks were French citizens.
A spokesman for President Barack Obama said Sunday that the administration is moving forward with its plan to thoroughly vet and admit as many as 10,000 Syrian refugees.
""What we need to be able to do frankly is sort out that foreign fighter flow, those who have gone into Syria and come out and want to launch attacks or those people who have connections with ISIL in Syria,""  Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said on Fox News Sunday. ""At the same time, we have to recognize there's tragic victims of this conflict, there are women, and children, orphans of this war and I think we need to do our part, along with our allies, to provide them a safe haven.""
The Paris attacks have elevated national security in the presidential contest. In Saturday night's Democratic presidential debate, which began with a moment of silence for the Paris victims, all three candidates â former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley â said the U.S. should admit far more than the 10,000 Syrians to which Obama has committed, but only with proper screening.
Rubio on Sunday said that was impossible.
""You can't pick up the phone and call Syria, and that's one of the reasons why I said we won't be able to take more refugees,"" Rubio said on ABC.
That is a switch from Rubio's other statements this fall, in which he voiced skepticism about proper vetting but still left the door open to admitting refugees.  In September, he told Boston Herald radio: ""We've always been a country that's been willing to accept people who have been displaced. And I would be open to that if it can do it in a way that allows us to ensure that among them are not infiltrated, people who are part of a terrorist organization.""
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, meanwhile, said Sunday that the U.S. has a responsibility to ""help with refugees after proper screening.""
""And I think or focus out to be on the Christians who have no place in Syria anymore,"" he added in NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ''They're being beheaded, they're being executed by both sides.  And I think we have a responsibility to help.""

"Republican presidential candidates have criticized Democratic White House hopeful Hillary Clinton for decliningÂ to use term such as âradical Islam” and “Islamic terrorism”Â to describe the extremists who have unleashed a string of terrorist attacks on Western targets recently.
Asked at the second Democratic debate on Saturday night whether the U.S. was âat war with radical Islam,â Ms. Clinton drew a distinction between the worldâs 1.6 billion Muslims and those who commit acts of violent extremism.
âI donât think weâre at war with Islam. I donât think weâre at war with all Muslims,â she said. âI think weâre at war with jihadists. We are at war with violent extremism. We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression, and yes, we are at war with those people, but I donât want us to be painting with too broad a brush.â
She recounted admiringly former president George W. Bushâs call forÂ tolerance in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
âIslam is peace,â Mr. Bush said in a speech at the Islamic Center of Washington, D.C. the week after the attacks.
Mrs. Clinton’sÂ answer prompted reproach from Republicans who insisted she use the phrase, âradical Islam.â
Former Arkansas governor and Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee on Twitter mocked Democrats, writing âSay it with me: âIslamic Terrorism.ââ Carly Fiorina wrote on Twitter that unlike Hillary Clinton, she would use the phrase âIslamic terrorism.â
You’re all grown up now. You can do it. Three words. Ten syllables. Say it with me: “Radical Islamic terrorism.” #DemDebate
â Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) November 15, 2015

We need a President who will see and speak and act on the truth…Hillary Clinton will not call this Islamic terrorism. I will.
â Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) November 15, 2015

On Sunday morning, Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who has put an aggressive foreign policy at the center of his presidential campaign, called the fight against terrorism âa clash of civilizationsâ and said he was baffled by Ms. Clintonâs reluctance to use the term âradical Islam.â
âI donât understand it. That would be like saying we werenât at war with Nazis, because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but werenât violent themselves,â he said. âWe are at war with radical Islam, with an interpretation of Islam by a significant number of people around the world, who they believe now justifies them in killing those who donât agree with their ideology.â
And on CNN on Sunday morning, Former Florida governor and Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said, âI know what Islamic terrorism is. This is not a question of religion. This is a political ideology that has co-opted a religion. And I think it’s more than acceptable just to call it for what it is and then organize an effort to destroy it.â
He also described the fight against terrorism as âa fight for Western civilization.â
About 1% of the U.S. population are Muslims, according to the Pew Research Center.Â About 26% are evangelical Protestants, a group who hold considerably influence among the GOP primary electorate in the early nominating states of Iowa and South Carolina.

" (AP) â A day after deadly terrorist attacks in Paris, Hillary Rodham Clinton cast herself as the strongest U.S. commander in chief in an uncertain world, even as she found herself forced to defend the Obama administration's response to the rise of the Islamic State militants.
""This election is not only about electing a president, it's also about choosing our next commander in chief,"" said Clinton, in her opening remarks. ""All of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.""
But she nearly immediately faced criticism of her own record, when Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders traced the current instability in the region to the Senate vote â including Clinton's â to authorize military action in Iraq in 2002. He said that U.S. invasion ""unraveled the region.""
Clinton fought back, saying terrorism has been erupting for decades, specifically mentioning the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. She said the recent unrest in Libya and other parts of the Middle East was symptomatic of an ""arc of instability from North Africa to Afghanistan.""
She rejected the idea that she and the rest of the administration underestimated the growing threat of the Islamic State.
The early dispute revealed a foreign policy split within the Democratic Party, with Sanders playing to the anti-war activists who boosted then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama to victory in 2008.
Sanders argued for a far more hands-off approach, advocating for Muslim countries to lead the fight and arguing that the war against Islamic State militants is about the ""soul of Islam.""
Clinton has a history of advocating for more robust involvement across the globe â both as a presidential candidate eight years ago and as Barack Obama's secretary of state. In recent weeks, she has advocated for a more aggressive U.S. role in the Syrian conflict, calling for a no-fly zone over the area, a move the Obama administration opposes.
The candidates were meeting in the shadow of the Paris attacks that killed at least 129 and wounded at least 352 people.
The debate began with a solemn tone, with a moment of silence followed by previously unplanned foreign policy questions.
All the candidates denounced the attacks, the first time the Democratic field spoke about the incidents.
The Republican presidential candidates condemned the Paris attacks earlier in the day, coupled with sharp criticism for Obama and his former secretary of state, Clinton.
Former technology executive Carly Fiorina said she was angry that Obama and Clinton declared victory in Iraq and ""abandoned all of our hard-won gains for political expediency."" Donald Trump, the celebrity businessman who leads many GOP polls, said the U.S. should be far more aggressive against the Islamic State and would be ""insane"" to accept any refugees from Syria.
Foreign relations is an area where Clinton, as a former secretary of state, is in the strongest position to talk about the attacks and the U.S. effort to dismantle the Islamic State group. But she is vulnerable, too, her tenure tied to that of Obama, who's struggled to contain the threat from Islamic militants in Syria and associated terror attacks across the globe.
Since the party's first debate a month ago, Clinton has helped build a lead in the early voting states, an uptick that has come amid other signs the party is coalescing behind her. An Associated Press survey of superdelegates published Friday found that half of the Democratic insiders are publicly backing Clinton.

" (AP) â A day after deadly terrorist attacks in Paris, Hillary Rodham Clinton cast herself as the country's strongest commander in chief in a scary world, even as she defended her own role in the rise of Islamic militants.
""This election is not only about electing a president, it's also about choosing our next commander in chief,"" Clinton declared Saturday night in the Democrats' second debate of the presidential campaign. ""All of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.""
Amid the backdrop of global anxiety, Clinton found herself fending off questions about not only her foreign policy record but her economic ties, with both Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley painting the former senator from New York as a lackey for Wall Street and corporate interests.
""Let's not be naive about it,"" said Sanders, noting that Clinton collected millions in campaign donations from Wall Street bankers. ""They expect to get something. Everybody knows that.""
The barbs marked a far more aggressive shift in a primary race that has been notable in part for its civility compared to the Republican contest.
Since the Democrats' first debate a month ago, Clinton has built a lead in the early voting states, gains that have come amid other signs the party is coalescing behind her. But the nomination fight is far from over.
On Saturday night, Clinton faced criticism of her national security record, when Sanders traced the current instability in the Middle East to the U.S. Senate's vote â including Clinton's â to authorize military action in Iraq in 2002. He said that U.S. invasion ""unraveled the region.""
The former secretary of state fought back, saying terrorism has been erupting for decades. She rejected the idea that she and the rest of the Obama administration underestimated the growing threat of the Islamic State group.
The back-and-forth revealed a foreign policy split within the Democratic Party, with Sanders playing to the anti-war activists who boosted then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama to the presidential nomination in 2008.
Sanders argued for a far more hands-off approach, advocating for Muslim countries to lead the fight and declaring that the war against Islamic State militants is about the ""soul of Islam.""
Clinton has a history of advocating for more robust involvement across the globe â both as a presidential candidate eight years ago and as Obama's secretary of state. In recent weeks, she has called for a more aggressive U.S. role in the Syrian conflict, including a no-fly zone over the area, a move the Obama administration opposes.
The debate began with a moment of silence followed by the previously unplanned foreign policy questions. All the candidates denounced the attacks, but they gave some fodder to their Republican rivals who coupled condemnation of the Paris attacks with sharp criticism for Obama and Clinton.
All three Democrats criticized the term ""radical Islam"" used by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and other Republican candidates as unnecessarily offensive to American Muslims.
""We are at war with violent extremism, we are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression,"" said Clinton. ""I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.""
GOP candidates immediately seized on the remarks. ""Yes, we are at war with radical Islamic terrorism,"" tweeted former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.
The debate pivoted to economic issues, in a conversation that revealed how Sanders' liberal message has helped shift the party to the left on some economic issues.
All three agreed that wealthy citizens and corporations should pay more in taxes to benefit the middle class. They tangled over how high to increase the minimum wage, with Clinton backing a $12-per-hour federal floor while Sanders and O'Malley said $15 an hour. And they fought over the degree to which they would curtail large financial institutions, with Sanders describing Wall Street's business model as ""greed and fraud"" â a startling judgment for a major presidential candidate.
""I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,"" joked Sanders, saying the 1950s-era president backed a 90 percent marginal tax rate.
Clinton defended her relationship with Wall Street, citing her work in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but her statement met with blowback from Republicans who accused her of politicizing the terrorist assaults.
While Clinton is wary of alienating Sanders backers whose support she'll need should she win the nomination, she did take a few shots. She attempted to cast some of Sanders' major proposals, including a single-payer health care system and free college, as politically unrealistic.
""The revolution never came,"" she said, in a knock on his call for a ""political revolution.""
Sanders may have inadvertently helped her in the first debate, when he seemed to dismiss the controversy over her use of a private email account and server by saying Americans are tired of hearing about her ""damn emails.""
Saturday night, Sanders declined once again to attack: ""I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email,"" he said.
""I agree completely,"" said Clinton, with a laugh.

"Are we heading back to the 1960s, when cities and campuses spiraled into chaos and conservatives won elections by demanding law and order? In a period that has seen riots over police conduct in Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore, attacks on police officers in New York and other cities, and now student protests, it sometimes feels that way.
Last week, several Republican candidates sounded as if they were reviving the tough justice theme that helped Ronald Reagan and Richard M. Nixon rise to power almost half a century ago. Donald Trump derided university presidents who bow to student demands as “weak, ineffective people,” and said he wouldn't have quit if he had been in charge at the University of Missouri. Ben Carson warned that if society coddles students, “We will move much further toward anarchy than anybody can imagine.” And Chris Christie said it was all President Obama's fault: “This is a product of the president's own unwillingness and inability to bring people together.”
In another flashback to the 1960s, Democrats lined up on the other side, signaling that their sympathies lay with the students. “It's time to address structural racism on college campuses,” Bernie Sanders tweeted. Hillary Rodham Clinton sent a similar message through an aide. And White House spokesman Josh Earnest lauded the Missouri students for their “commitment to fighting hate and intolerance.” Their success, he said, reinforced Obama's view “that a few people speaking up and speaking out can have a profound impact.”
There was an unmistakable echo in that micro-debate of the argument after the 2014 unrest in Ferguson, where the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager prompted weeks of angry demonstrations; and the later debate over Black Lives Matter, the movement to curb law enforcement excesses. In all three cases, there has been an impulse toward polarization, reducing the question to: Which side are you on?
A few Republicans, notably Christie and Ted Cruz, have charged that BLM is calling for the murder of police officers. (A few demonstrators have done so, but they've been disavowed by the movement's leaders.)
“The president encourages this lawlessness,” Christie added last month. (The president has condemned that lawlessness several times, actually, even as he has also condemned excessive police 
violence.)
On the other side, Sanders found himself shouted down by demonstrators when he wasn't emphatic enough in endorsing BLM. (He has made amends since.)
The implicit message: You can declare that black lives matter, or that police lives matter — but you don't have the option of believing both those things.
Except — and here's where things get interesting — most candidates do believe both those things. If you listen closely and dig beneath the sound bites, you'll find that things have changed since the 20th century, after all.

Among Republicans, I highlighted the more ferocious voices, but others have been more restrained. Even the ones I quoted, Trump, Carson and Christie, aren't campaigning principally on law and order. They've mostly answered questions thrown at them by reporters, whose job includes goading candidates into making headlines.
Most of the Republican candidates have noticed that crime is down, prisons are overcrowded and the cost of incarcerating nonviolent criminals — mostly drug offenders — has become an undue burden. Several have endorsed various brands of criminal justice reform: Rand Paul, most notably, but also Cruz and Christie and Jeb Bush. And one or two have even spoken up to say, in effect, that BLM has a point — although they don't endorse the group's tactics.
“This is a legitimate issue,” Marco Rubio said in August. “It is a fact that in the African American community around this country there has been, for a number of years now, a growing resentment toward the way law enforcement and the criminal justice system interacts with the community. It is particularly endemic among young African American males … [who] have a much higher chance of interacting with criminal justice than higher education. We do need to face this. It is a serious problem.”
Rubio won't appreciate the comparison, but that wasn't too far from what Clinton said in April.
“There is something profoundly wrong when African American men are still far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and sentenced to longer prison terms than are meted out to their white counterparts,” she said in April. It is also wrong, she added, when “brave police officers are attacked in the line of duty.”
Despite those knee-jerk reactions to campus upheavals, most Republicans seem to have left the lock 'em up era behind. And so have Democrats; Clinton's position is a shift from the tough-on-crime stance that helped one Bill Clinton get elected in 1992. (Bill Clinton, for his part, was trying to distance himself from the allegedly soft-on-crime Democrats of the 1960s.)
It's rare in an election year that candidates are resisting the temptation to polarize — but let's give credit where credit is due. Maybe, in this instance, Carson got it right. “We have people who get in their respective corners and demonize each other, but there's no conversation,” he said recently. “If you ask people to put on the record what their gripes are and what their solutions are, then perhaps they can see that maybe they are not so far apart.”
