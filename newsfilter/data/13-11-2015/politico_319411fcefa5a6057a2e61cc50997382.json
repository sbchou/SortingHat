You don't cure these people. You don't cure a child molester. There's no cure for it. Pathological, there's no cure for that.\"\nCarson has been upfront about bursts of violent behavior in the past. In \"Gifted Hands,\" Carson\u2019s autobiography published in the late 1990s, he wrote that his behavior is due to a \u201cpathological temper,\u201d which made headlines recently in relation to an anecdote from Carson\u2019s youth about an attempt to stab a friend. \n\n\n\n            By \nEliza Collins\n\nTrump has taken issue this week with one specific passage in which Carson wrote, \"I had what I only can label a pathological temper \u2014 a disease \u2014 and this sickness controlled me, making me totally irrational.\" \nOn Thursday, Trump reiterated that he was not adding anything new to the conversation separate from what Carson already penned. \n\"I'm not bringing up anything that's not in his book,\" he said, and added, \u201cI'm not saying anything other than pathological is a very serious disease.
