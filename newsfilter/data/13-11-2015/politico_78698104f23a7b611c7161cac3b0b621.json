The Department of the Army will then take action as appropriate,\" Carter added. \"I expect the highest possible standards of conduct from the men and women in this department particularly from those serving in the most senior positions. There is no exception.\"\nLewis, a three-star general, previously served as Carter's top military aide when Carter served as deputy defense secretary from 2011 to 2013. Lewis subsequently served as the Army's chief spokesman before returning to Carter's side when he took over as defense secretary earlier this year.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Ash Carter fires three-star general for &apos;allegations of misconduct&apos;", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/ash-carter-fires-three-star-general-for-allegations-of-misconduct-215810", "topics": ["trade"], "people": ["Ash Carter", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Elena Schneider", "Nick Gass", "Richard Shelby", "Steven Shepard", "Jeremy Herb", "Jenny Hopkinson", "Kevin Robillard", "Brian Mahoney", "Caitlin Emma", "Nahal Toosi", "Josh Gerstein", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Rich Lowry", "Bryan Bender", "Bernie Becker", "Jennifer Scholtes", "John Shinkle", "Neera Tanden", "Noah Weiland", "Alex Isenstadt", "Donald Trump", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Jeff Greenfield", "Eric Wolff", "David Vitter", "Tim Starks", "Zachary Warmbrodt", "Jason Kander", "Tony Romm", "Daniel Strauss", "Doug Palmer", "Rick Reed", "Brianna Ehley", "Darren Goode", "Darius Tahir", "Ben Carson", "Paul Ryan"], "orgs": ["Congress", "Swift Boat", "UFCW", "NAFTA", "Medal of Honor", "U.N.", "Yale University", "Drake University", "Army", "AT&T", "Pentagon", "GOP", "Senate Armed Services Committee", "WTO"], "election_confidence": 0.7924924321923253, "authors": [{"author_id": 30897, "fullname": "darren goode", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-12 23:14:26", "org": "politico", "article_id": "78698104f23a7b611c7161cac3b0b621", "date_access": "2015-11-12 23:46:26.681072"}
