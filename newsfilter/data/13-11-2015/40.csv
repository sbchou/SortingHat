"Hillary Clinton should have seen that Wall Street shot coming. Instead, she compounded the damage.

The former secretary of state was off to a sound outing in Saturday night’s debate against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland. Friday’s terrorist attacks in Paris dominated at first, allowing her to highlight her superior experience in world affairs. But it was those attacks that made her badly muffed response to questions about her fealty to Wall Street all the more jarring. Here’s the exchange:

Mr. Sanders: “I have never heard a candidate, never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military-industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me. I’m going to be independent. Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something. Everybody knows that. Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate. We are relying on small campaign donors, 750,000 of them, 30 bucks apiece. That’s who I’m indebted to.”

Mrs. Clinton: “Well John, wait a minute. Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impugn my integrity. Let’s be frank here.”

Mr. Sanders: “No, I have not.”

Mrs. Clinton: “Oh, wait a minute, senator. You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small. And I’m very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent. So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked. Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.”

Predictably, Twitter exploded with demands to know what campaign donations from big banks had to do with New York’s recovery from 9/11.

Answer: little to nothing. Since 2001, she and Bill Clinton have earned more than $125 million for speeches, many of the most lucrative made before financial groups.

That does not begin to account for the millions of dollars given directly to her campaign, and to political action committees backing her. Nearly 15 years after the 2001 attacks, Mrs. Clinton was earning more than $200,000 for a 20-minute speech. Most of those took place behind guarded doors. But one can guess that she and the financial executives were not still talking about 9/11.

Middle-class Americans associate Wall Street with the 2008 meltdown of the economy that cost so many their homes and savings. In the debate Mrs. Clinton repeatedly referred to her plan for reining in banks, but offered precious few specifics. This is what happens when Hillary Clinton the candidate gets complacent. The debate moderator, John Dickerson, had even tipped her off before a commercial break that the next topic was Wall Street.

Her effort to tug on Americans’ heartstrings instead of explaining her Wall Street ties — on a day that the scars of 9/11 were exposed anew — was at best botched rhetoric. At worst it was the type of cynical move that Mrs. Clinton would have condemned in Republicans. She should make a fast, thorough effort to explain herself by providing a detailed plan for how she would promote measures protecting middle-class Americans from another financial crisis.",THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"After a good start on national security and terrorism, Hillary Clinton flubbed legitimate questions about her ties to Wall Street on Saturday.",Hillary Clinton Botches Wall Street Questions,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/opinion/hillary-clinton-botches-wall-street-questions.html,[u'economy'],"[u'Bill Clinton', u'Bernie Sanders', u'John Dickerson', u'Hillary Clinton', u""Martin O'Malley""]",nyt,0.8708710278871227,"[{u'author_id': 697, u'fullname': u'the editorial board', u'primary_org': u'nyt'}]",2015-11-15 21:26:52,[],ac1a1d01775534781b522dfa3ead3ef1,2015-11-15 21:45:54.898058

After Bernie Sanders challenged Hillary Clinton's independence from the influence of her corporate donors, she offered a defense during Saturday night's debate — and included her work as a New York senator after September 11th.
""Why, over her political career has Wall Street been a major — the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?"" Sanders asked onstage after calling her financial policy package not good enough. ""You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.""
Clinton, offered the chance to respond, first cited the number of small donors to her presidential campaign, and then that the majority of them are women.
Then, she turned to 9/11.
""So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked,"" she said. ""Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is."" 
""I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild,"" she continued. ""That was good for New York. It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.""

SANDERS: Here's the story: I mean, you know, let's not be naive about it. Why do — why, over her political career has Wall Street been a major — the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton? You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.
Here is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street. It ain't complicated. You have six financial institutions today that have assets of 56%, equivalent to 56% of the GDP In America. They issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages.
If Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, were alive today, you know what he'd say? ""Break them up."" Reestablish Glass-Steagall. And Teddy Roosevelt is right. That is the issue. Now I am the only candidate up here that doesn't have a super PAC. I am not asking Wall Street or the billionaires for money. I will break up these banks. Support community banks and credit unions. That's the future of banking in America.
DICKERSON: Great follow up because you — and Secretary Clinton, you will get a chance to respond. You said they know what they're going to get. What are they going to get?
SANDERS: I have never heard a candidate never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me. I'm going to be independent. Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? they expect to get something. Everybody knows that. Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate. We are relying on small campaign donors, 750,000 of them, 30 bucks a piece. That's who I'm indebted to.
CLINTON: Well, John, wait a minute. Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impune my integrity. Let's be frank here.
SANDERS: No, I have not. 
CLINTON: Oh, wait a minute, senator. You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small. And I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60%
So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked. Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.
So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal. Reinstating Glass-Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough. My proposal is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive because I go after all of Wall Street not just the big banks.

Hillary Clinton faced tough criticism Saturday night from her Democratic rivals over everything from her Middle East policies to her swaying stance on gun control to her Wall Street ties, at a debate that saw both Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley step up their attacks on the party’s front-runner.
The former secretary of state was put on the defensive almost immediately, as she was challenged by her rivals -- and the moderator -- over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability. Vermont Sen. Sanders ripped her support for “regime change.”  
But while the Paris terror attacks the night before shifted the early presidential debate focus to national security, the candidates sparred aggressively in the latter half over domestic issues – especially financial industry reform and Clinton’s Wall Street support.
Former Maryland Gov. O’Malley called her the “candidate of Wall Street.”
Asked about her hefty Wall Street-backed speaking fees and donations, Clinton defended her independence in being able to pursue financial industry reform.

But Sanders shot back, “Not good enough.”
“Let's not be naive about it. Why …has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?” he said. “You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.”
He and O’Malley, unlike Clinton, both want to re-instate a Depression-era banking law known as Glass-Steagall – and they both criticized Clinton’s Wall Street plans as not going far enough. 
O’Malley called it “weak tea.”
In an eyebrow-raising moment, Clinton countered Sanders’ criticism of her Wall Street donations by saying that as New York senator, she helped “rebuild” Wall Street and downtown Manhattan after 9/11.
Clinton was later asked about social media reaction claiming she had invoked 9/11 to justify financial industry donations; Clinton said she’s sorry that anyone had that “impression.”
Meanwhile, she said she doesn’t think her rivals’ financial industry plans – particularly to reinstate the Depression-era law that separated investment and commercial banking – would get the job done.
“I'm all about making sure we actually get results,” Clinton said.
The debate in Des Moines, Iowa, came in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which thrust the issues of national security and foreign policy back to the center of the 2016 campaign. The format of the debate – hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register -- was changed to focus anew on those issues in the beginning.
Clinton tried to highlight her deep experience in foreign policy issues from the outset.
“This election is not only about electing a president. It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief,” she said.
But, citing the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa, Clinton’s rivals soon turned to her record as U.S. senator and later as secretary of state to question her judgment in foreign policy matters.
O’Malley appeared to criticize her support for toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.
He said America’s role is not to roam the world “looking for new dictators to topple.” He said it is also important to understand “secondary and third consequences” that come after removing a “single dictator.” O’Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a “mess.”
Clinton defended her support for ousting Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a “genocide” and America’s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support. And to O’Malley’s critique, she said, “I don’t think you can paint with a broad brush” in an “incredibly complicated region of the world.”
Sanders, meanwhile, referenced Clinton’s Senate vote for the use of force in Iraq and said the “disastrous invasion” led “to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.” The senator also claimed that “climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.”
Clinton again called her Iraq war vote a “mistake,” but disputed that the war is the only driver of modern terrorism.
She and O’Malley briefly sparred over America’s role in fighting ISIS. After Clinton said it “cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential,” O’Malley said, “This actually is America’s fight,” though not “solely” America’s fight.
Sanders staked out a different position in saying it is the nations in the region that “have to get their hands dirty.”
“Those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort,” he said.
The candidates declined to categorize the threat itself as “radical Islam.” Asked about that categorization, Clinton said only, “I don’t think we’re at war with Islam.”
All the candidates on stage condemned the Paris terror attacks and vowed to take on the threat of terror.
“It cannot be contained. It must be defeated,” Clinton said of ISIS, appearing to distance herself from President Obama, who hours before the Paris attacks claimed ISIS was “contained.”
The attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said. It brought the issue of terrorism to the forefront of both party’s presidential primary races. Ostensibly, it is an area where Clinton enters with the thickest resume – but also one that could, as the debate showed, prove problematic given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable nations like Libya and Syria.
While the tragedy hung over the debate, the candidates were able to tackle of range of domestic issues including wages and immigration.
O’Malley landed virtually the only shot of the night against Republican candidate Donald Trump, a favorite target of the Democrats, by calling him an “immigrant-bashing carnival barker.” The Democratic candidates generally agree on the call for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the country.
Sanders, meanwhile, continued to advocate for a $15 minimum wage.
But the candidates were divided on gun control. While Clinton has tried in the past to cast Sanders as soft on the issue, O’Malley accused Clinton of being “on three sides of this.”
“When you ran in 2000, you said we needed federal robust regulations, then in 2008 you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying we don't need those regulations ... and now you’re coming back around here,” he said.
The debate was notable in that it saw Sanders and O’Malley taking a more aggressive tone against the front-runner, who seemed to have strengthened her hand since their initial debate.
Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O’Malley. She also made it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and saw one of her biggest potential political threats – a late bid by Vice President Biden – disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.
Sanders remains Clinton’s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.
Still, the FBI investigation over Clinton’s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding. Sanders appeared to give her a pass on the email issue at the first debate by saying he was tired of hearing about the controversy.
Sanders, though, stood by his comments at the second debate Saturday night: “I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email, I’m still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email. … Let’s go to the major issues facing America.” ",,"Hillary Clinton faced tough criticism Saturday night from her Democratic rivals over everything from her Middle East policies to her swaying stance on gun control to her Wall Street ties, at a debate that saw both Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley step up their attacks on the party’s front-runner.  ","Clinton hit by Dem rivals over Wall St. ties, Mideast policies at 2nd debate",http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/V8TEBB0dgZ8/,"[u'foreign policy/national security', u'immigration']","[u""Martin O'Malley"", u'Jim Young', u'Hillary Clinton', u'Donald Trump', u'Muammar Qaddafi', u'Bernie Sanders']",fox,0.9974292038547423,[],2015-11-15 05:15:16,"[u'Senate', u'Al Qaeda', u'FBI']",29828bcd7ecc03e34848b99e5ee11039,2015-11-15 06:14:40.351600

“We will not solve our nation’s problems … by returning to [the] polarizing figures of our past.”
This was a not so veiled attack against Hillary Clinton from Martin O’Malley on Saturday night at the second Democratic debate. It was uttered on a night when her opponents were more direct in their criticism but still did not appear to lay a glove on her.  
Indeed, O’Malley’s words are poignant, but ultimately won’t make much of a difference. Hillary Clinton is 19 points up nationally and Saturday night’s debate was another example of why she is so far in front.
Just as in the first debate, Clinton showed the depth of her experience in politics over the last 30 years. She has the deepest understanding of the issues – particularly foreign policy having been secretary of state – and is a sharp, quick debater.

None of the candidates were willing to say that we’re at war with radical Islam. Everyone was watching for this and it seemed that they erred on the side of political correctness. 

Clinton continued to show herself to be a commanding force on the stage. This isn’t to say that she didn’t have struggles.
She tripped up during an answer about Wall Street where she countered that her work to aid the 9/11 recovery while a New York senator made her a crusader against Wall Street. And her vote for the Iraq war haunted her again. These are points the GOP will seize upon and showed flashes of weakness.
Saturday debate began with a series of questions on terrorism and how America can combat ISIS, especially in light of the heinous attacks in Paris on Friday night. We knew this would happen, as it should. And each of the candidates emphasized how important American leadership is in the fight against terrorism, something I agree with wholeheartedly.
It was no surprise that Clinton was the most hawkish of the three candidates on stage. She talked of using airpower, training and equipping forces in the region and pushes our allies – especially Turkey and the Gulf States – to make up their minds about how much they’re going to help in this effort. Sanders and O’Malley had good rhetoric on the issue, but were vague and non-specific. And we also heard again that climate change is creating terrorism from Sanders – a claim that the Republicans will surely seize on.
It must be noted that Clinton was trying to distance herself from Obama's statement that ISIS needs to be ""contained"" by saying they need to be ""defeated."" That being said, she did not declare war on ISIS. She did not forthrightly speak of the singular and unique role the U.S. must play in providing leadership, and sought to deflect attention from Sanders' efforts to link her with the rise of ISIS because of her support of the Iraq war by blaming George Bush.
In short, it was a good and effective job for a Democratic primary audience, but all three candidates were on the defensive for much of the first part of the debate over the Middle East and the War on Terror. This will probably be a manageable challenge in the Democratic primary, but will almost certainly be a more serious challenge during the general election campaign. We will have to watch how this unfolds closely.
Furthermore, none of the candidates were willing to say that we’re at war with radical Islam. Everyone was watching for this and it seemed that they erred on the side of political correctness.
Clinton had the best rationale for not using the term by defending it in terms of not offending our Muslim allies, but coming on the day after the Paris attacks, I’m sure this will be an issue.
There was more antagonism on Saturday night than we’ve seen before. Sanders went after Clinton for her close ties to Wall Street and on gun control. And Clinton returned the favor.
O’Malley got in on the action to tout how far he went as Maryland governor to raise wages, control gun violence and work to combat climate change. He certainly did better than he has before, but I don’t think he made a strong case for an O’Malley presidency. As Sanders pointed out, it’s not like Baltimore is doing too well right now. And he’s right.
The most important thing that voters will have seen at the Iowa debate this week is that a Clinton and a Sanders presidency would be very different.
Sanders believes two things are of paramount importance: income inequality and climate change. His plans could push taxes on the rich upwards of 80 percent-- in a light moment he joked about Dwight Eisenhower levying a 90% tax -- and he’d bring back Glass-Steagall and break up the banks. Sanders supports a $15 minimum wage and free college tuition. And he brought the conversation on health care back to the idea of single payer, a favorite of the progressive left.
These are all areas where you can see differences with Clinton. She only supports a $12 federal minimum wage and said it should be up to states/cities to raise it above that (this is also what Senate Democrats support). She wouldn’t break up the banks or bring back Glass-Steagall while at the same time arguing that her proposals go the furthest in reining in the banks.
On health care, Clinton wants to build on ObamaCare and improve it, especially by focusing on the issue of prescription drug costs.
It’s also important to note that all the candidates were allied on immigration – each supports comprehensive immigration plan and a pathway to citizenship.
Martin O’Malley was the only candidate to say how many Syrian refugees he’d take in (65,000), but they all argued that it’s our humanitarian duty to take in refugees. This will also be a sticking point after the Paris attacks.
All this is to say that Saturday night’s event was a well-moderated debate and all the candidates did well.
It’s just that Clinton did that much better. She’s the only one on stage who looked presidential. And I believe everyone could see that.

" For Bernie Sanders, it was a missed opportunity. 
The second Democratic debate was a high stakes chance for him to blunt Hillary Clinton’s resurgence at one of the more crucial times in the Democratic contest for president.
But while Clinton did find herself on the defensive over foreign policy and terrorism, the challenges came largely from the moderators. Sanders failed to deliver in small and large ways at the Democratic presidential debate Saturday that would have either cast positive attention on him or negative attention on her.
It’s a dynamic that explains why she’s pulling comfortably ahead of him in the Democratic race and likely to remain there in the critical weeks to come. 
After the terrorist attack in Paris hours before, Americans expected to hear about foreign policy and more specifically how the candidates planned to fight the Islamic State which took responsibility for killing more than 100 people. 
But when Sanders in his opening statement was asked to share his thoughts on the attacks, he uttered a mere two sentences on terrorism – totaling about 20 seconds – before quickly switching back to his standard stump speech.
“I’m running for president because as I go around this nation I talk to a lotta people,” he said. “And what I hear is people concerned that the economy we have is a rigged economy.”
The abrupt switch from terrorism as well as his claim that climate change is the greatest threat to national security seemed out of place as the Paris attacks dominated the world’s attention.

Climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism. And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say you're gonna see countries all over the world...you're gonna see all kinds of international conflict, Bernie Sanders
Sanders’ problems with the debate began even before the candidates walked on stage. His campaign spent hours refuting published reports that aides were angry about changes in the format to reflect the Paris attacks. Clinton supporters flooded social media saying anyone who couldn’t change topics based on world events couldn’t handle being president.
The independent senator from Vermont has surprised political observers, even himself, with his popularity in the contest that has translated to large crowds and millions of dollars in contributions. But he needs to do something more if he expects to compete with Clinton for the nomination.
With the candidates not debating again for five more weeks, the debate was perhaps his best hope to blunt her rise in the polls. He did provide several strong answers, particularly on reining in Wall Street and ridding politics of unaccountable money. But to get ahead he needed to criticize her, something he and his aides repeatedly say he’s not comfortable with. 
EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
When asked if he had any criticism in the way Clinton performed as secretary of state, Sanders spoke vaguely about “regime change,” saying forcing leadership changes in some countries are not always beneficial while he barely mentioned her or explained that she has supported such moves. 
EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM
Sanders instead found himself agreeing with her more than once.
“I agree with much of what the secretary said,” he said about terrorism.
“The secretary’s obviously right,” he said on her assessment of the Middle East. 
Sanders did manage to criticize her more than he did in their first debate in October.
He forcefully went after her for voting to authorize the invasion of Iraq in 2003 as a senator, saying it created instability that led to the rise of the Islamic State.
“I don’t think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the level of instability that we have now,” he said. “That is one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the history of the United States.”
Clinton acknowledged once again that she made a mistake on the Iraq war. But she then called on him to acknowledge his mistake on a vote he cast to grant immunity to gun manufacturers and dealers from liability if their firearms are used criminally. 

That was a terrible mistake. It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate, legislators not just in Washington but across the country, Hillary Clinton.
He didn’t and instead delivered a muddled answer. “We will talk of that bill which I agree with parts, I disagree – I am certainly absolutely willing to look at that bill and make sure – and not a form of the bill,” he said.
EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
He also failed to focus on what political observers consider one of his best lines of attacks – accusing Clinton of flipping on policy positions. 
EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM
If all else failed, Sanders could have used the emails. Clinton has been under fire using a personal email system while secretary of state.
Sanders gave her pass on the issue in the first debate – saying Americans are “sick and tired” about hearing about her emails. But he said later he wasn’t dismissing concerns and that there are “valid questions.”
Then on Saturday, he said he really hadn’t changed his mind and that the way his remarks were misinterpreted was “just media stuff.”
“I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email,” he said. “I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email.”

Clinton was pleased with that statement. “I agree completely.”

"WASHINGTON — The tragedy in Paris is roiling American politics, bolstering the Republican right’s anti-immigration demands in the short run and perhaps ultimately enhancing Hillary Rodham Clinton and her credentials as the candidate with experience.

Politicians from President Obama on down have expressed outrage at the attacks, for which the Islamic State claimed responsibility.

Several leading Republicans immediately politicized the issue. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas blamed Mr. Obama and what he called a weak “photo-op” foreign policy, and one of the party’s presidential front-runners, Donald J. Trump, said the tragedy reinforced the need for “tougher” American leadership.

“This will be exceptionally important” in shaping the presidential race, said Peter D. Hart, a prominent Democratic poll-taker, suggesting it was likely to help Mrs. Clinton, the only top-tier candidate in either party who has a background in national security.

In a debate among Democratic candidates on Saturday, she opened by stating that the United States would be electing a new commander in chief.

The attacks seem certain to heighten the importance of foreign policy in an election where it has not been prominent. In a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, only 8 percent of the public cited terrorism as the most important issue.

The attacks were immediately seized upon as a reason for cracking down on immigration. “This will help the anti-immigration cause and hurt efforts to bring in Syrian refugees,” predicted Vin Weber, a leading Republican strategist and immigration advocate.

Among Republicans, the speculation was about the consequences of the Paris attacks for Mr. Trump. In Iowa on Thursday, he let loose a particularly vicious tirade against some of his rivals.

There was a growing sense within the Republican establishment that the “Trump rant” might be the incident that really derails his candidacy, even though he has not been affected by supposedly lethal political acts in the past. The terrorist episode could reverse any political slippage. Mr. Trump has largely set the agenda and dominated the dialogue on immigration; other candidates have followed.

Both prominent Republicans and Democrats suggested that a renewed attention to terrorism could harden his core support, though an overall emphasis on foreign policy would not play to Mr. Trump’s strengths.

Among the other leading contenders, the boyish-looking Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, 44, has most emphasized a hard line on national security.

Yet, Mr. Hart predicts voters “won’t want the kid” in the White House. Mr. Cruz, though the same age, was seen as projecting more forcefulness than his rivals in his response to the attacks, though he may have overreached.

Mr. Weber, one of the Republican wise men, said that with time, voters may look “for someone with more gravitas.” He said he hoped this would play to the strength of his candidate, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida.

Mr. Bush, considered one of the more mature candidates in either party, has only derivative national security credentials because of his family, particularly his brother, former President George W. Bush. That may prove a mixed blessing for a candidate struggling to regain his footing.

The reason Mr. Hart sees an advantage for Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, is that a greater focus on terrorism will cause voters to look even more for a “heavy and strong hand at the tiller.” This might minimize the problems she has among staunchly noninterventionist Democratic primary voters because she is more hawkish on foreign policy than the president she served. And it could help her in a general election, though Republicans constantly criticize the “Obama/Clinton” weakness on foreign policy.

In the Democratic debate, Mrs. Clinton took the hardest line on national security: She insisted that the Islamic State “must be defeated,” not just contained, and stressed that she had advised Mr. Obama to approve the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.

However this evolves, both Republicans and Democrats agree that Nov. 13 is likely to be an important marker in the selection of the 45th American president.",ALBERT R.

"Republican candidates for president called on the Obama administration to tighten border controls amid reports that one of the suicide bombers who carried outÂ Fridayâs attacks in Paris may have entered Europe as a Syrian migrant.
Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee said President Barack Obama should âclose our borders.â
âIf a left-wing politically-correct country like France will close its borders, it’s time for us to put a moratorium on people coming here from countries where there are ISIS or al Qaeda ties,â he told CNN on Saturday.
Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, another GOP presidential candidate, said the difficulty of running background checks on Syrian refugees should preclude further migration from Syria into the U.S.
âYou canât pick up the phone and call Syria, and thatâs one of the reasons why I said we wonât be able to take more refugees,â he said on ABC on Sunday.
He added: âYou can have 1,000 people come in, and 999 of them are just poor people fleeing oppression and violence, but one of them is an ISIS fighter. If thatâs the case, you have a problem, and there is no way to vet that out.â
The news that one of the bombers may have entered Europe amidst the flood of Middle Eastern refugees has galvanized opponents of Chancellor Angela Merkelâs open-door policy, with critics saying migrants represented a grave security threat.
Jeb Bush, whose support for legal status for undocumented immigrants in the U.S. puts him at odds with the mainstream of the Republican Party, said the U.S. had the capacity to screen refugees based on their religion.
âWe do that all the time. We do that,â he said on CNN on Sunday. âIt takes almost a year for a refugee to be processed into the United States.”
He called for the U.S. to take a âlimited numberâ and to prioritize Christians who are fleeing religiously motivated persecution in Syria.
The U.S. is preparing to admit at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next year, a six-fold increase from the number currently in the country, the White House announced in September.
Ben Rhodes, deputy national security advisor to President Obama, said the administration had no intention of changing its refugee policy and said it had extensive screening procedures already in place for all Syrian refugees entering the U.S.
âThere’s a very careful vetting process that includes our intelligence community, our national Counterterrorism Center, the Department of Homeland Security,â he said on NBC on Sunday.
âWe need to sort out how to focus on the terrorists that we need to keep out of the country. But I think we do need to do our part to take those refugees who are in need.â

"WASHINGTON The deadly attacks in Paris pushed terrorism and the Syrian refugee crisis to the center of the U.S presidential campaign on Sunday, as Republicans hammered Obama administration plans to take in more refugees as well as Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton's stance on Middle East policy.
After officials said one of the Paris gunmen might have slipped into Europe among refugees fleeing Syria's war, more Republicans voiced their opposition to the 10,000 Syrian refugees the White House wants to admit in the coming year.
""Bringing people into this country from that area of the world I think is a huge mistake,"" Republican candidate Ben Carson said on the ""Fox News Sunday"" program, echoing comments by fellow Republican contenders on Saturday.
While the U.S. number is a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of refugees that Europe is prepared to take, the plan has become a main point of attack for candidates seeking to show a tougher stance on terrorism.
The deadliest attack in Europe in a decade could end up reshaping the race to elect a U.S. president in 2016.
Clinton, a former secretary of state under President Barack Obama, told a debate on Saturday in Iowa that she supported raising the refugee intake to 65,000, but only with a careful screening and vetting process.
Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for Obama, defended the administration's vetting process as thorough and made a humanitarian appeal.
""We're also dealing with people who've suffered the horrors of war, women and children, orphans. We can't just shut our doors to those people,"" he said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""
Earlier this month, the administration announced plans to accelerate the process for Syrian refugees hoping to enter the United States with new screening outposts in Iraq and Lebanon. 
More on the Syrian refugee screening process
The events in Paris have highlighted a double-edged foreign policy problem for Clinton. As America's top diplomat from 2009 to 2013, she has international experience none of her rivals can match but can also be called to account for failings on her watch.
Clinton's Democratic and Republican opponents said the administration had misjudged the Middle East and underestimated Islamic State, the militant group that claimed credit for bomb and gun attacks that killed at least 132 people in Paris on Friday.
Republican presidential candidate Senator Lindsey Graham said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that if he were elected, the United States would be ""part of a world-wide force to destroy ISIL,"" another acronym for Islamic State.
""Hillary Clinton,"" he added ""seems to be disconnected from what you need to do. She won’t embrace boots on the ground.""

VETTING UNDER SCRUTINY
Florida Senator Marco Rubio, another Republican candidate, said on ABC's ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos"" that just one vetting oversight could jeopardize public safety. 
""You can have a thousand people come in and 999 of them are just poor people fleeing oppression and violence, but one of them is an ISIS fighter. ... If that's the case, you have a problem,"" Rubio said.
Fellow Republican contenders, Ohio Governor John Kasich and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, have been open to accepting more refugees, but they echoed Rubio's concerns about vetting. 
""We can't be in a position of inviting the enemy in, and frankly we better be careful about looking at Americans that have traveled"" in the region, Kasich said on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.""
Bush said on ""Meet the Press"" the United States had a special responsibility to help Syrian Christians, who he said had no place in their homeland.
Ahead of the first Democratic nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 1, Clinton has opened a commanding lead over main party challenger Bernie Sanders, who argues the invasion of Iraq, which Clinton supported in a U.S. Senate vote in 2003, led to the rise of al Qaeda and Islamic State.

Hillary Clinton entered the second debate of the campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination with far less to prove than she had in the first, and, in the end, she probably achieved far less as well. But for the time being, at least, she may be able to afford it. The first debate, in October, corresponded with a time of stress for her candidacy, besieged by various legal and political investigators and drifting downward in voter-preference polls. But Clinton did so well and struck such a blend of competence and charm in the October debate on CNN that she was widely acknowledged to have rescued her fortunes — or at least strengthened her hand. This latest debate on CBS News and staged at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, was never likely to have as great an impact. The likely audience was limited. It was staged on a Saturday night, competing with various sports and entertainment programs. This weekend, in particular, it was overshadowed by the tragedy unfolding in Paris, where at least 129 people died in terrorist attacks Friday night. The group known as Islamic State claimed responsibility for the coordinated attacks by teams of gunmen and suicide bombers. The debaters observed a moment of silence for the victims in Paris and devoted the first quarter of the debate to discussing the attacks and the proper response from the U.S. and its allies. All agreed the U.S. had a major, leading role to play in battling the terrorists, but all also agreed that U.S. allies needed to respond with greater commitment as well. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont noted that the struggles in the Middle East amounted to ""a war for the soul of Islam,"" implying it was a contest beyond the power of the U.S. government to resolve. But Sanders also explicitly assigned responsibility for the current turmoil in the Middle East to the administration of George W. Bush, whose invasion of Iraq in 2003 was responsible for ""all this instability,"" he said. Sanders made the point that he had opposed the invasion on the Senate floor, where Clinton had voted in support. Clinton has since called that vote a mistake. But the most difficult part of that first segment of the debate for Clinton came when CBS News debate moderator John Dickerson asked whether her prescriptions for the fight against the group called Islamic State suffered for her association with President Obama, who has been downplaying, or underestimating, the strength of the group. As recently as this week, the president had said the group had been ""contained,"" at least in its territorial ambitions in Iraq and Syria. On this, Clinton distanced herself from the president somewhat, saying she had advised more involvement in the region after the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq — a shift she said was mandated by the agreement struck with Iraq by the last Bush administration. She had said she warned that ""extremist groups might fill the vacuum."" Sanders said several times that the Department of Defense budget was already $600 billion and that the U.S. should be hesitant to increase that greatly without knowing what it was expecting to accomplish with more military hardware. A self-described Democratic Socialist, Sanders also contrasted his reliance on small donors with the Clinton campaign's donations from the wealthy of Wall Street: ""Maybe they're stupid about what they're going to get [in return], but I don't think so."" Clinton then insisted on a chance to respond, because Sanders had ""impugned my integrity."" That drew an audible sound of anticipation from the crowd, which may not have expected even this degree of confrontation between the candidates after the harmony of the first debate. Clinton then said she had many thousands of donors, most of them not rich, and 60 percent of them women. Although not directly responsive to the Wall Street thrust from Sanders, Clinton's reference to gender prompted applause and cheers from the crowd. This was her best moment of the debate, according to people following the proceedings on social media such as Twitter. Clinton went on to suggest her contributions from Wall Street stemmed from appreciation for all she had done to help the Lower Manhattan financial industry recover from the terror attacks of September 2001. That rationale drew a decidedly mixed response from the audience in the hall and on social media, with many questioning whether it fully explained the generous contributions she still receives from the financial industry more than a dozen years later.

Sanders said Clinton's plan to increase regulation of the financial industry was ""not good enough,"" and he had corroborating support from third-place challenger Martin O'Malley, the former governor of Maryland, who called the Clinton plan ""weak tea."" The candidates revisited a divide on gun violence, with Sanders saying he was willing to reconsider his past opposition to legislation stripping gun manufacturers of their liability when their products were used in the commission of crimes. O'Malley sided with Clinton on this issue, only moments after favoring Sanders' point of view on banking regulation. But, in general, the candidates were largely in agreement on major issues. They agreed that President Obama had been right to offer a path to citizenship for young people brought to the U.S. illegally while still minor children. ""The symbol of America is the Statue of Liberty,"" said O'Malley, ""not a barbed-wire fence."" O'Malley also won cheers from the crowd for his reference to ""that immigrant-bashing carnival-barker Donald Trump,"" a reference to the candidate leading most polls among Republican candidates for president. All three candidates supported greater access to a college education, with Sanders saying all public universities and colleges should be tuition-free. Clinton said she did not think taxpayers should pay for Trump's children to go to college, as he is a billionaire. O'Malley noted that he had held the line on tuition increases at state schools when he was a governor. And neither Sanders nor O'Malley took the bait when asked whether Clinton's private e-mail server should have been used for any kind of government business. Sanders in particular refused the chance to criticize her on the issue, saying he was still ""tired of her emails,"" as he had said in the first debate. Dickerson then asked Clinton if there were ""other shoes to drop"" as multiple investigations proceed into her time in office and the activities of her aides. Clinton alluded to her 11 hours of testimony before a House investigative panel last month as an indication to the contrary. Overall, the debate did not seem likely to affect Clinton's standing in the primary field. Despite moments of vulnerability and dubious reaction to her defenses regarding Wall Street contributors, she remained the strong center of the cast on stage. She had 40 percent of the total speaking time, with 35 percent going to Sanders and 25 percent to O'Malley. But as she had arrived at this juncture of the campaign as not only the leader but an increasingly dominant leader, Clinton had little room to improve. Dickerson also invited favorable comparison to his predecessors in the role of debate moderator. His questions were crisp, to the point and frequently challenging — but without the argumentative tone that has brought criticism from participants in earlier debates on the Republican side.

Hillary Clinton faced tough criticism Saturday night from her Democratic rivals over everything from her Middle East policies to her swaying stance on gun control to her Wall Street ties, at a debate that saw both Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley step up their attacks on the party’s front-runner.
The former secretary of state was put on the defensive almost immediately, as she was challenged by her rivals -- and the moderator -- over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability. Vermont Sen. Sanders ripped her support for “regime change.”  
But while the Paris terror attacks the night before shifted the early presidential debate focus to national security, the candidates sparred aggressively in the latter half over domestic issues – especially financial industry reform and Clinton’s Wall Street support.
Former Maryland Gov. O’Malley called her the “candidate of Wall Street.”
Asked about her hefty Wall Street-backed speaking fees and donations, Clinton defended her independence in being able to pursue financial industry reform.

But Sanders shot back, “Not good enough.”
“Let's not be naive about it. Why …has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?” he said. “You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.”
He and O’Malley, unlike Clinton, both want to re-instate a Depression-era banking law known as Glass-Steagall – and they both criticized Clinton’s Wall Street plans as not going far enough. 
O’Malley called it “weak tea.”
In an eyebrow-raising moment, Clinton countered Sanders’ criticism of her Wall Street donations by saying that as New York senator, she helped “rebuild” Wall Street and downtown Manhattan after 9/11.
Clinton was later asked about social media reaction claiming she had invoked 9/11 to justify financial industry donations; Clinton said she’s sorry that anyone had that “impression.”
Meanwhile, she said she doesn’t think her rivals’ financial industry plans – particularly to reinstate the Depression-era law that separated investment and commercial banking – would get the job done.
“I'm all about making sure we actually get results,” Clinton said.
The debate in Des Moines, Iowa, came in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which thrust the issues of national security and foreign policy back to the center of the 2016 campaign. The format of the debate – hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register -- was changed to focus anew on those issues in the beginning.
Clinton tried to highlight her deep experience in foreign policy issues from the outset.
“This election is not only about electing a president. It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief,” she said.
But, citing the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa, Clinton’s rivals soon turned to her record as U.S. senator and later as secretary of state to question her judgment in foreign policy matters.
O’Malley appeared to criticize her support for toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.
He said America’s role is not to roam the world “looking for new dictators to topple.” He said it is also important to understand “secondary and third consequences” that come after removing a “single dictator.” O’Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a “mess.”
Clinton defended her support for ousting Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a “genocide” and America’s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support. And to O’Malley’s critique, she said, “I don’t think you can paint with a broad brush” in an “incredibly complicated region of the world.”
Sanders, meanwhile, referenced Clinton’s Senate vote for the use of force in Iraq and said the “disastrous invasion” led “to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.” The senator also claimed that “climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.”
Clinton again called her Iraq war vote a “mistake,” but disputed that the war is the only driver of modern terrorism.
She and O’Malley briefly sparred over America’s role in fighting ISIS. After Clinton said it “cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential,” O’Malley said, “This actually is America’s fight,” though not “solely” America’s fight.
Sanders staked out a different position in saying it is the nations in the region that “have to get their hands dirty.”
“Those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort,” he said.
The candidates declined to categorize the threat itself as “radical Islam.” Asked about that categorization, Clinton said only, “I don’t think we’re at war with Islam.”
All the candidates on stage condemned the Paris terror attacks and vowed to take on the threat of terror.
“It cannot be contained. It must be defeated,” Clinton said of ISIS, appearing to distance herself from President Obama, who hours before the Paris attacks claimed ISIS was “contained.”
The attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said. It brought the issue of terrorism to the forefront of both party’s presidential primary races. Ostensibly, it is an area where Clinton enters with the thickest resume – but also one that could, as the debate showed, prove problematic given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable nations like Libya and Syria.
While the tragedy hung over the debate, the candidates were able to tackle of range of domestic issues including wages and immigration.
O’Malley landed virtually the only shot of the night against Republican candidate Donald Trump, a favorite target of the Democrats, by calling him an “immigrant-bashing carnival barker.” The Democratic candidates generally agree on the call for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the country.
Sanders, meanwhile, continued to advocate for a $15 minimum wage.
But the candidates were divided on gun control. While Clinton has tried in the past to cast Sanders as soft on the issue, O’Malley accused Clinton of being “on three sides of this.”
“When you ran in 2000, you said we needed federal robust regulations, then in 2008 you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying we don't need those regulations ... and now you’re coming back around here,” he said.
The debate was notable in that it saw Sanders and O’Malley taking a more aggressive tone against the front-runner, who seemed to have strengthened her hand since their initial debate.
Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O’Malley. She also made it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and saw one of her biggest potential political threats – a late bid by Vice President Biden – disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.
Sanders remains Clinton’s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.
Still, the FBI investigation over Clinton’s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding. Sanders appeared to give her a pass on the email issue at the first debate by saying he was tired of hearing about the controversy.
Sanders, though, stood by his comments at the second debate Saturday night: “I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email, I’m still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email. … Let’s go to the major issues facing America.” ",,,"DEMOCRATIC DEBATE  Clinton hit by rivals over Mideast, Wall Street ties",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/15/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate/,"[u'foreign policy/national security', u'immigration']","[u""Martin O'Malley"", u'Jim Young', u'Hillary Clinton', u'Donald Trump', u'Muammar Qaddafi', u'Bernie Sanders']",fox,0.9973633621405877,[],2015-11-15 06:03:37,"[u'Senate', u'Al Qaeda', u'FBI']",e310bbfc28aa65b4735b170dc3b6246a,2015-11-15 07:00:04.156895
"(Updates with comments from candidates)
By John Whitesides and Amanda Becker
DES MOINES, Iowa Nov 14 U.S. Democratic
presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton was criticized in a
debate on Saturday for her 2003 vote backing the U.S. invasion
of Iraq, with rival Bernie Sanders linking it to regional chaos
that aided the rise of Islamic State militants.
The day after a series of deadly bomb and gun attacks that
killed at least 129 people in Paris, Sanders said the invasion
was ""one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the modern
history of the United States.""
""I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq,
something that I strongly opposed, unraveled the region
immensely, and led to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS,"" said
Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont.
""I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the
invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are
seeing right now,"" he said.
Clinton, who has frequently called the vote a mistake, said
it should be placed in the historical context of years of
terrorism before the invasion.
""If we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed by
jihadi extremists, we need to understand it and realize that it
has antecedents to what happened in Iraq,"" she said.
The exchange came early in the second debate for Democrats
seeking their party's nomination for the November 2016
presidential election, with the focus shifted to foreign policy
and ways to combat terrorism after the Paris attacks.
The candidates and audience at Drake University in Des
Moines, Iowa, observed a moment of silence at the beginning of
the debate to honor those killed in France.
Clinton, the former secretary of state, has far more foreign
policy experience than either Sanders or her other rival, former
Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley. But she was forced on the
defensive early in the debate about her years of leading
President Barack Obama's foreign policy team.
Clinton struck a sharp contrast to Obama's comments in an
interview aired on Friday that ISIS had been contained.
""We have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an
international terror network. It cannot be contained, it must be
defeated,"" she said.
Republican presidential contenders have criticized Obama for
what they say was an inadequate response to the rise of Islamic
State in Iraq and Syria. In the aftermath of the attacks,
businessman Donald Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz called on the
administration to reconsider plans to allow thousands of Syrian
refugees to be resettled in the United States.
The White House aims to increase to 10,000 the number of
Syrian refugees accepted in the United States during fiscal year
2016, from less than 2,000 accepted in the previous year.
Clinton has always been from the more hawkish wing of the
Democratic Party. Her support for the 2003 Iraq invasion played
a major role in her primary loss to Obama in the 2008 White
House race.
The foreign policy focus was a dramatic shift in emphasis in
a Democratic presidential race that so far has been dominated by
domestic economic issues such as income inequality, college
affordability and family leave.
The Democrats returned to that theme later in the debate,
and Sanders criticized Clinton for being too cozy with Wall

Act, the 1933 law that established a firewall between investment
and commercial banking.
""Over her political career, Wall Street has been a major,
the major donor to Hillary Clinton. Now maybe they're dumb, but
I don't think so,"" said Sanders, who favors reinstatement of the
act.
Clinton accused Sanders of impugning her integrity and said
reinstating the law was not enough to rein in corporate
influence and reform Wall Street.
""Reinstating Glass-Steagall is a part of what very well
could help, but it is nowhere near enough,"" she said. ""I go
after all of Wall Street, not just the big banks.""
With the political clock ticking to the first nominating
contest in Iowa on Feb. 1, Clinton has opened a commanding lead
over Sanders, her prime challenger, in national and Iowa polls.
O'Malley trails well behind, in single digits in most polls.

" (CNN)Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley met for the second Democratic presidential primary debate on Saturday night, an event that finally saw a fight between the front-runner and her chief opponent, but also coming a day after a deadly terror attack that shocked the world. 
Here are the six key takeaways from the debates:

Clinton distanced herself from President Barack Obama's now-controversial comment in an interview Thursday that the U.S. had ""contained ISIS."" During Saturday's debate, Clinton asserted that ISIS ""cannot be contained"" and must simply be ""defeated.""
 As she has in the past, Clinton also suggested that she had argued ""early on that we needed to find a way to train and equip moderates."" Clinton reportedly argued for a more forceful administration plan to help the Syrian opposition early on in the civil war that has since exploded.

The Vermont senator in the first debate appeared unprepared or unwilling to go after Clinton with any real vigor.
But Saturday night, Sanders suggested Clinton is in the pocket of Wall Street and tied her vote to authorize the war in Iraq to the rise of ISIS. Clinton, meanwhile, knocked Sanders on his mixed record on guns and suggested his policy proposals are too simplistic.
In the most forceful exchange of the night, Sanders pointed to the millions of dollars in donations Wall Street has funneled to Clinton's campaigns over her political career.
""Why over her political career has Wall Street been a major, the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton? Maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so,"" Sanders said. ""I have never heard a candidate, never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street from the military industrial complex, not one candidate -- 'Oh these, these campaign contributions will not influence me.' But why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something, everybody knows that.""

Clinton responded by accusing Sanders of impugning her ""integrity,"" before claiming that Wall Street has supported her because of the work she did to rebuild the Financial District after it was hit in the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center.  
As she did in the first debate, Clinton hit Sanders on guns, calling the Vermont senator's vote to shield gun makers from some lawsuits a ""terrible mistake"" and urging Sanders to admit as much, as she has done regarding her Iraq vote.
Sanders responded by suggesting there's little daylight between himself and Clinton and O'Malley on guns.

Sanders didn't take the gloves off completely during Saturday night's debate in Iowa.
Instead, he took a pass on one of the biggest points of contention of the 2016 cycle: Clinton's record as secretary of state.
Given a chance to slam Clinton's tenure, Sanders demurred, instead pivoting to his ""disagreement"" with Clinton over her vote in favor of the Iraq War in 2002, more than six years before she became secretary of state.
Republicans are already picking apart Clinton's track record as secretary of state, but Sanders' simply wouldn't take the bait.
It was reminiscent of Sanders' ""damn emails"" moment in the first Democratic debate, when he said Americans are tired of hearing about the controversy over Clintons' use of personal email during her time as secretary of state.

However, Clinton's response to Sanders -- when she beat back the suggestion that she is influenced by Wall Street donors -- could really come back to bite her.
Clinton explained her connection to Wall Street by tying her relationship to her role in helping to rebuild New York's financial district after the 9/11 attacks.
Twitter was ablaze Saturday night over the response, and the Republican National Committee was quick to blast out a best-of compilation of political observers' reactions.
It's not the only moment that could come back to haunt Clinton -- especially if she faces a younger GOP nominee, like Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida.
Clinton at one point said she is ""from the '60s"" -- a moment in the debate that could be replayed in political ads down the line suggesting she is part of the past, not the future, of American leadership.

The debate Saturday night began with the candidates pausing on stage, taking a moment of silence to remember the victims of the terrorist attacks that ripped Paris apart just a day earlier.  
Clinton said while ""our prayers are with the people of France tonight...that is not enough"" and called for better coordinated efforts to root out ISIS, the radical group that claimed responsibility. 
She said Americans should see the terrorist attack as a reminder that the election ""is not only about electing a president, it's also about choosing our next commander in chief.""
Sanders made brief note of the terrorist attacks at the top of his opening statement, but quickly pivoted to the core message of the campaign: ""a rigged economy"" that benefits billionaires.
Still, Sanders made a bold claim in his reference to Paris: ""Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarist (sic) organization called ISIS.""
And O'Malley, after saying his heart goes out ""to the people of France in this moment of loss,"" quickly called for ""fresh thinking"" and ""new approaches"" -- a definitive nod to his youth and the generational contrast the  52-year-old offers to Clinton's 68 years and Sanders' 74.
All three candidates refused to say the fight was with radical Islam, instead focusing on using the word ""jihadist"" to describe the threats spotlighted in the Paris attacks. 
RELATED: Clinton calls out 'radical jihadist ideology'

O'Malley delivered several strong one-liners throughout the night, notably when he slammed Republican front-runner Donald Trump as a ""carnival barker"" for his immigration policies.
But O'Malley also missed a couple of key moments where he could have shined. 
His central contention is that it's time for a new generation of leadership -- meaning no more baby boomers like Clinton. But he lacked a strong, convincing response to one of the debate's final questions: When have you been most tested in your life, and how did it prepare you for the presidency? 
O'Malley's response conceded that he is untested -- that nothing he's been through as mayor of Baltimore or governor of Maryland comes close to the crises he would face as President.
Trump later responded to O'Malley's insult on Twitter by calling him a ""clown.""

Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders needs to slow frontrunner Hillary Clinton’s run toward the party nomination, and Saturday night’s debate might be such an opportunity.
The format of the CBS debate, the second of the 2016 cycle for Democratic White House candidates, was reworked after the Paris terror attacks Friday night to focus more on terrorism, national security and foreign policy.
Clinton, as a former secretary of state, has more experience with such matters, compared to both Sanders, a Vermont independent, and fellow challenger Martin O’Malley, a former Maryland governor.
However, her record as the State Department leader from 2009 to 2013 could also invite moderator questions and candidate attacks Saturday about her handling of the deadly Sept. 11, 2012, terror attacks on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya.
Among the concerns, as frequently highlighted by Republicans, are whether Clinton paid enough attention to security concerns raised by Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who was killed in the attacks, and whether she attempted to cover up that the attacks were terror related.

Stevens and three other Americans died in the attacks.
Clinton will also likely face questions at the debate in Des Moines, Iowa, about her role in the Obama administration’s efforts to eradicate the Islamic State, the increasingly dangerous terror group that has claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks that killed at least 129 people.
Clinton leads Sanders 54.7 percent to 33 percent, with O’Malley at a distant 2.7 percent, according to an averaging of polls by the nonpartisan website RealClearPolitics.com.
And an Associated Press survey of superdelegates published Friday found that half of the Democratic insiders are publicly backing Clinton, which further secures her nomination efforts.
Clinton’s campaign got off to a rough start following revelations about eight months ago that as secretary of state she used a private server and email accounts for official business, which raised questions about whether classified information was compromised.
However, the former first lady and New York senator has been on a recent roll, which started with a good first debate in mid-October and was followed about a week later by her well-prepared testimony before a GOP-led special House committee on the Benghazi matter.
Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist whose outsider campaign has drawn large crowds and good polling numbers in early-voting states Iowa and New Hampshire, will indeed be free to attack Clinton on foreign policy.
However, his focus on such domestic issues as income inequality, affordable college tuition and social justice reform could present problems Saturday if Clinton or the moderators go deep and hard into the foreign policy issues.
Sanders may have inadvertently facilitated some of Clinton’s turnaround when in the first debate he seemed to dismiss the controversy over her use of a private email account and server by saying Americans are tired of hearing about her ""damn emails.""
But he has since given her no more passes.
Though careful never to mention Clinton by name, Sanders has drawn a series of contrasts with the former secretary of State on issues that include her backing of the war in Iraq, trade and the minimum wage.
Sanders advisers say he plans to discuss the email issue only if the moderators raise it.  
""He's definitely going to cut a harder contrast on core issues,"" said Larry Cohen, a senior adviser to Sanders, ""But it's not going to be over personal style.""
The problem for Sanders is that Clinton agrees with him on some of the core domestic issues of his campaign, having shifted to the left in recent weeks to oppose construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.
""His current arguments aren't enough to get beyond his core voter,"" said Gina Glantz, manager of Bill Bradley's 2000 presidential campaign.
While Sanders aides bragged about their candidate's lax preparation for the last debate, they shuttled him to his campaign headquarters in Burlington, Vermont, for mock sessions before this match-up. Clinton, too, has kept her schedule relatively clear over the last several days, leaving plenty of time for rehearsals.
""They are absolutely prepared for the fact that Bernie's going to come out swinging,"" said Maria Cardona, a Democratic strategist who worked for Clinton's failed 2008 White House campaign, ""The question is how it's going to happen.""
Clinton supporters say their candidate will remain focused on laying out her vision for the future rather than striking back at Sanders. Her campaign has about $15.2 million in television advertising planned through mid-February, compared with a $3.2 million Sanders ad buy that ends next week, according to Kantar Media's CMAG advertising tracker.
The Service Employees International Union, an influential force in Democratic politics, is expected to issue their endorsement on Tuesday, according to people knowledgeable about the union's process. Clinton has been backed by more than 72 percent of members in all their internal polling, including the most recent survey conducted a few weeks ago.
In addition to her success in the first debate and on Capitol Hill, Clinton has benefited from Vice President Joe Biden's decision to forgo a presidential run.
O'Malley has questioned Sanders' commitment to the Democratic Party and President Obama, still a popular figure among Democrats.
A more aggressive tone would mark a shift for a race that has so far been notable for its civility. Democrats have spent months boasting about the substantive tone of their contest, attempting to set-up a favorable early contrast with the often carnival-like insults of the crowded Republican primary.

"There is plenty of anger swirling around the 2016 presidential campaign. Anger at Washington, disdain for Wall Street, disgust with career politicians. Anger is all the rage, and both parties clearly have candidates that are successfully riding the wave. Neither 
Bernie Sanders
 nor 
Donald Trump
 would be where he is without the substantial number of fed-up voters in their parties. Everyone can see that. It's obvious.
But loathing doesn't account for the differences we are witnessing between the 
GOP
 and 
Democratic Party
 nomination fights. Fear does. Or the absence of fear. Although both sides are angry, Republicans are more angry at the Republican Party leadership than they are afraid of Democrats, while Democrats are more afraid of Republicans than they are angry at the Democratic Party leadership. That's why Trump and 
Ben Carson
, extreme outsiders, are dominating on the right while Hillary Rodham Clinton, the consummate insider, is dominating on the left.
This relationship isn't new: The extent to which fear of the other side tempers anger at one's own often determines the nominee.
In 2004, when I ran Howard Dean's campaign for president, Democrats were seething at the Democratic establishment, which had voted with the GOP to invade Iraq. But this anger over time gave way to a very real fear that 
Bush
 would win reelection.
Bernie Sanders' success on the campaign trail does not defy explanation in quite the way that Donald Trump's does — Sanders has not dominated the polls, for one thing — but it's improbable all the same. He is a 74-year-old grandfather with thick glasses and frequently disheveled white hair. And...
Bernie Sanders' success on the campaign trail does not defy explanation in quite the way that Donald Trump's does — Sanders has not dominated the polls, for one thing — but it's improbable all the same. He is a 74-year-old grandfather with thick glasses and frequently disheveled white hair. And...
As fear of Bush's victory rose, voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, who had been attracted to Howard Dean's progressive politics and willingness to take on the party leadership, moved to John Kerry. Venting, they realized, wasn't as important as nominating someone with a better chance to win.
This year, fear within the Democratic Party of a GOP win is off the charts. The GOP has majorities in the House of Representative and the U.S. Senate. For Democrats, losing the presidency in 2016 would be catastrophic. With control of both the executive and legislative branches of government, the GOP would be able to roll back all of the accomplishments of the 
Obama
 administration and fill any number of Supreme Court vacancies, guaranteeing a rightward shift in the makeup of the court for a generation.
Bernie Sanders can tap into the very real anger at Wall Street and Washington all he wants, but he's not going anywhere; the party rank and file isn't going to risk the 2016 election by nominating an untested democratic socialist. Fear has a way of making voters put ideological purity aside and rally around the most tested, most viable general election candidate: Hillary Rodham Clinton.
The fact that many Republicans are probably snickering at those last few sentences helps explain the starkly different race for the GOP nomination. There is a complete absence of fear within the GOP rank and file right now. Having won the House and the Senate, having taken over most state legislatures, the party feels as if the wind is at its back. Are they sick of Barack Obama? Absolutely. Are they sick of Clinton? Certainly. But they don't fear either one of them. They're convinced that the country could not possibly want another four years with a Democrat in the White House.
Any fear they had of Clinton was erased by months of pundits proclaiming her collapse, her fumbling response to the private server scandal and Sanders' surprising popularity in early primary states. GOP primary voters' opinion of her was so low they happily bought into the idea of her vulnerability, and still do.
It's the absence of fear that is driving Jeb Bush into the ground and holding Marco Rubio, 
John Kasich
 and others from gaining any real traction. Why compromise for someone who calls illegal immigration “an act of love,” or someone who once supported a path to citizenship, if there is no way you can lose? Why not go with the guy who wants to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants, then let the “good ones” back in?
Of course, there's still time for the GOP to get scared straight. As Clinton's strengths become more obvious, and they will, fear within the GOP will rise. Republican primary voters could abandon Trump and Carson for Rubio, Kasich, Christie or even Bush — just as Democratic primary voters abandoned Dean for Kerry in 2004.
The establishment candidates just have to hope that fear will overcome loathing sooner rather than later.

"DES MOINES, Iowa U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton came under heavy criticism in a debate on Saturday for her 2003 vote backing the U.S. invasion of Iraq, with rival Bernie Sanders linking it to regional chaos that aided the rise of Islamic State militants.
Sanders and rival Martin O'Malley took a more aggressive tone with Clinton than in their first debate last month, also accusing her of being too cozy with Wall Street and unwilling to stand up to corporate interests.
The day after a series of bomb and gun attacks that killed at least 129 people in Paris, Sanders criticized Clinton's vote authorizing the Iraq invasion and said it was ""one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the modern history of the United States.”
""I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, unraveled the region immensely, and led to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS,"" said Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont.
""I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now,"" he said.
Clinton, who has frequently called the vote a mistake, said it should be placed in the historical context of years of terrorism before the invasion.
“If we’re ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extremists, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq,” she said.
""This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.  It's become more complicated. And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in,"" she said.  
The Iraq exchange came early in the second debate for Democrats seeking their party's nomination for the November 2016 presidential election, which focused on foreign policy and ways to combat terrorism after the Paris attacks.
The candidates and audience at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, observed a moment of silence at the beginning of the debate to honor those killed in France.
Clinton, the former secretary of state, has far more foreign policy experience than either Sanders or O'Malley. But she was forced on the defensive early in the debate about her years of leading President Barack Obama's foreign policy team.
Clinton struck a sharp contrast to Obama's comments in an interview aired on Friday that ISIS had been contained. ""We have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network. It cannot be contained, it must be defeated,"" she said.
Republican presidential contenders have criticized Obama for what they say was an inadequate response to the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In the aftermath of the attacks, businessman Donald Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz called on the administration to reconsider plans to allow thousands of Syrian refugees to be resettled in the United States.
The White House aims to increase to 10,000 the number of Syrian refugees accepted in the United States during fiscal year 2016, from less than 2,000 accepted in the previous year.
Clinton has always been from the more hawkish wing of the Democratic Party. Her support for the 2003 Iraq invasion played a major role in her primary loss to Obama in the 2008 White House race.
The foreign policy focus was a dramatic shift in emphasis in a Democratic presidential race that so far has been dominated by domestic economic issues such as income inequality, college affordability and family leave.
The Democrats returned to that theme later in the debate, and Sanders criticized Clinton for her opposition to reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act, the 1933 law that established a firewall between investment and commercial banking. Its removal has been blamed by some for helping lead to the 2008 financial crisis.
""Over her political career, Wall Street has been a major, the major donor to Hillary Clinton. Now maybe they’re dumb, but I don’t think so,"" said Sanders, who favors reinstatement of the act.
Clinton accused Sanders of impugning her integrity and said reinstating the law was not enough to rein in corporate influence and reform Wall Street.
""Reinstating Glass-Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough,"" she said. ""I just don’t think it would get the job done, I’m all about making sure it actually gets results for whatever we do.” 
With the political clock ticking to the first nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 1, Clinton has opened a commanding lead over Sanders, her prime challenger, in national and Iowa polls. O'Malley trails well behind, in single digits in most polls.

" With the deadly terrorist attacks in Paris as a somber backdrop, three Democratic presidential candidates squared off in Des Moines, Ia., Saturday night in the party’s second 2016 debate.
Sometimes the statements made by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley on foreign policy and domestic issues rang true; sometimes their remarks didn’t coincide with the facts. For instance:
Sanders criticized Clinton for her support for the Iraq war, saying the was has led to the current instability in the region. Hillary Clinton voted for authorizing the war in Iraq in 2002, which she has since said she regrets. It became an obstacle for her 2008 presidential campaign. In 2006, she said, ""Obviously, if we knew then what we know now, there wouldn't have been a vote, and I certainly wouldn't have voted for it."" 
Clinton said that Americans spend more than anyone else in the world on prescription drugs. A PBS report last year found that “the United States spends almost $1,000 per person per year on pharmaceuticals. That’s around 40 percent more than the next highest spender, Canada, and more than twice as much as than countries like France and Germany spend.” 
Sanders aid that Americans spend more on health care than anyone else in the world. This appears to be true, according to a Commonwealth Fund report last year. “The United States health care system is the most expensive in the world, but this report and prior editions consistently show the U.S. under-performs relative to other countries on most dimensions of performance,"" it found. 
Sanders said climate change contributed to global terrorism and attributed the claim to the CIA. ""Climate change is directly related to the rise of global terrorism,"" the senator said. ""This is what the CIA says.""
In a Department of Defense release last year, then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said climate change is a ""trend that will affect national security. Rising global temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, climbing sea levels and more extreme weather events will intensify the challenges of global instability, hunger, poverty and conflict."" 
O'Malley made a similar connection between climate change and terrorism last September. Politifact rated the claim as ""Mostly True."" It said the drought in Syria – which limited resources – was not the ""sole culprit,"" but rather ""one of many factors that led to the Syrian conflict."" 
The article stated that Syrian President Bashar Assad's ""recruitment of al Qaida members"" and Sunni Arab genocide are more ""direct"" and ""crystal clear"" causes.

 repeatedly challenged the former secretary of State on Saturday night in a debate where they largely agreed on most issues.
The session at 
Drake University
 was originally supposed to focus on the economy, but the terrorist attacks in Paris changed that. The deadly assault, which 
Islamic State
 extremists took responsibility for, set a somber tone; the debate opened with a moment of silence, the candidates standing on stage with their heads bowed, to mark the tragedy.
The contest is about “choosing our next commander in chief,” Clinton pointedly stated in her opening remarks. “All of the other issues we want to deal with depend on our being secure and strong.”
The candidates echoed one another in calling for a war against Islamic extremists, agreeing there was a need for better intelligence, a better use of the country's vast military resources and the need for a closer partnership with U.S. allies, especially in the Middle East.
Sanders, the independent U.S. senator from Vermont, used the discussion to once more bring up Clinton's 2002 vote in favor of the Iraq war when she was a senator, which she has since called a mistake. Noting his opposition at the time when he was a member of the House, Sanders said the invasion “led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now. I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the modern history of the United States.”

Clinton said the issue of terrorism was far more complicated, pointing out that the United States had been a target long before the invasion, including the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. “We've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing, and no place more so than in the Middle East,” she said.
In light of the horror in Paris, Sanders was asked whether he still believed, as he had earlier stated, that global warming was the greatest threat to national security.
“Absolutely,” Sanders replied, suggesting that “climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism” — with the fight over natural resources like water possibly leading to even greater international conflict.
Asked by moderator John Dickerson of CBS News whether they would use the words “radical Islam” to describe the United States' enemy — as many Republicans do — all three Democrats balked.
“Let's not fall into the trap of thinking all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here,” said former Maryland Gov. O'Malley, suggesting the vast majority of law-abiding Muslims are the “first line of defense” against radical elements.
Strikingly, some of the testiest exchanges of the evening came on issues where the differences among the candidates were largely a matter of degree.
Sanders and O'Malley insisted, for instance, on setting a $15 national minimum wage rather than the $12 that Clinton favors, and suggested her history of taking generous contributions from Wall Street undercut her promises to impose stiffer regulations. “Weak tea,” O'Malley said dismissively.
Clinton repeatedly brushed aside the challenges, saying she shared the same broad goals but would pursue policies that were more pragmatic and more apt to achieve results.
“I have nothing against the passion my two friends have here for reinstating Glass-Steagall,” she said, when the debate turned to a discussion of the Depression-era bank regulation. “I just don't think it gets the job done.”
Clinton entered the evening in the strongest political position since announcing her candidacy in April, benefiting from an impressive performance at the Democrats' first debate last month and her marathon testimony before lawmakers investigating the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.
Nothing she said or did seemed likely to diminish her commanding status.
By contrast, Sanders has lost steam after drawing gargantuan crowds over the summer. He has stalled far behind Clinton in national polls, and has also lost ground in some early-voting states, including Iowa, which casts the first votes of the 2016 contest.
Stepping onto the debate stage, the Vermonter found himself in something of a quandary of his own design. He has long disparaged negative campaigning, boasting he has never run an attack ad in his decades-long political career.
He also seemed to conspicuously foreclose one line of attack on Clinton, her controversial use of a private server while secretary of State, declaring in last month's debate that the “American people were sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.” Aides have been pressing Sanders to assume a more combative stance, but asked Saturday night whether he was reconsidering his comment, Sanders emphatically said he was not. “I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email,” he said. “I am still sick and tired.”
“What I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, or we have more people in jail than any other country, or we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality,” Sanders said. “We've gotten off of Hillary Clinton's emails, good. Let's go to major issues facing America.”
“I agree completely,” Clinton said. “I couldn't have said it better myself.”
But she bridled when Sanders attacked her over her fundraising on Wall Street, suggesting that bankers would not contribute so much money if they did not think they would get something in response. “Maybe they're dumb,” he said. “I don't think so.”
Clinton responded that Sanders was trying to “impugn [her] integrity” and noted that two hedge-fund billionaires were already running advertisements against her in Iowa.
The exchange led to a seeming Clinton stumble, when she referred to her work helping Wall Street recover from the Sept. 11 attacks. “I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York; that was good for the economy,” Clinton said.
The negative reaction on social media was swift, including a Tweet from one critic who was incredulous that Clinton invoked the terrorist attacks in defending her relationship with Wall Street. When the comment was read to her onstage, Clinton said she was sorry if her remark — quickly seized upon by Republican opponents — was misconstrued.
In another response that may echo later in the campaign, Clinton inadvertently raised the generational issue during a discussion of the protests sweeping college campuses. Republicans have repeatedly portrayed her as a has-been compared with some of their more youthful candidates.
“I come from the '60s, a long time ago,” she said. “There was a lot of activism on campus. Civil rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism. And I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out. Obviously, I believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other.”
O'Malley has struggled to be anything more than an afterthought in the Clinton-Sanders contest and he repeatedly took after both rivals.
He cited his record as Maryland's chief executive, saying, for instance, that while all three support a higher minimum wage, in his state “it was not just a theory … we did it.”
The stage was less crowded than at the Democrats' first debate last month in Las Vegas. Former Sens. 
Jim Webb
 of Virginia and 
Lincoln Chafee
 of Rhode Island both quit the contest after their poor showings.
That opened up the two-hour program for a longer, deeper series of exchanges. But that didn't mean they broke a lot of new substantive ground. Much of the conversation touched on issues they had covered before.
Clinton again attacked Sanders on guns, one of the few areas where she is to the left of the Vermont senator.
“There are different records,” Clinton said. “I know that Sen. Sanders had a different vote than I did when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers. That was a terrible mistake. It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate legislators, not just in Washington but across the country.”
Sanders cited his votes for certain gun controls and said he would reconsider the liability issue.
O'Malley said Clinton had her own consistency problems, arguing she had repeatedly changed her position for political reasons. “There's a big difference between leading by polls and leading by principle,” he said.
To the delight of the partisan crowd, all three candidates positioned themselves as aggressively pro-immigrant.
“The fact of the matter is — and let's say it in our debate because you will never hear it from that immigrant-bashing carnival barker Donald Trump — the truth of the matter is net immigration from Mexico last year was zero,” O'Malley said in response to weighing immigration reform against the need for border security.
“We've been focusing on border security to exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform,” he said. “Our symbol is the Statue of Liberty; it is not a barbed wire fence.”
Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, drew one of the biggest laughs of the night from the university audience, during a discussion of taxes. All three candidates said they favored higher rates for well-off Americans to pay for such things as cheaper college tuition for students.
“We haven't come up with an exact number yet,” Sanders said. “But it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90%.... I'm not a socialist compared to Eisenhower.”

                         The Paris attacks have reawakened martial feelings absent since 9/11.

Remember the mood in America just after 9/11? The surge of super-patriotism (dare we say jingoism)? The pall of political correctness (you’re fired, Bill Maher). The phrases that so resonated: “Let’s roll.” “You’re either with us or against us.” “Bring ‘em on.” Something like that is taking hold in France right now after Friday night’s horror, one of the worst terrorist attacks on Western soil since that terrible day 14 years ago. 
You could see it in the grim visage of Francois Hollande, socialist-turned-avenger, when the French president declared, “This is an act of war,” pledged a “ruthless” response, and called in effect for a global counterattack against the Islamic State. The frighteningly coordinated attacks that left more than 120 people dead in the heart of one of the world’s most cosmopolitan and beloved cities were, Hollande said, “an act committed by a terrorist army, Daesh, against France, our values, who we are, a free country that speaks to the entire planet.”
Story Continued Below
Hollande is likely to get a great deal of such support. Because in one night of slaughter, the attacks in Paris have caused the tectonic plates of geopolitics to shift sharply rightward, and no one will be unaffected. The new axis of opinion in the U.S. and Western European countries is plainly going to be harsher, more interventionist and less tolerant of, well, tolerance. Americans were already beginning to lose their post-Iraq war squeamishness about intervening overseas: a November Quinnipiac University poll found that American voters, by a 54-38 percent margin, backed sending U.S. troops to fight the Islamic State in Iraq. It’s safe to assume we’re about to grow more even more interventionist in mood, and Obama, as is his wont, may well follow the public temper, stepping up the minimalist approach he’s taken to countering Islamic State in Iraq and Syria so far.
Already in Washington a somewhat more subdued version of this martial mood —subdued only because it didn’t happen here this time—is hardening up the 2016 presidential race. Republicans suddenly possess a new attack line against Obama over his withdrawal from Iraq and reluctance to intervene more dramatically in Syria. Obama’s former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton--who is suddenly on the defensive about something other than Benghazi (though we’ll be hearing more about that too)—will feel compelled to remind everyone at Saturday night’s Democratic debate that she was more hawkish than the president on that particular point.
The GOP presidential candidates, of course, immediately seized on Obama’s unfortunately timed declaration in an interview Thursday that “we have contained” the Islamic State. Donald Trump, never one for political niceties, tweeted: ""President Obama said 'ISIL continues to shrink' in an interview just hours before the horrible attack in Paris. He is just so bad! CHANGE.""
Ted Cruz, meanwhile, made fun of Obama’s reluctance to blame Islam for repeated acts of terrorism, saying, ""We must immediately recognize that our enemy is not ‘violent extremism.’ It is the radical Islamism that has declared jihad against the West."" He also embraced his own brand of ruthlessness, suggesting it was time to stop worrying about bombing civilians, whom Islamic State radicals have been hiding behind in cities such as Mosul. The Islamic State, he said, “will not be deterred by targeted airstrikes with zero tolerance for civilian casualties, when the terrorists have such utter disregard for innocent life.” Marco Rubio, already building a reputation for himself as the GOP field’s chief hawk, called for “improv[ing] our defenses, destroy[ing] terrorist networks, and depriv[ing] them of the space from which to operate.”
This new right-wing normal will also no doubt seal the fate of less hawkish candidates—in particular the already-fading Rand Paul, whom Rubio denounced at the last debate as a “committed isolationist” and who can no doubt hear the tolling of political oblivion even now.
***
The tenor of diplomacy will change as well, starting today in Vienna, where talks were already underway on whether the U.S., Europeans and Russians could find common ground against Islamic State at a time when they were still sharply divided over Moscow’s contention that Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad should be shored up; that common ground is far more visible than it was a day ago. Against the brazen brutality of the Islamic State, even the barrel-bombing Assad will become slightly more tolerable, at least on an interim basis (delighting Vladimir Putin). Old differences seemed forgotten as Secretary of State John Kerry appeared at a news conference on Saturday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and declared: “We are in absolute and total agreement that these kinds of attacks are the most vile, horrendous, outrageous, unacceptable acts on the planet.”
Civil liberties, which made a comeback with the Snowden revelations of 2012, will also now fade once again as an international issue. France and Belgium were already discussing increasing their internet surveillance, long a fraught topic under European law; now they’ll talk a lot louder about it.

"AMES, Iowa (AP) â Fresh from the second Democratic presidential debate, Hillary Rodham Clinton suggested Sunday that Bernie Sanders would raise middle-class taxes and ""scrap"" President Barack Obama's health care law, in an escalating critique of the Vermont senator.
Joined by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, at a fall barbecue, the front-runner said middle-class families ""need a raise, not a tax increase"" and she was the lone Democrat in the debate to commit to raising wages ""and not your taxes.""
Without mentioning her main rival by name, Clinton said Democrats should work to build on Obama's health law and not suggest ""we scrap it and start all over again."" During the debate, Clinton questioned Sanders' 2013 health care legislation, saying it would dismantle the law and empower Republican governors like Terry Branstad of Iowa to administer the health care system in each state. Sanders envisions a ""single-payer"" system that would be run by the states under federal rules.
Even as the field responded somberly to the deadly attacks in Paris, the debate Saturday night marked a feistier phase in the Democratic campaign. Helped by a strong autumn, Clinton has built a small lead in Iowa and is trying to stave off Sanders in the Feb. 1 presidential caucuses.
Sanders put Clinton on the defensive in the debate when he said Wall Street had been the major contributor to her campaigns in order to get support in return.
Clinton responded that Sanders was trying to ""impugn my integrity"" and said that as a New York senator, she helped New York City's financial hub rebuild after the Sept. 11 attacks. Her invoking of 9/11 received an incredulous response on social media and Republicans accused her of shamefully hiding behind the attacks to deflect attention from her ties to her wealthiest donors.
Taking the stage in Ames, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley said Clinton brought up 9/11 to try to ""mask her proximity to Wall Street and the huge amount of contributions and the dollars she has received personally from the major banks of Wall Street.""
""She doesn't have to mask it. It is what it is,"" O'Malley said. ""That is the sort of company, that is the sort economic advice that she would follow.""
Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said following the debate that the senator's proposals would be paid for with higher taxes on the wealthy and large corporations. ""He's raising taxes to pay for relief for middle-income and working people,"" he said.
He also said Sanders would build upon the health care law to provide universal coverage. ""It's not a question of ripping up Obamacare, it's really expanding on the promise of Obamacare,"" Weaver said.
The barbecue inside a massive agriculture center featured another appearance by Bill Clinton, who briefly introduced his wife and joked that after watching the debates, ""I think I'm going to vote for Hillary.""
