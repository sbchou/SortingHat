Join her on Facebook and follow her on Twitter @drpeggydrexler. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. \n (CNN)This week", the election season took a turn for the predictable as Hillary Clinton's hair became the topic of conversation in a Donald Trump media appearance. \nTrump was chatting with Mark Levin, a conservative talk radio host who wanted to know what Trump suspected voters liked most about Clinton. Trump's response was characteristically provocative," if entirely off-point: \""Well", she has a new hairdo,"\"" Trump replied. \""Did you notice that today?\""\nThat wasn't all. He then went on to call Clinton's hair \""shocking","\"" \""massive\"" and agreeing with Levin's suggestion that the pile of hair atop his opponent's head \""must be\"" a wig. \nPolitics as usual", right? \nWhat a woman looks like -- her weight, her clothes, how much makeup she does or doesn't wear --has remained stubbornly front and center in the world of working women, and especially those in, or aiming for, public office. Despite being one of history's most successful female political figures, Clinton has been judged for decades on how she looks: for those pantsuits, for her choice of hair accessories, for her weight, you name it. \nThroughout, many have argued that such comments are directed at Clinton, and her female cohorts, simply because they're women; that no male candidate would be subjected to such constant analysis of hair, skin, wardrobe, weight. And, in the wake of Trump's comments last night, it would be easy to say that things haven't really changed; that even when talking about one of the world's most powerful women, matters still come down to how good we think she looks.  \nExcept it's not entirely true that women are on the receiving end of all the focus on appearance.\nHillary Clinton, for example," made fun of Trump's hair in a bit on Jimmy Fallon (\""just one strand that he twirls over his head like a soft serve at Dairy Queen\"")  And let's not forget all the girl talk about Mitt Romney's good looks or judgment of his expensive haircut as a signal of \""wealthy privilege.\"" Meanwhile", President Barack Obama's personal style continues to garner praise -- that is," when he's not taking heat over his \""mom jeans.\"" \nDonald Trump", we well know by now, has no filter. He says what he thinks, seemingly as soon as he thinks it, and it's not always appetizing. That's why people love him, and also why people don't. It's certainly why he's still generating headline news.  \nAnd yet, in his conversation with the Levin -- which, given that Levin is a well-known conservative, had an agenda from the get-go -- Trump doesn't actually say anything negative or positive about Clinton's hair. He brings it up out of context, sure. But he never actually says it doesn't look good. \nBut so what if he did? The truth is that appearance is part of life, and a pretty big one. \nIn politics, it may not be something to celebrate, necessarily -- certainly not a legitimate reason to elect or not elect someone to office -- but it needn't be something to entirely ignore, either. That's just not how the rest of the world works; why should politics be any different? \nMore importantly, the way to end sexism isn't to stop acknowledging a woman's appearance altogether. That's not evolution; that's just forced silence, which is quite possibly as damning, and as damaging, as making appearance the only thing that matters. \nIn fact, let's consider that the greatest amount of attention put on Clinton's new hairstyle wasn't Trump's doing; it was the doing of everyone else who took his comments and ran with them, turning a blowhard's observation into something resembling an attack. \nClinton may very well be wearing a wig. It seems unlikely, but who cares? Many women do. So do many men.\nDoes Trump? Well, the world continues to marvel at his odd locks. Perhaps enduring many years of public taunting about them has encouraged him to do the same to others or at least sent him the message that the topic isn't off-limits. That, after all, is how bullies become bullies -- they've been subject to the teasing themselves.\nLet's make sure that from now on, if anyone's going to do the bullying," it's Trump.

"{""body"": ""With the Democratic presidential nomination contest all but officially a two-person race", Hillary Rodham Clinton appears vastly better positioned than Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to persuade party primary voters that she would be more effective at passing her agenda and dealing with international crises, according to a New York Times/CBS News survey released Thursday.\n\nMrs. Clinton even undercuts Mr. Sanders on his core political message, with 62 percent of Democratic primary voters saying she could bring about real change in Washington, compared with 51 percent for Mr. Sanders.\n\nThe promise of change, always a popular lure in politics, is at the heart of a striking paradox in the Democratic race. Democratic primary voters say that the ability to deliver needed change is the most important quality they seek in a candidate, and Mr. Sanders\u2019s popularity is highest with voters who want change. Yet 60 percent of Democrats also want their nominee to continue President Obama\u2019s policies, and these voters support Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Sanders by about a 2-to-1 margin.\n\nThis advantage for Mrs. Clinton may reflect all-around skepticism that Mr. Sanders\u2019s leftist candidacy can prevail: Her party\u2019s primary voters expect Mrs. Clinton to be their eventual nominee by more than a 4-to-1 margin over Mr. Sanders.\n\nHis chief indictment against Mrs. Clinton, that she is an establishment politician who is captive to big-money special interests and inconsistent on liberal priorities, simply has not persuaded many Democrats to abandon her. While 84 percent of them see Mrs. Clinton as under the sway of special interests, she is still the heavy favorite among Democratic primary voters seeking a candidate who is a strong leader with the right experience to be president.\n\nAnd while Mr. Sanders is running as an unwavering liberal, three-quarters of Democratic primary voters prefer a nominee who would compromise with Republicans in Congress to get things done.\n\nAfter a month of sharpened attacks by Mr. Sanders against her, Mrs. Clinton has support from 52 percent of Democratic primary voters, while Mr. Sanders has backing from 33 percent, the poll found. The numbers are virtually unchanged from an early October CBS News poll, in which she led Mr. Sanders, 56 percent to 32 percent.\n\nThe nationwide telephone poll was conducted Nov. 6 to 10 on cellphones and landlines with 1,495 adults, including 418 Democratic primary voters, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus six percentage points for Democratic primary voters.\n\nMrs. Clinton inspires more confidence among party members on a range of issues than the lesser known Mr. Sanders, who is only now starting to run biographical advertisements on television. On a signature Sanders issue, regulating large banks and financial institutions, Mrs. Clinton inspired confidence in 70 percent of primary voters, compared with 65 percent for Mr. Sanders. On gun laws, 76 percent of Democratic primary voters think she would make the right decisions compared with 57 percent for Mr. Sanders, whose votes against some gun-control measures have been highlighted by Mrs. Clinton.\n\nOn foreign conflicts, too, Democrats overwhelmingly expressed more faith in the decision-making of Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state, than of Mr. Sanders, a longtime antiwar figure.\n\n\u201cShe knows all the players, all the world leaders,\u201d Jan Lyles, 52, a consultant in Reno, Nev., said in an interview after the poll was completed. She added, approvingly, \u201cShe has her husband behind her for advice.\u201d Three-quarters of Democrats view Bill Clinton favorably.\n\nBut support for Mrs. Clinton lags in some groups of Democratic primary voters, particularly men and younger voters. Among the misgivings is one that has surfaced before in her political career: Fifty-two percent of Democratic primary voters think that Mrs. Clinton says what she actually believes, compared with 62 percent who think Mr. Sanders is genuine in his remarks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much I don\u2019t trust her, but she seems to me to say what she thinks people want to hear,\u201d said Jack Bernblum, 68, a self-employed Democrat from East Haven, Conn., who is leaning toward Mr. Sanders. \u201cShe has recently said something about legalizing marijuana, which is a brand new position for her. I don\u2019t think she means anything she says.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Sanders, who is attracting bigger crowds than Mrs. Clinton and is running notably close to her in fund-raising, the overarching challenge is to transform an insurgent primary campaign aimed at two must-win states, Iowa and New Hampshire, into a formidable movement with broad national appeal. He will face his greatest test yet on Saturday night at the second Democratic debate, which will be televised nationally from Des Moines. Nearly half of Democratic primary voters say they are very likely to watch the debate, and an additional three in 10 said they were somewhat likely.\n\nMrs. Clinton will take the stage after a run of positive developments since their Oct. 13 debate, including strong reviews of her performance there; Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s decision not to enter the race; and a steely, well-received face-off with congressional Republicans investigating the 2012 attack on the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nMr. Sanders has been trying to undercut her political momentum by drawing more contrasts on policy, noting that he has been more liberal for far longer than her on issues like free trade, the death penalty and a single-payer health care system. Yet his attacks have not been memorably potent.\n\nA third Democratic candidate, former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland, will also take part in Saturday\u2019s debate, but he is trailing far behind his rivals. He received 5 percent support in the Times/CBS News poll.\n\nMr. Sanders and Mr. O\u2019Malley have room to grow if they can find a way: Half of Democratic primary voters say it is still too early to say for sure whom they will support. And while Mr. Sanders is running closest behind Mrs. Clinton, four in 10 voters still do not have an opinion of him \u2014 and many hold views that suggest they would be open to his platform.\n\nWhile some Sanders allies worry that his decades-long identification as a democratic socialist will hurt him, 56 percent of Democratic primary voters say they hold a positive view of socialism. About nine in 10 think that the gap between rich and poor is an urgent problem, and most would support raising taxes on the wealthy to deal with it \u2014 one of Mr. Sanders\u2019s major positions \u2014 and 78 percent oppose unlimited campaign contributions to fund-raising committees known as \u201csuper PACs,\u201d as does Mr. Sanders. (Mrs. Clinton is supported by a such a fund-raising arm.)\n\nSue Moon, a Seattle Democrat and a retired teacher, said she did not like Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ties to wealthy donors and Wall Street executives, some of whom Ms. Moon blames for the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\u201cI am much more in favor of the wing of the party that thinks a lot of these people should have gone to jail,\u201d said Ms. Moon, a Sanders supporter.\n\nWhile the Republican presidential race is far more unsettled, with 15 candidates, Democrats think that Donald J. Trump, whose tough talk and outsize personality have energized many disaffected conservatives, would be the toughest to beat in a general election. Thirty-one percent of Democrats said Mr. Trump would be the most formidable opponent next November, while 15 percent named the retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and 13 percent each picked former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas lagged far behind.\n\nLuke Cottrill, a junior high school teacher and a Democrat in San Francisco, said that Mr. Trump would be the most dangerous foe in a general election because he is not only a political outsider but also speaks pointedly in ways that resonate deeply with some people, while offending others. Mr. Trump is also famous in a nation that worships celebrity, Mr. Cottrill said.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is a TV star, and Ronald Reagan was a movie star \u2014 people know who he is,\u201d said Mr. Cottrill, 60. \u201cHe also is a demagogue," and sometimes we Americans are impressed by demagogues and forget about their power over people.\u201d"""," ""byline"": ""PATRICK HEALY and MEGAN THEE-BRENAN"""," ""description"": ""In a new poll", 62 percent said Mrs. Clinton could bring about real change in Washington," compared with 51 percent for Mr. Sanders."""," ""title"": ""Poll Shows Hillary Clinton Is Seen as More Likely Than Bernie Sanders to Be Effective"""," ""url"": ""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/13/us/politics/poll-shows-hillary-clinton-is-seen-as-more-likely-than-bernie-sanders-to-be-effective.html"""," ""topics"": [""foreign policy/national security""]"," ""people"": [""Martin O'Malley"""," ""Bill Clinton"""," ""Jeb Bush"""," ""Hillary Clinton"""," ""John Kasich"""," ""Donald Trump"""," ""Hillary Rodham Clinton"""," ""Marco Rubio"""," ""Donald J.

You have to wait until Dec. 15 for Republicans to do it again.\nStory Continued Below\nTHE NARROWCAST DEBATE: POLITICO\u2019s Gabriel Debenedetti reports: Iowa, Iowa, Iowa. That\u2019s the not-particularly-subtle message pervading Democratic camps as the party\u2019s three remaining presidential candidates prep for their second debate Saturday night in Des Moines, a recognition that the first-caucusing state will likely play an even more outsized role than usual in 2016. \nWhile the direction of the questions may be squarely in the hands of debate host CBS News and moderator John Dickerson, each of the candidates has already started sharpening the message (and spin) that they think will specifically take them furthest with the state\u2019s influential voters. \u201cThe Nevada debate was more of a national debate,\u201d explained BERNIE SANDERS\u2019 lead strategist, Tad Devine," echoing the beliefs of other top Democrats. \u201cI do expect [this one] to be a debate that has more focus on Iowa.\""\nFor Sanders", that means heading north to his Burlington headquarters for two days starting Wednesday night to sit down with aides, and to scour briefing papers that include a deep-dive rundown on Iowa issues outlined by his staff on the ground there. He\u2019s agreed to participate in mock debate run-throughs \u2014 after being resistant to such standard pre-debate fare last time \u2014 and his staff expects that he'll prepare specific policy contrasts to unleash against front-runner HILLARY CLINTON before he flies out to Des Moines on Friday. http://politi.co/1METIPq\nTGIT, and welcome to your 2016 Blast.

An archivist at the University of Chicago agreed in January that Sanders was not the speaker in the photo.\u201d http://ti.me/1Ma6J23\nNOVEMBER SURPRISE: POLITICO\u2019s Eliza Collins reports: \u201cIn a blow to HILLARY CLINTON, former Ohio state senator and minority whip Nina Turner is throwing her support behind BERNIE SANDERS. The move is a surprise, considering how involved Turner has been with the Clintons. The former secretary of state met with Turner in October before her appearance at the Women's Leadership Forum. While she never formally endorsed Clinton, Turner was also involved in the Ready for Hillary super PAC, appeared at a Clinton organizing event, and served on the pro-Clinton super PAC Correct the Record until recently.\u201d http://politi.co/1N04G4k\nHOLLYWOOD HUNK: The Hollywood Reporter: It-guy actor Ryan Gosling, who turned 35 today, asked his Twitter followers to \u201cdo him a solid\u201d to celebrate his birthday by passing around a BERNIE SANDERS campaign video called \u201cCompassion.\u201d http://bit.ly/1WUPiWa \nTURNING THE (WOOD) SCREWS: MassLive.com reports MARTIN O\u2019MALLEY \u201ccalled on IKEA to immediately recognize Massachusetts employees' decision to unionize, stressing that he stands with the Stoughton-based workers.

But sugar supports have for decades been unassailable in Congress, partly due to wide bipartisan support from lawmakers representing states from Florida to North Dakota that grow sugar cane and sugar beets.\u201d http://bit.ly/1Lcypzy \nNOT A FAN: Gawker looks at Bob Dole\u2019s reaction when asked about TED CRUZ. \u201cDole announces jovially, \u2018There are a lot of good candidates.

"{""body"": "" (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Republican presidential rivals Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are backpedaling furiously as they try to outmaneuver each other on immigration.\nRubio co-wrote a massive 2013 immigration bill that passed the Senate. He disavows it now", but Cruz won't stop talking about it.\nCruz opposed the bill, but he offered amendments to massively increase legal immigration. Now he says that's not a good idea after all, but Rubio won't let him off the hook.\nBoth senators are maneuvering to appeal to conservative GOP presidential primary voters in a campaign shadowed by Donald Trump, who wants to deport all 11.5 million immigrants in this country illegally. Trump's hard-line stance has pushed the entire GOP field to the right and may create problems for the eventual GOP nominee facing a more diverse general election electorate. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush pointed to that possibility in Tuesday night's GOP debate when he said that Hillary Rodham Clinton's Democratic campaign would be doing high-fives at such talk.\nOn Thursday Cruz did a complete about-face on one of his long-held immigration stances," telling conservative talk host Laura Ingraham when asked whether he would increase the numbers of legal immigrants to the U.S.: \""I don't believe that's a good idea.\""\nBut during the Senate immigration debate two years ago the Texas senator was an outspoken advocate for increasing legal immigration"," particularly for highly skilled immigrants. He called legal immigration \""a pillar of our nation's heritage and strength\"" and introduced amendments to double the cap on legal immigration and increase the number of high-skilled immigrant visas by 500 percent.\nCruz also proposed an amendment to eliminate the path to citizenship in the Senate bill", allowing immigrants in the country illegally to end up with legal status short of citizenship instead.\nRubio highlighted those stances in a campaign appearance in South Carolina on Thursday," saying: \""Ted is a supporter of legalizing people that are in this country illegally. ... If you look at it"," I don't think our positions are dramatically different.\""\nBrian Phillips", Cruz's rapid response director, disputed that over Twitter, arguing in a series of tweets that Cruz was not seeking to support legal status for immigrants in the country illegally," only to oppose citizenship. \""For the 1000th time"," his amdt had nothing to do with legalization. He intentionally focused on citizenship only ... to illustrate that Dems weren't serious about passing real reform.\""\nFor his part", Cruz sought to use his appearance on Ingraham's show to highlight Rubio's role authoring the Senate immigration bill with its divisive path to citizenship for many of the immigrants in this country illegally. The legislation passed the Senate on a bipartisan vote in 2013 but ended up dying in the House, and President Barack Obama ultimately addressed the issue through executive actions now tied up in court.\nWhen asked about Rubio, Cruz said," \""You know where someone is based on their actions", as the Scripture says, you shall know them by their fruits,"\""\nSpeaking of Rubio and the other authors of the Senate bill", Cruz also said," \""They fought tooth and nail to try to jam this amnesty down the American people's throat over and over and over again.\""\nRubio now says that a single", comprehensive immigration bill is not the way to go and he would not address the status of the people in this country illegally before securing the border and remaking the legal immigration system. Ultimately he would still allow people here illegally to qualify for citizenship," but only after 15 years."""," ""byline"": """""," ""description"": ""WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Republican presidential rivals Sens.
