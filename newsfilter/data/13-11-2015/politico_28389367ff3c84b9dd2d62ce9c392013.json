He\u2019s agreed to participate in mock debate run-throughs \u2014 after being resistant to such standard pre-debate fare last time \u2014 and his staff expects that he'll prepare specific policy contrasts to unleash against front-runner Hillary Clinton before he flies out to Des Moines on Friday.\nFor O\u2019Malley, it\u2019s meant all-but-shouting into a loudspeaker that he\u2019ll aggressively attack Clinton and Sanders over their past records, recognizing that his poll numbers soon need to reach the neighborhood of the 15 percent viability threshold needed to win delegates from the state's precincts under the caucus rules if he plans to be a factor in the race. Eager to amp up the pressure, O\u2019Malley won\u2019t be sitting for long Baltimore prep sessions in the days leading up to the debate: instead, he was in Austin on Thursday meeting with a family that would benefit from the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program, using the opportunity to further contrast with Sanders and Clinton over immigration. It's a policy area his team has identified as a winner for the former Maryland governor \u2014 who they hope to position as the true Democratic heir to Obama and his Iowa backers.\n\n\n\n            By \nNoah Weiland\n\nThe front-running Clinton is taking a break from the campaign and cash trail after a pair of New York City fundraising events on Wednesday while her staff tries to manage her newly-sky-high expectations following her strong October. She just has to protect her lead in Iowa when she takes the Drake University stage, said a handful of people in her orbit, pointing to her speech at the state party\u2019s Jefferson-Jackson dinner this fall as a guide. That means articulating a specific, forward-looking policy slate \u2014 and not taking the bait while her opponents eagerly pick at her past record.\nThe three divergent approaches will underscore the seemingly hard-wired caucus dynamics: a clear and dominant favorite chased by two challengers focused on proving they should be taken seriously. Democrats associated with all campaigns acknowledge if Clinton were to win Iowa \u2014 a state where she finished in third place in 2008 \u2014 handily in February, Sanders\u2019 uphill path to the nomination would become even steeper. So his brain trust is squarely focused on keeping the margin close there.\n\u201cWe recognize that she\u2019s got a real lead there. A lot of it can be attributed to her having long-standing ties with voters, and institutional ties in both states. But she also had three months on television in Iowa and New Hampshire,\u201d Devine said, alluding to the Clinton advertisements that plastered the early-voting states\u2019 airwaves starting this summer.\nBut, he added, \u201cWe\u2019ve looked at them as being states that are symbiotic. What happens in Iowa can drastically effect what happens in New Hampshire, so it\u2019s very important for Bernie to demonstrate in Iowa that he is a strong national candidate who can compete with Hillary.\"\nClinton\u2019s Iowa lead is 17 points, according to the Huffington Post Pollster average, and she\u2019s down by 8 points in New Hampshire. (O\u2019Malley sits 46 and 40 points behind the leader in each state, respectively.)\nHowever, the former secretary of state\u2019s aides are not eager to talk about locking up Iowa anytime soon \u2014 if anything, they are aiming to lower public expectations for Clinton\u2019s debate performance. Following her strong showing in the first debate, Clinton is faced with the challenge of peeling away from her rivals without looking like she\u2019s punching down \u2014 and defending herself while the others increasingly attack her for being untrustworthy or overly political.\nAs such, she\u2019s unlikely to proactively go after either of her rivals in a specific way, like she did at the last debate in criticizing Sanders\u2019 record on gun control.\n\u201cYou\u2019re much better off counterpunching than punching in her situation,\u201d explained Bob Shrum, who was a senior advisor to both John Kerry in 2004 and Al Gore in 2000.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t launch negative attacks. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any big reason to do it right now. Going into the first debate they were very worried about Sanders\u2019 surge. And I don\u2019t think he\u2019s still surging.\"\nTeam Sanders\u2019 calculation is different: the senator\u2019s campaign is running a soft, biography-laden television ad in both Iowa and New Hampshire, and he\u2019s been focused on showing his personable side on the trail.\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\nBut he\u2019s also likely to challenge Clinton on a series of policy points, aides said, so they want him to use his prep sessions to find a way to strike the balance between being relatable to voters, and politically aggressive at the same time.\nIf that works, Sanders\u2019 team expects to leverage its online fundraising tools to take its debate success to the bank, like last time, when it raised $2.5 million in the 24 hours after the forum \u2014 nearly double O\u2019Malley's entire third-quarter haul.\nThe former Maryland governor is, accordingly, in the most precarious situation, forcing him to flash the most fire.\nBelieving that the narrowed field will give the candidate more time in the spotlight, O'Malley's allies predict an onslaught of criticism toward both Sanders \u2014 over his status as an independent and his call for a primary challenge to Obama in 2012 \u2014 and Clinton \u2014 over issues where she has shifted, most notably on immigration.\nO\u2019Malley has gone out of his way to needle Clinton over the last few days, most recently comparing her policies to Donald Trump's in a tweet after she reminded New Hampshire voters that she \u201cvoted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in.\u201d \nBy lurching away from its hands-off-Clinton policy \u2014 borne out of fear of raising his name recognition through negative attacks \u2014 O'Malley's projected that he's likely to take his new tone to the debate stage in Des Moines, after his rhetoric reached its sharpest point yet at a Sunday immigration reform forum in Nevada:\n\u201cWe are not going to solve this problem with poll-tested triangulation and half-truths,\u201d he said. \u201cNor will we solve this problem by falsely asserting that immigrants take our jobs or lower our wages.\"\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Clinton, Sanders and O'Malley will have a national audience Saturday but they'll be narrowcasting to a much smaller group of voters.", "title": "Democratic debate stamped with Iowa imprint", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/democratic-debate-strategy-preview-215790", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Bob Shrum", "Elena Schneider", "Tad Devine", "Richard Shelby", "Steven Shepard", "Jeremy Herb", "Jenny Hopkinson", "Kevin Robillard", "Brian Mahoney", "Caitlin Emma", "Nahal Toosi", "Josh Gerstein", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Al Gore", "Rich Lowry", "Bryan Bender", "Bernie Becker", "John Dickerson", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Martin O'Malley", "Neera Tanden", "Noah Weiland", "Alex Isenstadt", "Bernie Sanders", "Donald Trump", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Jeff Greenfield", "Eric Wolff", "David Vitter", "Tim Starks", "Zachary Warmbrodt", "John Kerry", "Jason Kander", "Tony Romm", "Daniel Strauss", "Hillary Clinton", "Doug Palmer", "Rick Reed", "Brianna Ehley", "Darren Goode", "Darius Tahir", "Ben Carson", "Paul Ryan"], "orgs": ["Congress", "Swift Boat", "Iowa Democratic Party", "UFCW", "NAFTA", "Medal of Honor", "U.N.", "Yale University", "Drake University", "AT&T", "GOP", "WTO"], "election_confidence": 0.9974425995278602, "authors": [{"author_id": 30897, "fullname": "darren goode", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-12 23:02:00", "org": "politico", "article_id": "28389367ff3c84b9dd2d62ce9c392013", "date_access": "2015-11-12 23:46:25.359882"}
