McCaskill\n\n11/12/15 11:43 AM EST\nJeb Bush, once the \"joyful tortoise\" playing the long game in the presidential race, has come out of his shell. What's emerged? Macho Jeb!\nThe former Florida governor has been reinventing himself as he seeks to calm his \"nervous Nellie\" donors concerned about his flailing poll numbers and a series of underwhelming debate performances. \nStory Continued Below\nHis campaign has rebooted with a \"Jeb Can Fix It\" slogan, and the self-described introvert has gone on a bro spree, trying to prove to voters that he has the guts and determination to dominate the still-unwieldy GOP field. \nHere are just a few ways Macho Jeb has made his mark in recent days:\n1. When a voter told Bush he was switching his support from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to Bush, the 6-foot-3 presidential candidate responded with an awkward chest bump. Bush didn't stop there. He's now offering chest bumps to any converts.\nCruz supporter tells Bush he's now backing him instead.

He even has the picture to prove it.\n \nThe waiters had a little fun with me this AM. #nailsforbreakfast pic.twitter.com/S2Zpb3I3Yr\n\u2014 Jeb Bush (@JebBush) November 8, 2015\n3.
