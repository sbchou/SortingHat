The New Jersey governor has made New Hampshire the focus of his campaign, and the super PAC, America Leads, has spent the vast majority of its budget on running ads there.\nStory Continued Below\nThe Iowa ad, which will begin running on Friday, highlights Christie\u2019s record battling Democrats in his liberal home state. It will run for two weeks and on about a dozen radio stations. It comes as Christie is in the middle of a three-day campaign swing in the state.\n\u201cWith Democrats fighting Chris Christie\u2019s every move he did what others only talk about,\u201d says the spot, which notes his vetoes of tax increases and his high-profile battles with teachers unions. \u201cYou want a president with the guts to stop the liberals ruining America, who cares about you and has your back?\u201d\nA spokesman for the super PAC, Tucker Martin, declined to say how much was being spent but called the sum \u201csubstantial.\u201d\nThe decision to invest in Iowa comes as some in the party are calling for early-state polling to determine entry to future debates. At issue is whether debate hosts should base entry on a candidate\u2019s standing in early-state polls, as opposed to the national ones that have been used so far. Christie, who polls at around 2 percent nationally, narrowly missed the cut to qualify for this week\u2019s prime-time debate in Milwaukee.\nCNN, which is hosting the next Republican debate, to be held Dec. 15 in Las Vegas, has yet to say whether it will be using early-state or national polls in deciding which candidates are allowed onstage.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Chris Christie super PAC preps big ad run in Iowa", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/chris-christie-super-pac-ad-iowa-215804", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Elena Schneider", "Richard Shelby", "Steven Shepard", "Chris Christie", "Jenny Hopkinson", "Kevin Robillard", "Brian Mahoney", "Jeremy Herb", "Nahal Toosi", "Josh Gerstein", "Darius Tahir", "Jeff Greenfield", "Rich Lowry", "Nick Gass", "Jack Shafer", "Bernie Becker", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Neera Tanden", "Noah Weiland", "Alex Isenstadt", "Bernie Sanders", "Tucker Martin", "Jason Kander", "Jake Sherman", "Darren Goode", "Paul Ryan", "Eric Wolff", "David Vitter", "Tim Starks", "Zachary Warmbrodt", "Brianna Ehley", "Tony Romm", "Daniel Strauss", "Ben White", "Doug Palmer", "Rick Reed", "Eliza Collins", "Ben Carson", "Caitlin Emma"], "orgs": ["Fed", "Congress", "Swift Boat", "UFCW", "NAFTA", "Medal of Honor", "U.N.", "Yale University", "PAC", "Drake University", "AT&T", "GOP", "WTO"], "election_confidence": 0.9872349334706338, "authors": [{"author_id": 30899, "fullname": "zachary warmbrodt", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-12 20:59:45", "org": "politico", "article_id": "a4731515d8ed83944bc5445853223581", "date_access": "2015-11-12 23:00:06.265559"}
