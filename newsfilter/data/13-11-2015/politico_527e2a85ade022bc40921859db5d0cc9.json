The school has been a staple for primary debates: It has hosted nationally televised debates every presidential cycle since 2007. Sheslow Auditorium, where the debate will occur, is a part of the National Register of Historic Places. It holds just 775 seats and has striking stained glass windows. If you\u2019re eager to look like an insider, refer to the campus neighborhood as \u201cDogtown.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\nWhat time and how long is the debate?\nThe debate will last two hours and begin at 9 p.m. Eastern time. It should look markedly different than the last Democratic debate: With just three candidates, each participant should be able to speak for a length of time equivalent to a stump speech. \nCBS News says there will be no opening statements. Candidates will have 60 seconds to respond, 30 seconds for rebuttals and follow ups, and 60 seconds for closing statements.\nHow can I watch the debate?\nThe debate will air on CBS and stream for free at www.cbsnews.com/live/. No cable subscription is necessary. CBS will also air the debate on its radio affiliates, meaning anyone with network TV, radio or Internet access can take it in. Those already tuned in to the live broadcast of the Midwest favorite Prairie Home Companion can simply switch the radio dial to listen.\nThe debate competes with a local football game as regional adversary Minnesota comes to Iowa City to play the fifth-ranked Iowa Hawkeyes in a critical matchup just more than 100 miles away. The winner of the Democratic debate will not receive the Floyd of Rosedale pig trophy awarded to the winner of the game.\nDoes this debate have a theme?\nCBS News\u2019 John Dickerson told The Des Moines Register he plans to focus the debate on the economy \u2014 especially wages and income inequality. Even health care, education and retirement issues will revolve on the axis of finance. \u201cThe goal of the moderator is to illuminate the views of the candidates on the issues that matter the most to voters, and you don\u2019t need to be on the side of the party to do that,\u201d Dickerson told the newspaper.\nWho will participate in the debate?\nAfter Lincoln Chafee and Jim Webb dropped out shortly after the last debate, the field was left with three candidates: Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley. In April, President Barack Obama joked that even attendees at an O\u2019Malley campaign event wouldn\u2019t recognize O\u2019Malley, but after two debates, he seems to have earned at least a modest following. Just two days before the debate, he\u2019ll dine with a family in Austin, Texas, headed by an illegal immigrant.\nWhere will they stand on the stage?\nIt would be an understatement to say Clinton has a commanding lead, which means she\u2019ll stand center stage, flanked by Sanders and O\u2019Malley. \nWho will moderate the debate?\nThere will be four people involved in moderating the debate, with Dickerson taking the lead as the principal moderator. Dickerson--known for acerbic questions asked on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d every Sunday--will get help from his CBS News colleague Nancy Cordes, the network\u2019s congressional correspondent. Two local journalists will also pitch in on the panel with Cordes: KCCI\u2019s Kevin Cooney and the Des Moines Register\u2019s Kathie Obradovich. Cooney has been a stalwart of local politics and breaking news for decades and is retiring this month.\nHow will Sanders go after Clinton?\nIn the last debate\u2019s most memorable moment, the Ronda Rousey-endorsed Sanders seemed to put the issue of Clinton\u2019s email scandal(s) to rest. But he soon backed off his backing off the topic, telling The Wall Street Journal that the controversies involve \u201cvalid questions.\u201d Sanders continues his implicit anti-Clinton campaign in a state that could decide his fate as a self-appointed revolutionary.\nWill Clinton continue to be haunted by Iowa?\nAfter losing to Barack Obama in a wrenching defeat in the 2008 Iowa caucuses, Clinton has spent the past few years building another sturdy following in the state. Any feelings of betrayal don\u2019t appear to affect her in this less-competitive race. She has the endorsement of the beloved former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, and she\u2019s convincing undecided Iowa Democrats that she is indeed, the best choice for the nomination.\nWhen is the fifth Republican debate?\nThe fifth Republican debate is scheduled for Tuesday, Dec. 15 in Las Vegas \u2014 the last Republican debate of the calendar year. It will be hosted by CNN and Salem Radio and moderated by Wolf Blitzer. Hugh Hewitt will return to contribute questions.\nWhen is the next Democratic debate?\nIn another Saturday night bout, the candidates will next take the stage Saturday, Dec. 19 in Manchester, New Hampshire. The debate will be hosted by ABC News, the New Hampshire Democratic Party, WMUR-TV and the Union Leader.\nNoah Weiland is a researcher at Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Everything you need to know about Saturday&apos;s Democratic debate", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/second-democratic-2016-debate-iowa-when-is-it-215792", "topics": ["ethics", "trade", "income inequality"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Eliza Collins", "Nancy Cordes", "Jim Webb", "Doug Palmer", "Hugh Hewitt", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "Steven Shepard", "Kathie Obradovich", "Barack Obama", "Jenny Hopkinson", "Brian Mahoney", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Darius Tahir", "Caitlin Emma", "Rich Lowry", "Nick Gass", "Jack Shafer", "Bernie Becker", "John Dickerson", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Martin O'Malley", "Neera Tanden", "Noah Weiland", "Alex Isenstadt", "Seung Min Kim", "Jason Kander", "Jake Sherman", "Darren Goode", "Paul Ryan", "Nicholas Vinocur", "Brianna Ehley", "Tim Starks", "Jeremy Herb", "Tony Romm", "Jennifer Haberkorn", "Rachana Pradhan", "Tom Harkin", "Hillary Clinton", "Ben Carson", "Ben White", "Elena Schneider", "Wolf Blitzer", "Rick Reed", "Eric Wolff", "Lincoln Chafee", "Bernie Sanders", "Jeff Greenfield"], "orgs": ["New Hampshire Democratic Party", "National Register of Historic Places", "Fed", "NAFTA", "Union Leader", "UFCW", "Yale University", "U.N.", "Swift Boat", "Medal of Honor", "Des Moines Register", "Salem Radio", "Drake University", "AT&T", "GOP", "The Des Moines Register", "WTO"], "election_confidence": 0.9413362945875061, "authors": [{"author_id": 32625, "fullname": "eliza collins", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-12 19:10:24", "org": "politico", "article_id": "527e2a85ade022bc40921859db5d0cc9", "date_access": "2015-11-12 19:44:17.684409"}
