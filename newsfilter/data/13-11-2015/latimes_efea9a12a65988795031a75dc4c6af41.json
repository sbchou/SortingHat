{"body": "The lieutenant governor\u2019s office filed papers Thursday aimed at keeping two employees on loan from the California Senate but who have been notified they must return to the Senate for reassignment.\nThe Times has reported that a political rift had opened when Senate President Pro Tem Kevin De Leon (D-Los Angeles) took action to slash Democratic Lt. Gov. \nGavin Newsom\n\u2019s staff just weeks after Newsom introduced a 2016 ballot initiative that includes one of De Leon\u2019s pet policy proposals.\nNewsom\u2019s office manager and chief consultant for economic development were told to return to the Senate for reassignment Monday. They represent two of the six people working for the lieutenant governor.\nRhys Williams, the lieutenant governor\u2019s chief of staff, said he filed papers with state personnel officials on Thursday to convert the two workers to full time employees of the lieutenant governor. Williams said the two workers will resign their Senate positions Friday to pave the way for the change.\n\u201cThey have expressed a desire to continue to work for the lieutenant governor,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe decision has been made by them.\u201d\nNewsom is running for governor in 2018 and his candidacy may benefit from his leadership on the gun-control initiative. De Leon has formed a committee to campaign for lieutenant governor in 2018 and might also have received a boost if viewed as a leader on gun control.\nDe Leon had introduced a bill last year to require background checks for those who buy ammunition, and the same language was included in Newsom\u2019s initiative.\n\u201cThe record is relevant but a distraction from a key point and that is, no one person should assume a monopoly of ownership on taking actions that make our communities safer,\u201d Williams said.", "byline": "", "description": "<p>The lieutenant governor\u2019s office filed papers Thursday aimed at keeping two employees on loan from the California Senate but who have been notified they must return to the Senate for reassignment.</p> <p>The Times has reported that a political rift had opened when Senate President Pro Tem Kevin De Leon...</p>", "title": "Lt.
