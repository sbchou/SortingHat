"WASHINGTON (AP) â Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz says he wants to do away with government support for the sugar industry â a veiled dig at rival Marco Rubio, the Florida senator who has long supported sugar growers.
Some conservatives like Cruz want to get rid of the program, which supports prices and protects growers from foreign competition. But sugar supports have for decades been unassailable in Congress, partly due to wide bipartisan support from lawmakers representing states from Florida to North Dakota that grow sugar cane and sugar beets.
In Tuesday night's GOP debate, Cruz listed sugar assistance as among government programs he'd like to eliminate to allow more spending for the military.
""Among them are corporate welfare, like sugar subsidies,"" said the Texas senator. ""Let's take that as an example. Sugar subsidies. Sugar farmers farm under roughly 0.2 percent of the farmland in America, and yet they give 40 percent of the lobbying money."" On Wednesday, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier clarified that Cruz meant 40 percent of crop industries' total lobbying expenditures.
U.S. assistance to sugar growers is not really direct subsidies â unlike some other agricultural commodities. The government does not offer cash payments to processors and growers. Instead, it props up prices through loans, limits the amount domestic processors can sell and restricts sugar imports.
Rubio, who has received campaign donations from the sugar industry, has consistently voted to maintain the sugar program. On Wednesday, he told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that he supports getting rid of sugar supports, but only if countries that export sugar to the United States also get rid of their government sugar aid. The sugar industry has made a similar argument.
""I'm not going to wipe out an American industry that happens to have a lot of workers in Florida by unilaterally disarming,"" Rubio said.
Another Republican candidate, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, has distanced himself from sugar as some conservative groups have focused on overhauling the program and called it ""crony capitalism."" A Bush spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell, said Wednesday that Bush supports phasing out the sugar program.
""Gov. Bush believes we should constantly be moving to reduce government interference and create a level playing field for all commodities on the world market,"" she said.
In 2014, the sugar industry spent almost $10 million on lobbying, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The group says the industry contributed more than $5 million to congressional candidates during the 2014 campaign cycle, split almost evenly between Republicans and Democrats.
When Frazier clarified Cruz's remark about lobbying expenditures, she cited a 2014 Heritage Foundation report. It's unclear how that report calculated the numbers, but the Center for Responsive Politics' data puts the percentage of sugar industry lobbying dollars closer to 8 percent of all agribusiness lobbying dollars so far this year.
Still, the sugar industry's influence is undeniable.
Congressional votes to reform or do away with the sugar aid have consistently failed, and it is one of the only agricultural commodity programs not to be overhauled in recent years. A 2013 Senate amendment to scale back the program garnered 45 votes, with many of the most conservative Republicans voting with Democrats to maintain the status quo. While sugar cane produces jobs in Florida, Louisiana and even Cruz's home state of Texas, sugar beets are grown and create jobs in at least 14 states, many in the Great Plains and the northern tier of the country.
Some of the most ardent opponents are candy companies, which see the prices they pay for domestic sugar inflated by the program. Members of Congress from Illinois, home to Wrigley and other candy companies, and Pennsylvania, home to Hershey, have fought for years to overhaul the program. Phasing out sugar subsidies could also benefit the corn industry, which produces high fructose corn syrup, a popular sweetener.
Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Joe Pitts, whose district is close to Hershey's headquarters, sponsored a 2013 House amendment to scale back sugar support that was rejected 221-206. Pitts says he thinks Americans are starting to turn on the program.
""Government shouldn't be used by a tiny elite to play favorites,"" he said.
Jennifer Cummings, a spokeswoman for The Coalition for Sugar Reform, an alliance of candy companies, food industry associations, consumer groups, business groups and taxpayer watchdog organizations, agrees there is momentum building for reform.
""America should be a leader on this issue and we shouldn't wait for other countries to reform their subsidies,"" she says.

" (AP) â For months, Marco Rubio's campaign team in South Carolina operated out of a staffer's garage, plotting strategy for the first-in-the-South primary from freshly painted yard sale furniture and tiny classroom desks.
The shoestring budget setup was a point of pride for the Republican presidential candidate's team. Now, with Rubio enjoying a burst of momentum as the early voting contests edge closer, the Florida senator's campaign is moving beyond its lean and mean roots.
On Wednesday, Rubio's South Carolina team officially moved out of the garage and into a proper campaign headquarters â though they brought some of the yard sale furniture along with them.
""This election could very well be decided in this state,"" Rubio told the crowd gathered at the office in Columbia, South Carolina's capital.
Rubio's team also opened offices in Nevada a few weeks ago. His staff grew by about 30 percent in October, with more than 70 people now on the campaign payroll. The new hires include communications and digital advisers, as well as field workers to boost voter contact and advance staff to help set up larger and more frequent events in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, the first four states to vote in the nomination contest.
Whether Rubio can effectively build up his campaign infrastructure in those states may determine whether he can turn his natural political talents and easy appeal with GOP voters into primary victories.
""Everywhere I go I hear folks talking about him,"" said Glenn McCall, a Republican National Committeeman from South Carolina. ""So it's the right time to come into the state, set up shop and set up more time here.""
While Rubio's advisers say they're simply executing the next phase in a carefully crafted campaign blueprint, there's no doubt the team's early penny-pinching was driven in part by necessity. The senator's fundraising has been underwhelming and his money totals trailed several rivals through summer and fall, including a lackluster $6 million haul in third financial reporting period of the year.
But buoyed by strong performances in the last two GOP debates, Rubio has been attracting more high-dollar donors, including billionaire investor Paul Singer and New York hedge fund manager Cliff Asness.
With more cash in the pipeline, Rubio is expected to spend more money on travel to early voting states and on larger events aimed at putting him in front of as many voters as possible. Rubio communications director Alex Conant pointed to a 450-person event in New Hampshire last week and a similar sized event in Davenport, Iowa, on Wednesday as examples of the type of settings the candidate will appear at more regularly.
Rubio's more robust travel plans are welcome news to some Republicans in early voting states who have griped for months that the senator wasn't spending enough time on the ground meeting with donors and wooing important backers. While some candidates have all but taken up residency in Iowa and New Hampshire, Rubio has been a more sporadic presence.
""He's recognizing that in order to win in New Hampshire, you need to be available to voters â not just once or twice but more often than that,"" said Donna Sytek, a prominent New Hampshire Republican. She called Rubio an ""attractive candidate"" but said she's also still considering Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina.
Rubio's backers believe the campaign's fiscal caution has already been validated by the early money woes of other candidates. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker quickly built a large and expensive operation, but was forced to withdraw from the race after just two months when his fundraising stopped covering his bills. And despite raising more than $100 million for his super PAC, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush slashed payroll spending by 40 percent after campaign fundraising slowed.
To be sure, the Rubio team's tales of cheapness have helped the campaign define the Florida senator as a scrappy underdog taking on wealthier rivals. Campaign manager Terry Sullivan has bragged about sticking Rubio on budget airline Frontier â which he called ""a special kind of hell"" â and touted his rule of personally approving expenses over $500.
At one of the campaign's Nevada offices, staffers tried to do their part to live up to the less is more mantra. After noticing a pizza place next to a campaign office had free wireless internet that required a password, a staffer walked over and bought two pieces of pizza and asked for the internet access code.
But the cost-cutting measure was short-lived. After about three weeks, the pizza place caught on and asked the Rubio team to stop.

" (AP) â Republican presidential candidates agree that Islamic extremists are running rampant, the Mideast is on fire and Russia, China and Iran are flexing their muscles, yet they are far from reaching consensus on how much is enough when it comes to spending on defense.
It's a political divide that has dogged the GOP since 2010 â defense hawks versus deficit hawks born in the tea party movement. It also reflects a war-weary nation as conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan drag on with no end in sight and President Barack Obama decides to deploy up to 50 Special Operations forces to Syria.
The divisions were on stark display during Tuesday's night debate. In a heated exchange, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio called for raising defense spending significantly. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz wants more robust spending, too, but he doesn't want to make the deficit larger. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul's isolationist bent makes him less willing for the U.S. to get involved abroad and he wondered aloud how spending more money on defense qualifies a candidate as a conservative.
""Defense spending has fallen dramatically on President Obama's watch, and our forces have been reduced and suffered readiness challenges even as threats abroad increase,"" Rubio said. ""Our military therefore needs a serious program of reinvestment and modernization.""
He failed to mention that the cuts to defense spending as well as to domestic spending were largely the result of the 2011 budget pact between Obama and congressional Republicans, who were intent on reducing the nation's deficit.
Paul, who has proposed a budget in the past that would have cut spending across the board to curb deficits, said he wants a strong national defense, ""but I don't want us to be bankrupt.""
Congress just approved spending $607 billion on defense next year, and the United States is still the world's largest military spender ""at nearly three times the level of second-placed China,"" according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Russia and Saudi Arabia are third and fourth, respectively.
However, the bipartisan National Defense Panel released a report last year that strongly condemned the current state of the U.S. military. It said U.S. military strength has been weakened by deep budget cuts that started with the 2011 budget law. ""Budget cuts have left the military in disrepair,"" the panel's report said. The Budget Control Act has created a ""readiness crisis"" and has caused shortfalls in present and future capabilities.
That has prompted U.S. allies to question the United States' resolve on the world stage, the report said. If the budget cuts are not stopped, the U.S. military will become a hollow force, the report said. Several candidates have embraced the panel's findings in their campaign rhetoric, but few have provided their desired price tag for the Pentagon budget.
What some of the other GOP candidates have said about defense spending:
___
JEB BUSH
In his June speech announcing his presidential campaign, the former Florida governor called the Obama administration ""risk averse"" and said that Obama was leading America into a state of ""military inferiority.
""We need to increase defense spending significantly if we are to carry out our global responsibilities today and modernize our armed forces for the future,"" said Bush.
___
BEN CARSON
The retired neurosurgeon told conservative radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt that the U.S. is no longer just cutting fat from the Pentagon budget, but is ""cutting into the muscle and cutting into the bone.""
Carson said he thinks the United States needs to be able to respond to at least three areas of the world simultaneously and will be in jeopardy if it can't.
___
LINDSEY GRAHAM
The South Carolina senator is a defense hawk who has repeatedly clashed with deficit hawks.
""Our ballooning national debt poses a serious threat to our national security, but failed attempts to address it by blindly and recklessly slashing military funding are equally dangerous,"" Graham says on his campaign website.
____
DONALD TRUMP
The wealthy businessman said other nations are beating the U.S. economically and militarily.
""We have to make our military bigger, better, stronger than ever before so that nobody messes with us, and in the long run, it's going to save us,"" Trump says.
At the same time, Trump says, ""We can't continue to be the policeman of the world. ... We have a country that's going to hell. We have an infrastructure that's falling apart.""

" (AP) â Republican presidential rivals Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are backpedaling furiously as they try to outmaneuver each other on immigration.
Rubio co-wrote a massive 2013 immigration bill that passed the Senate. He disavows it now, but Cruz won't stop talking about it.
Cruz opposed the bill, but he offered amendments to massively increase legal immigration. Now he says that's not a good idea after all, but Rubio won't let him off the hook.
Both senators are maneuvering to appeal to conservative GOP presidential primary voters in a campaign shadowed by Donald Trump, who wants to deport all 11.5 million immigrants in this country illegally. Trump's hard-line stance has pushed the entire GOP field to the right and may create problems for the eventual GOP nominee facing a more diverse general election electorate. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush pointed to that possibility in Tuesday night's GOP debate when he said that Hillary Rodham Clinton's Democratic campaign would be doing high-fives at such talk.
On Thursday Cruz did a complete about-face on one of his long-held immigration stances, telling conservative talk host Laura Ingraham when asked whether he would increase the numbers of legal immigrants to the U.S.: ""I don't believe that's a good idea.""
But during the Senate immigration debate two years ago the Texas senator was an outspoken advocate for increasing legal immigration, particularly for highly skilled immigrants. He called legal immigration ""a pillar of our nation's heritage and strength"" and introduced amendments to double the cap on legal immigration and increase the number of high-skilled immigrant visas by 500 percent.
Cruz also proposed an amendment to eliminate the path to citizenship in the Senate bill, allowing immigrants in the country illegally to end up with legal status short of citizenship instead.
Rubio highlighted those stances in a campaign appearance in South Carolina on Thursday, saying: ""Ted is a supporter of legalizing people that are in this country illegally. ... If you look at it, I don't think our positions are dramatically different.""
Brian Phillips, Cruz's rapid response director, disputed that over Twitter, arguing in a series of tweets that Cruz was not seeking to support legal status for immigrants in the country illegally, only to oppose citizenship. ""For the 1000th time, his amdt had nothing to do with legalization. He intentionally focused on citizenship only ... to illustrate that Dems weren't serious about passing real reform.""
For his part, Cruz sought to use his appearance on Ingraham's show to highlight Rubio's role authoring the Senate immigration bill with its divisive path to citizenship for many of the immigrants in this country illegally. The legislation passed the Senate on a bipartisan vote in 2013 but ended up dying in the House, and President Barack Obama ultimately addressed the issue through executive actions now tied up in court.
When asked about Rubio, Cruz said, ""You know where someone is based on their actions, as the Scripture says, you shall know them by their fruits,""
Speaking of Rubio and the other authors of the Senate bill, Cruz also said, ""They fought tooth and nail to try to jam this amnesty down the American people's throat over and over and over again.""
Rubio now says that a single, comprehensive immigration bill is not the way to go and he would not address the status of the people in this country illegally before securing the border and remaking the legal immigration system. Ultimately he would still allow people here illegally to qualify for citizenship, but only after 15 years.",,WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican presidential rivals Sens.

For his part, Cruz sought to use his appearance on Ingraham's show to highlight Rubio's role authoring the Senate immigration bill with its divisive path to citizenship for many of the immigrants in this country illegally. The legislation passed the Senate on a bipartisan vote in 2013 but ended up dying in the House, and President Barack Obama ultimately addressed the issue through executive actions now tied up in court.
When asked about Rubio, Cruz said, ""You know where someone is based on their actions, as the Scripture says, you shall know them by their fruits,""
Speaking of Rubio and the other authors of the Senate bill, Cruz also said, ""They fought tooth and nail to try to jam this amnesty down the American people's throat over and over and over again.""
Rubio now says that a single, comprehensive immigration bill is not the way to go and he would not address the status of the people in this country illegally before securing the border and remaking the legal immigration system. Ultimately he would still allow people here illegally to qualify for citizenship, but only after 15 years.
Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, appearing separately on Ingraham's show, also discussed the 2013 Senate immigration bill. He contended that Rubio had struck a ""secret deal"" with another author of the bill, Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, to block any conservative amendments to their legislation. In fact, the deal among all eight bipartisan authors of the bill to vote as a group to defeat troublesome amendments was well known at the time and not a secret.",,WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican presidential rivals Sens.

Ben Carson says if the United States were to establish a no-fly zone in Syria and Russian planes were to enter it, then those planes would have to be shot down.The Republican presidential candidate made the comment to Iowa radio host Simon Conway on Wednesday after arguing that the U.S. should establish a no-fly zone over the ""Turkish-Syrian border"" to provide a safe haven for refugees.Asked whether he would enforce the no-fly zone if a Russian plane were to enter it, Carson first said, ""If they come into that area, after you have given them adequate warning, after we have talked to Putin, you shoot ‘em down, absolutely.""When the host noted that shooting down a plane could provoke a response, Carson said, ""Whatever happens next, we deal with it, but we can't continue backing down because in the long run, that'll hurt us.""Carson also said that he favors dialogue with the Russian president.

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul on Wednesday continued his attack on Florida Sen. Marco over military spending. 
The two candidates for the Republican presidential nomination clashed at Tuesday's GOP debate over defense spending and the budget in one of the night's more heated exchanges. 
""I went right at Marco Rubio, because I frankly don't think he's a conservative,"" Paul said of his presidential rival. ""He offered a trillion dollars, with a t, for new spending for the new military, with no explanation about how he was going to pay for it. But then he also offered a trillion dollars of a new entitlement program which will be refundable tax credits.""
Earlier in the interview, Paul said of his opponents, ""They all want unlimited funds for the military and they think the military can't have enough.""
""I don't want us to be hallowed out by debt,"" added Paul, saying he understood and felt the nationalism calling for a strong military but the nation couldn't survive mounting debt.

White supremacists are praising Donald Trump for citing a 1950s U.S. government policy that deported hundreds of thousands of Mexican immigrants.,,"“This represents a milestone in the immigration debate.”

White supremacists are praising Donald Trump for citing a 1950s U.S. government policy that deported hundreds of thousands of Mexican immigrants.
After Trump mentioned the policy, called ""Operation Wetback,"" at Tuesday night's Republican presidential debate, Richard B. Spencer, the president of the white nationalist National Policy Institute, tweeted, ""Operation Wetback, fuck yeah!"" 
""Mass deportation would be easy and could easily be done humanely,"" he added in another tweet during the debate.
A post that ran on the white nationalist site Vdare.com and the white supremacist site Daily Stormer called it a ""milestone in the immigration debate.""
""This represents a milestone in the immigration debate,"" wrote James Kirkpatrick. ""At a stroke, Trump demolished the argument that deporting illegals is not feasible. The only question now is whether we have the will to do it.""
A photo of President Dwight Eisenhower pointing at the reader ran at the bottom of the post declaring, ""Ike wants you to help Make America Great Again.""
Under ""Operation Wetback,"" which was implemented under Eisenhower, the government deported hundreds of thousands of Mexicans (the exact total has been called into question) via buses and ships, depositing them in various places in Mexico. The operation has since been widely condemned for violating human rights.
Trump previously referred to Eisenhower's policy in an interview for CBS' 60 Minutes as an example of how he planned to round up undocumented immigrants in a ""very humane way, a very nice way."" At the Republican presidential debate on Tuesday night, Trump suggested Eisenhower's popularity shows that mass deportation could be done humanely. 
""Let me just tell you that Dwight Eisenhower. Good president. Great president,"" Trump said at the Fox Business debate. ""People liked him. I liked him. I Like Ike, right? The expression, 'I like Ike.' Moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country. Moved them just beyond the border, they came back. Moved them again beyond the border, they came back. Didn't like it. Moved 'em waaaay south, they never came back. Dwight Eisenhower. You don't get nicer, you don't get friendlier. They moved 1.5 million people out. We have no choice. We. Have. No. Choice.""
Jared Taylor, who runs the site American Renaissance (which says that ""one of the most destructive myths of modern times is that people of all races have the same average intelligence""), wrote in an email to BuzzFeed News that the policy was a ""useful model.""
""If jobs dry up and illegals realize the feds will come for them eventually, they won't wait. They'll choose when and how to leave,"" Taylor said. 
""Most whites want illegals gone because most illegals are Hispanic,"" Taylor added. ""They wouldn't dare say that, but look at what they do. When the neighborhood or the school turns Mexican, they move. I'm different from other whites only because I say it out loud: I'd rather live in a white society.""
Trump's citing of the policy was also well received on StormFront.org, the white nationalist Internet forum site founded by former Ku Klux Klan leader and white supremacist Don Black.
On his radio program, Black called Trump ""the alpha male"" on the debate stage, and his co-host Don Advo said he was happy that Trump ""evoked Dwight Eisenhower,"" on immigration. 
""Trump is holding firm on his anti-immigration policy,"" said Advo
""Donald Trump is to be commended. He really is to be supported,"" stated Advo. ""One thing that you can do to support him and support the cause of the pro-white narrative is that if you live in a state where you are not registered as a Republican you need to register as a Republican so you can vote for him in the primary.""
""He is telling the truth about the racial realities of the immigrant invasion,"" added Black. 
Brad Griffin, who runs the white nationalist blog Occidental Dissent under the pseudonym ""Hunter Wallace"", expressed disappointment in Trump for saying he would let deported immigrants back into the country. 
""I watched the debate and Trump said that he would deport the 11 million, but he keeps saying he would allow them to come back. That disturbs me. What's the point of deporting all these people if you only plan to let them back into the country?""

Ben Carson isn't only challenging Donald Trump's frontrunner status in the Republican presidential primaries — he's beating him in book sales, too.Trump's new book, Crippled America, will debut on the New York Times hardcover nonfiction bestseller list at #5 — one spot below Carson's book, A More Perfect Union. The yet-to-be-released list was sent to BuzzFeed News by a publishing industry source, and will appear in the Nov. 22 edition of the New York Times Book Review.Trump's title does edge out Carson's in the less-closely-followed ""combined print and e-book"" category: On that list, Crippled America is at #4 and A More Perfect Union is at #5. But many industry observers expected Trump's book to dominate the bestseller list.As BuzzFeed News recently reported, the celebrity billionaire's proposal was passed over earlier this year by some publishers, who were skeptical of his staying power in the 2016 race, and then came to regret their decision.Carson's performance on the Times list is particularly impressive given that his book has already been out for more than a month: This will be A More Perfect Union's fifth week as a bestseller. By contrast, Cripple America is benefitting from the surge of publicity and sales that typically accompany a book's first week on the shelves.Carson and Trump — currently locked in a dead heat for first place in the 2016 primary polls — are both prolific bestselling authors. Carson became the country's most famous neurosurgeon, and an icon in the African-American community, thanks largely to his bestselling 1996 memoir Gifted Hands. And Trump has spent much of this year touting his popular 1987 business book The Art of the Deal, which he calls his second favorite book (behind only the Bible).

"Washington  (CNN)Three more Republican presidential candidates added their names to the New Hampshire primary ballot on Thursday -- while making sure to heap praise on the first-in-the-nation primary state. 
South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham was the first GOPer of the day to file for the ballot in the state's capital of Concord, followed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum.
""From a personal point of view this is a bit emotional for me. I wish my parents were here, I think they are in spirit,"" Graham said while tearing up a bit.
""When you put benchmarks on your life, this is an incredible day for me,"" Graham added.
Graham also voiced his concern over using national polls to determine debate lineups. Graham failed to qualify for Tuesday's debate because of his low support in national polls. 
""I've never been more worried about the early primary states than I am today,"" Graham said. ""The nationalization of this election by using national polls to determine who's qualified to speak, undercuts the process that stood the test of time.""
Cruz also defended New Hampshire's status as the nation's first primary when he filed in the Granite State Thursday. 
""I think it is a tremendous facet of our democracy. You know there's some folks in Washington that are talking about trying to end New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation status. I got to say I think that it is complete lunacy.""
Cruz added that giving that status to larger states would turn elections into a money race. 
""If our elections began in large states, if they began in large states like California or New York or my home state of Texas, they would all be decided by slick Hollywood TV ads, it would just be whoever spends the most money,"" Cruz said.
Santorum criticized the media and the Republican National Committee for relying on national polling rather than surveys in New Hampshire and Iowa to gauge who qualifies for debates.
""Iowa and New Hampshire, in my opinion, should be the ones that set the field, and right now they're not. The media's setting the field by the debate structure, and the way they --  the number of the debates and that's the RNC's fault, and then the debate structure which is a combination of the RNC and the media's fault,"" Santorum said. ""You know, Republicans complain about the media, and  then they allow the media to set the terms of how, who are the top tier and bottom tier, when historically national polls have meant nothing with respect to who is ultimately gonna be selected by Iowa and New Hampshire."" 
Donald Trump became the first Republican candidate to file for the New Hampshire primary last week, a day after the state opened its primary filing period. Marco Rubio also filed last week.
The primary is scheduled to be held February 9.

" (CNN)Donald Trump said Thursday that Ben Carson's self-described ""pathological temper"" is incurable -- adding that it's like the sickness of a ""child molester.""  
""It's in the book that he's got a pathological temper,"" Trump told ""Erin Burnett OutFront,"" speaking about Carson's autobiography. ""That's a big problem because you don't cure that ... as an example: child molesting. You don't cure these people. You don't cure a child molester. There's no cure for it. Pathological, there's no cure for that.""
In his 1990 autobiography, ""Gifted Hands,"" Carson attributes violent behavior in his youth to his ""disease,"" a ""pathological temper"" that the Republican presidential hopeful said caused him to strike one friend with a rock and attempt to stab another. In subsequent accounts of his violent youth, Carson said he once attempted to attack his mother with a hammer. 
""I'm not bringing up anything that's not in his book,"" Trump told Erin Burnett. ""You know, when he says he went after his mother and wanted to hit her in the head with a hammer, that bothers me. I mean, that's pretty bad. When he says he's pathological -- and he says that in the book, I don't say that -- and again, I'm not saying anything, I'm not saying anything other than pathological is a very serious disease. And he said he's pathological, somebody said he has pathological disease.""
RELATED: Trump says most undocumented immigrants don't pay taxes
Carson has used the story of overcoming his temper as the cornerstone of a remarkable life story, which took him up from poverty in Detroit to Yale, where he began on a track that would make him one of his generation's most respected and accomplished neurosurgeons. 
""When he said he hit a friend of his in the face with a lock, with a pad lock, right in the face, I say, 'Whoa,' that's pretty bad,"" Trump said in the interview. ""And when he said he stabbed somebody with a knife but it hit a belt buckle -- I know all about knives and belt buckles. Belt buckles aren't gonna stop because they can turn, they can twist ... they're not solid especially if somebody's got a couple extra pounds on them.""
Asked by Burnett if he were satisfied by Carson's assurances that he left his anger long behind, Trump demurred.
""I just don't know,"" he said. ""You'll have to ask him that question. Look, I hope he's fine because I think it would be a shame. What he's saying is these things happen. It'd be nice if he said none of these things did happen. He's saying these things happen and therefore I have credibility. And what I'm saying is, I'd rather have them if they didn't happen. I don't want somebody who hit somebody in the face with a padlock.""

"Washington (CNN)Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump got into a name-calling throw-down with the chief adviser of the last GOP president on Thursday, with the two trading insults like ""dummy"" and ""childish.""
Trump had taken issue with an op-ed Karl Rove wrote Thursday in The Wall Street Journal criticizing the mogul's GOP debate performance. In it, President George W. Bush's political adviser said, ""Mr. Trump's worst moment came when he attacked the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal,"" implying China was a party to the deal, which Sen. Rand Paul jumped on. 
"".@KarlRove is a biased dope who wrote falsely about me re China and TPP. This moron wasted $430 million on political campaigns and lost 100%,"" Trump tweeted Thursday.
He continued on a Twitter screed, linking to a Business Insider article about how much money Rove's super PAC, American Crossroads, spent on the 2012 election trying unsuccessfully to get Mitt Romney elected.
""Total fool @KarlRove is part of the Republican Establishment problem. An all talk, no action dummy!"" Trump tweeted. 
But Rove fired back, omitting his 2012 record but defending his PAC's investment in electing Republicans in midterm elections. 
""YUGE error @realDonaldTrump RE: Crossroads record - 60% races won in '10; 71% in '14 - leading to GOP House & Senate,"" Rove tweeted, mocking Trump's speaking style. 
He continued: ""Free advice @realDonaldTrump: get facts straight, accept legit criticism, develop thick skin, drop childish insults.""
The two Republicans represent opposite streams in the current GOP. Rove's PAC seeks to support mainstream conservatives as opposed to the tea party wave that gained momentum beginning in 2010.
Trump has been running his campaign as a Washington outsider and non-politician, taking every opportunity to mention he self-funds his campaign and isn't beholden to any donors.

" (CNN)It's official. Sen. Ted Cruz is now a citizen of the United States -- and the United States only.
If you remember, the Texas Republican was born in Canada to an American mother and a Cuban father.  As such, he was a dual citizen -- an American because of his mother, and Canadian because the country, like America, grants automatic citizenship to anyone born there. 
No harm in that, except Cruz is considered a potential candidate for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. And when the news of his dual citizenship surfaced last year, thanks to a Dallas Morning News piece, some began to question his eligibility to become president. (In truth, that was never in jeopardy. Most legal experts said Cruz qualifies as a ""natural born citizen,"" a requirement for the White House job, as stated in the Constitution.)
The newspaper piece came as a revelation to Cruz as well. 
""Because I was a U.S. citizen at birth, because I left Calgary when I was 4 and have lived my entire life since then in the U.S., and because I have never taken affirmative steps to claim Canadian citizenship, I assumed that was the end of the matter,"" Cruz said at the time.

"Washington  (CNN)Pledging to spend more money on the military was once an easy way for Republican presidential candidates to showcase their conservative bona fides.
Not anymore.
The feud among Republicans over what it means to be a national security conservative was on clear display at this week's presidential debate, where Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator known for his libertarian leanings and non-interventionist foreign policy views, dug into Florida Sen. Marco Rubio over his plans to increase the defense budget by $1 trillion over the next 10 years without explaining how he would pay for the increase.
""How is it conservative to add a trillion dollars in military expenditures?"" Rand Paul asked his opponent at Tuesday's Republican debate. ""You cannot be a conservative if you're going to keep promoting new programs that you're not going to pay for.""
Rubio retorted swiftly: ""We can't even have an economy if we're not safe."" 
The heated exchange exposed the fault lines in the GOP as conservatives grapple with a world that seems increasingly in turmoil and a country weighed down by mounting debt.
It also raises questions about the definition of a conservative national security policy, where two of the ideology's traditional tenets -- a strong U.S. military and reduced government spending -- collide. Rubio and Rand are each trying to claim the mantle of being the ""true conservative"" in an appeal to GOP primary voters, even though they take sharply opposing views on the issue.
READ: Takeaways from the Republican debate
Both senators' approaches have footholds in American conservatism, and which one ends up resonating more with voters could be as much a product of the current international security environment as ideological imperatives.
Peter Berkowitz, a senior fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution, described ""a very difficult balancing act"" for Republicans between the instinct for fiscal restraint and the deep-rooted conservative tradition of a strong national defense.
""There's something in my mind worrisome and off in declaring what the authentic conservative position is,"" Berkowitz said. ""The better way to characterize the tradition is really an unending debate between these two sides.""
Paul and Rubio's views on U.S. defense spending are each aligned with two different Republican presidents: Dwight Eisenhower, who reined in defense spending, and Ronald Reagan, who ramped it up, according to fellow Hoover Institution scholar Kori Schake, a National Security Council aide in President George W. Bush's administration.
""There is really an enduring tension between the two, but it is certainly true that at least since Ronald Reagan, the reflexes of conservatism are for more defense spending, not less,"" Schake said.
Schake said that Paul's arguments in favor of fiscal restraint might have gained more traction three years ago when conservatives accepted steep defense cuts as part of ""sequestration"" to hold down the cost of the U.S. budget. But now, a downsized military, the rise of ISIS, instability in the Middle East and a more aggressive Russian posture are making a strong defense a priority for most conservatives.
""The world is looking a lot more dangerous and uncertain for America's safety in the last two, three years,"" Schake said. ""I do think there is an increased appreciation even among debt hawks that we want a wider margin of error, we want a stronger military in order to deter challenges to America's security.""
But Christopher Preble, the vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he believes Rubio's plan to increase defense spending without offsetting the cost is simply ""not a conservative sentiment at all.""
And while the Republican foreign policy establishment has largely embraced the neoconservative belief in an aggressive American military stance abroad, Preble said he believes that ideology represents a ""very small segment of the public at large, including the Republican electorate.""
But an August 2014 Pew Research Center poll showed that a slim majority of Americans believed Obama's foreign policy approach is ""not tough enough"" -- a figure that soared to 81% among conservatives.
Norman Ornstein, a political analyst at the neoconservative American Enterprise Institute, suggested Paul's argument in favor of a more scaled-down military will face significant headwinds since the GOP has pressed its message that Obama is too weak on the world stage and in confronting ISIS.
Instead, Ornstein said Rubio probably ""had the upper hand"" in the debate, with Rubio's hawkish position likely to be more attractive.
READ: Rand Paul: Clinton, Rubio both 'neoconservatives'
""The antipathy toward Obama is so great,"" Ornstein said. ""If Obama's X, you want to be the opposite of X. So if the narrative in almost every case is Obama is getting taken to the cleaners by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, Obama is unable to deal with ISIS, unable to deal with China and you're out there saying I'm not going to do that -- that will probably help.""
Indeed, it's a calculation that most in the Republican field have made. Beyond Rubio, nearly every candidate from Jeb Bush to Chris Christie to Donald Trump has pledged to adapt a more robust posture in fighting ISIS and to build a stronger military to do so.
But both Rubio and his like-minded rivals as well as Paul have some claim to the conservative movement's sentiments on foreign policy. That's largely because views on foreign policy are in no way homogenous within the movement.
In Ornstein's word, on foreign policy there simply isn't a ""one-size-fits-all conservative mantle. 
And James Carafano, vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Rubio and Paul's arguments are not necessarily incompatible.
""We had this kind of caricature of foreign policy that the choice in foreign policy is between invading everybody and every country or sitting at home and doing nothing,"" Carafano said. ""I don't think that reflects the mainstream of where conservatives really are, and I don't think that really reflects where the major candidates really are.""
He concluded, ""The reality of foreign policy is there is not a rule book, and there is not a philosophical or ideological answer for every foreign policy problem.""

"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump insisted on Thursday that the U.S. must keep wages low in order to compete with other countries, one day after he dug in on his assertion that ""wages are too high"" in America.
""Whether it's taxes or wages, if they're too high we're not going to be able to compete with other countries,"" Trump said Thursday morning on Fox News.
Trump first said he believes wages are ""too high"" during Tuesday night's Republican debate, undercutting the populist tone Trump has struck on the campaign trail as he's called for protecting U.S. manufacturing jobs from outsourcing and immigration.
Trump's comments about wages being ""too high"" came in response to a debate question about raising the minimum wage, which Trump and other GOP candidates said they oppose.
""Our taxes are too high. Our wages are too high. We have to compete with other countries,"" Trump said again on Wednesday morning in an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" where he was pressed on whether people can live on the current federal minimum wage of $7.25.

" (CNN)A conservative activist best known for questioning President Barack Obama's religion is challenging Bernie Sanders qualifications for the Democratic ballot in New Hampshire. 
Andy Martin, who has filed himself as a Republican presidential candidate in New Hampshire, argued in a complaint to the New Hampshire secretary of state's office that Sanders had no standing to run in the Democratic primary.
""Mr. Sanders claims that he can run as a Democrat in New Hampshire 'because there is no party registration in Vermont.' The claim is a complete red herring,"" Martin writes in his complaint filed on Thursday. 
Sanders is an independent who caucuses with Democrats in the Senate.
Martin gained some fame during the Obama's first White House run for his claim that Obama was a Muslim. The New York Times reported in 2008 that Martin spread the rumor in a 2004 press release ""Obama is a Muslim who has concealed his religion.""
Sanders strategist Tad Devine said Thursday he wasn't worried about Martin's challenge. 
""I'm sure they have a process, whatever their process is we'll deal with the process,"" Devine said of how the secretary of state's office handles complaints. ""He has declared his standing as a Democratic candidate publicly, signed an affidavit, did so when he filed his declaration of candidacy.""

"Sarah R. Coleman is a Ph.D. candidate in history at Princeton University and a fellow at the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia. 
 (CNN)In Tuesday night's GOP debate, Donald Trump turned to history to provide a model for his plan to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, saying, ""Let me just tell you that Dwight Eisenhower, good president, great president. ... Moved a million and a half illegal immigrants out of this country, moved them just beyond the border. They came back. Moved them again, beyond the border, they came back. Didn't like it. Moved them way south. They never came back. Dwight Eisenhower.""
While not calling it by name, Trump was praising Eisenhower's ""Operation Wetback,"" which Trump claims significantly reduced unlawful immigration in the early 1950s. Here's the problem: It wasn't ""successful"" then, by Trump's standard, and is not a model for a considered immigration policy now.  It was an inhumane program that sheds a harsh light on the supposedly tranquil Fifties and casts doubt on Trump's judgment.
With rising domestic political concern about illegal Mexican immigration in the early 1950s, President Eisenhower turned to his Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner, and his former West Point classmate, Gen. Joseph Swing, to undertake Operation Wetback — named for the derogatory term for Mexican immigrants that dates to the 1920s — with the cooperation and assistance of the Mexican government as historians have shown. 
In a military-style action, beginning in June 1954 and continuing through 1955, immigration agents throughout the Southwest and, later, other parts of the United States, rounded up immigrants without legal status. The deportation program also had something Donald Trump might have loved — extensive publicity, as immigration officers were followed and photographed by journalists courted by government officials.
INS agents began by blanketing communities with public notices encouraging undocumented workers to leave on their own accord, then soon turned to harsher methods, including sweeps and raids using jeeps, planes and ground teams. 
As historian Mae Ngai related, while some immigrants were transported by plane or train to Mexico, a quarter of those deported were transported on cargo boats from Port Isabel, Texas, to Vera Cruz, Mexico, in an operation that a congressional investigation — convened in 1956 — compared to an ""18th century slave ship"" and a ""penal hell ship.""  
Cramped into inhumane sleeping spaces, with ""filthy conditions,"" ""crude"" medical facilities, and no proper safety equipment, a riot broke out on one ship, and seven immigrants drowned on another.  Eighty-eight immigrants died of sunstroke during a roundup in 112-degree heat, while others were loaded tightly on trucks, driven south to Mexico and dumped in the desert. While the INS at the time claimed that the six-week operation netted 1.3 million deportations, scholars have suggested the numbers were far less.  
Despite the U.S. government's major efforts, Operation Wetback was unsuccessful at curbing future unauthorized migration to the United States. At the same time, legal migration did increase, which was the main goal of the INS, which wanted to encourage farmers to hire workers legally through the ""Bracero"" program, which allowed temporary contract workers to enter the United States.  
Between 1953 and 1955, INS more than doubled the number of Bracero visas and many of those legally contracted workers had previously worked illegally.  The Bracero program itself was marked by widespread abuse of workers. 
Where immigration policy is concerned, Eisenhower is not the president to emulate, regardless of where one stands on the political spectrum.
Operation Wetback is just one of many shameful episodes of forceful removal in American history, from the Trail of Tears, when members of several Native American nations were forcibly removed from their traditional lands and relocated farther west during the 19th century, to the forced relocation and incarceration of over 100,000 Japanese Americans during World War II.
 Like those events, Operation Wetback was a shameful violation of human rights, not a model for future policy.

Donald Trump said Thursday that undocumented immigrants cost the U.S. economy up to $300 billion annually, and that no more than 10% of the 11 million living in the country pay taxes.
""Illegal immigration, each year, costs us between $200 billion and $300 billion,"" Trump told Erin Burnett during an interview for ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" ""I don't know if anybody gives you those numbers. Probably not.""
Trump insisted that people living in the U.S. without documentation are avoiding taxation at all levels.
""Do you really believe they pay taxes?"" Trump asked Burnett in a clip of the interview that was aired on ""The Lead with Jake Tapper.""
Burnett pushed back on Trump, noting that undocumented immigrants' incomes are often taxed by state and local governments. 
""But there's very little, percentage-wise,"" Trump said. ""There's very little, probably 5 percent, 10 percent.""
Between 50% and 75% of undocumented immigrants pay some taxes, according to information in a 2007 report from the Congressional Budget Office.

 (CNN)This week, the election season took a turn for the predictable as Hillary Clinton's hair became the topic of conversation in a Donald Trump media appearance. 
Trump was chatting with Mark Levin, a conservative talk radio host who wanted to know what Trump suspected voters liked most about Clinton. Trump's response was characteristically provocative, if entirely off-point: ""Well, she has a new hairdo,"" Trump replied. ""Did you notice that today?""
That wasn't all. He then went on to call Clinton's hair ""shocking,"" ""massive"" and agreeing with Levin's suggestion that the pile of hair atop his opponent's head ""must be"" a wig. 
Politics as usual, right? 
What a woman looks like -- her weight, her clothes, how much makeup she does or doesn't wear --has remained stubbornly front and center in the world of working women, and especially those in, or aiming for, public office. Despite being one of history's most successful female political figures, Clinton has been judged for decades on how she looks: for those pantsuits, for her choice of hair accessories, for her weight, you name it. 
Throughout, many have argued that such comments are directed at Clinton, and her female cohorts, simply because they're women; that no male candidate would be subjected to such constant analysis of hair, skin, wardrobe, weight. And, in the wake of Trump's comments last night, it would be easy to say that things haven't really changed; that even when talking about one of the world's most powerful women, matters still come down to how good we think she looks.  
Except it's not entirely true that women are on the receiving end of all the focus on appearance.
Hillary Clinton, for example, made fun of Trump's hair in a bit on Jimmy Fallon (""just one strand that he twirls over his head like a soft serve at Dairy Queen"")  And let's not forget all the girl talk about Mitt Romney's good looks or judgment of his expensive haircut as a signal of ""wealthy privilege."" Meanwhile, President Barack Obama's personal style continues to garner praise -- that is, when he's not taking heat over his ""mom jeans."" 
Donald Trump, we well know by now, has no filter. He says what he thinks, seemingly as soon as he thinks it, and it's not always appetizing. That's why people love him, and also why people don't. It's certainly why he's still generating headline news.  
And yet, in his conversation with the Levin -- which, given that Levin is a well-known conservative, had an agenda from the get-go -- Trump doesn't actually say anything negative or positive about Clinton's hair. He brings it up out of context, sure. But he never actually says it doesn't look good. 
But so what if he did? The truth is that appearance is part of life, and a pretty big one. 
In politics, it may not be something to celebrate, necessarily -- certainly not a legitimate reason to elect or not elect someone to office -- but it needn't be something to entirely ignore, either. That's just not how the rest of the world works; why should politics be any different? 
More importantly, the way to end sexism isn't to stop acknowledging a woman's appearance altogether. That's not evolution; that's just forced silence, which is quite possibly as damning, and as damaging, as making appearance the only thing that matters. 
In fact, let's consider that the greatest amount of attention put on Clinton's new hairstyle wasn't Trump's doing; it was the doing of everyone else who took his comments and ran with them, turning a blowhard's observation into something resembling an attack. 
Clinton may very well be wearing a wig. It seems unlikely, but who cares? Many women do. So do many men.
Does Trump? Well, the world continues to marvel at his odd locks. Perhaps enduring many years of public taunting about them has encouraged him to do the same to others or at least sent him the message that the topic isn't off-limits. That, after all, is how bullies become bullies -- they've been subject to the teasing themselves.
Let's make sure that from now on, if anyone's going to do the bullying, it's Trump. Not the rest of us.

"Washington (CNN)Some Republicans seeking the White House blasted University of Missouri administrators for resigning in the wake of continued protests, while Democrats said they were standing with students and others looking to address what they say is structural racism.
""I think it's just disgusting. I think the two people who resigned are weak, ineffective people,"" Donald Trump said on Fox News Thursday morning. ""When they resigned, they set something in motion that's going to be a disaster for the next long period of time.""
Trump also called the protestors' demands for change ""crazy.""
""Many of those things are like crazy,"" he said.
Missouri's president and chancellor both resigned Tuesday, not long after the university's football players joined in the protests. The protests are over decades of complaints, but took shape after the student government president took to Facebook in September to complain about bigotry and racial slurs. 
Republican Ben Carson, the only black candidate in the 2016 race, said the resignations are a sign of the ""politically correct police"" going too far.
""It's OK to disagree with people, but it's not OK to destroy them,"" Carson said Thursday on Fox News. ""People are so frightened of the politically correct police that they are willing to do things that are irrational in order to appease them. I believe it's going to be necessary for those people who truly believe in our system, who believe in our Constitution, who believe in our principles and values that made America great, to be willing to stand up.""
But Democratic presidential candidates took sides with the students protesting racism on campus at the University of Missouri.
""I'm listening to the #BlackOnCampus conversation. It's time to address structural racism on college campuses,"" Sanders tweeted. 
Hillary Clinton retweeted her staffer Marlon Marshall, who wrote, ""Racism has no place anywhere, let alone an institution of learning. Standing w/ the students at Mizzou in my home state calling for change.""
Marshall is a former Obama aide who helped oversee health care enrollment efforts.
Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who is also seeking the GOP presidential nomination, said Tuesday ""there's a certain amount of anger out there"" in response to a question about the clash between protesters and members of the media.
""I think freedom of speech is very, very important. Does freedom of speech mean there will be boorish people who say things you don't want to associate with? Yes,"" he said. ""But really in a free society, there's got to be a place for people to make their argument.""

"Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama on Thursday dismissed Donald Trump's plan to enlist a ""deportation force"" to rid the country of undocumented immigrants, saying it was infeasible, bad optics and contrary to U.S. values.
""Imagine the images on the screen flashed around the world as we were dragging parents away from their children, and putting them in detention centers, and then systematically sending them out,"" Obama said during an interview with ABC News.
""Nobody thinks that that is realistic,"" he added. ""But more importantly, that's not who we are as Americans.""
Trump has pointed to a more than m half-century-old deportation plan as the model for his proposal, the so-called ""Operation Wetback"" instituted under President Dwight Eisenhower to move immigrants back across the Mexican border. ""Wetback"" is considered a derogatory slur for Mexicans living in the United States.
""I think the name of the operation tells you something about the dangers of looking backwards,"" Obama said.
In the interview, Obama said Trump's plan would cost the country billions. And he suggested Trump was using the proposal to exploit an anti-immigrant strain.
""There has always been a strain of anti-immigrant sentiment in America,"" he said. ""It's the job of leaders not to play into that sentiment.""

" (CNN)Ted Cruz is facing criticism on the right over a surprising issue: immigration.
The senator from Texas and Republican presidential candidate, who rose to national prominence because of his hard-line stands on everything from Obamacare to immigration, is under fire for his past support of the controversial H-1B visa program. 
Cruz has backed quintupling the number of visas in the program, which encourages legal immigration for highly skilled foreign workers. But it's a position that's causing headaches for him as the campaign develops.  
""You've got Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and even Ted Cruz, to my disappointment, who want to do everything from double to triple to quintuple -- in Ted Cruz's case -- the number of H-1B visas that are available to these largely offshore outsourcing companies from India,"" influential conservative pundit Michelle Malkin said in a video on her Facebook page last week. ""That is nuts.""  
For Cruz, support for H-1B visas has been a way to insulate himself not just from a hot red base quick to label any moderation as amnesty, but also from his unwillingness to say what he would do with the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Sharing his father's dramatic flight from Cuba, Cruz tells reporters or town hall questioners that he ""celebrates legal immigration"" and that he would like to ""streamline"" the process -- even as he cracks down on illegal border crossings. 
But Cruz appears to be changing his tune. During Tuesday night's Fox Business debate in Milwaukee, he framed illegal immigration as an economic threat, choosing the rhetoric used by conservative talk radio hosts who have raked Cruz over the coals, rather than his tried-and-true stump speech about preserving rule of law. And Cruz now no longer supports an increase in the number of visas until the program is reformed, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said Wednesday. 
Ted Cruz draws immigration contrast with Marco Rubio

The U.S. currently allows only 65,000 workers who specialize in science or technology to immigrate legally each year. But the program has come under increasing criticism from protectionists and American industries that say the country is ""outsourcing"" labor and charge there is widespread abuse of the visa system. 
Cruz has of late been more loudly voicing objections to the visa process, telling a New Hampshire voter in a town hall on Wednesday evening that the emerging reports are ""horrifying,"" a shift he signaled in an interview with radio host Vince Coakley last week. 
""I have been very, very concerned at the growing abuse of the program,"" Cruz said. ""That's not what the H-1B program was designed to do."" 
That interview made its way to Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, perhaps the GOP's leading anti-immigration voice. Sessions said he is talking with Cruz about his current position and even hinted that Cruz could flip his position, sounding skeptical that the senator from Texas would still want to quintuple the number of legal immigrants in the future. 
""I think a lot of our members will come out that way in the end,"" Sessions told CNN. 
Cruz is hardly the only GOP candidate who backs the program on some level. Republicans from Bush to Ben Carson have voiced some support for H-1B visas, and Rubio's push for a more ambitious, Microsoft-backed bill has drawn the ire of Sessions, who said Rubio's legislation would ""quash the dreams of more talented Americans."" 

Donald Trump has already shown a willingness to mock Rubio for his aggressive support for the Silicon Valley-backed policy. Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said the campaign is not planning to hit Cruz on the explosive issue, but Trump's hard line on immigration has helped shift the debate to the right on the campaign trail. 
Takeaways from the Republican debate
But given Cruz's ideological purity -- highlighted by a report on Monday from Heritage Action, a political group tied to the influential Heritage Foundation -- his support for H-1Bs may be the most attractive liability to attack. 
Republican talkers have been Cruz's biggest gadflies. Cruz enjoys an unusually chummy relationship with conservative talk radio hosts -- joking before Tuesday night's debate that a leading trio in the industry should moderate future forums -- but some have turned on him. 
The New Hampshire voter told Cruz that her brother in the tech industry might not vote for him because of his position -- which the brother learned about from talk radio. 
""The rhetoric and the policy do not match,"" Rick Santorum told CNN on Wednesday, saying Cruz's motivation for increased legal immigration was ""purely political"" and an attempt to win over business-friendly donors. ""This is a way of having a foot in both camps -- to sound very tough on illegal immigration, but to say, 'I'm going to take care of you by bringing in a whole bunch of people legally.'""  

The unease with Cruz dates back to the 2013 Senate fight over immigration, when Rubio and Democratic leaders led an ill-fated push for comprehensive reform legislation that included a path to citizenship for the undocumented. Cruz fought the bill, but also argued for an amendment to increase in the cap on visas to 325,000, a position he has repeated during the 2016 race. 
But after the 2013 bill died and the dust settled, Cruz continued to be excoriated by some of the movement's leading talkers for his stance.
""I don't care how many times Ted Cruz is held up by the tea party. Ted Cruz is identical to Marco Rubio,"" radio host Michael Savage told his listeners in January 2014. ""Ted Cruz is not to be trusted. I told you he's a snake."" 
Cruz's critics on the issue see room for hope: Cruz does not bring up the specific fivefold increase as often as he once did, opting for vaguer rhetoric. He chided donors and reporters in Tuesday night's debate for not seeing immigration as a pocketbook issue as opposed to a cultural one. And his radio interview last week could foreshadow the package of reforms that Sessions said Cruz is likely to introduce in the Senate over the coming months. 
Roy Beck, who leads NumbersUSA, a group supporting a reduction in immigration numbers, predicted that while Cruz is ""polishing some of the edges"" with his new language, his support for expanded H-1Bs would be used a political wedge to expose ""his real vulnerable spot."" 
Unless, of course, Cruz changes his position. 
""I just see him month by month and shifting,"" Beck said. ""As time goes on, you could end up being in a really different place than nine months ago.""

" (CNN)Donald Trump is pointing to a 1950s-era federal program as a possible model for his plan to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, insisting it can be done ""humanely.""
But one expert who has studied ""Operation Wetback"" said the program of then-President Dwight Eisenhower was deadly and cruel. 
""It was not humane, it was a military style of operation,"" said Mae Ngai, a professor of history at Columbia University. ""[Eisenhower] sent hundreds of border patrol officers to sweep up people.""
""In many cases,"" she added, ""they basically herded people on to big trucks and dropped them off on the other side of the border."" 
Trump has said this week that he would use a ""deportation force"" to carry out his plan and told reporters it would be done in a ""humane"" way, but he hasn't provided details. The real estate mogul said he has heard different things about how ""Operation Wetback"" worked. ""I've heard good reports, I've heard bad reports,"" he told Fox host Bill O'Reilly on Wednesday night.
But Ngai said there's no doubt about the past program's harm or about the unworkability of Trump's plan.
""It's absolutely not possible,"" she said. ""We're talking about 11 million people...You can't round up that many people -- I don't know how you could do it in a humane way, it begs the imagination...This is just bluster on Trump's part."" 
RELATED: Trump promises 'deportation force'
Trump didn't use the name of the program when he cited it in the GOP debate this week -- ""wetback"" is a slur that was more widely used at the time than it is now.  
Under ""Operation Wetback,"" Ngai said, raids began in Texas and southern California, but soon moved as far north as Chicago. Buses, trucks, trains and ships were used to transport immigrants back across the Mexico border.
""There was one infamous incident where 88 people died from heat stroke, because they were just left in 112-degree weather,"" said Ngai, the author of books, including ""Impossible Subjects: Illegal Aliens and the Making of Modern America,"" and scholarly papers about immigration policy and the immigrant experience.
The government used boats designed to carry cargo to move immigrants from places like Galveston, Texas, to locations on Mexico's eastern shore. 
""The ships weren't refurbished or fitted for this,"" Ngai explained. When a riot erupted after a boat made a brief landing at a port en route to Mexico, Congress launched an investigation.
Lawmakers would find that conditions on the ""penal hell ships,"" as Ngai recounted the findings, were similar to those on 18th-century slave ships. The deportation program lasted only a few months. 
An immigrant ""panic"" in the 1950s was sparked in large part by a program that offered Mexican laborers contracted, seasonal work in the U.S. But demand for the cheap labor exceeded the number of permitted legal entries and soon American businesses welcomed a second stream of uncontracted workers, Ngai said.
The actions of the growers, luring Mexican workers across the border, ""was an affront to the authority of the attorney general and the commissioner general of immigration,"" she said. ""So 'Operation Wetback' was their response.""

"Washington (CNN)Marco Rubio insisted he learned his lesson when he abandoned his controversial immigration bill: Congress could not tackle such an issue in a comprehensive fashion.
But on the campaign trail, Rubio says he's open to the most controversial aspect of that plan: a pathway to citizenship for the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants. Rubio laid out this week a list of criteria illegal immigrants would have to meet to earn citizenship -- mirroring the controversial Gang of Eight bill that he has methodically been distancing himself from after it passed the Senate in 2013.
""I personally am open to that,"" he said of a ""very long"" path to citizenship on National Public Radio.
The comments drew Rubio back into the fray of an issue that has dogged him with the right wing of the party since he first tried to tackle it in 2012. He has tried to project himself as a leader trying to fix a vexing issue, while also trying to be sensitive to the anger from the GOP base.
But by playing to both sides, Rubio has sparked criticism from the left and right and prompted sharp charges that he's choosing his position for political expediency. It's a sign that the issue is only going to heat up as he continues to ascend in the GOP race.
Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, an immigration hardliner and an aggressive opponent of the 2013 bill, told CNN on Thursday that GOP candidates should drop out of the race if they back a path to citizenship.
""Supporting citizenship for illegal immigrants should be disqualifying,"" Sessions said when asked about Rubio's position. ""Just like we can't have a GOP nominee who supports Obamacare, we can't have a GOP nominee who supports amnesty.""
Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks said in an interview that Rubio's position on immigration would ""very significantly"" depress conservative voter turnout in a general election if he were the nominee.
""When I see what Marco has said and done, along with other presidential candidates, that is: Their actions and their comments are a definite concern because they undermine the ability of American families to earn enough to take care of themselves,"" said Brooks, a conservative Republican who backs Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for the nomination.
On Thursday, Rubio tried to muddy the waters even further by telling reporters that Cruz was aligned with his position on immigration reform, citing positions on H-1B visas and other matters that the Texan took during the 2013 battle. 
READ: Why some conservatives are upset with Ted Cruz on immigration
""I don't think our positions are dramatically different,"" Rubio said. 
But Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said the Florida senator has made clear he  now opposes moving on a bill in a comprehensive fashion, saying Washington must enact individual pieces of immigration reform -- starting with border and interior enforcement -- before debating a path to citizenship.
""What he has said is that the Gang of Eight bill is dead, and it's not coming back and it has even less support now than it did two years ago,"" Conant said Thursday. ""It's clear that the only way that the way to fix the broken immigration system is by first securing the border.""

In April 2012, a 41-year-old Rubio called a small group of reporters into his conference room to announce a rather bold step: He wanted to offer some children of undocumented immigrants the opportunity to apply for ""non-immigrant"" visas before they would be allowed to earn a more permanent legal status.
The plan stopped short of offering a full-blown path to citizenship, as Democrats wanted. But it elevated his stature and showcased his willingness to dive in the choppy immigration waters -- just as the GOP's presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, had veered right on the issue and was considering picking him as the party's vice presidential nominee.
But in June 2012, Rubio gave up on that plan. President Barack Obama, in an election-year move, took executive action to defer deportations to certain undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. Rubio said such executive actions undermined an effort to do anything legislatively.
""People are going to say to me, 'Why are we going to need to do anything on this now. It has been dealt with. We can wait until after the election,'"" Rubio told the Wall Street Journal at the time. ""And it is going to be hard to argue against that.""
After Romney was routed with Hispanic voters in the 2012 elections, a bipartisan group of senators began negotiating behind the scenes to put together a sweeping proposal that they intended to push through Congress in 2013, when Democrats controlled the Senate and occupied the White House.
READ: Bush on Rubio: 'I'm a better bet' against Clinton
For months, Rubio was flirting with the group and privately negotiating details, but hadn't made a formal decision about signing onto the legislative proposal until April 2013, when he went on all the Sunday talk shows to aggressively defend the effort.
""This is not blanket amnesty,"" Rubio said at the time.
As the measure headed to the Senate floor, Rubio sided with fellow negotiators to defeat any controversial amendments aimed at changing the structure of the plan. He voted against an amendment by Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, to require the completion of 700 miles of
fencing at the border before allowing the pathway to citizenship plan to move forward. And he opposed a plan by Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, requiring that the country's biometric entry-exit system of tracking people crossing the border is fully implemented before giving legal status to undocumented immigrants.
Moments before the bill's passage, Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, said: ""Generations of unfulfilled dreams will finally come to pass,"" adding: ""That's why I support this reform.""

But after the bill's passage, Rubio began to speak much less frequently about the matter. Even though the rest of the Gang of Eight was still meeting regularly to strategize over how to ratchet up pressure on House Republicans to take up the bill, Rubio refused to do so, saying that the issue was now in the hands of the GOP-led House, which never called the plan up for a vote.
By taking that approach, Rubio began to make amends with many conservatives who were furious at his position, but he angered fellow proponents of immigration reform who believed he was caving to political pressure.
In an interview with CNN last week, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., one of the co-authors of the bill, said Rubio was initially ""totally committed"" to the Gang of Eight plan and that his fingerprints were ""all over"" the creation of a pathway to citizenship.
""The fact that he abandoned the bill so quickly because a bunch of right-wing commentators came out against it will not serve him well in his presidential campaign primary or general if he ever got there,"" Schumer said.
By 2014, Rubio began to blame the president for scuttling immigration reform, saying voters had lost trust with him on enforcing existing law since Obama has acted, in his opinion, illegally by the executive actions he's taken. The crisis at the Southern border, where scores of undocumented children were trying to enter the country last summer, made it even harder politically for Rubio to defend the bill. And he has increasingly said that doing anything legislatively in such a major fashion would be a mistake.
""Every massive piece of legislation that has passed over the last 20 years has by and large been disastrous,"" Rubio told Politico in April.
In recent days, Rubio's immigration position has begun to come into sharp focus, even though he was spared from the back-and-forth during the GOP presidential debate in Milwaukee earlier this week.
Despite being an early proponent to give relief to children who arrived in the country illegally at a young age, Rubio has made clear that the president's deferred action program must ""end."" He
cosponsored a bill last month to crack down on sanctuary cities.
READ: Marco Rubio's quip about welders gets torched
Rubio has dismissed Donald Trump's call to round up and deport the 11 million illegal immigrants as not ""reasonable,"" but he added that some undocumented immigrants would be deported.
""There are going to be people who are going to have to be deported,"" Rubio said in Hilton Head, South Carolina on Thursday. ""Criminals will be deported. People who have not been here long enough will be deported. We will enforce our immigration laws.""
Yet, Rubio has signaled an openness to eventually let the 11 million undocumented apply for citizenship, after paying back taxes and fines and taking other punitive steps -- echoing the call in the Gang of Eight plan that would have created a 13-year pathway to citizenship. But that would only happen, he said, after separate individual pieces of immigration reform are enacted, including border security and fixing the existing legal immigration system.
Some on the right are still not satisfied.
""Republican voters are tired of leaders who promote an immigration agenda that serves everyone's interests but theirs,"" Sessions said.

Congressional Republicans once again are weighing a controversial tactic to try and repeal parts of ObamaCare – and defund Planned Parenthood – despite the long odds weighing against them.
The tactic, known as “budget reconciliation,” is tantamount to bringing a knife to a gunfight. But as with anyone so outmatched they resort to the blade, so are congressional Republicans.
And so Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., armed with what he can find, pitched his members at the weekly GOP luncheon Tuesday on the use of the special parliamentary gambit to undo some portions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and strike federal dollars for Planned Parenthood. The reconciliation strategy is still valuable because it can sidestep filibusters and curb amendment options for senators – the two most fundamental tenets of Senate operations.
Budget reconciliation appeals to Senate Republicans because they’ve yet to conduct an actual, concrete vote on repealing the ACA. Democrats held the Senate majority since final passage of ObamaCare in 2010. As a result, they could block such a vote from coming to the floor. Moreover, Democrats continue to barricade the Senate from voting on an ObamaCare repeal – even though Democrats now operate in the minority. That’s because of filibusters. It takes 60 votes to overcome a filibuster – usually at two distinct parliamentary mileposts. Republicans now control 54 seats in the Senate. So the math to hinder an ObamaCare repeal still favors the Democrats.
But that’s the beauty of budget reconciliation. If the House and Senate approve a budget each year, lawmakers get one shot at crafting a reconciliation package and install various legislative priorities which have trouble vaulting the 60 vote threshold. Time is limited for debate under reconciliation. And most importantly, it only takes a simple majority (presumably 51 ayes) to approve the reconciliation measure.

With Republicans running both the House and Senate this year for the first time since 2006, the GOP leadership aimed to engineer a reconciliation measure to purge as much of ObamaCare as possible. A recent addition was a plan to defund Planned Parenthood.
The real power of budget reconciliation lies in the Senate. But Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution dictates that “revenue” related matters must originate in the House of Representatives. So the House teed up a reconciliation plan late last month, dismantling parts of the ACA and defunding Planned Parenthood. The House approved the reconciliation package 240-189.
It stripped the mandate that required that all Americans hold health insurance. It also gutted the decree that employers of a certain size provide health coverage for their employees. Also slashed was a tax on medical devices.
If you abhor ObamaCare and Planned Parenthood, this sounds great, right?
That was until Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., published a joint statement. They argued that the reconciliation plan “simply isn’t good enough.” The trio asserts that they promised voters a “full repeal” of ObamaCare and as a result, this plan falls short.
Fifty-four minus three equals 51. Okay. So the reconciliation plan only needs 51 votes to pass the Senate. But other senators may have reservations, too. Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Mark Kirk, R-Ill., and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, all struggle with defunding Planned Parenthood.
Republicans could potentially pick up a vote or two from moderate Democratic senators like Sens. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., or Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. But either way, the margin for passage is razor-thin in the Senate.
There is a possible Senate landmine known as the “Byrd Rule,” the namesake of the legendary, late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. The Byrd Rule imposes a multi-part test to reconciliation measures administered by Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough. This process is known on Capitol Hill as the “Byrd Bath.” For instance, the Byrd Rule prohibits “extraneous” legislative provisions. It also bans changes in revenues and must not compound the deficit. Legislative items purged from the reconciliation package are referred to as “Byrd Droppings.”
Leave it to the Senate to orchestrate cornpone, parliamentary humor …
Potentially contributing to the deficit is the inherent issue with stripping taxes imposed by ObamaCare. Those taxes were imposed to diminish the deficit.
MacDonough ruled that as written, some of the House’s reconciliation provisions aren’t consistent with the Byrd Rule. Out are taxes on so-called “Cadillac” health insurance plans and the medical device tax. Also yanked are requirements that people buy insurance and the mandate that many employers must provide coverage for their workers.
But the effort to defund Planned Parenthood survived.
This is why Republican leaders are prepping an amendment to alter the House’s reconciliation measure (keep in mind the Byrd Rule doesn’t apply in the House). The Senate GOP leadership brass aims to tweak the reconciliation plan so it comports with the Byrd Rule – yet still preserves the major lacerations to ObamaCare.
But remember, budget reconciliation can’t fillet all of ObamaCare – because Democrats didn’t use reconciliation to approve the entire bill in 2010. So no matter how successful Republicans are with reconciliation, they can only attempt to strike those sections dealing with taxes, revenue and the deficit.
And here’s the rub: even if the House and Senate ultimately approve a unified reconciliation package which takes out a chunk of ObamaCare and defunds Planned Parenthood, it’s doubtful President Obama will sign it.

Donald Trump couldn't beat the team of Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake.
Last Saturday's Trump-hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" averaged 9.3 million viewers, according to final Nielsen figures released Thursday.
NBC says it's the most-watched edition of ""SNL"" since December 2013, when Fallon guest-hosted, joined by musical guest Timberlake. That broadcast drew 9.4 million viewers.
Trump's appearance had been highly anticipated and sparked controversy in the aftermath of remarks made by the GOP presidential hopeful about Mexican immigrants. The show, which also featured musical guest Sia, was roundly panned by critics.

Too many of the men and women I have met on the campaign trail are disillusioned with a government that they believe no longer works for them. Indeed, 75 percent of Americans now believe that our government is corrupt. They believe that it favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy, and the well-connected—and they are right.
For decades, under both Democrat and Republican leadership, the government has continued to grow in size, in power, and in complexity.
Spending increased to $3.5 trillion in 2014. Our national debt is over $18 trillion. Since 2001, there have been over 4,500 changes to the tax code—an average of more than one per day. There are nearly 1,000 rules governing the operation of small businesses, more than at any point in the last decade.
As the government grows more bloated and more complex, it naturally favors the big, the powerful, and the well-connected—because only they can afford to hire armies of lawyers, accountants, and lobbyists to handle big government. And here's the truth: It can't be fair unless it's simple.

I have spent my whole life challenging the status quo and overhauling bloated bureaucracies. It’s what I did at Hewlett-Packard and it is what I will do when I lead the federal government.

That is the dirty little secret of giant, expensive regulations like ObamaCare or Dodd-Frank. They were written in part by lobbyists for big companies who want the rules to work for them. 
The passage of ObamaCare is bringing rising premiums for many Americans—and tens of millions of dollars in profits for drug companies. Dodd-Frank has crushed more than 1,500 of the community banks that provide half the loans to small businesses—while the ten banks too big to fail have simply become five banks too big to fail.
As government grows, it also becomes much more difficult to hold people and agencies accountable and to root out this type of corruption. 
It is how Lois Lerner was able to get away with her illegal, partisan attacks on conservatives. 
It is how the Department of Veterans Affairs became a stain on our nation’s honor, with hundreds of thousands of veterans dying awaiting health care. 
It is how Hillary Clinton has been able to repeat her lies about Benghazi.
But there is an opportunity here, if our next president is prepared to seize it. 
All of our wounds are self-inflicted—and all of our problems are fixable. 
It will take citizenship and it will take leadership, but together, we can fix them.
There’s an old saying that if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. For politicians, regulations and bureaucracy are their hammer. For too long, they have been in the business of managing problems and they have forgotten that leadership is about envisioning solutions.
We need a proven, tested leader in the White House—someone who has challenged the status quo and who is not afraid to make enemies. 
She must be prepared to change the order of things because she hasn’t spent her whole life in the system. 
We need a president of courage and conviction, who is committed to citizen government and who will engage you to solve our nation’s problems.
I have spent my whole life challenging the status quo and overhauling bloated bureaucracies. It’s what I did at Hewlett-Packard and it is what I will do when I lead the federal government.
First, we have to move to zero-based budgeting. Every agency must justify every dollar that they spend. We have to roll back the regulations that are crushing the small businesses that create two thirds of the jobs in our country.
We must also shrink the size of our bloated bureaucracy. Over the next five years, hundreds of thousands of federal employees are expected to retire. 
I would not replace a single one. At the same time, we must move to a pay-for-performance system and turn the federal government into a meritocracy.
We must examine every regulation on the books today. Congress should pass the REINS Act, which will require every major regulation from the White House to be reviewed and voted up or down.
Finally and most importantly, we must engage the American people. Technology allows us to do this easily. 
I will use that technology to engage you and put pressure on the political class to actually get something done.
Politicians have gotten us into this mess. It will take a proven leader and citizens to get us out of it. 
It's time to take our government back. 

Carly Fiorina is a candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. She served as chairman and CEO of Hewlett-Packard from 1999 to 2005.  She has also served on the Defense Business Board, as the chairman of the CIA's External Advisory Board and on the Advisory Group for Transformational Diplomacy for the Department of State.

Charles Krauthammer told viewers Thursday on “Special Report with Bret Baier” that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is “extremely good” at handling the topic of immigration.
“He [Trump] dances and he dekes and he feints and then he disappears without backing it down,” Krauthammer, a syndicated columnist and Fox News contributor said.
Krauthammer was referring to Baier’s Thursday interview with Trump, during which the real estate mogul was challenged about his previous criticism of former GOP candidate Mitt Romney’s stand on illegal immigration. Romney had supported self-deportation of illegal immigrants during his campaign.
Krauthammer noted when Trump was asked about his statement at the time saying self-deportation being “crazy and mean-spirited,” he denied ever having said that.
“Well, in fact he did [say that],” Krauthammer said, “[Self-deportation] is a lot softer than the forcible deportation, which he is advocating now.”

Hillary Clinton's campaign on Thursday unveiled a $30 billion plan to help coal communities rebound as the ""clean energy economy"" develops -- drawing a rebuke from Republicans who accuse her of backing policies that are ""crippling"" coal country in the first place. 
The Democratic presidential front-runner's plan is aimed at protecting health benefits for coal miners and their families and helping them retrain for new jobs. The plan also would use a combination of tax incentives and grants to help coal communities repurpose old mine sites and attract new investment. 
""Building a 21st century clean energy economy in the United States will create new jobs and industries, deliver important health benefits, and reduce carbon pollution. But we can't ignore the impact this transition is already having on mining communities, or the threat it poses to the healthcare and retirement security of coalfield workers and their families,"" the campaign plan says. 
But Republicans fired back, noting that Clinton is backing the highly controversial EPA plan requiring states to cut emissions from coal-fired power plants -- a regulatory plan that coal-state representatives are fighting. The sweeping new environmental regulation may result in the closure of hundreds of coal-fired plants and freeze construction of new coal plants. 
""Hillary Clinton is Public Enemy No. 1 for coal miners and their communities because she wholeheartedly supports President Obama's EPA agenda that is crippling their way of life,"" Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short said in a statement. 

""If Hillary Clinton were truly on the side of coal country, she would stand up to extreme anti-energy environmentalists that run the Democrat Party instead of embracing their agenda that is killing jobs and driving up costs."" 
Eight years ago, Clinton ran as a champion of coal, beating then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama in the Ohio and Pennsylvania primaries with support from working-class white Democrats. 
""But we're going to use coal, there's no doubt about it,"" said Clinton at a 2008 campaign event in Indiana. ""It's just that we've got to figure out how to make it as clean as coal can be."" 
Her rhetoric has since shifted. 
In recent months, Clinton has moved left on environmental issues, pledging to make combating climate change a major goal of her presidency and opposing the Keystone XL pipeline, which was rejected by the Obama administration on Friday. 
She, along with the other Democratic presidential candidates, backed the EPA's Clean Power Plan over the summer -- and vowed to defend and build on it if elected. 
But she's also vowed to protect coal workers, who she says helped power much of the country's economic growth. 
""We have to move away from coal,"" she said in New Hampshire on Monday. ""But that does not and should not mean we move away from coal miners, their families, and their communities.  They kept the lights on."" 
Her plan says Clinton will not allow coal communities ""to be left behind."" 
The plan calls for boosting support for education and training programs for these communities, and boosting funding for ""technical assistance for entrepreneurs and small businesses in impacted coal communities."" 
Beyond providing new economic incentives for revitalizing coal county, Clinton's plan would expand broadband Internet access, invest in new infrastructure projects and find ways to replace local revenue for schools that's lost when coal production plants disappear. 
The coal industry has suffered as governments have pushed new policies to curb climate change and promote more renewable fuels. A 2015 study by Duke University found the coal industry lost nearly 50,000 jobs since 2008. Coal now accounts for one-third of U.S. power generation, with consumption falling 25 percent over the past decade.

Buzz Cut: • Battleground poll shows trouble for Hillary on vets, illegals • Compact GOP calendar gives Christians more clout • Carson chides Trump on deportation talk • Group hits Bennet over Colorado ObamaCare bust • Butt named best tight end
BATTLEGROUND POLL SHOWS TROUBLE FOR HILLARY ON VETS, ILLEGALS Hillary Clinton’s recent stumbles on addressing the scandal at the VA and a new liberal line on illegal immigration didn’t sound very good to swing-state voters, according to a new poll.  A new battleground survey, conducted for the pro-GOP group American Crossroads by pollsters Vox Populi, found that 59 percent of voters in seven battleground states said they were less likely to support Clinton in light of her comment that problems at the Veterans Administration were not as “widespread” as Republicans suggested.  And she doesn’t need any more headaches with the voters in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, Ohio, and Virginia.  Clinton’s deficit to a generic Republican nominee stands basically unchanged at 12 points and her net favorability remained low at negative 22 points. On the question of whether those polled felt Clinton would say or do anything to get elected, 61 percent agreed at least to some degree.  Another danger zone for Clinton in the poll: Her support for allowing illegal immigrants to get insurance benefits under ObamaCare and a promised expansion of Obama’s executive amnesty program. Fully 50 percent said they would be much less likely to back Clinton because of her policies.  The telephone survey included 1,028 registered voters. You can get the full results here.  Postal workers endorse Bernie - AP: “Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders secured the endorsement of the 200,000-member American Postal Workers Union on Thursday, marking the largest labor union to back his Democratic presidential campaign. The union’s decision gives Sanders a boost heading into the second Democratic debate in Iowa on Saturday and comes as the Vermont senator has sought to halt a string of labor endorsements to Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton.”  [But with voters, Clinton keeps crushing Sanders, according to the latest NYT/CBS News poll.]  THE JUDGE’S RULING: OBAMA’S PEN IS OUT OF INK Citing a federal appeals court ruling this week in favor of states battling President Obama’s temporary executive amnesty for certain illegal immigrants, Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano says the president’s rule by the pen has run out of ink. Read more here.  WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… In the category of awesome nature, we give you infrared salmon eyeballs. The Atlantic: “It’s November, and salmon are currently leaving the oceans and returning to the rivers where they were born. During these epic waterfall-leaping, bear-dodging migrations, their bodies change. Their color darkens and reddens. The males develop hooked jaws, and sometimes humps. The red muscles that are so useful for long-distance swimming are replaced by fast-acting white muscles that can power sprints and jumps. And one of the most dramatic changes, and perhaps the least obvious one, happens in their eyes. In rivers, flecks of mud and algae shift the underwater light away from the clear blue of the ocean and towards the red end of the spectrum. The salmon compensate for this: A simple biochemical switch in their retinas gradually enhances their ability to see infrared light.”  Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT? Email FoxNewsFirst@FOXNEWS.COM  POLL CHECK Real Clear Politics Averages Obama Job Approval: Approve – 45.3 percent//Disapprove – 51.4 percent Directions of Country: Right Direction – 27.4 percent//Wrong Track – 64.0 percent  COMPACT GOP CALENDAR GIVES CHRISTIANS MORE CLOUT Ted Cruz is putting his preacher father front and center in Iowa. Marco Rubio focused his debate comments on taxes about the need to bolster families. Donald Trump keeps bashing Ben Carson on character issues.  And it’s no mystery why: Everyone knows conservative Christian voters are the key bloc for the GOP nomination.  But a close-up look at the composition of electorates in February and early March from the University of Virginia Center for Politics shows just how influential evangelicals are.  Here’s the key part: “we found that about two-thirds (64%) of the total delegates in states with contests on or before March 8 will come from states with electorates that may be at least 50% white evangelical.”  While we know that blue-state, moderate Republicans have lots of clout at the end of the GOP nominating process, it is conservative, evangelical Christians who hold sway in the early going when candidates need wins to build momentum. And their clout is increasing this cycle.  The role of Iowa and South Carolina Christian conservatives have been well documented for years, the more compact primary calendar this year gives even more influence to the members of Team Jesus. States voting in the new March 1 “SEC Primary” include those with the highest concentrations of evangelicals, including Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and Mississippi.  Who do they like best? Carson, by a long shot.  He holds a 10-point lead on his nearest competitor, Trump, in the latest Fox News poll. Running third in the key demographic was Cruz with 12 percent. Rubio is tied for fourth among evangelicals with 7 percent.  But when evangelicals were asked their second choice, Rubio jumped up to 15 percent, close to Trump and Carson.  If Rubio remains broadly palatable to Christian voters, he could have the makings of the same coalition that propelled the last Republican to the White House: George W. Bush and his alliance between the GOP establishment and social conservatives.  Cruz, on the other hand, is looking to build a coalition that fuses evangelical support with the more libertarian-minded voters who fueled the original Tea Party movement.  But with both, expect to hear lots of discussion from them about their faiths and families.  GOP insiders worry about attacks on Rubio - WaPo: “Many Republican elites are once again celebrating [Sen. Marco Rubio] as the party’s golden boy, if not its strongest general-election candidate, and fear seeing him bruised too badly during the primary season. ‘He’s articulate, attractive and young. His rivals don’t want him to win, but no one wants to lose him,’ said Vin Weber, a prominent Jeb Bush supporter.”
But Jeb keeps up backhands - NYT: “‘I’m a better bet,’ Mr. Bush said. ‘I’ve got a proven record, and I campaign in a way that is based on that record and based on the ideas that I have that are about the future,’ he said. ‘And I’ve been vetted. I’ve been tested. I’m an open book.’”  [Just ahead of facing major donors in Miami next month, Bush plans to host a fundraising event in Washington on Dec. 3 targeting K Street, reports Politico. Those invited include Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.]  Carson chides Trump on deportation talk - WashEx: “In an exclusive interview with the Washington Examiner Wednesday before a private fundraiser outside of Richmond, Va., [Ben] Carson took aim at Trump’s deportation push, saying it will ‘hurt’ the billionaire candidate more than the Republican Party. ‘I think they hurt Donald Trump in the long run,’ Carson said, referring to the deportation plans. ‘I think there are enough people who know that there are others in the race that are very reasonable. I don’t think he necessarily is the representation of the Republican Party — far from it.”  [AP probes Carson’s friendship with an oral surgeon who pleaded guilty to insurance fraud.]  Prickly politics on Trump’s claim that wages are ‘too high’ - National Journal: “One of the most over­looked mo­ments in Tues­day night’s Re­pub­lic­an de­bate came at the very be­gin­ning. Don­ald Trump, asked wheth­er he’d sup­port a hike in the min­im­um wage, in­stead di­gressed in­to say­ing, ‘Wages [are] too high,’ in mak­ing the case for cor­por­ate com­pet­it­ive­ness…Trump’s polit­ic­al base is dom­in­ated by work­ing-class voters who have been dev­ast­ated by the re­ces­sion and sub­sequent slow re­cov­ery. Many of them are drawn to Trump be­cause they be­lieve his tough per­sona and ne­go­ti­at­ing prowess will re­verse Amer­ica’s eco­nom­ic de­cline—and with it, raise their own wages.”  [Trump keeps claiming self-funding status while raking in donations via his website.]  Koch brother has no plan to play in GOP primary - USA Today: “Billionaire industrialist Charles Koch said Wednesday he’s unlikely to back a candidate in the crowded Republican presidential primary, the latest sign that one of the most influential figures in conservative politics seems less than enthusiastic about his choices. ‘I have no plans to support anybody in the primary now,’ Koch told USA TODAY during a wide-ranging interview that touched on politics, his management theories and what he views as increasing threats to free speech at universities…Koch acknowledged that the vast policy and political network he helps oversee with his New York-based brother, David, might exceed his fundraising expectations before the presidential and congressional elections.”  CONSERVATIVE GROUP HITS BENNET OVER OBAMACARE BUST WashEx: “Americans for Prosperity on Wednesday released an attack ad against Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet on the failure of his state's consumer operated and oriented plan. The group, backed partly by influential GOP donors and industrialists Charles and David Koch, said that it could do more attacks on the co-op failures. The ad says Colorado HealthOp caused more than 80,000 state residents to lose their health insurance. It also cites a Colorado NBC affiliate that reported some doctors turned away HealthOp policyholders for fear they won't get reimbursed”  [Bennet brushed aside questions from Politico about his reported support of a Colorado plan to replace ObamaCare with a single-payer model long sought by liberals.]  More DC dough for Strickland - Wash Free Beacon: “Democrat Ted Strickland attended a fundraiser for his Ohio Senate campaign in Washington, D.C., Tuesday evening that was held by a top executive at the Center for American Progress, his former employer…According to a Washington Free Beacon analysis, the Democratic candidate raised over $170,000 from donors in the Washington area in the first three-quarters of 2015, much of it coming from wealthy consultants, lobbyists, and attorneys.”  Infighting liberally in Maryland - The Hill: Three influential Maryland progressives announced their support Tuesday for Rep. Chris Van Hollen’s (D-Md.) Senate bid, calling it ‘laughable’ that some liberal groups had already consolidated behind Rep. Donna Edwards (D-Md.)…Van Hollen is looking to cut into Edwards’s perceived strength among grassroots liberals after two national progressive groups, Democracy for America (DFA) and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC), threw their weight behind Edwards early on.”  A VITTER LOSS COULD HAUNT GOP IN 2016 The nastiest gubernatorial race in recent memory, the Louisiana gubernatorial brawl between Sen. David Vitter, R-La., and Democratic state Rep. John Bell Edwards could have consequences for control of Senate in 2016 as the NYT reports.  [National Journal has the jaw-dropping details on this week’s Edwards/Vitter  debate.]  Vets want respect - Edwards, who used a picture of Arlington National Cemetery in attack ads aimed at Vitter, is drawing fire from veterans. AP: “[Afghanistan war veteran] Mike McNaughton, a retired National Guard soldier who lost two fingers and his right leg when he stepped on a land mine, urged candidates in his speech at the Old State Capitol to ‘not use our veterans for promoting yourself’ to get elected.”  BUTT NAMED BEST TIGHT END Michigan Live: “Jake Butt finished last Saturday with a career performance and a national honor for his trouble. Michigan's 6-foot-6, 248-pound junior was named the John Mackey Award tight end of the week Wednesday. Butt had four receptions for a career-best 102 yards during the team's 49-16 win over Rutgers. Through nine games, Butt leads all Big Ten tight ends with 31 receptions for 418 yards. He's also caught one touchdown. Butt's second on the team in receptions and yards behind receiver Amara Darboh (37 receptions, 458 yards). In addition, the Pickerington, Ohio native -- who is a Mackey Award watch list member -- ranks No. 7 all-time on Michigan's career list in receptions by a tight end (72) and No. 10 in yards (864).”  Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

Congressional Republicans once again are weighing a controversial tactic to try and repeal parts of ObamaCare – and defund Planned Parenthood – despite the long odds weighing against them.
The tactic, known as “budget reconciliation,” is tantamount to bringing a knife to a gunfight. But as with anyone so outmatched they resort to the blade, so are congressional Republicans.
And so Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., armed with what he can find, pitched his members at the weekly GOP luncheon Tuesday on the use of the special parliamentary gambit to undo some portions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and strike federal dollars for Planned Parenthood. The reconciliation strategy is still valuable because it can sidestep filibusters and curb amendment options for senators – the two most fundamental tenets of Senate operations.
Budget reconciliation appeals to Senate Republicans because they’ve yet to conduct an actual, concrete vote on repealing the ACA. Democrats held the Senate majority since final passage of ObamaCare in 2010. As a result, they could block such a vote from coming to the floor. Moreover, Democrats continue to barricade the Senate from voting on an ObamaCare repeal – even though Democrats now operate in the minority. That’s because of filibusters. It takes 60 votes to overcome a filibuster – usually at two distinct parliamentary mileposts. Republicans now control 54 seats in the Senate. So the math to hinder an ObamaCare repeal still favors the Democrats.
But that’s the beauty of budget reconciliation. If the House and Senate approve a budget each year, lawmakers get one shot at crafting a reconciliation package and install various legislative priorities which have trouble vaulting the 60 vote threshold. Time is limited for debate under reconciliation. And most importantly, it only takes a simple majority (presumably 51 ayes) to approve the reconciliation measure.

With Republicans running both the House and Senate this year for the first time since 2006, the GOP leadership aimed to engineer a reconciliation measure to purge as much of ObamaCare as possible. A recent addition was a plan to defund Planned Parenthood.
The real power of budget reconciliation lies in the Senate. But Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution dictates that “revenue” related matters must originate in the House of Representatives. So the House teed up a reconciliation plan late last month, dismantling parts of the ACA and defunding Planned Parenthood. The House approved the reconciliation package 240-189.
It stripped the mandate that required that all Americans hold health insurance. It also gutted the decree that employers of a certain size provide health coverage for their employees. Also slashed was a tax on medical devices.
If you abhor ObamaCare and Planned Parenthood, this sounds great, right?
That was until Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., published a joint statement. They argued that the reconciliation plan “simply isn’t good enough.” The trio asserts that they promised voters a “full repeal” of ObamaCare and as a result, this plan falls short.
Fifty-four minus three equals 51. Okay. So the reconciliation plan only needs 51 votes to pass the Senate. But other senators may have reservations, too. Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Mark Kirk, R-Ill., and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, all struggle with defunding Planned Parenthood.
Republicans could potentially pick up a vote or two from moderate Democratic senators like Sens. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., or Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. But either way, the margin for passage is razor-thin in the Senate.
There is a possible Senate landmine known as the “Byrd Rule,” the namesake of the legendary, late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. The Byrd Rule imposes a multi-part test to reconciliation measures administered by Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough. This process is known on Capitol Hill as the “Byrd Bath.” For instance, the Byrd Rule prohibits “extraneous” legislative provisions. It also bans changes in revenues and must not compound the deficit. Legislative items purged from the reconciliation package are referred to as “Byrd Droppings.”
Leave it to the Senate to orchestrate cornpone, parliamentary humor …
Potentially contributing to the deficit is the inherent issue with stripping taxes imposed by ObamaCare. Those taxes were imposed to diminish the deficit.
MacDonough ruled that as written, some of the House’s reconciliation provisions aren’t consistent with the Byrd Rule. Out are taxes on so-called “Cadillac” health insurance plans and the medical device tax. Also yanked are requirements that people buy insurance and the mandate that many employers must provide coverage for their workers.
But the effort to defund Planned Parenthood survived.
This is why Republican leaders are prepping an amendment to alter the House’s reconciliation measure (keep in mind the Byrd Rule doesn’t apply in the House). The Senate GOP leadership brass aims to tweak the reconciliation plan so it comports with the Byrd Rule – yet still preserves the major lacerations to ObamaCare.
But remember, budget reconciliation can’t fillet all of ObamaCare – because Democrats didn’t use reconciliation to approve the entire bill in 2010. So no matter how successful Republicans are with reconciliation, they can only attempt to strike those sections dealing with taxes, revenue and the deficit.
And here’s the rub: even if the House and Senate ultimately approve a unified reconciliation package which takes out a chunk of ObamaCare and defunds Planned Parenthood, it’s doubtful President Obama will sign it.
It’s all Republicans can do right now. And that’s why they appear to be armed only with a knife in a gunfight.

Buzz Cut: • Battleground poll shows trouble for Hillary on vets, illegals • Compact GOP calendar gives Christians more clout • Carson chides Trump on deportation talk • Group hits Bennet over Colorado ObamaCare bust • Butt named best tight end
BATTLEGROUND POLL SHOWS TROUBLE FOR HILLARY ON VETS, ILLEGALS Hillary Clinton’s recent stumbles on addressing the scandal at the VA and a new liberal line on illegal immigration didn’t sound very good to swing-state voters, according to a new poll.  A new battleground survey, conducted for the pro-GOP group American Crossroads by pollsters Vox Populi, found that 59 percent of voters in seven battleground states said they were less likely to support Clinton in light of her comment that problems at the Veterans Administration were not as “widespread” as Republicans suggested.  And she doesn’t need any more headaches with the voters in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, Ohio, and Virginia.  Clinton’s deficit to a generic Republican nominee stands basically unchanged at 12 points and her net favorability remained low at negative 22 points. On the question of whether those polled felt Clinton would say or do anything to get elected, 61 percent agreed at least to some degree.  Another danger zone for Clinton in the poll: Her support for allowing illegal immigrants to get insurance benefits under ObamaCare and a promised expansion of Obama’s executive amnesty program. Fully 50 percent said they would be much less likely to back Clinton because of her policies.  The telephone survey included 1,028 registered voters. You can get the full results here.  Postal workers endorse Bernie - AP: “Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders secured the endorsement of the 200,000-member American Postal Workers Union on Thursday, marking the largest labor union to back his Democratic presidential campaign. The union’s decision gives Sanders a boost heading into the second Democratic debate in Iowa on Saturday and comes as the Vermont senator has sought to halt a string of labor endorsements to Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton.”  [But with voters, Clinton keeps crushing Sanders, according to the latest NYT/CBS News poll.]  THE JUDGE’S RULING: OBAMA’S PEN IS OUT OF INK Citing a federal appeals court ruling this week in favor of states battling President Obama’s temporary executive amnesty for certain illegal immigrants, Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano says the president’s rule by the pen has run out of ink.

The Atlantic: “It’s November, and salmon are currently leaving the oceans and returning to the rivers where they were born. During these epic waterfall-leaping, bear-dodging migrations, their bodies change. Their color darkens and reddens. The males develop hooked jaws, and sometimes humps. The red muscles that are so useful for long-distance swimming are replaced by fast-acting white muscles that can power sprints and jumps. And one of the most dramatic changes, and perhaps the least obvious one, happens in their eyes. In rivers, flecks of mud and algae shift the underwater light away from the clear blue of the ocean and towards the red end of the spectrum. The salmon compensate for this: A simple biochemical switch in their retinas gradually enhances their ability to see infrared light.”  Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

Marco Rubio focused his debate comments on taxes about the need to bolster families. Donald Trump keeps bashing Ben Carson on character issues.  And it’s no mystery why: Everyone knows conservative Christian voters are the key bloc for the GOP nomination.  But a close-up look at the composition of electorates in February and early March from the University of Virginia Center for Politics shows just how influential evangelicals are.  Here’s the key part: “we found that about two-thirds (64%) of the total delegates in states with contests on or before March 8 will come from states with electorates that may be at least 50% white evangelical.”  While we know that blue-state, moderate Republicans have lots of clout at the end of the GOP nominating process, it is conservative, evangelical Christians who hold sway in the early going when candidates need wins to build momentum. And their clout is increasing this cycle.  The role of Iowa and South Carolina Christian conservatives have been well documented for years, the more compact primary calendar this year gives even more influence to the members of Team Jesus. States voting in the new March 1 “SEC Primary” include those with the highest concentrations of evangelicals, including Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and Mississippi.  Who do they like best? Carson, by a long shot.  He holds a 10-point lead on his nearest competitor, Trump, in the latest Fox News poll. Running third in the key demographic was Cruz with 12 percent. Rubio is tied for fourth among evangelicals with 7 percent.  But when evangelicals were asked their second choice, Rubio jumped up to 15 percent, close to Trump and Carson.  If Rubio remains broadly palatable to Christian voters, he could have the makings of the same coalition that propelled the last Republican to the White House: George W. Bush and his alliance between the GOP establishment and social conservatives.  Cruz, on the other hand, is looking to build a coalition that fuses evangelical support with the more libertarian-minded voters who fueled the original Tea Party movement.  But with both, expect to hear lots of discussion from them about their faiths and families.  GOP insiders worry about attacks on Rubio - WaPo: “Many Republican elites are once again celebrating [Sen. Marco Rubio] as the party’s golden boy, if not its strongest general-election candidate, and fear seeing him bruised too badly during the primary season. ‘He’s articulate, attractive and young. His rivals don’t want him to win, but no one wants to lose him,’ said Vin Weber, a prominent Jeb Bush supporter.”
But Jeb keeps up backhands - NYT: “‘I’m a better bet,’ Mr. Bush said. ‘I’ve got a proven record, and I campaign in a way that is based on that record and based on the ideas that I have that are about the future,’ he said. ‘And I’ve been vetted. I’ve been tested. I’m an open book.’”  [Just ahead of facing major donors in Miami next month, Bush plans to host a fundraising event in Washington on Dec. 3 targeting K Street, reports Politico. Those invited include Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.]  Carson chides Trump on deportation talk - WashEx: “In an exclusive interview with the Washington Examiner Wednesday before a private fundraiser outside of Richmond, Va., [Ben] Carson took aim at Trump’s deportation push, saying it will ‘hurt’ the billionaire candidate more than the Republican Party. ‘I think they hurt Donald Trump in the long run,’ Carson said, referring to the deportation plans. ‘I think there are enough people who know that there are others in the race that are very reasonable. I don’t think he necessarily is the representation of the Republican Party — far from it.”  [AP probes Carson’s friendship with an oral surgeon who pleaded guilty to insurance fraud.]  Prickly politics on Trump’s claim that wages are ‘too high’ - National Journal: “One of the most over­looked mo­ments in Tues­day night’s Re­pub­lic­an de­bate came at the very be­gin­ning. Don­ald Trump, asked wheth­er he’d sup­port a hike in the min­im­um wage, in­stead di­gressed in­to say­ing, ‘Wages [are] too high,’ in mak­ing the case for cor­por­ate com­pet­it­ive­ness…Trump’s polit­ic­al base is dom­in­ated by work­ing-class voters who have been dev­ast­ated by the re­ces­sion and sub­sequent slow re­cov­ery. Many of them are drawn to Trump be­cause they be­lieve his tough per­sona and ne­go­ti­at­ing prowess will re­verse Amer­ica’s eco­nom­ic de­cline—and with it, raise their own wages.”  [Trump keeps claiming self-funding status while raking in donations via his website.]  Koch brother has no plan to play in GOP primary - USA Today: “Billionaire industrialist Charles Koch said Wednesday he’s unlikely to back a candidate in the crowded Republican presidential primary, the latest sign that one of the most influential figures in conservative politics seems less than enthusiastic about his choices. ‘I have no plans to support anybody in the primary now,’ Koch told USA TODAY during a wide-ranging interview that touched on politics, his management theories and what he views as increasing threats to free speech at universities…Koch acknowledged that the vast policy and political network he helps oversee with his New York-based brother, David, might exceed his fundraising expectations before the presidential and congressional elections.”  CONSERVATIVE GROUP HITS BENNET OVER OBAMACARE BUST WashEx: “Americans for Prosperity on Wednesday released an attack ad against Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet on the failure of his state's consumer operated and oriented plan. The group, backed partly by influential GOP donors and industrialists Charles and David Koch, said that it could do more attacks on the co-op failures. The ad says Colorado HealthOp caused more than 80,000 state residents to lose their health insurance. It also cites a Colorado NBC affiliate that reported some doctors turned away HealthOp policyholders for fear they won't get reimbursed”  [Bennet brushed aside questions from Politico about his reported support of a Colorado plan to replace ObamaCare with a single-payer model long sought by liberals.]  More DC dough for Strickland - Wash Free Beacon: “Democrat Ted Strickland attended a fundraiser for his Ohio Senate campaign in Washington, D.C., Tuesday evening that was held by a top executive at the Center for American Progress, his former employer…According to a Washington Free Beacon analysis, the Democratic candidate raised over $170,000 from donors in the Washington area in the first three-quarters of 2015, much of it coming from wealthy consultants, lobbyists, and attorneys.”  Infighting liberally in Maryland - The Hill: Three influential Maryland progressives announced their support Tuesday for Rep. Chris Van Hollen’s (D-Md.) Senate bid, calling it ‘laughable’ that some liberal groups had already consolidated behind Rep. Donna Edwards (D-Md.)…Van Hollen is looking to cut into Edwards’s perceived strength among grassroots liberals after two national progressive groups, Democracy for America (DFA) and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC), threw their weight behind Edwards early on.”  A VITTER LOSS COULD HAUNT GOP IN 2016 The nastiest gubernatorial race in recent memory, the Louisiana gubernatorial brawl between Sen. David Vitter, R-La., and Democratic state Rep. John Bell Edwards could have consequences for control of Senate in 2016 as the NYT reports.  [National Journal has the jaw-dropping details on this week’s Edwards/Vitter  debate.]  Vets want respect - Edwards, who used a picture of Arlington National Cemetery in attack ads aimed at Vitter, is drawing fire from veterans. AP: “[Afghanistan war veteran] Mike McNaughton, a retired National Guard soldier who lost two fingers and his right leg when he stepped on a land mine, urged candidates in his speech at the Old State Capitol to ‘not use our veterans for promoting yourself’ to get elected.”  BUTT NAMED BEST TIGHT END Michigan Live: “Jake Butt finished last Saturday with a career performance and a national honor for his trouble. Michigan's 6-foot-6, 248-pound junior was named the John Mackey Award tight end of the week Wednesday. Butt had four receptions for a career-best 102 yards during the team's 49-16 win over Rutgers. Through nine games, Butt leads all Big Ten tight ends with 31 receptions for 418 yards. He's also caught one touchdown. Butt's second on the team in receptions and yards behind receiver Amara Darboh (37 receptions, 458 yards). In addition, the Pickerington, Ohio native -- who is a Mackey Award watch list member -- ranks No. 7 all-time on Michigan's career list in receptions by a tight end (72) and No. 10 in yards (864).”  Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

Nov. 3, 2015: With his wife Glenna Bevin, center, and Lieutenant Governor-elect Jenean Hampton, right, looking on, Kentucky Republican Governor-elect Matt Bevin, speaks to his supporters at the Republican Party victory celebration in Louisville, Ky. (AP)


What Kentucky’s Democratic governor has done to implement ObamaCare may soon be undone by the Republican governor-elect.
Matt Bevin, who defeated Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway 53 percent to 44 percent Nov. 3, campaigned on uprooting Gov. Steve Beshear’s ObamaCare exchange and Medicaid expansion.
Without support from a divided Kentucky Legislature, Beshear created a state-run ObamaCare exchange and opted in to ObamaCare’s expansion of Medicaid to working-age adults with no kids and no disabilities.
Praising Beshear during his 2014 State of the Union speech, President Obama said the governor was “like a man possessed” when it came to implementing ObamaCare — regardless of opposition from state legislators.
Unfortunately for Obama and fans of his unpopular health insurance law, Beshear’s unilateral actions leave the state’s two biggest pro-ObamaCare decisions open to reversal from Bevin.

Bevin won the Republican primary after promising to roll back ObamaCare expansion. He aims to shut down Kynect — the state’s ObamaCare exchange — and direct Kentuckians to the federal exchange by the end of 2016.

"The lieutenant governor’s office filed papers Thursday aimed at keeping two employees on loan from the California Senate but who have been notified they must return to the Senate for reassignment.
The Times has reported that a political rift had opened when Senate President Pro Tem Kevin De Leon (D-Los Angeles) took action to slash Democratic Lt. Gov. 
Gavin Newsom
’s staff just weeks after Newsom introduced a 2016 ballot initiative that includes one of De Leon’s pet policy proposals.
Newsom’s office manager and chief consultant for economic development were told to return to the Senate for reassignment Monday. They represent two of the six people working for the lieutenant governor.
Rhys Williams, the lieutenant governor’s chief of staff, said he filed papers with state personnel officials on Thursday to convert the two workers to full time employees of the lieutenant governor. Williams said the two workers will resign their Senate positions Friday to pave the way for the change.
“They have expressed a desire to continue to work for the lieutenant governor,” Williams said. “The decision has been made by them.”
Newsom is running for governor in 2018 and his candidacy may benefit from his leadership on the gun-control initiative. De Leon has formed a committee to campaign for lieutenant governor in 2018 and might also have received a boost if viewed as a leader on gun control.
De Leon had introduced a bill last year to require background checks for those who buy ammunition, and the same language was included in Newsom’s initiative.
“The record is relevant but a distraction from a key point and that is, no one person should assume a monopoly of ownership on taking actions that make our communities safer,” Williams said.",,<p>The lieutenant governor’s office filed papers Thursday aimed at keeping two employees on loan from the California Senate but who have been notified they must return to the Senate for reassignment.</p> <p>The Times has reported that a political rift had opened when Senate President Pro Tem Kevin De Leon...</p>,Lt.

"Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton announced a $30 billion plan Thursday to help coal mining towns hit hard by the shift to less polluting sources of energy.
Republicans bashed Clinton in response – accusing her of backing policies that hurt coal country in the first place.
Clinton’s proposal calls for building new roads, bridges, water system and airports in coal areas, expanding Internet access, and helping finance projects that promise new uses for abandoned coal mines.
Clinton said she’d help school districts struggling from the loss of coal revenue. She pledged to guarantee pension and health benefits to coal miners and power plant workers whose companies go bankrupt.
“As President, I will make sure our country honors our commitments to coal miners and their families, who gave their careers, their health, and in some cases their lives to powering America’s economy,” Clinton said in a written statement. “And I will invest for the future, by increasing federal investment to revitalize coal communities and partnering with the private sector to promote locally-driven business development and job creation.”
Coal is losing its competition with the cheap and cleaner natural gas produced in abundance by America’s fracking boom. The coal industry complains that environmental regulations have also hurt by increasing the costs of mining and burning coal.

We shouldn't expect a fix from someone who has been part of the problem all along Sergio Gor, spokesman for Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is running for the Republican nomination for president.
Central Appalachia has been hit especially hard by coal’s struggles, with the number of coal jobs in eastern Kentucky plummeting by half in recent years.
“Hillary Clinton will continue President Obama's failed environmental policies which are killing jobs and destroying communities across the nation,” said Sergio Gor, spokesman for Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is running for the Republican nomination for president. “We shouldn't expect a fix from someone who has been part of the problem all along.”
Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short said “if Hillary Clinton were truly on the side of coal country, she would stand up to extreme anti-energy environmentalists that run the Democrat Party instead of embracing their agenda that is killing jobs and driving up costs.”
Coal will be an issue in 2016 presidential campaign, largely because of the importance of the coal state of Ohio, which is a swing state that could go for a Democrat or a Republican. Clinton has pushed a clean energy and climate change agenda as she campaigns. 
“Building a 21st century clean energy economy in the United States will create new jobs and industries, deliver important health benefits, and reduce carbon pollution,” the Clinton campaign said. “But we can’t ignore the impact this transition is already having on mining communities, or the threat it poses to the healthcare and retirement security of coalfield workers and their families.”

"Republican and Democratic presidential candidates are divided over the handling of racially-charged protests at the University of Missouri and Yale University.
Republican presidential hopeful Ben Carson accused colleges and universities of being ""a little too tolerant"" and accepting of ""infantile behavior"" in the wake of separate episodes of racially-tinged unrest at the University of Missouri and Yale University, Carson’s undergraduate alma mater.
Speaking on ""The Kelly File"" on Fox News Wednesday night, Carson said the demonstrations on the two campuses and their aftermath is symptomatic of what’s wrong with the nation’s discourse.
""It's part of the problem that's going on in our country right now,"" said Carson, a retired neurosurgeon who leads the Republican presidential field in several key polls. ""We have people who get in their respective corners and demonize each other but there's no conversation. And of course, if you ask people to put on the record what their gripes are and what their solutions are, then perhaps they can see that maybe they are not so far apart and they can come up with some reason or solutions.""
Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who’s seeking the Democratic presidential nomination tweeted Thursday: “I'm listening to the #BlackOnCampus conversation. It's time to address structural racism on college campuses.”
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s Democratic presidential campaign retweeted a message Thursday from one of her staffers, Marlon Marshall, that said “Racism has no place anywhere, let alone an institution of learning. Standing w/ the students at Mizzou in my home state calling for change.”
At Missouri, university system President Tim Wolfe resigned Monday under pressure from students and faculty who said that he failed to respond to what they described as a racially intolerant atmosphere on the Columbia, Mo., campus. 
Demonstrations and protests boiled to the point the university’s football team threatened not to play a game until Wolfe was gone as president.

Their demands, they're like crazy. The demands that they're - the things that they're asking for, many of those things are -- like -- crazy! So it is just disgraceful Donald Trump on protesting students at the University of Missouri
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, speaking on Fox Business News’ “Morning with Maria” Thursday, called the resignation of Wolfe and a faculty member at Missouri “disgusting.”
“I think the two people that resigned are weak, ineffective people,” Trump said. “I think that when they resigned they set something in motion that's going to be a disaster for the next long period of time. They were weak ineffective people. How we hire people like this -- Trump should have been the chancellor of that university. Believe me, there would have been no resignation.” 
At Yale, minority students have railed against what they say is a culturally-insensitive atmosphere on the New Haven, Conn., campus triggered by accusations that black women weren’t admitted to a party and an email message from a university official urging students not to take offense to some potentially insensitive Halloween costumes

I know the President of Yale and he's a very, very reasonable person. And you know, I would imagine that he's working overtime right now to try to establish some dialogue Ben Carson on protests at Yale University
 Carson, speaking on Fox News, said the situations at Missouri and Yale were cases of ""just raw emotion"" and people being ""manipulated"" by ""outside forces who wish to create disturbances.""
""Well, we're being a little bit too tolerant, I guess you might say, accepting infantile behavior, I guess you might say,"" Carson told Fox News’ Megyn Kelly. ""And I don't care which side it comes from. You know, to say that I have the right to violate your civil rights, because you're offending me is un- American. It's unconstitutional. And the officials at these places must recognize that and have the moral courage to stand up to it. Because if they don't, it will grow, it will exacerbate the situation, as we will move much further toward anarchy than anybody can imagine and much more quickly.""
Carson said ""we must encourage open dialogue"" and likened what’s happened at Missouri and Yale to the end of a failing marriage.
""You know, it’s the same thing that happens before people get a divorce,"" he said. ""They stopped talking. The next thing you know their spouse is a devil incarnate. That’s what’s going on. And we cannot allow that in America.""

" Donald Trump suggested it’s time for some of his rivals to drop out of the presidential race as he returned to Iowa Thursday amid some polls that show his numbers flattening in the first-in-the nation state.
The standing room-only rally at a local community college was Trump’s first appearance in the state since Tuesday’s debate and he told the crowd he’s hopeful that some of “the guys on the end” get out of the presidential race.
“Why are these people staying? George Pataki?” Trump said of the former New York governor. “He’s got nothing.”
Lindsey Graham? “He talks tough, but we’ll end up with World War II over Syria,” Trump charged. Marco Rubio he called “weak like a baby on immigration.”
He told the crowd in a free-wheeling, hour-plus speech that as president he’d restore “Merry Christmas” and “bomb the sh&*” out of the Islamic State.
”We can’t allow people to cut off peoples’ heads,” he said. 
He panned President Barack Obama’s decision to send 50 forces to work with local forces in Syria: “50 sounds ridiculous. “If you’re going to do something, do it. Or don’t do it.”
And he cited unpredictability as a qualification for president, criticizing Obama for announcing that he would send the troops into Syria.

" White evangelical Christians are well-positioned to have a strong say in early 2016 Republican primaries and caucuses, a new analysis by Geoffrey Skelley of Sabato’s Crystal Ball found Thursday. But they could face trouble later in the campaign season.
Voting starts February 1 in Iowa, where in 2012 exit poll data showed 56 percent of caucus voters were white evangelicals. Rick Santorum, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, had a strong appeal to those voters, and inched out a win.
Skelley, using data from exit polls in 2008 and 2012, as well as information from the Census Bureau and the Public Religion Research Institute’s American Values Atlas, found that 64 percent of total delegates in states with primaries or caucuses prior to March 8 will come from states with likely white evangelical majorities. South Carolina votes later in February, and on March 1, states with primaries or caucuses, and sizable evangelical populations, include Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. Three more such states, Kentucky, Louisiana and Kansas, vote March 5.
That means that candidates with special appeal to those groups could get an early boost, but it doesn’t mean that will last. A majority of convention delegates will be chosenafter March 8.
“All this is to say that white evangelical Christians are going to impact the 2016 Republican nomination contest, just as they have in previous cycles,” Skelley found.
But because early delegates will be awarded proportionately, it will be hard for any single candidate in a multi-candidate field to get a huge early lead. And after March 15, some states will have winner take all primaries. And more states with smaller evangelical communities, such as Florida and Ohio, will be voting.
“This is not to say that a white evangelical-oriented outsider candidate won’t win the Republican nomination,” Skelley said. “But many states with large numbers of conservative born-again Christians will vote when many candidates may still be in the race, possibly splintering their delegate hauls. 
“Nonetheless, if the white evangelical Iowa lane of the field winnows a great deal between now and March 1, it’s possible that someone could take advantage and rack up a solid delegate take. Only time will tell, but there’s little question that white evangelical Christians are going to be an important factor in determining the GOP nominee, particularly in the early going.”
So far, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has attracted a strong evangelical following. Also in the mix are real estate mogul Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas; Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana; Mike Huckabee, former governor of Arkansas and 2008 Iowa caucus winner, and Santorum.

That the freshman senator from Texas had a good night on stage at the latest Republican debate surprises nobody anymore — Ted Cruz is poised, articulate and smart. He's gaining ground in the race for the Republican Presidential nomination, and he's positioning himself to capture supporters from Donald Trump or Ben Carson, should they falter. There's still a long way to go in this contest but Cruz and his campaign are well funded, well organized and confident in his ability to outlast and overtake his rivals. Cruz's success is rooted in the idea that there's no such thing as too conservative, both inside electoral politics and in governing. Or if need be, not governing — history's shown he's fine with shutting the federal government down if it helps him acquire leverage over the opposition, be it Democrat or Republican. And when he runs for office, nobody gets to the right of Ted Cruz. That's how he's won. The senator likes very much where he's positioned now. In most prior elections, he told NPR ""there has been a consensus moderate candidate early on and all the money gets behind that candidate."" Conservatives, on the other hand, are more plentiful, ""nobody has any money, and we fight like cats and dogs."" 

They're gonna spend millions ripping each other apart. To be honest, right now, the moderates are acting like conservatives usually do in a Republican primary.


Ted Cruz


""What's remarkable about this cycle is the entire situation is inverted,"" Cruz said. He has enjoyed watching enjoyed watching candidates in the moderate wing of the party slug it out. ""They're gonna spend millions ripping each other apart. To be honest, right now, the moderates are acting like conservatives usually do in a Republican primary,"" he said. On the economy, immigration and Obamacare On the economic front, a President Cruz would abolish the IRS, institute a 10 percent flat tax across the board and retie the value of the dollar to the gold standard. The U.S. stopped trading gold for dollars in 1933 and while the supply of gold has grown, there isn't enough gold in the world to match the $18 trillion U.S GDP. The money supply, the availability of credit and the nation's economy would necessarily have to contract to match the supply of bullion. Nevertheless, Cruz says returning to the gold standard deserves serious consideration. If you look at most of the history of America, he said, ""we've had a gold standard. Including through some of the greatest economic booms known to mankind."" Unpredictability in the country's currency, he added, ""has a profoundly negative effect."" If elected president, Cruz would order the FBI and the Department of Justice to investigate Planned Parenthood for fraud. The Texas senator doesn't believe in climate change science and would veto any legislation that would raise taxes or fees to inhibit global warming. He would like to institute term limits for U. S. Supreme Court justices. He opposes any minimum wage increase. And he would deport the millions of undocumented immigrants in this country, all of them. 

You know, my view on immigration is simple. Legal, good. Illegal, bad.


Ted Cruz


""You know, my view on immigration is simple,"" he said. ""Legal, good. Illegal, bad. ... You know, if you start from the proposition that rule of law matters, it answers a whole lot of questions."" In foreign policy, Cruz is a hawk with limitations. He's less a ""boots on the ground"" man than a ""bomb them from the skies"" guy. He deplores the Obama administration's agreement to slow down Iran's nuclear capabilities and believes the next president will have to bomb. ""When the next president enters the White House, the odds are significant that he or she will encounter an Iran on the verge of having nuclear weapons,"" Cruz said. ""And it may be that the only option at the point to preventing Iran from having nuclear weapons is military force. And of course Cruz, who was a catalyst in closing the federal government for two weeks in 2013 during the Showdown at the Obamacare Corral remains firmly against the Affordable Care Act. ""If I am elected president, mark my words, we will repeal every single word of Obamacare,"" he said. At war with the GOP establishment So what are the chances the Ted Cruz is the next Republican nominee for president? In the past, a rogue Republican senator at war with the leadership of his own party would have zero chance. But as if to demonstrate that we're not in Kansas anymore, Cruz's first radio spot emphasizes that the Texas senator is hated by the GOP establishment. In it, a young mother explains she voted for Cruz to keep America safe, stop the debt from growing and to keep her religious freedoms intact. ""The media and even some in his own party like Speaker John Boehner attacked Ted Cruz referring to him as a pain in the you know what,"" the ad goes. ""Because of his bold actions fighting to keep the promises he made to me. That was the Ted Cruz I trust."" Among the Tea Party and other insurgent Republican voters that Cruz is courting, being made an object of ridicule by the leaders of your own party is something you want to advertise. In this world, moderates are squishy ""Republicans In Name Only"" and right-wing true believers are the only Republican politicians that can be trusted to stand up and fight. ""There are a handful of consultants who relentlessly push what I call the Washington fallacy,"" Cruz said. ""Which is that the way Republicans win a general election is to run in the middle. To run as Democrat light. Every time we do that, we lose."" Cruz has assembled both an impressive campaign war chest and a solid network of state organizations across the South and Midwest. He's capturing both billionaire and Republican grass roots financial support. His strategy is to persevere and thrive while other candidates fall, eventually emerging as the default favorite of Republican right. Cruz cites the millions of evangelicals in American — he says more than half of them didn't vote in 2012. ""I think I'm in the best position to energize and mobilize and inspire the millions of conservatives who've been staying home,"" Cruz said. Super Tuesday comes early in this Republican primary, just 10 days after South Carolina. Georgia, Alabama, Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma and the big prize of Cruz's home Texas are among the conservative states that go to the polls. On Wednesday March 2, Ted Cruz is counting on the GOP race looking a lot different than the day before. And what of the other son of a Cuban immigrant, the Floridian who is also well positioned and a growing favorite with Republican voters? Cruz says he would be delighted if it came down to him and Marco Rubio, two quintessential American success stories writ large. He calls Rubio a ""friend"" and ""fellow son of Cuban immigrants,"" but said he still has the upper hand. ""I will say this. If the race becomes head to head. A battle between a clear conservative to a clear moderate, we win,"" Cruz said. A year ago no political pundits were predicting Donald Trump and Ben Carson would be leading the Republican field of presidential candidates. When it comes to this GOP race, it seems it's the outsiders who've got the inside track.

"Four of the eight Republican presidential contenders in the prime-time debate on Tuesday were asked their views on raising the federal minimum wage.

Donald Trump, who went first, set the tone when he said that the current minimum of $7.25 an hour was already too low when it took effect in 2009 and should be doubled.

Just kidding!

Here’s what the candidates really said and why they’re all wrong.

Mr. Trump said that American businesses can’t compete because “wages too high” and, for that reason, he would keep the minimum wage where it is.

If American businesses can’t compete – a dubious assertion in itself – it is not because wages are too high. Most working people can’t remember their last raise. And the minimum wage is certainly not too high. Raising it to $12 an hour would simply bring it into line with historical wage-and-price benchmarks. Raising it to $15 an hour would bring it closer to where it would be if it had kept up in recent decades with productivity gains.

All of which makes a higher minimum wage, what’s the word . . . fair? Sensible?

But in Mr. Trump’s view, wages for low-paid workers in America are too high because they are higher than those in, say, Pakistan. If you take that thought to its logical conclusion, he is saying that if he were president, he would lead the nation in a race to the bottom with countries whose economies are built on poverty wages.

Ben Carson was off base, too. Earlier in the campaign, he said he favored increasing the minimum, to an unspecified amount. On Tuesday, he said he did not support raising the minimum, because “every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases.”

No, it doesn’t. To give just one example, the minimum wage was raised by nearly 12 percent in 1996 (to $4.75 an hour) and by another eight percent in 1997 (to $5.15). The late 1990s were a period of full employment and rising wages for everyone.

The question of whether a higher minimum wage leads to higher unemployment isn’t one of those issues on which reasonable people disagree. It has been exhaustively studied, in theory and in real world conditions, since 1938, when the United States first enacted a minimum wage (at 25 cents an hour). The weight of evidence shows that increases in the minimum wage have lifted pay without hurting employment.

Mr. Carson also said that high unemployment among black teenagers was “because of those high wages.” Even for a teenager, $7.25 an hour is not a lot. Nor is $2.13 an hour, which is the federal minimum wage for tipped workers. Does he really want to let employers hire teenagers (and adults, for that matter) at wages that are not enough to provide pocket change, let alone cover real expenses, like getting back and forth to work?

Marco Rubio was next, warning as he has for months that “if you raise the minimum wage, you’re going to make people more expensive than a machine. And that means all this automation that’s replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated.”

Playing on fears is not the hallmark of a leader. “Fear the robots” is not an economic policy. Automation, by another name, is capital investment, and keeping wages low to discourage capital investment is a path to economic decline. It also ignores history, in which new technology has both replaced and created jobs.

Mr. Rubio went on to extol vocational training for welders as a way to lift wages. As if robots can’t weld?

Then there was John Kasich, who seemed to be trying to set himself apart from his scroogy opponents by noting that in Ohio, “We do have a moderate increase in the minimum wage.” The minimum in Ohio is $8.10 an hour, except for employers grossing $283,000 a year or less, who can pay as little as $7.25 an hour.

If it wasn’t so serious, it would be laughable.",TERESA TRITCH,Here’s what the candidates said at the debate on Tuesday — and here are the facts.,Taking Note: Republicans Sound Off on the Minimum Wage,http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/12/republicans-sound-off-on-the-minimum-wage/,[u'jobs/employment'],"[u'Donald Trump', u'Marco Rubio', u'Ben Carson', u'John Kasich']",nyt,0.8083537910154293,"[{u'author_id': 2728, u'fullname': u'teresa tritch', u'primary_org': u'nyt'}]",2015-11-12 20:53:37,[],01fd6ecd05292172651b0f1d6742215a,2015-11-12 21:44:49.772354
"With the Democratic presidential nomination contest all but officially a two-person race, Hillary Rodham Clinton appears vastly better positioned than Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to persuade party primary voters that she would be more effective at passing her agenda and dealing with international crises, according to a New York Times/CBS News survey released Thursday.

Mrs. Clinton even undercuts Mr. Sanders on his core political message, with 62 percent of Democratic primary voters saying she could bring about real change in Washington, compared with 51 percent for Mr. Sanders.

The promise of change, always a popular lure in politics, is at the heart of a striking paradox in the Democratic race. Democratic primary voters say that the ability to deliver needed change is the most important quality they seek in a candidate, and Mr. Sanders’s popularity is highest with voters who want change. Yet 60 percent of Democrats also want their nominee to continue President Obama’s policies, and these voters support Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Sanders by about a 2-to-1 margin.

This advantage for Mrs. Clinton may reflect all-around skepticism that Mr. Sanders’s leftist candidacy can prevail: Her party’s primary voters expect Mrs. Clinton to be their eventual nominee by more than a 4-to-1 margin over Mr. Sanders.

His chief indictment against Mrs. Clinton, that she is an establishment politician who is captive to big-money special interests and inconsistent on liberal priorities, simply has not persuaded many Democrats to abandon her. While 84 percent of them see Mrs. Clinton as under the sway of special interests, she is still the heavy favorite among Democratic primary voters seeking a candidate who is a strong leader with the right experience to be president.

And while Mr. Sanders is running as an unwavering liberal, three-quarters of Democratic primary voters prefer a nominee who would compromise with Republicans in Congress to get things done.

After a month of sharpened attacks by Mr. Sanders against her, Mrs. Clinton has support from 52 percent of Democratic primary voters, while Mr. Sanders has backing from 33 percent, the poll found. The numbers are virtually unchanged from an early October CBS News poll, in which she led Mr. Sanders, 56 percent to 32 percent.

The nationwide telephone poll was conducted Nov. 6 to 10 on cellphones and landlines with 1,495 adults, including 418 Democratic primary voters, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus six percentage points for Democratic primary voters.

Mrs. Clinton inspires more confidence among party members on a range of issues than the lesser known Mr. Sanders, who is only now starting to run biographical advertisements on television. On a signature Sanders issue, regulating large banks and financial institutions, Mrs. Clinton inspired confidence in 70 percent of primary voters, compared with 65 percent for Mr. Sanders. On gun laws, 76 percent of Democratic primary voters think she would make the right decisions compared with 57 percent for Mr. Sanders, whose votes against some gun-control measures have been highlighted by Mrs. Clinton.

On foreign conflicts, too, Democrats overwhelmingly expressed more faith in the decision-making of Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state, than of Mr. Sanders, a longtime antiwar figure.

“She knows all the players, all the world leaders,” Jan Lyles, 52, a consultant in Reno, Nev., said in an interview after the poll was completed. She added, approvingly, “She has her husband behind her for advice.” Three-quarters of Democrats view Bill Clinton favorably.

But support for Mrs. Clinton lags in some groups of Democratic primary voters, particularly men and younger voters. Among the misgivings is one that has surfaced before in her political career: Fifty-two percent of Democratic primary voters think that Mrs. Clinton says what she actually believes, compared with 62 percent who think Mr. Sanders is genuine in his remarks.

“It’s not so much I don’t trust her, but she seems to me to say what she thinks people want to hear,” said Jack Bernblum, 68, a self-employed Democrat from East Haven, Conn., who is leaning toward Mr. Sanders. “She has recently said something about legalizing marijuana, which is a brand new position for her. I don’t think she means anything she says.”

For Mr. Sanders, who is attracting bigger crowds than Mrs. Clinton and is running notably close to her in fund-raising, the overarching challenge is to transform an insurgent primary campaign aimed at two must-win states, Iowa and New Hampshire, into a formidable movement with broad national appeal. He will face his greatest test yet on Saturday night at the second Democratic debate, which will be televised nationally from Des Moines. Nearly half of Democratic primary voters say they are very likely to watch the debate, and an additional three in 10 said they were somewhat likely.

Mrs. Clinton will take the stage after a run of positive developments since their Oct. 13 debate, including strong reviews of her performance there; Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s decision not to enter the race; and a steely, well-received face-off with congressional Republicans investigating the 2012 attack on the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.

Mr. Sanders has been trying to undercut her political momentum by drawing more contrasts on policy, noting that he has been more liberal for far longer than her on issues like free trade, the death penalty and a single-payer health care system. Yet his attacks have not been memorably potent.

A third Democratic candidate, former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland, will also take part in Saturday’s debate, but he is trailing far behind his rivals. He received 5 percent support in the Times/CBS News poll.

Mr. Sanders and Mr. O’Malley have room to grow if they can find a way: Half of Democratic primary voters say it is still too early to say for sure whom they will support. And while Mr. Sanders is running closest behind Mrs. Clinton, four in 10 voters still do not have an opinion of him — and many hold views that suggest they would be open to his platform.

While some Sanders allies worry that his decades-long identification as a democratic socialist will hurt him, 56 percent of Democratic primary voters say they hold a positive view of socialism. About nine in 10 think that the gap between rich and poor is an urgent problem, and most would support raising taxes on the wealthy to deal with it — one of Mr. Sanders’s major positions — and 78 percent oppose unlimited campaign contributions to fund-raising committees known as “super PACs,” as does Mr. Sanders. (Mrs. Clinton is supported by a such a fund-raising arm.)

Sue Moon, a Seattle Democrat and a retired teacher, said she did not like Mrs. Clinton’s ties to wealthy donors and Wall Street executives, some of whom Ms. Moon blames for the 2008 financial crisis.

“I am much more in favor of the wing of the party that thinks a lot of these people should have gone to jail,” said Ms. Moon, a Sanders supporter.

While the Republican presidential race is far more unsettled, with 15 candidates, Democrats think that Donald J. Trump, whose tough talk and outsize personality have energized many disaffected conservatives, would be the toughest to beat in a general election. Thirty-one percent of Democrats said Mr. Trump would be the most formidable opponent next November, while 15 percent named the retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and 13 percent each picked former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas lagged far behind.

Luke Cottrill, a junior high school teacher and a Democrat in San Francisco, said that Mr. Trump would be the most dangerous foe in a general election because he is not only a political outsider but also speaks pointedly in ways that resonate deeply with some people, while offending others.

"Shortly after Mayor Bill de Blasio and his national advocacy group trumpeted plans last month to hold a presidential forum in Iowa, the mayor hopped on a conference call to rev up the liberal faithful.

Addressing members from around the country, the mayor spoke of girding for a sustained war on inequality — the very topic of the Dec. 6 forum, which organizers believed would be a harbinger of the group’s intent to play on the national stage.

Those plans collapsed this week. The de Blasio-backed group canceled its event, explaining in a statement that it would redirect its energies into other methods of tackling inequality.

On Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio acknowledged a more humbling reality: Not a single presidential candidate had agreed to attend.

The disintegration of the Iowa conclave was the most significant setback yet for the Progressive Agenda Committee, an ambitious but halting enterprise that has prompted questions about Mr. de Blasio’s political judgment, and has tested his clout as a local official with baldly ideological aspirations.

Mr. de Blasio and his allies say the group is a necessary vehicle to rally liberal elites behind a cohesive message. Inspired by a policy agenda that Mr. de Blasio unveiled in Washington in May, covering topics from union rights to international trade, the Progressive Agenda Committee is now incorporated as a nonprofit, with its own executive director and political director.

But the project, founded by Mr. de Blasio and backed by influential labor leaders and former City Hall aides, has faced a series of unexpected setbacks: Prominent elected officials have hesitated to commit themselves. Some leaders who endorsed Mr. de Blasio’s policy manifesto have had second thoughts about promoting such a grandly ideological document.

Even the rise of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the presidential race has presented a challenge for the Progressive Agenda, forcing the group to reconsider its goals now that a self-described socialist has already electrified the Democratic primary with heated rhetoric about inequality. (Mr. de Blasio endorsed Hillary Rodham Clinton last month.)

The project has also sharply divided advisers to Mr. de Blasio, some of whom counseled the mayor to reconsider the Iowa forum, concerned that it had deepened perceptions of Mr. de Blasio as excessively preoccupied with national politics, according to people familiar with their reservations.

These people, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, said Mr. de Blasio held out on having the forum until just days before the plug was pulled, convinced that the event would ultimately advance the broader cause of his liberal group.

Others in the mayor’s circle remain intensely committed: John Del Cecato, one of Mr. de Blasio’s closest advisers who is widely viewed as the most enthusiastic champion of the project, defended it this week as having helped move the national political debate in a liberal direction.

Mr. de Blasio stressed Wednesday that he was invested in making the Progressive Agenda a success, and vowed to put “years and years of effort” into pressing its inequality message forward.

“We are going to be doing activities all over the country and in Washington to keep pushing the issue of income inequality to the fore,” Mr. de Blasio said, adding, “We’re going to keep trying new strategies until we find the ones that we think work best.”

Amid the public clamor over Mr. de Blasio’s foray into presidential politics, other aspects of the Progressive Agenda Committee have begun to take shape.

The organization, which at first appeared aimed at shaping the 2016 election by pressuring Mrs. Clinton from the left, has sketched out a more gradual timeline for its activities, aimed at preparing to extract liberal policy achievements from the next president.

Geri Prado, a former A.F.L.-C.I.O. strategist who joined the Progressive Agenda Committee over the summer as its executive director, said the group had begun to assemble a “message calendar” for the progressive movement aimed squarely at the first quarter of 2017.

“We want to make sure that in the first 100 days of 2017, people are fulfilling their promises around income inequality,” Ms. Prado said in an interview.

Ms. Prado, who is based in Washington, has wooed liberal leaders with a PowerPoint presentation that ticks off a series of national ills — including the “Corporatization of America” — and detailed tactics to address them.

The function of the committee, according to a copy of the presentation, is to help provide message discipline for a diverse array of activist communities on the left.

The presentation repeatedly invokes the image of a religious congregation, and states that this particular group’s role is to provide “hymnals for the choir.”

The Progressive Agenda intends to hold regular planning calls featuring a range of liberal leaders — not just Mr. de Blasio — outlining the elements of what it views as a successful progressive economic message, according to people familiar with the plans. (It has already held calls to highlight research by the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank, and Democracy Corps, a Democratic polling project focused on economic messaging.)

In mass emails, organizers have urged members of the group to help create a drumbeat around key liberal priorities: One message last Friday offered up sample Twitter posts, suggesting that members use social media to proclaim, “Wall Street and the superrich are gaming the stock market.”

The group has also taken steps to reduce Mr. de Blasio’s presence: The mayor’s name did not appear on the invitations sent to presidential candidates, and organizers said that he would have played no speaking role at the forum.

Still, Mr. de Blasio confers with Ms. Prado at least once a week about the group’s activities. And if the group is aiming to channel a broader set of voices, beyond City Hall, Mr. de Blasio and the stature of his office have plainly been the animating forces behind its public activities so far.

The first glimmers of the Progressive Agenda emerged last spring, when Mr. de Blasio convened an April meeting at Gracie Mansion with other left-leaning Democrats, to discuss economic issues. By the next month, at least two City Hall aides, Stephanie Yazgi and Jonathan Viguers, were involved in efforts to recruit endorsers for the Progressive Agenda, according to emails obtained through public records requests.

Early on, Mr. de Blasio personally solicited support for the agenda from leading Democrats. Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor and presidential candidate, said he joined the group because of a direct appeal from Mr. de Blasio, and called it a useful gathering point for liberal leaders.

“He’s basically trying to, I think, put together a counterweight to the right,” Mr. Dean said, adding, “There are not that many forums where national progressives all get together and talk.”

But Mr. de Blasio’s back-channel recruitment efforts also revealed his limitations as a liberal field marshal. He repeatedly sought support from Edwin M. Lee, the mayor of San Francisco and a fellow Democrat, telling him in a personal email that his backing would be a “great boost” to the Progressive Agenda.

When Mr. Lee offered a noncommittal response, Mr. de Blasio pressed the issue, asking him to consider signing on by the following day. Mr. Lee did not.

Other outreach efforts have yielded only impermanent results. Mr. Sanders, whom the mayor has praised as an important spokesman for the left, agreed in a phone call with Mr. de Blasio to participate in the Iowa forum. But the Sanders campaign never ultimately made a formal commitment.

Even among officials who signed on to the group, some have balked at promoting the Progressive Agenda with their own energies.

Mayor Steve Adler of Austin, Tex., gave his stamp of approval to Mr. de Blasio’s policy manifesto, but in emails privately fretted with aides about how far to take the partnership. “Much of this is national stuff, which could be divisive here,” Mr. Adler’s chief of staff, John-Michael Cortez, cautioned in an email.

Jason Stanford, a spokesman for Mr. Adler, said there were areas of overlap between the Texas mayor’s ideas and Mr. de Blasio’s liberal platform. But, he added, “There are other things there that just aren’t part of our agenda that are perceived as national political issues, and not what the mayor’s trying to accomplish here in Austin.”",ALEXANDER BURNS and MICHAEL M.

"A long-simmering debate over immigration in the Republican presidential contest boiled over on Thursday, as five contenders seized on the issue and Senator Ted Cruz accused his colleague, Senator Marco Rubio, of “trying to stuff amnesty down the throats of the American people.”

From appearances on conservative talk radio to the campaign trail in South Carolina, the candidates sought to appeal to grass-roots conservatives who are alarmed about immigration. And the eruption of open warfare between Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz, two establishment candidates who have been rising in the polls, showed the likely contours of the Republican presidential fight as it hurtles toward the Iowa caucuses in less than 90 days.

Immigration is a key vulnerability for Mr. Rubio, who was initially part of an effort in 2013 to formulate a bipartisan bill in the Senate to reform the immigration system, an effort that is viewed with deep skepticism by conservatives.

Mr. Cruz, in an appearance with the conservative radio host Laura Ingraham, denounced Mr. Rubio without using his name, saying, “You know where someone is based on their actions. As the Scripture says, you shall know them based on their fruits.”

And three other lower-polling candidates — Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky; Rick Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator; and Carly Fiorina, a former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard — sought to join the fight, piling on Mr. Rubio or Mr. Cruz as insufficiently pure on a key litmus test for segments of the Republican base.

The long-distance exchanges illustrated the degree to which several candidates see immigration, which emerged as a key issue in the 2014 midterm elections, as the most potent weapon in their arsenal in a presidential contest that has been characterized by concerns about the direction of the country.

Mr. Rubio, when asked about Mr. Cruz’s critique while campaigning Thursday morning, sought to turn the tables.

“Ted is a supporter of legalizing people that are in this country illegally,” Mr. Rubio said, according to a transcript provided by his aides. “In fact, when the Senate bill was proposed, he proposed legalizing people that were here illegally. He proposed giving them work permits. He’s also supported a massive expansion of the green cards.

“He supported a massive expansion of the H-1B program, a 500 percent increase,” he continued. “So, if you look at it, I don’t think our positions are dramatically different. I do believe that we have to deal with immigration reform in a serious way, and it begins by proving to people that illegal immigration is under control.”

In his criticism of his Senate colleague, Mr. Cruz recalled that Mr. Rubio, the Florida senator who was a member of the so-called Gang of Eight group of lawmakers who sought to overhaul the immigration system, opposed measures to tighten border security.

“He opposed every single one of them,” Mr. Cruz, of Texas, said of amendments Mr. Rubio opposed that would have increased border-patrol resources, created a strong e-verify system and developed an exit-entry system for visa overstays. “The Gang of Eight voted against securing and enforcing the border.”

Mr. Rubio now says that immigration must be handled in parts and that after the border is secured, new policies can be developed for dealing with immigrants who have entered the country illegally.

"After a week of debate over whether Ben Carson really won a scholarship to West Point, Republicans have refocused the question of military service on Hillary Rodham Clinton, expressing doubts about her claim that she tried to join the Marines in the 1970s.

The matter came up after an event in New Hampshire this week, when Mrs. Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, shared a story with voters about her interest as a young woman in becoming a Marine.

“He looks at me and he goes, ‘Um, how old are you?'” Mrs. Clinton recalled. “I said, ‘Well, I’m 26, I’ll be 27.’ He goes, ‘Well, that’s kind of old for us.’ He says to me, ‘Maybe the dogs will take you,’ meaning the Army.”

Republicans are suggesting that the story is an embellishment, as Mrs. Clinton would have been seeking to join the military in 1975, the year she married Bill Clinton in Fayetteville, Ark.

The story of Mrs. Clinton’s military aspirations has come up before, as have questions about her honesty on the subject. In 1994, The New York Times’s Maureen Dowd noted that joining the military seemed to clash with the future first lady’s persona:

After all, Hillary Rodham was an up-and-coming legal star involved with an up-and-coming political star. She had made a celebrated appearance in Life magazine as an anti-establishment commencement speaker at Wellesley College, where, as president of the student government, she had organized teach-ins on her opposition to the Vietnam War.

Mrs. Clinton’s campaign did not respond to questions about the circumstances of her application to the Marines.

“G.I. Hillary?” the Republican National Committee wrote in an email that suggested she had a pattern of fudging her biography. “Clinton’s claim that she tried to join the Marines doesn’t add up.”

While running for president in 2008, Mrs. Clinton faced an uproar after she said that her plane landed under sniper fire during a 1996 trip to Bosnia. In fact, she was greeted by children rather than bullets.

On Thursday, Senator John McCain, who was the Republican presidential nominee that year, suggested that Mrs. Clinton might have misremembered trying to join the Marines.

"Senator Ted Cruz continued to pound Senator Marco Rubio over his immigration record on Thursday, escalating the tension between the two rivals for the Republican presidential nomination. 

Speaking on Laura Ingraham’s radio program, Mr. Cruz reiterated his view that Mr. Rubio is weak when it comes to immigration.

“Talk is cheap,” the Texas senator said. “You know where someone is based on their actions. As the Scripture says, you shall know them based on their fruits.”

Mr. Cruz went on to recall that Mr. Rubio, the Florida senator who was a member of the so-called Gang of Eight group of lawmakers who sought to overhaul the immigration system, opposed measures to tighten border security. 

“He opposed every single one of them,” Mr. Cruz said of amendments Mr. Rubio opposed that would have increased border patrol resources, created a strong e-verity system and an developed exit-entry system for visa overstays. “The Gang of Eight voted against securing and enforcing the border.”

Mr. Rubio now says that immigration must be handled in parts and that after the border is secured new policies can be developed for dealing with immigrants who have entered the country illegally. He is not in favor of deporting undocumented immigrants en masse, as some of his rivals propose.  

Mr. Cruz’s comments come as he has been running close with Mr. Rubio in many polls and as they are increasingly competing for attention from conservative voters. At an event in New Hampshire on Wednesday night, Mr. Cruz suggested that picking a nominee who favors “amnesty” would damage his party’s prospects in a general election.

“In my view, if Republicans nominate for president a candidate who supports amnesty, we will have given up one of the major distinctions with Hillary Clinton and we will lose the general election,” he said. “That is a path to losing.”

In spite of his tough talk on immigration, some Republicans think that it is Mr. Cruz whose actions do not match his words. Rick Santorum, the former senator from Pennsylvania, said on Thursday that Mr. Cruz’s support for expanding the H1-B visa program for skilled workers without reforms would harm American workers. 

“Cruz tough on immigration?” Mr. Santorum’s campaign said in an email. “Not so fast!” ",ALAN RAPPEPORT,"Immigration reform continues to be a sticking point between two of the Republican senators running for president, with Ted Cruz saying that selecting a nominee who supports amnesty, like Marco Rubio, “is a path to losing” the general election.",First Draft: Ted Cruz Keeps Up Fight With Marco Rubio on Immigration Differences,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/12/ted-cruz-keeps-up-fight-with-marco-rubio-on-immigration-differences/,[u'immigration'],"[u'Rick Santorum', u'Marco Rubio', u'Hillary Clinton', u'Laura Ingraham', u'Ted Cruz']",nyt,0.9932012501085925,"[{u'author_id': 8381, u'fullname': u'alan rappeport', u'primary_org': u'nyt'}]",2015-11-12 17:37:51,[],b513e51ead7aa794da2d0ed072b69223,2015-11-12 18:00:51.160648
"Despite a month of sharpened attacks, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has failed to significantly dent Hillary Rodham Clinton’s lead in the Democratic presidential race, according to a New York Times/CBS News survey released on Thursday.

Mrs. Clinton has support from 52 percent of Democratic primary voters, while Mr. Sanders has backing from 33 percent, the poll found. In an early October CBS News poll, she led Mr. Sanders 56 percent to 32 percent.

Mr. Sanders, whose overarching challenge is to transform his left-wing, lesser-known candidacy into a formidable national campaign with broad appeal, will face his greatest test yet on Saturday night at the second Democratic debate, which will be televised nationally from Des Moines. Mrs. Clinton will take the stage after a run of positive developments since their Oct. 13 debate, including strong reviews of her performance there, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s decision not to enter the race, and a steely, well-received face-off with congressional Republicans investigating the 2012 attack on the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. 

Mr. Sanders, in turn, has been drawing more contrasts with Mrs. Clinton’s positions on trade, Social Security, the death penalty and marijuana legalization since the October debate, but his attacks have not been memorably effective.

A third Democratic candidate, former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland, will also take part in Saturday’s debate, but he is trailing far behind his rivals. He received 5 percent of the vote in the Times/CBS News poll.

Mr. Sanders and Mr. O’Malley do appear to have room to grow if they can find a way, the poll found: Half of Democratic primary voters said it was still too early to say for sure who they would support.

Sanders supporters stand out as especially engaged with the presidential race. Fifty-four percent of them said they were paying a lot of attention to the campaign, compared with 38 percent of Mrs. Clinton’s backers.

But Mrs. Clinton enjoys a firmer base of voters than Mr. Sanders, according to the poll. Fifty-four percent of her supporters said their minds were completely made up, while 58 percent of Mr. Sanders’s supporters said they had not made a final decision.

And 43 percent of Democrats said they would enthusiastically support Mrs. Clinton as their presidential nominee, compared to 35 percent for Mr. Sanders. Slim majorities of women, nonwhites and older voters said they would enthusiastically back Mrs. Clinton as the party’s choice, while just three in 10 male Democrats said they would feel that way about her as their standard-bearer in 2016.

A strong majority of Democratic primary voters say they are paying at least some attention to the presidential campaign; 26 percent of Democrats say they have not been paying much attention, compared with 11 percent of Republican primary voters.

The nationwide telephone poll was conducted Nov. 6 to 10 on cellphones and landlines with 418 Democratic primary voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus six percentage points. Additional findings from the full poll will be published on Thursday at 6:30 p.m.",PATRICK HEALY and GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO,"Despite a month of sharpened attacks from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton has support from 52 percent of Democratic primary voters, according to a New York Times/CBS News survey released on Thursday, compared with Mr. Sanders’s 33 percent.",First Draft: Poll Shows Hillary Clinton Maintaining Lead Over Bernie Sanders,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/12/poll-shows-hillary-clinton-maintaining-lead-over-sanders/,"[u'personality', u'budget/taxation']","[u'Bernie Sanders', u'Joseph R.

President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin may not have any meetings on the schedule but they may still end up talking.
“There is not a formal meeting between the president and Mr. Putin on the schedule but has often been the case at the G20 and other multilateral leaders meetings we fully expect they’ll have ample opportunity for discussion directly,” National Security Adviser Susan Rice said at a White House briefing Thursday.

“The G20 meeting will come just after Secretary Kerry again convenes the key countries in Vienna along with the United Nations we’ve been working with all the key players in that configuration including the Russians,” Rice said. “The Russians certainly have their ideas, we have ours, other players have theirs and this discussion in Vienna will be an opportunity to try to see the extent to which we can forge a common way forward.” 
Rice said everyone will be looking for a concrete transition plan for Syria, though later in the briefing she acknowledged concrete plans aren’t likely to come immediately because she views it as ""a process.""
“I think we’re all very realistic for the conflict in Syria to be resolved, which it must, it’s going to require all the relevant players to come to a common understanding,” Rice said.

A new TV ad from GOP Sen. David Vitter's Louisiana gubernatorial campaign features ""Duck Dynasty"" star Willie Robertson offering his forgiveness to Vitter.
Vitter, wearing camouflage, stands next to Robertson throughout the 30-second spot, which continues Vitter's recent strategy of confronting his 2007 prostitution scandal, albeit indirectly, and shifting the conversation to his political conservatism. 
Story Continued Below
""David and I have been out in the woods today. I know he's made some mistakes, but who hasn't? The whole story of the Bible is about redemption,"" Robertson says in the ad. ""I'm concerned about our state."" 
""That's right, Willie,"" Vitter responds. ""What defines us in life is how we get up and earn redemption. Where we are as a state is needing to get up based on strong conservative principles, and that's what I'm leading with.""

The Robertson clan's political record is mixed. They endorsed a failed congressional candidate in 2014 and have backed incumbent Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's faltering presidential bid.
Polls show Vitter, once a heavy favorite, trailing Democratic state Rep. John Bel Edwards. Shortly after the ad's release, Edwards' campaign blasted out a 2014 Baton Rouge Advocate article where Vitter declares: ""I'm not even running to gain a cameo appearance on 'Duck Dynasty.'""
John Brabender is Vitter's long-time media consultant.

Iowa, Iowa, Iowa.
That’s the not-particularly-subtle message pervading Democratic camps as the party’s three remaining presidential candidates prep for their second debate Saturday night in Des Moines, a recognition that the first-caucusing state will likely play an even more outsized role than usual in 2016. 
Story Continued Below
While the direction of the questions may be squarely in the hands of debate host CBS News and moderator John Dickerson — whose role will be to manage the widely-expected fireworks coming from Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley — each of the candidates has already started sharpening the message (and spin) that they think will specifically take them furthest with the state’s influential voters.
“The Nevada debate was more of a national debate,” explained Sanders’ lead strategist, Tad Devine, echoing the beliefs of other top Democrats. “I do expect [this one] to be a debate that has more focus on Iowa.""
For Sanders, that means heading north to his Burlington headquarters for two days starting Wednesday night to sit down with aides, and to scour briefing papers that include a deep-dive rundown on Iowa issues outlined by his staff on the ground there. He’s agreed to participate in mock debate run-throughs — after being resistant to such standard pre-debate fare last time — and his staff expects that he'll prepare specific policy contrasts to unleash against front-runner Hillary Clinton before he flies out to Des Moines on Friday.
For O’Malley, it’s meant all-but-shouting into a loudspeaker that he’ll aggressively attack Clinton and Sanders over their past records, recognizing that his poll numbers soon need to reach the neighborhood of the 15 percent viability threshold needed to win delegates from the state's precincts under the caucus rules if he plans to be a factor in the race. Eager to amp up the pressure, O’Malley won’t be sitting for long Baltimore prep sessions in the days leading up to the debate: instead, he was in Austin on Thursday meeting with a family that would benefit from the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program, using the opportunity to further contrast with Sanders and Clinton over immigration. It's a policy area his team has identified as a winner for the former Maryland governor — who they hope to position as the true Democratic heir to Obama and his Iowa backers.

The front-running Clinton is taking a break from the campaign and cash trail after a pair of New York City fundraising events on Wednesday while her staff tries to manage her newly-sky-high expectations following her strong October. She just has to protect her lead in Iowa when she takes the Drake University stage, said a handful of people in her orbit, pointing to her speech at the state party’s Jefferson-Jackson dinner this fall as a guide. That means articulating a specific, forward-looking policy slate — and not taking the bait while her opponents eagerly pick at her past record.
The three divergent approaches will underscore the seemingly hard-wired caucus dynamics: a clear and dominant favorite chased by two challengers focused on proving they should be taken seriously. Democrats associated with all campaigns acknowledge if Clinton were to win Iowa — a state where she finished in third place in 2008 — handily in February, Sanders’ uphill path to the nomination would become even steeper. So his brain trust is squarely focused on keeping the margin close there.
“We recognize that she’s got a real lead there. A lot of it can be attributed to her having long-standing ties with voters, and institutional ties in both states. But she also had three months on television in Iowa and New Hampshire,” Devine said, alluding to the Clinton advertisements that plastered the early-voting states’ airwaves starting this summer.
But, he added, “We’ve looked at them as being states that are symbiotic. What happens in Iowa can drastically effect what happens in New Hampshire, so it’s very important for Bernie to demonstrate in Iowa that he is a strong national candidate who can compete with Hillary.""
Clinton’s Iowa lead is 17 points, according to the Huffington Post Pollster average, and she’s down by 8 points in New Hampshire. (O’Malley sits 46 and 40 points behind the leader in each state, respectively.)
However, the former secretary of state’s aides are not eager to talk about locking up Iowa anytime soon — if anything, they are aiming to lower public expectations for Clinton’s debate performance. Following her strong showing in the first debate, Clinton is faced with the challenge of peeling away from her rivals without looking like she’s punching down — and defending herself while the others increasingly attack her for being untrustworthy or overly political.
As such, she’s unlikely to proactively go after either of her rivals in a specific way, like she did at the last debate in criticizing Sanders’ record on gun control.
“You’re much better off counterpunching than punching in her situation,” explained Bob Shrum, who was a senior advisor to both John Kerry in 2004 and Al Gore in 2000.
“I wouldn’t launch negative attacks. I don’t think there’s any big reason to do it right now. Going into the first debate they were very worried about Sanders’ surge. And I don’t think he’s still surging.""
Team Sanders’ calculation is different: the senator’s campaign is running a soft, biography-laden television ad in both Iowa and New Hampshire, and he’s been focused on showing his personable side on the trail.



            By

But he’s also likely to challenge Clinton on a series of policy points, aides said, so they want him to use his prep sessions to find a way to strike the balance between being relatable to voters, and politically aggressive at the same time.
If that works, Sanders’ team expects to leverage its online fundraising tools to take its debate success to the bank, like last time, when it raised $2.5 million in the 24 hours after the forum — nearly double O’Malley's entire third-quarter haul.
The former Maryland governor is, accordingly, in the most precarious situation, forcing him to flash the most fire.
Believing that the narrowed field will give the candidate more time in the spotlight, O'Malley's allies predict an onslaught of criticism toward both Sanders — over his status as an independent and his call for a primary challenge to Obama in 2012 — and Clinton — over issues where she has shifted, most notably on immigration.
O’Malley has gone out of his way to needle Clinton over the last few days, most recently comparing her policies to Donald Trump's in a tweet after she reminded New Hampshire voters that she “voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in.” 
By lurching away from its hands-off-Clinton policy — borne out of fear of raising his name recognition through negative attacks — O'Malley's projected that he's likely to take his new tone to the debate stage in Des Moines, after his rhetoric reached its sharpest point yet at a Sunday immigration reform forum in Nevada:
“We are not going to solve this problem with poll-tested triangulation and half-truths,” he said. “Nor will we solve this problem by falsely asserting that immigrants take our jobs or lower our wages.""

Donald Trump lashed out at Ben Carson on Thursday, likening his ""pathological"" temperament to that of a child molester’s. 
In an appearance on CNN’s ""Erin Burnett OutFront,"" the billionaire businessman said that there is no cure for his 2016 presidential opponent’s “pathological temper.” 
Story Continued Below
Throughout the interview, Trump took jabs at Carson’s memoir.
“It's in the book that he's got a pathological temper,"" he said. 
""That's a big problem because you don't cure that ... as an example: child molesting. You don't cure these people. You don't cure a child molester. There's no cure for it. Pathological, there's no cure for that.""
Carson has been upfront about bursts of violent behavior in the past. In ""Gifted Hands,"" Carson’s autobiography published in the late 1990s, he wrote that his behavior is due to a “pathological temper,” which made headlines recently in relation to an anecdote from Carson’s youth about an attempt to stab a friend.

Trump has taken issue this week with one specific passage in which Carson wrote, ""I had what I only can label a pathological temper — a disease — and this sickness controlled me, making me totally irrational."" 
On Thursday, Trump reiterated that he was not adding anything new to the conversation separate from what Carson already penned. 
""I'm not bringing up anything that's not in his book,"" he said, and added, “I'm not saying anything other than pathological is a very serious disease. And he said he's pathological.”

THE CLOCK: 361 days until Election Day 2016 …
THE DEBATE CLOCK: The next Democratic debate is 2 days away. You have to wait until Dec. 15 for Republicans to do it again.
Story Continued Below
THE NARROWCAST DEBATE: POLITICO’s Gabriel Debenedetti reports: Iowa, Iowa, Iowa. That’s the not-particularly-subtle message pervading Democratic camps as the party’s three remaining presidential candidates prep for their second debate Saturday night in Des Moines, a recognition that the first-caucusing state will likely play an even more outsized role than usual in 2016. 
While the direction of the questions may be squarely in the hands of debate host CBS News and moderator John Dickerson, each of the candidates has already started sharpening the message (and spin) that they think will specifically take them furthest with the state’s influential voters. “The Nevada debate was more of a national debate,” explained BERNIE SANDERS’ lead strategist, Tad Devine, echoing the beliefs of other top Democrats. “I do expect [this one] to be a debate that has more focus on Iowa.""
For Sanders, that means heading north to his Burlington headquarters for two days starting Wednesday night to sit down with aides, and to scour briefing papers that include a deep-dive rundown on Iowa issues outlined by his staff on the ground there. He’s agreed to participate in mock debate run-throughs — after being resistant to such standard pre-debate fare last time — and his staff expects that he'll prepare specific policy contrasts to unleash against front-runner HILLARY CLINTON before he flies out to Des Moines on Friday. http://politi.co/1METIPq
TGIT, and welcome to your 2016 Blast. Henry C. Jackson (@henrycjjackson) is here to guide you through today’s campaign news. Send your tips, complaints, and hottest hot takes to: hjackson@politico.com. 
TRAIL MIX: Here’s what’s popping on the campaign trail
In today’s campaign news, the HILLARY CLINTON FBI probe seems to enter another stage and BERNIE SANDERS may have a photo flub to explain. On the GOP side, the cold war between MARCO RUBIO and TED CRUZ heats up, JEB BUSH gets his bro on, DONALD TRUMP picks a new fight, CHRIS CHRISTIE blames Obama and BEN CARSON’s associations are questioned.
THE DAILY CLINTON
FBI DIGGING IN: Fox News reports the FBI “has expanded its probe of HILLARY CLINTON’s emails, with agents exploring whether multiple statements violate a federal false statements statute, according to intelligence sources familiar with the ongoing case … This phase represents an expansion of the FBI probe, which is also exploring potential violations of an Espionage Act provision relating to ""gross negligence"" in the handling of national defense information.” http://fxn.ws/1MDm0dc
FASTER, PLEASE: POLITICO’s Josh Gerstein reports: “A federal judge issued an order Thursday that will sharply ramp up the volume of documents being release in a lawsuit demanding memos and emails from top aides to former Secretary of State HILLARY CLINTON … U.S. District Court Judge Rudolph Contreras instructed the State Department to move toward production of 2,200 pages of documents per month … The schedule virtually guarantees that a significant volume of records about Clinton, who is the leading Democratic candidate for president, will be emerging through the primary and caucus season and into the heart of the general election next fall.” http://politi.co/1WPCxBz 
THIRD TERM WATCH: Time: HILLARY CLINTON’s campaign released a video on Thursday that attacks “Republican candidates for seeking to roll back President Obama’s policies … The 28-second campaign video provides a window into the kind of contrast Clinton will set with the Republicans in a general election, with the campaign painting Republican candidates as backward-looking and out of touch.” http://ti.me/1PEwcTN 
CURBING COAL: The Wall Street Journal: “HILLARY CLINTON on Thursday released a $30 billion plan aimed at revitalizing communities dependent on coal production, seeking to mitigate the economic impact of the nation’s shift from an electricity source that is both plentiful and polluting.” http://on.wsj.com/1SmV3ui 
UNDENTED: The New York Times: Despite amped up attacks from BERNIE SANDERS, the Vermont senator “has failed to significantly dent HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON’s lead … according to a New York Times/CBS News survey released on Thursday … Clinton has support from 52 percent of Democratic primary voters, while Mr. Sanders has backing from 33 percent, the poll found. In an early October CBS News poll, she led Mr. Sanders 56 percent to 32 percent.” http://nyti.ms/1Ma5Jem 
THE PROGRESSIVE RESISTANCE
PHONY PHOTO?: Time reports that several University of Chicago alums are casting doubt on a photo that BERNIE SANDERS campaign has touted as showing his roots as an activist, leading a civil rights protest. “Four University of Chicago alumni who went to school with Sanders (said) they believe that the dramatic photo of Sanders, which his campaign has featured on its website and in a promotional video, is not in fact a photograph of Sanders. An archivist at the University of Chicago agreed in January that Sanders was not the speaker in the photo.” http://ti.me/1Ma6J23
NOVEMBER SURPRISE: POLITICO’s Eliza Collins reports: “In a blow to HILLARY CLINTON, former Ohio state senator and minority whip Nina Turner is throwing her support behind BERNIE SANDERS. The move is a surprise, considering how involved Turner has been with the Clintons. The former secretary of state met with Turner in October before her appearance at the Women's Leadership Forum. While she never formally endorsed Clinton, Turner was also involved in the Ready for Hillary super PAC, appeared at a Clinton organizing event, and served on the pro-Clinton super PAC Correct the Record until recently.” http://politi.co/1N04G4k
HOLLYWOOD HUNK: The Hollywood Reporter: It-guy actor Ryan Gosling, who turned 35 today, asked his Twitter followers to “do him a solid” to celebrate his birthday by passing around a BERNIE SANDERS campaign video called “Compassion.” http://bit.ly/1WUPiWa 
TURNING THE (WOOD) SCREWS: MassLive.com reports MARTIN O’MALLEY “called on IKEA to immediately recognize Massachusetts employees' decision to unionize, stressing that he stands with the Stoughton-based workers. In a letter to IKEA U.S. President Lars Petersson, (O’Malley) pointed to warehouse workers in Perryville, Md. who have formed a union … that he said ‘allows them to share in the company's success.’” http://bit.ly/1PqC6sU 
TRUMP ON THE STUMP
DARK ARTIST: POLITICO’s Alex Isenstadt reports DONALD TRUMP’s campaign “has been in talks with Rick Reed, a veteran Republican operative known for his bare-knuckle TV ad campaigns … Reed, a mainstay of GOP politics, has served as a strategist for a number of conservative causes. During the 2004 presidential race, he was a chief architect of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth effort to take down John Kerry.” http://politi.co/1WPrurY 
AWKWARD EMBRACE: Buzzfeed: “White supremacists are praising DONALD TRUMP for citing a 1950s U.S. government policy that deported hundreds of thousands of Mexican immigrants. After Trump mentioned the policy, called “Operation Wetback,” at Tuesday night’s Republican presidential debate, Richard B. Spencer, the president of the white nationalist National Policy Institute, tweeted, ‘Operation Wetback, (expletive) yeah!’” http://bzfd.it/1lmd6Xt 
TEXAS TIE: DONALD TRUMP and home state Sen. TED CRUZ are joint leaders in a new poll of Texas by the Texas Tribune and the University of Texas. http://bit.ly/1HE7W2R 
CARSON’S COURSE 
FRIEND WITHOUT BENEFITS: The Associated Press: “Republican presidential contender BEN CARSON has maintained a business relationship with a close friend convicted of defrauding insurance companies and testified on his behalf, even as the candidate has called for such crimes to be punished harshly. Pittsburgh dentist Alfonso A. Costa pleaded guilty to a felony count of health care fraud after an FBI probe into his oral surgery practice found he had charged for procedures he never performed, according to court records.” http://nbcnews.to/1OGrKoR 
‘BEST FRIEND’: Bloomberg: Carson reiterated Thursday that Costa was his “best friend” and defended him in a statement. http://bloom.bg/1WUWT72 
RUBIO’S RACE
IMMIGRATION DEFENSE: The Island Packet: “MARCO RUBIO defended his proposal to combat illegal immigration and his support of a 2013 immigration reform bill during his first presidential campaign stop on Hilton Head Island on Thursday morning … ""The American people do not trust the federal government to enforce our immigration laws,"" Rubio said. ""If you want to fix the mess we have on immigration in this country, it begins with a very concrete step -- proving to the American people that illegal immigration is under control. Actually doing it and proving it to people."" http://bit.ly/1HEjJhD 
HAPPENING NOW: POLITICO’s Daniel Strauss reports: “The immigration squabble among the Republican presidential contenders has turned into an all-out brawl between TED CRUZ and MARCO RUBIO, with the two senators challenging each other's conservative credentials on the hot-button issue.” Cruz took shots on Laura Ingraham’s talk show while Rubio said Cruz of supported legalizing people who entered the country illegally. http://politi.co/1SmUdOn 
THE DEBATE CRASHER: The Daily Beast wonders why David Rivera -- a controversial, scandal-soaked former congressman and friend of MARCO RUBIO’s – keeps showing up at Republican debates. Rubio’s campaign denies it has given him tickets. ""If he was there, he didn't get [a ticket] from us,"" Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. ""I don't know anything about his whereabouts."" http://thebea.st/1iXLMgn 
TED’S TRIP
DUMP ON TRUMP: The Boston Herald: TED CRUZ registered for the New Hampshire primary on Thursday and took a whack at DONALD TRUMP. Cruz “claimed he’s been a more consistent conservative than ... Trump. … ‘I think the distinguishing factor that every Republican primary voter is looking for is distinguishing between campaign conservatives -- people who talk a good game on the trail, but haven’t walked the walk -- and a consistent conservative,’ Cruz told reporters. http://bit.ly/1PqplyL
NO SWEETENER: The Associated Press gives more background on a potential fault line between TED CRUZ and MARCO RUBIO -- sugar subsidies. “Some conservatives, like Cruz, want to get rid of the program, which supports prices and protects growers from foreign competition. But sugar supports have for decades been unassailable in Congress, partly due to wide bipartisan support from lawmakers representing states from Florida to North Dakota that grow sugar cane and sugar beets.” http://bit.ly/1Lcypzy 
NOT A FAN: Gawker looks at Bob Dole’s reaction when asked about TED CRUZ. “Dole announces jovially, ‘There are a lot of good candidates. I like [extended pause] nearly all of them.’ Suddenly—his brow furrows. He turns to the women at his right. ‘Except…’ he whispers. ‘Except for Cruz.’ Then, the 92-year-old man begins to giggle. Over his deep sense of loathing for TED CRUZ, Bob Dole giggles.” http://bit.ly/1WPyHIJ 
JEB’S JOURNEY
ALL SYSTEMS BRO: POLITICO’s Nolan McCaskill takes a look at the ways JEB BUSH has been upping the machismo of his campaign. “The self-described introvert has gone on a bro spree, trying to prove to voters that he has the guts and determination to dominate the still unwieldy GOP field.” http://politi.co/1Mqn3tB 
BIG SPENDER: NBC reports that JEB BUSH and his allies are spending more than the other presidential campaigns, “outpacing the nearest competition by more than 2-to-1, according to ad-spending numbers from NBC News partner SMG Delta. Through this week, the pro-Bush Super PAC Right to Rise has spent a total of $17.5 million in TV ads, and the campaign has chipped in an additional $440,000.” http://nbcnews.to/1MEAoSp 
RAPIDS RESPONSE: Fox 17 reports JEB BUSH spoke to Republicans in Grand Rapids on Thursday. http://bit.ly/1iXNu1d 
CHRISTIE CHRONICLES
IOWA SUPER PUSH: POLITICO’s Alex Isenstadt reports: “CHRIS CHRISTIE is making his first major foray into Iowa, with his super PAC launching a slate of radio advertisements in the state promoting him as ‘a true conservative outsider.’ It’s the first time that a pro-Christie group has purchased airtime in Iowa … The Iowa ad, which will begin running on Friday, highlights Christie’s record battling Democrats in his liberal home state. It will run for two weeks and on about a dozen radio stations.” http://politi.co/1QkTShp 
LAWLESSNESS The Washington Post: CHRIS CHRISTIE was “asked about the protests at the University of Missouri and Yale University,” while campaigning in New Hampshire. Christie, “said that President Obama had created an atmosphere of ‘lawlessness.’’ ‘I think part of this is a product of the president’s own unwillingness and inability to bring people together,’ Christie said.” http://wapo.st/1OGwn2b 
SURVEYING THE 2016 LANDSCAPE
WATCHING YOU: Yahoo!: RAND PAUL “ thinks the government might be listening to Americans’ phone conversations and reading private emails — including his … ‘There is a huge trust gap. The head of our intelligence — the intelligence director James Clapper — came to the Senate, and when he was asked, ‘Are you collecting all of Americans’ phone records?,’ he said no. He lied to us,’ Paul said.” http://yhoo.it/1Qyw6xM 
DEBATE PREP: POLITICO’s Noah Weiland answers all the important questions ahead of Saturday’s second Democratic debate. Including that Saturday’s venue features stained glass windows. http://politi.co/1WPl38v 
NEXT NEWS CYCLE
HILLARY CLINTON, MARTIN O’MALLEY and BERNIE SANDERS are down and presumably prepping for Saturday’s tussle in Des Moines, Iowa. 
 MARCO RUBIO, TED CRUZ, LINDSEY GRAHAM, MIKE HUCKABEE, JEB BUSH, BEN CARSON and DONALD TRUMP are slated to speak at the Florida GOP’s Sunshine Summit in Orlando.
 CHRIS CHRISTIE’s in Iowa. So is CARLY FIORINA.
 JOHN KASICH is in New Hampshire, as is JEB BUSH.
THE DAILY NUMBER
88. That’s the number of times Priorities USA Action -- a super PAC backing HILLARY CLINTON -- has mentioned MARCO RUBIO in tweets or retweets since the Oct. 28 debate. A sign of who they expect -- or fear -- will get the GOP nomination. http://bit.ly/1Qys4p9

                        The exclusion of rebel groups from recent peace talks stirred controversy. 

            By

Secretary of State John Kerry assured members of the Syrian opposition on Thursday that they will play a key role in charting the future of their country, insisting diplomatic efforts to end the conflict in the Arab state are “not about imposing anything on anyone.”
Kerry’s comments came ahead of an international meeting in Vienna on Saturday aimed at plotting a path forward for Syria, where some 250,000 people have died and millions have been displaced in the past four and a half years.
Story Continued Below
No Syrian groups were invited to the first round of the effort two weeks ago, which drew representatives from a range of other interested parties, including rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia, as well as Russia. None are reported to have been invited to the new round either, although the delegations gathered are expected to try to decide which ones to invite in the future. The Syrians’ exclusion prompted criticism that the world powers running the show were not accounting for the wishes of the Syrian people.
But deciding which Syrians to invite is not simple. There are numerous Syrian opposition and other groups, many of them not moderate by U.S. standards but acceptable to other countries. Kerry himself noted that a U.N. envoy has met with representatives of more than 230 Syrian groups, including the Syrian government of Bashar Assad.
“I want to be clear: the Syrian people will be the validators of this whole effort,” Kerry said during a speech at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington, D.C. “Our own special envoy, Michael Ratney, has also been in constant communication with Syrian representatives, and I have met with opposition leaders myself. So this is not about imposing anything on anyone.”
The secretary acknowledged that Assad's future role remains a major sticking point among the U.S., Russia and Iran. All three countries now have military involvement in Syrian territory, although the U.S. says its role is restricted to battling the Islamic State terrorist network that has grabbed land there. Russia and Iran have backed Assad; the Obama administration wants him gone, as do the members of what Kerry described as the “responsible” Syrian opposition.
“Asking the opposition to trust Assad or to accept Assad’s leadership is simply not a reasonable request, and it is literally therefore a non-starter,” Kerry said.

When is the next Democratic presidential debate?
The second Democratic presidential debate will be Saturday, Nov. 14, live from Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. The school has been a staple for primary debates: It has hosted nationally televised debates every presidential cycle since 2007. Sheslow Auditorium, where the debate will occur, is a part of the National Register of Historic Places. It holds just 775 seats and has striking stained glass windows. If you’re eager to look like an insider, refer to the campus neighborhood as “Dogtown.”
Story Continued Below
What time and how long is the debate?
The debate will last two hours and begin at 9 p.m. Eastern time. It should look markedly different than the last Democratic debate: With just three candidates, each participant should be able to speak for a length of time equivalent to a stump speech. 
CBS News says there will be no opening statements. Candidates will have 60 seconds to respond, 30 seconds for rebuttals and follow ups, and 60 seconds for closing statements.
How can I watch the debate?
The debate will air on CBS and stream for free at www.cbsnews.com/live/. No cable subscription is necessary. CBS will also air the debate on its radio affiliates, meaning anyone with network TV, radio or Internet access can take it in. Those already tuned in to the live broadcast of the Midwest favorite Prairie Home Companion can simply switch the radio dial to listen.
The debate competes with a local football game as regional adversary Minnesota comes to Iowa City to play the fifth-ranked Iowa Hawkeyes in a critical matchup just more than 100 miles away. The winner of the Democratic debate will not receive the Floyd of Rosedale pig trophy awarded to the winner of the game.
Does this debate have a theme?
CBS News’ John Dickerson told The Des Moines Register he plans to focus the debate on the economy — especially wages and income inequality. Even health care, education and retirement issues will revolve on the axis of finance. “The goal of the moderator is to illuminate the views of the candidates on the issues that matter the most to voters, and you don’t need to be on the side of the party to do that,” Dickerson told the newspaper.
Who will participate in the debate?
After Lincoln Chafee and Jim Webb dropped out shortly after the last debate, the field was left with three candidates: Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley. In April, President Barack Obama joked that even attendees at an O’Malley campaign event wouldn’t recognize O’Malley, but after two debates, he seems to have earned at least a modest following. Just two days before the debate, he’ll dine with a family in Austin, Texas, headed by an illegal immigrant.
Where will they stand on the stage?
It would be an understatement to say Clinton has a commanding lead, which means she’ll stand center stage, flanked by Sanders and O’Malley. 
Who will moderate the debate?
There will be four people involved in moderating the debate, with Dickerson taking the lead as the principal moderator. Dickerson--known for acerbic questions asked on “Face the Nation” every Sunday--will get help from his CBS News colleague Nancy Cordes, the network’s congressional correspondent. Two local journalists will also pitch in on the panel with Cordes: KCCI’s Kevin Cooney and the Des Moines Register’s Kathie Obradovich. Cooney has been a stalwart of local politics and breaking news for decades and is retiring this month.
How will Sanders go after Clinton?
In the last debate’s most memorable moment, the Ronda Rousey-endorsed Sanders seemed to put the issue of Clinton’s email scandal(s) to rest. But he soon backed off his backing off the topic, telling The Wall Street Journal that the controversies involve “valid questions.” Sanders continues his implicit anti-Clinton campaign in a state that could decide his fate as a self-appointed revolutionary.
Will Clinton continue to be haunted by Iowa?
After losing to Barack Obama in a wrenching defeat in the 2008 Iowa caucuses, Clinton has spent the past few years building another sturdy following in the state. Any feelings of betrayal don’t appear to affect her in this less-competitive race. She has the endorsement of the beloved former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, and she’s convincing undecided Iowa Democrats that she is indeed, the best choice for the nomination.
When is the fifth Republican debate?
The fifth Republican debate is scheduled for Tuesday, Dec. 15 in Las Vegas — the last Republican debate of the calendar year. It will be hosted by CNN and Salem Radio and moderated by Wolf Blitzer. Hugh Hewitt will return to contribute questions.
When is the next Democratic debate?

Donald Trump defended his comment during the debate that increased American wages would hurt U.S. competition in a global market on Thursday, adding that he had not even realized he had caused a stir with his remarks.
“Let me just explain. That was on minimum wage and it was how we're going to compete with other countries,"" Trump told ""Fox and Friends"" in a telephone interview. ""They were talking about increasing the minimum wage. And whether it's taxes or minimum wages, if they’re too high, we’re not going to be able to compete with other countries.""
Story Continued Below
During the debate, Trump also said that he would not raise the minimum wage.
""But, taxes too high, wages too high, we're not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is,"" he told debate moderator Neil Cavuto when asked if he would raise wages. ""People have to go out, they have to work really hard and have to get into that upper stratum. But we cannot do this if we are going to compete with the rest of the world. We just can't do it.""
Taxes are ""so high in this country,"" the Republican candidate went on to say Thursday, touting his tax plan ""that is going to lower them greatly.""
""That’s what I’m referring to, and anybody should be able to see that. It was very clear,"" he added, going on to reference an on-screen chyron that read ""TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN."" 
""And interestingly, this is the first time I’ve even heard, you put a headline about 'Trump doubles down,'"" he told the hosts. ""It’s the first time I’ve even heard about it. I just called in and I’m hearing about it now for the first time, so obviously it can’t be much of a story.""
The explanation is ""pretty simple,"" he added, noting that he is ""talking about the fact that we have to keep competitive both in wages and you know the cost, and we also have to be competitive in taxes, because our taxes are so high that we can’t compete with other countries.""

                        The former Florida governor has suddenly became very bro. 

            By 
Nolan D. McCaskill

11/12/15 11:43 AM EST
Jeb Bush, once the ""joyful tortoise"" playing the long game in the presidential race, has come out of his shell. What's emerged? Macho Jeb!
The former Florida governor has been reinventing himself as he seeks to calm his ""nervous Nellie"" donors concerned about his flailing poll numbers and a series of underwhelming debate performances. 
Story Continued Below
His campaign has rebooted with a ""Jeb Can Fix It"" slogan, and the self-described introvert has gone on a bro spree, trying to prove to voters that he has the guts and determination to dominate the still-unwieldy GOP field. 
Here are just a few ways Macho Jeb has made his mark in recent days:
1. When a voter told Bush he was switching his support from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to Bush, the 6-foot-3 presidential candidate responded with an awkward chest bump. Bush didn't stop there. He's now offering chest bumps to any converts.
Cruz supporter tells Bush he's now backing him instead. Bush gives him a chest bump. pic.twitter.com/S201SJEabh
— Ashley Killough (@KilloughCNN) November 12, 2015
2. Bush is so tough, he says, he eats nails before breakfast. He even has the picture to prove it.
 
The waiters had a little fun with me this AM. #nailsforbreakfast pic.twitter.com/S2Zpb3I3Yr
— Jeb Bush (@JebBush) November 8, 2015
3. He’s also handy. Give Bush just about any problem and #JebCanFixIt. The Bush campaign launched this initiative earlier this month, much to the delight of Twitter.

4. Bush is also a winner, something on his to-do list in Iowa.

5. Bush is a jock, pre-gaming for the fourth presidential debate with some competition on the bocce ball court.

— Jeb Bush (@JebBush) November 11, 2015
6. Bush is so tough that he would kill Baby Hitler, a question first posed by New York Times Magazine: “Hell yeah, I would,” Bush told Huffington Post this week. “You gotta step up, man.”
7. And let’s not forget his low-five with Donald Trump during September’s GOP debate.

President Barack Obama ridiculed Donald Trump's proposal to use a ""deportation force"" to expel millions of undocumented immigrants from the United States, calling the proposal unrealistic as well as costly. 
“The notion that we’re gonna deport 11, 12 million people from this country — first of all, I have no idea where Mr. Trump thinks the money’s gonna come from,” Obama said in an interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos at the White House. “It would cost us hundreds of billions of dollars to execute that.”

Trump, appearing on “Morning Joe” this week, told co-host Mika Brzezinski he would have a deportation force to carry out his controversial immigration proposal. ""You're going to have a deportation force, and you're going to do it humanely and you’re going to bring the country — and, frankly, the people, because you have some excellent, wonderful people, some fantastic people that have been here for a long period of time,"" Trump said. ""Don't forget, Mika, that you have millions of people that are waiting in line to come into this country and they’re waiting to come in legally.""

Obama challenged the humanity of Trump’s plan. “Imagine the images on the screen flashed around the world as we were dragging parents away from their children, and putting them in what, detention centers, and then systematically sending them out,” Obama said. “Nobody thinks that that is realistic. But more importantly, that’s not who we are as Americans.”
The president said some Americans back the billionaire real estate mogul's proposal because there has always been some anti-immigrant sentiment in this country — ironically, he said, from people who have immigrant roots. 
“It’s the job of leaders not to play into that sentiment,” he said. “We don’t want, I think, a president or any person in a position of leadership to play on those kinds of fears.”
Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton attacked Trump on his deportation plan Wednesday, calling it “absurd, inhumane, and un-American.”
Immigration has been an especially hot topic on the campaign trail this week, with Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio getting in a nasty back-and-forth about their records on the issue.

Rep. Sam Farr won't run for reelection in 2016, the California Democrat announced Thursday. 
Farr was first elected in a 1993 special election to succeed former Rep. Leon Panetta, who left the seat to become director of the Office of Management and Budget under Bill Clinton.
Story Continued Below
Farr's decision was first reported by KSBW-TV.
The Monterey-based district is safely Democratic: President Barack Obama won 71 percent of the vote there in 2012, and Farr was reelected last year with 75 percent of the vote.
Panetta's son, Monterey County Deputy District Attorney James Panetta, has been mentioned as a possible successor to Farr. ""I've talked to people about it, and it's something I'm seriously considering,"" the younger Panetta told the Carmel Pine Cone in 2013.

                Secretary of Defense Ash Carter testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee. | John Shinkle

11/12/15 06:14 PM EST
Defense Secretary Ash Carter has fired his top military aide after learning about ""allegations of misconduct,"" he said in a statement late Thursday, and has asked the Pentagon's inspector general to investigate the matter.
""Today I made the decision to remove my Senior Military Assistant Lieutenant General Ron Lewis from his position after learning about allegations of misconduct,"" Carter said, without divulging the details of the allegations.
Story Continued Below
""I have confidence in the Inspector General's ability to determine the facts. The Department of the Army will then take action as appropriate,"" Carter added. ""I expect the highest possible standards of conduct from the men and women in this department particularly from those serving in the most senior positions. There is no exception.""
Lewis, a three-star general, previously served as Carter's top military aide when Carter served as deputy defense secretary from 2011 to 2013. Lewis subsequently served as the Army's chief spokesman before returning to Carter's side when he took over as defense secretary earlier this year.

                        Like the voters they hope to represent, the drug epidemic has touched them too.

Three Republican candidates, three surprising, highly personal revelations—all within days of each other. 
Gov. Chris Christie, well-known for his in-your-face, confrontational style, riveted a town meeting in New Hampshire with a double-barreled story that recounted the death of his tobacco-addicted mother and the death of a law school friend from a prescription drug overdose.
Story Continued Below
 “When I sat there as the governor of New Jersey at his funeral, and looked across the pew at [my friend’s] three daughters, sobbing because their dad is gone—there but for the grace of God go I,” he said. “It can happen to anyone. And so we need to start treating people in this country, not jailing them.”
 The video of Christie was well on its way to viral status when Jeb Bush, whose family is famously resistant to personal revelations, sat down with the Huffington Post on his campaign bus in New Hampshire to talk about the most painful part of his life: his daughter’s drug addiction. “I visited her in jail. Never expected to see my beautiful daughter in jail,” he said. “She went through hell.”
Within a day, Sen. Ted Cruz, as polished a wordsmith as anyone in politics, was telling CNN’s Jake Tapper about the crippling drug habit of his half-sister and his futile efforts to persuade her to leave a crack house. “I sometimes found it hard to reconcile the bright, fun and charismatic sister I adored with the person who would lie to me without hesitation and who stole money from her teenage brother to feed her various addictions.”
Listening to these candidates, it’s hard to detect the strident moralizing of the party that gave us “Just say no.” The GOP’s softening on drug addiction has quickly become one of the most striking themes of the 2016 campaign, even if it gets less attention than illegal immigration or repealing Obamacare. Suddenly, in a crowded and topsy-turvy primary season that seems to be rewarding outsiders who have torn up the political script, a number of Republicans are dispensing with the antiseptic bios and have found that voters are engaging with the messiest episodes of their lives.
What’s going on here? This is not a coincidence, or parallel “messaging.” In fact, if you look under the hood, you’ll find this is a convergence of important trends in both political style and demographics that could signal a rewrite of the American playbook on drugs and crime.
Violent crime, the urban kind that fixated voters in the 80s and 90s has dropped precipitously. But at the very same time a wave of drug crime driven by prescription drugs and now heroin has swept into every corner of American society, respecting now geographic, social or political boundaries. Hollow-eyed addicts were suddenly just as much a feature of red state back roads as they were on the boulevards of big cities. Heroin use has climbed among all demographic groups, but it has skyrocketed among whites; nearly 90 percent of those who tried heroin for the first time in the last decade were white. 
All this has changed the way GOP politicians are engaging with their voters. Multimillionaires like the ones who make up most of the presidential field might not have a lot in common economically with most voters, but when it comes to addiction they are discovering points of empathy with a wide cross section of the electorate. 
***
Remember when FDR told America that he would beat the Depression the way he beat polio? Remember when JFK told us how he learned to endure pain during his ordeal in the Pacific and his life-threatening surgeries? Remember when Reagan talked of putting his alcoholic father to bed?
 Of course you don’t—because they never said those things. In earlier days (and Reagan was very much a product of earlier times) that’s not how politicians talked. Today, a personal “narrative” is as crucial an element of a campaign as a super-PAC and a micro-targeter. 
 “I see it as one of the more positive movements in our political culture,” says longtime Republican consultant Stu Stevens, who is unworried about the possibility of artifice on the part of candidates, “People have a good bullshit detector to pick up whether people are being sincere or not.”
 Maybe the seeds were planted in Nixon’s 1952 “Checkers” speech when he answered charges of financial misconduct with a detailed account of his assets and debts, including his wife’s “good Republican cloth coat.” Maybe it was fed by Jimmy Carter’s intensely personal case for his candidacy—the peanut farmer/evangelical who would never lie to us. Maybe Bill Clinton’s 1992 acceptance speech blazed a path (“I never knew my father”). Or Al Gore’s two vice-presidential acceptance speeches-one invoking his son’s near-fatal auto accident, the other his sister’s harrowing death from lung cancer. Maybe it was Bush the father painting himself as a risk-taking entrepreneur or Bush the son’s story of his meeting with juvenile offenders, or guardedly acknowledging his own struggles with substance abuse.
 Whatever the sources, the need for prospective presidents to connect on a visceral, personal level is profound. And there’s no more effective tool than recounting some personal travail. Indeed, when linked to the policy proposals that accompany such testimonials, they act as enhancers of credibility: I know what drugs can do because I have seen it firsthand.
 Christie’s viral video notwithstanding, the effectiveness of these personal revelations is hard to measure. Christie has fallen to the second-tier debate and Bush remains mired in the single digits in many polls. But there is no sign that they, or the rest of the crowded GOP field, are going to stop sharing. And that might say more about the electorate than it does the candidates.
 There was a time when it was possible for Middle America to think of drugs as something that happened to “them”—to the black and brown urban poor. Today, there is no “them.” Drugs are in Our Town, Pleasantville, Farmville. 
 The evidence is in the statistics. Drug overdoses are the leading cause of “injury death” among Americans—greater than from motor vehicle crashes and firearms. And of those overdoses, more than half were from heroin or prescription drugs. Substance abuse is one key reason why the death rate among less educated white Americans has risen over the last several years. The evidence is also anecdotal: In January 2014, Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin devoted his entire State of the State address to the epidemic of addiction in the Green Mountain State. “The time has come for us to stop quietly averting our eyes from the growing heroin addiction in our front yards,” Shumlin said, “while we fear and fight treatment facilities in our backyards.”

Mike Allen's must-read briefing on what's driving the day in Washington 
11/12/15 08:01 AM EST
By Mike Allen (@mikeallen; mallen@politico.com) and Daniel Lippman (@dlippman; dlippman@politico.com)
 
Story Continued Below
Good Thursday morning. THE CONVERSATION -- JON MEACHAM on “Morning Joe,” on Dr. Carson’s foreign-policy muddle at the debate: “A presidential campaign cannot simply be ‘This Is Your Life.’ It has to be about OUR lives. … There has to be a core of substance. … The people I talk to understand Trump: populist-billionaire appeal, celebrity appeal. … They don’t quite get Carson.”
 
--SO MARK HALPERIN gave the table a “Carson 101,” on his support and appeal: evangelicals and homeschoolers, plus social-media power -- “a candidate of the digital age [who] goes over the head of not just the old media, but much of the new media, too.” His assets are his faith, his biography and people’s connection to him, “with all his flaws and lack of specificity.”
 
NEW OVERNIGHT -- “Carson profits from ties with convicted felon,” by AP’s Michael Biesecker and Eileen Sullivan: “Carson has maintained a business relationship with a close friend convicted of defrauding insurance companies and testified on his behalf … Pittsburgh dentist Alfonso A. Costa pleaded guilty to a felony count of health care fraud after an FBI probe into his oral surgery practice found he had charged for procedures he never performed ... At Costa’s 2008 sentencing hearing, Carson described the dentist as ‘one [of] my closest, if not my very closest friend. ... Next to my wife of 32 years, there is no one on this planet that I trust more than Al Costa.’” http://bit.ly/1OG5prp
 
DEBATE AFTERMATH -- “Kasich faces conservative backlash over debate performance,” by Daniel Strauss: “[C]onservative media [are] thrashing the Ohio governor for soft positions on immigration and bank bailouts. Kasich has made no bones about his strain of compassionate conservatism that can ring hollow to evangelical voters and those looking for a true political outsider. But as Tuesday night evolved into a contest of conservative bona fides, Kasich appeared even more out of step with the rest of the GOP field, and came off as edgy, interrupting his rivals throughout the two-hour event.” http://politi.co/1kOMyh1
 
HOW JEB COULD STILL DO IT -- “Bush Is 2016’s John Kerry,” by Bill Scher, senior writer at the Campaign for America’s Future, on Politico: “Kerry’s [2004 primary] victory was not predicated on getting a personality transplant. He stuck to his boring script, used his personal finances to keep the campaign afloat and waited for everyone else’s weaknesses to become apparent. Once the others flopped, voters flocked to him as a safe harbor. Written off a few months earlier, Kerry ended up running the table, winning virtually every primary and caucus. Bush is in the same position Kerry was in November of 2003: floundering with the public yet surrounded by untested candidates and stocked with institutional resources. These are the necessary ingredients for outlasting the competition.” http://politi.co/1Qk1JvJ
 
--PEGGY NOONAN, on “Morning Joe,” re Jeb’s debate: “I think he achieved adequacy.”
 
JEB’S BASE? “Bush plans major D.C. fundraiser,” by Alex Isenstadt: “Those involved with the planning of the event, which is to be held on the evening of Dec. 3 at the home of former Ambassador Boyden Gray, said it would be one of Bush’s largest Washington fundraisers since he formally launched his candidacy last summer. … [T]he host committee … includes over two dozen current members of Congress and over 60 lobbyists, fundraisers and financial players.
“Among the names listed on the invitation are Sens. Susan Collins and Orrin Hatch and House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions. Also included are Bush family loyalists such as former Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, former Transportation Secretary Maria Cino, and former George W. Bush chiefs of staff Andy Card and Josh Bolten. Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor is also listed.” http://politi.co/1NLRX3O
 
--On Veterans Day, Bush campaign announced: “Bob Dole to Serve as National Veterans’ Chairman for Governor Jeb Bush.” http://bit.ly/1MpwGbV
 
RUBIO VICTORY-LAP video, “A Rubio Four-peat at #GOPDebate.” http://bit.ly/1OG83gM
 
RUBIO = GOP “GOLDEN BOY” – WashPost A1, above fold, “Rubio’s rivals pulling their punches, for now: Reluctance to bruise GOP’s golden boy helps his rise into top tier,” by Phil Rucker and Bob Costa: “For Rubio, it is a return to the lofty status he had after he burst onto the national scene five years ago. Many Republican elites are once again celebrating him as the party’s golden boy, … and fear seeing him bruised too badly during the primary season. … Asked why Bush did not scrutinize Rubio during the Milwaukee exchange, campaign manager Danny Diaz said the debate ‘was a serious one where important issues were discussed,’ and he urged reporters to stay tuned for the next debate on Dec. 15.” http://wapo.st/1MYBjza
 
ARTICLE OF THE DAY -- “How the Kochs created Joni Ernst: New details reveal the billionaire brothers’ network efforts to reshape the GOP are more ambitious than previously reported,” by Ken Vogel: “[T]he network’s financial support for [now-Sen. Joni] Ernst [of Iowa] ― detailed here for the first time ― offers the first signs of a move into GOP primaries. The Kochs and their allies are investing in a pipeline to identify, cultivate and finance business-oriented candidates from the local school board all the way to the White House, and Koch operatives are already looking for opportunities to challenge GOP incumbents deemed insufficiently hardline in their opposition to government spending and corporate subsidies.
“The ambitious effort, spearheaded partly by a for-profit consulting firm called Aegis Strategic that’s backed by the Koch network, is one of several ways in which the brothers and their allies are seeking to influence the types of candidates who carry the GOP banner. The network has taken on a vetting role in the GOP presidential primary, offering favored candidates access to its donors and activists. And some within the network have even advocated targeting from six to 12 GOP House members who have run afoul of the Koch orthodoxy on fiscal issues and who are facing 2016 primary challenges.” http://politi.co/1M8QCBS
--“Charles Koch has no plans to back a candidate in Republican primary,” by USA Today’s Fredreka Schouten: “‘I have no plans to support anybody in the primary now.’” http://usat.ly/1iWm4sp

RICK WILEY’s new gig -- “Walker’s presidential campaign manager gets new job” – AP/Madison:“Rick Wiley has been hired to work for the [NRSC] ... as a national voter contacts consultant, just as he was in 2014.” http://bit.ly/1SK2ixb  
 
SPEAKER RYAN -- House Republican Steering Committee to replace chairs with rank-and-file -- Jake Sherman: “Republicans are moving toward booting committee chairmen from a powerful panel that makes committee assignments, in what would be .. Ryan’s biggest restructuring of internal GOP policy so far ... [T]op committee chairmen would be removed from the panel and replaced with members elected by the House Republican Conference ...
“In the next Congress, the GOP would add additional regional representatives to the committee so it better reflects the makeup of the Republican Conference. ... The steering committee has become the target of much anger from conservatives, who see it as emblematic of the strong arm of the House speaker. For example, the panel can be used to strip troublemaking lawmakers of their committee assignments.” http://politi.co/1Y63iin

PULLING BACK THE CAMERA -- WSJ A1, above fold, “Populism Rises in GOP Race: Debate shows how 2008 financial crisis has reshaped the Republican Party … Candidates bash big banks, the Fed, corporations and international trade deals,” by Nick Timiraos: “Candidates voiced concerns about the power of big banks, even as they promised to sweep away new regulations, including the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul.” http://on.wsj.com/1kODB7k
 
--N.Y. Times A1, above fold, “G.O.P. Fight Is Now a Battle Over What Defines a Conservative,” by Jonathan Martin: “Years’ worth of arguments conducted at issues forums and in the pages of policy journals and newspapers are now coming to life. … Rubio is … facing a new line of questioning from doctrinaire supply-side conservatives about his tax plan, which would enlarge and make refundable a tax credit to families with children. How he defends it … could offer insight into the priorities of a party that is increasingly blue collar yet recoils from … a government handout.” With breakouts on immigration, foreign policy, bank bailouts, tax cuts http://nyti.ms/1WTFOdD
ROGER AILES email to the staff: “First, my congratulations to the employees of the Fox Business Network. The debate last night was excellent and showcased FBN as a world class financial network.

HOT VIDEO -- “Watch the Donald Trump Sketch So Bad ‘SNL’ Didn’t Even Air It,” by The Daily Beast’s Matt Wilstein: “For some reason, NBC decided to release this video, simply titled ‘Donald Trump’s Hair,’ online Wednesday, perhaps so the world could see that things could have been so much worse. In the misguided sketch, ‘Scalp Team 6’ is forced to shrink down and land a not-so-tiny aircraft on President Trump’s hair to keep it in line during an important and improbably windy summit with Vladimir Putin.” http://thebea.st/1M7XYWb

Five survived”: TIME’s David Von Drehle, Jay Newton-Small and Maya Rhodan conducted more than 150 interviews, including with the victims’ families and every adult survivor. Von Drehle writes: “At a time when the violent deaths of African Americans were triggering protests and even rioting from Missouri to Maryland—and a national movement sprang up to proclaim that Black Lives Matter—here was a cold-blooded attack by an avowed white supremacist intending to provoke a race war in the heart of the old Confederacy. But instead of war, Charleston erupted in grace, led by the survivors of the Emanuel Nine.”

--JON WARD, “Show notes for a great conversation,” on a panel he’s moderating: “[T]he panelists are focused on a topic near and dear to my heart: how technology shapes us in deep, profound ways, often without us fully comprehending it.” http://bit.ly/1LbyH9G

                        The controversial businessman may work with Rick Reed, a chief architect of the Swift Boat attack on Kerry.

            By 
Alex Isenstadt

11/12/15 11:58 AM EST
Donald Trump’s team has been in talks with Rick Reed, a veteran Republican operative known for his bare-knuckle TV ad campaigns, according to two sources familiar with the discussions. 
Reed, a mainstay of GOP politics, has served as a strategist for a number of conservative causes. During the 2004 presidential race, he was a chief architect of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth effort to take down John Kerry. He has previously worked for a number of congressional Republicans, including South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and former Virginia Sen. George Allen. He also spent years as a top operative for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
Story Continued Below
It was not clear, the sources said, whether Reed had formally signed on with the Trump campaign. 
Neither Reed nor spokespersons for Trump responded to multiple requests for comment in recent days, and neither side would confirm or deny that talks had taken place.
Despite his personal wealth, Trump, who remains the front-runner in the Republican presidential primary contest, has yet to commit to spending a substantial amount of money on TV ads to boost his candidacy. The real estate mogul, however, recently invested $300,000 in a slate of radio commercials airing in early primary states.

11/12/15 06:15 PM EST
In a blow to Hillary Clinton, former Ohio state senator and minority whip Nina Turner is throwing her support behind Bernie Sanders.
The move is a surprise, considering how involved Turner has been with the Clintons. The former secretary of state met with Turner in October before her appearance at the Women's Leadership Forum. While she never formally endorsed Clinton, Turner was also involved in the Ready for Hillary super PAC, appeared at a Clinton organizing event, and served on the pro-Clinton super PAC Correct the Record until recently. Former President Bill Clinton was also involved in Turner’s unsuccessful run for Ohio Secretary of State last year.
Story Continued Below
""Yes, I was out there, 'ready' [for Clinton], because I wanted to make sure Democrats were ready,"" Turner said to Cleveland.com. ""I thought it was important to show that Democrats were ready to go right back at it for 2015 and 2016. This has nothing to do with the secretary.""
“I'm very attracted by his message and his style and that he has held pretty much strong on his beliefs and the world is catching up with him,"" Turner said about Sanders, who she formally endorsed Thursday. 
On Monday Turner will introduce Sanders at a rally at Cleveland State University.
""Sen. Turner is a star in the Democratic Party. Bernie is very proud to have someone with so much talent and commitment join the grassroots campaign to fix the rigged economy propped up by a corrupt campaign finance system,"" Michael Briggs, Sanders' communication director said in a statement emailed to POLITICO.
The Vermont senator's campaign manager Jeff Weaver said the campaign was ""extremely, extremely humbled"" by Turner's support.
""She is nationally known as a voice for voting rights, for workers' rights and for marginalized people. The support of someone with that record of standing up for middle-income and working people is tremendously important,"" Weaver said in a statement emailed to POLITICO.
The Republican National Committee jumped on the news, sending out the Cleveland.com article Thursday afternoon in an email that started, “Guess somebody’s going on the ‘enemies list’ …”

11/12/15 03:59 PM EST
Chris Christie is making his first major foray into Iowa, with his super PAC launching a slate of radio advertisements in the state promoting him as “a true conservative outsider.”
It’s the first time that a pro-Christie group has purchased airtime in Iowa. The New Jersey governor has made New Hampshire the focus of his campaign, and the super PAC, America Leads, has spent the vast majority of its budget on running ads there.
Story Continued Below
The Iowa ad, which will begin running on Friday, highlights Christie’s record battling Democrats in his liberal home state. It will run for two weeks and on about a dozen radio stations. It comes as Christie is in the middle of a three-day campaign swing in the state.
“With Democrats fighting Chris Christie’s every move he did what others only talk about,” says the spot, which notes his vetoes of tax increases and his high-profile battles with teachers unions. “You want a president with the guts to stop the liberals ruining America, who cares about you and has your back?”
A spokesman for the super PAC, Tucker Martin, declined to say how much was being spent but called the sum “substantial.”
The decision to invest in Iowa comes as some in the party are calling for early-state polling to determine entry to future debates. At issue is whether debate hosts should base entry on a candidate’s standing in early-state polls, as opposed to the national ones that have been used so far. Christie, who polls at around 2 percent nationally, narrowly missed the cut to qualify for this week’s prime-time debate in Milwaukee.
CNN, which is hosting the next Republican debate, to be held Dec. 15 in Las Vegas, has yet to say whether it will be using early-state or national polls in deciding which candidates are allowed onstage.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman predicts that other states will follow his lead in cracking down on the daily fantasy sports sites DraftKings and FanDuel, saying regulators in his state and in others are just catching up to the industry's explosive growth over the last several months. 
“They grew very, very quickly and I think that New York state regulators and a lot of other states weren’t paying very much attention,"" Schneiderman said during a POLITICO New York Playbook discussion in Manhattan on Thursday. ""And in the last six to eight months, they've really exploded and become multibillion-dollar businesses and drawn the scrutiny of regulators here and all across the country.""

Schneiderman sent cease-and-desist letters to both DraftKings and FanDuel on Tuesday, on the basis that under state law, both websites amount to gambling, which is prohibited save for exemptions for venues like the state-run lottery, horse racetracks and casinos.
“There just is no exemption for daily fantasy sports gambling,"" Schneiderman told POLITICO's Mike Allen and POLITICO New York's Jimmy Vielkind.
The attorney general also remarked that if he were running one of the sites, he would try to see how he could get the law changed so that they could operate legally.
“They’ve got a phalanx of lawyers,"" Schneiderman said, when asked whether he would look at a statutory change or an amendment to a state law, ""and I’m sure they’re looking at that issue right now.”
As POLITICO reported earlier this week, other large states like California and Florida could be moved to act in New York's footsteps, which itself followed a decision by Nevada's state gaming commission to end the sites' operations in the state until they get gambling licenses.

The 2006 federal law that included an exception for fantasy sports games based on knowledge or skill was created during a time in which the technology to run a ""quick-payout, high-pressure"" operation did not exist, he remarked.
States have to take the lead, Schneiderman said, ""because the federal government is actually falling apart.""
""It's something where, were the federal government less dysfunction than it is now, they might come in and amend the Internet Gaming Act, but I don't think anyone at the state level is spending a lot of time waiting for that to happen,"" he said.

11/12/15 11:05 AM EST
In a move that could help stem the Democrats' declining fortunes in coal country, Hillary Clinton Thursday unveiled a $30 billion package of proposals to insulate coalfield workers and their families from economic upheaval amid a transition to cleaner sources of energy. 
The plan comes as Clinton and Bernie Sanders, her top challenger in the Democratic presidential primary, have both sought an edge with aggressive policies to confront climate change. But they acknowledge that doing so will require dramatically reducing consumption of coal, which has helped drive economies in key swing states including Ohio, Pennsylvania and Colorado, and elsewhere around the country. 
Story Continued Below
""Hillary Clinton is committed to meeting the climate change challenge as President and making the United States a clean energy superpower,"" the six-page plan says. ""At the same time, she will not allow coal communities to be left behind — or left out of our economic future.""
The fact sheet outlines a $30 billion package to shore up pension benefits, fund schools and train out-of-work coal miners or utility workers to find jobs in other industries, among other proposals. It does not include an itemized breakdown of the spending. Many of the proposals would need approval from Congress, where Republicans have so far balked at President Barack Obama's request for $10 billion in aid for coalfield communities.



            By

Several major U.S. coal mining companies have announced this year that they would or may soon seek bankruptcy protection, including Arch Coal, Patriot Coal, Alpha Natural Resources, Walter Energy and James River Coal. The Obama administration last month announced $14.5 million in grants to help coal communities diversify their economies. 
Clinton draws from several ideas already circulating on Capitol Hill, such as bipartisan pension-protection legislation from West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania senators to protect coal miner pensions. Clinton would expand that to include retirees from power plants or transportation companies who lose benefits due to a coal market-related bankruptcy. And she endorses “sweeping reforms” proposed by Virginia and Pennsylvania Democrats for the federal black lung benefit program.
Her plan also would create a Secure Coal Community Schools program — similar to the existing Secure Rural Schools program to offset lost revenue from a decline in Western timber sales — that would replace lost coal-industry revenue to public schools “until alternative sources of local tax revenue arise through economic growth.” 
Clinton outlines goals to modernize infrastructure, repurpose mines and power plant sites, increase high-speed broadband access and expedite permitting for renewable energy projects and transmission lines. She also would offer more tax credits for low-income residents, allow companies investing in coalfield communities to avoid capital gains taxes and establish a competitive grant program.
Carbon capture and sequestration research and development would receive more support under Clinton's plan. The technology has already received substantial federal support, but remains expensive and has struggled to gain widespread adoption. 
Clinton had already teased her coal community strategy back in July when she released a set of clean power goals that would build on the Obama administration's strategy. It also partially hit goals touted by billionaire climate activist and donor Tom Steyer and earned her the endorsement of the League of Conservation Voters. 
But Sanders has earned plaudits for pushing Clinton to the left, including in opposing the Keystone XL pipeline and Arctic drilling. His stance on stopping fossil fuel production on federal property goes further than Clinton has advocated and the longtime Vermont senator is promising to detail an aggressive climate platform that also goes further than a bill he offered in 2013 to enact a carbon tax. Sanders has also promised to propose a plan to provide education and training programs for coal workers.

Donald Trump on Thursday clarified his comments from Tuesday night's GOP debate about wages being too high, saying the blowback has been misguided.
The billionaire businessman was asked during the Fox Business debate about whether he was sympathetic to protesters who have been pushing for the minimum wage to be raised to $15 an hour. 
Story Continued Below
“I can’t be…and the reason I can’t be is because we are a country that is being beaten on every front,” Trump said on Tuesday night. “Taxes too high, wages too high, we’re not going to be able to compete against the world.”
But on Fox News’ “Special Report” Thursday he insisted that he never said wages were too high, just that the minimum wage should not increase.

“I didn’t say that. Bret, we were talking about the minimum wage, and they said ‘should we increase the minimum wage?’ And I’m saying that if we’re going to compete with other countries we can’t do that because the wages would be too high,” Trump said after host Bret Baier asked him about his comments.
“I was referring to the minimum wage,” Trump continued. 
The business mogul said that people say they want to increase the minimum wage because it sounds good politically and even though it’s hard for him to say, he had to stand strong on not raising the minimum wage because “our country is losing businesses.”

Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are neck-and-neck in Texas, well ahead of their nearest competitors.
According to an online University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll out Thursday, the Texas senator and business mogul each have the support of 27 percent of likely Republican voters in the state. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson trails them at 13 percent. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio comes in at 9 percent. 
Story Continued Below
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina are all tied at 4 percent. Everyone else is at 2 percent or below. 
The poll has bad news for Bush, who has been attempting to right a struggling campaign — 25 percent of likely Republican voters say they would “definitely not support"" him, the highest for any candidate. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham comes in second, with 22 percent saying they would definitely not support him, former New York Gov. George Pataki at 20 percent, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore at 18 percent. Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich both get 16 percent.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton doubles Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ share of support; 61 percent to 30 percent, respectively. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley gets 1 percent support.
Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig, who has since dropped out of the race, leads with “definitely not support” with 6 percent in the poll. Clinton and Sanders have 5 percent, and O’Malley has 4 percent. 
The survey of 1,200 registered voters was taken Oct. 30 to Nov. 8 online with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.83 percentage points. Out of 542 registered Republican primary voters, the margin of error is plus or minus 4.21 percentage points. Out of registered 459 Democratic primary voters, the margin of error is plus or minus 4.57 percentage points.

                    Updated 11/12/15 03:40 PM EST
The immigration squabble among the Republican presidential contenders has turned into an all-out brawl between Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, with the two senators challenging each other's conservative credentials on the hot-button issue.
While they were by no means the only GOP candidates throwing around immigration accusations on Thursday, the intensity was the highest between Cruz and Rubio, seen as two of the strongest ascending members of the Republican field, especially after Tuesday's fourth debate.
Story Continued Below
""They fought tooth and nail to try and jam this amnesty down the American people's throats,"" Cruz said in an interview with conservative radio host Laura Ingraham on Thursday, speaking about the ""Gang of Eight"" senators. Rubio's membership in the group, which unsuccessfully shepherded a comprehensive immigration reform effort in 2013, has haunted him since.
""Talk is cheap,"" Cruz continued, saying Rubio's actions disprove any claim that he's as conservative as Cruz on the topic. Cruz later added that the Florida senator opposed a set of amendments introduced by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and himself. 
""He opposed every single one of them, every single amendment,"" Cruz said. ""The 'Gang of Eight' voted as a gang against enforcing and securing the border."" 
Rubio, in roughly the same bracket of hours Thursday morning, took a few shots at Cruz while campaigning in South Carolina, hitting the Texas senator from the right.

""Ted is a supporter of legalizing people that are in this country illegally. In fact, when the Senate bill was proposed, he proposed legalizing people that were here illegally,"" Rubio said during a campaign stop in Hilton Head, according to a readout from his campaign. ""He proposed giving them work permits. He's also supported a massive expansion of the green cards. He supported a massive expansion of the H-1B program, a 500% increase. So, if you look at it, I don't think our positions are dramatically different. I do believe that we have to deal with immigration reform in a serious way, and it begins by proving to people that illegal immigration is under control."" 
A Cruz aide shot back that Rubio's comments were not an accurate indicator of where the Texas senator stands on immigration. 
""Laughably FALSE. No one fought harder to prevent Gang of 8's amnesty bill than Ted Cruz. Record is remarkably clear,"" Cruz rapid response director Brian Phillips tweeted. 
The tinder fueling the fighting between Cruz and Rubio has been growing for some time now. Cruz has styled himself as a hard-liner on immigration reform, and opponents of Rubio often accuse him of flipping back and forth on immigration reform, notably taking a rightward turn recently in throwing his support behind legislation cracking down on sanctuary cities. 
Other candidates looked to join in on the skirmishing that started during Tuesday night debate's in Milwaukee. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum tried to get into the mix by tweeting out on Thursday a link to a clip of Cruz describing how he's introduced ""two amendments to significantly expand legal immigration, to double the caps on legal immigration from 675,000 to 1.3 million and to increase temporary high skilled workers by 500 percent.""
It is clear what candidate is not a real conservative on immigration. Watch @tedcruz in 2013. https://t.co/TlCUYfgOi4
— Rick Santorum (@RickSantorum) November 12, 2015
Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, in a separate interview with Ingraham, moved to jab Rubio on his tax plan by tying it to immigration. 
""I think Rubio's plan would explode payments to illegal aliens. And this is a real problem. Until we fix the current tax credits, do we really want to double and triple the amount of tax credits we're giving? I mean really, $4 billion to illegal aliens? I think Rubio's tax plan will extend more tax credits to illegal aliens, and I think there's no way in the world that we should be supporting something like this,"" Paul said.

Immigration has become a central litmus test among conservatives this cycle, especially after billionaire Donald Trump kicked off his presidential run with a bold promise to build a massive wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and later pledged to deport more than 11 million undocumented immigrants. He noticeably pushed the field further right on the issue, after the Republican Party tried to find a more central position in the wake of Mitt Romney's bruising loss in 2012.
The two candidates currently leading in the polls — Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson — also tangled in the wake of Tuesday's debate. 
Carson said in an interview with The Washington Examiner on Wednesday that Trump's moves to build a wall along the border would backfire in the long run. ""I think there are enough people who know that there are others in the race that are very reasonable,"" Carson said. ""I don't think he necessarily is the representation of the Republican Party — far from it.""
On Thursday, Trump hit back, tweeting: ""Wow, pres. candidate Ben Carson, who is very weak on illegal Immigration, just said he likes amnesty and a pathway to citizenship.""
It wasn't the first time on Thursday that Trump banged the stronger borders drum, tweeting earlier in the day: ""We, as a country, either have borders or we don't. IF WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS, WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY!""

A federal judge issued an order Thursday that will sharply ramp up the volume of documents being  released in a lawsuit demanding memos and emails from top aides to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
U.S. District Court Judge Rudolph Contreras instructed the State Department to move toward production of 2,200 pages of documents per month in the case by next summer, up from a rate of 700 pages per month he set at a hearing earlier this week. The schedule virtually guarantees that a significant volume of records about Clinton, who is the leading Democratic candidate for president, will be emerging through the primary and caucus season and into the heart of the general election next fall.
The order (posted here) came in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by Vice News reporter Jason Leopold. It originally sought virtually all records the State Department possessed pertaining to Clinton's four-year tenure as secretary.
The State Department already agreed to release redacted versions of about 30,000 emails Clinton kept in a private account and returned to her former agency last December at its request. Leopold has now narrowed the request to a variety of topics ranging from WikiLeaks to the Keystone XL pipeline and to emails and other records used by top aides to Clinton.
More details on the dispute are here.

"WASHINGTONTwo U.S. consumer groups announced the formation of a coalition with New York labor unions on Thursday to press antitrust regulators to oppose big insurance mergers that would cut the number of nationwide for-profit health insurers from five to three.
The Coalition to Preserve Patient Choice, made up of the Consumer Federation of America, Consumer Action and others, was formed because of concern about Anthem Inc's purchase of Cigna Corp for $47 billion and Aetna Inc's decision to buy Humana Inc for $37 billion, the group said in a statement.
""The CPPC believes these mergers should be challenged or patient choice will suffer. In fact, studies have shown previous health insurance mergers resulted in (price) increases ranging from 7 percent to nearly 14 percent,"" the group said.  
Anthem said in a statement that the coalition's assertions were ""misleading,"" and that it was ""confident that the transaction’s consumer benefits will be understood by state and federal regulators.""
Aetna said in a statement that its deal for Humana was ""primarily about the Medicare marketplace, where there is robust competition and choice. We are confident that our transaction will receive a fair, thorough and fact-based review from the Department of Justice and the states.""
The deals are being reviewed by the U.S. Department of Justice and state insurance regulators, and have been the subject of hearings in Congress. They have also been criticized by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who said last month that she is ""very skeptical"" the mergers would be good for consumers.
The American Medical Association has asked for the deals to be blocked while the American Hospital Association has also been critical of them.

"Students held demonstrations on university campuses across the United States on Thursday to protest ballooning student loan debt for higher education and rally for tuition-free public colleges.
The demonstrations, dubbed the Million Student March, were planned just two days after thousands of fast-food workers took to the streets in a nationwide day of action pushing for a $15-an-hour minimum wage and union rights for the industry.
About 50 students from Boston-area colleges gathered at Northeastern University carrying signs that read ""Degrees not receipts"" and ""Is this a school or a corporation?""
""The student debt crisis is awful. Change starts when people demand it in the street. Not in the White House,"" said Elan Axelbank, 20, a third year student at Northeastern, who said he was a co-founder of the national action.
Photos and videos posted on Twitter, where #MillionStudentMarch was trending worldwide, showed marches involving dozens to hundreds of demonstrators at schools including Texas State, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and Depaul University in Chicago.
A few hundred students rallied on the campus of the historically progressive University of California Berkeley, and posted placards on the outside of a class building showing their individual student debt loads, ranging from just several thousand dollars to more than $100,000.
Organizers are demanding tuition-free public colleges, cancellation of all student debt and a $15-an-hour minimum wage for campus workers.
The total volume of outstanding U.S. student loan debt has more than doubled to $1.2 trillion, according to the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, compared with less than $600 billion in 2006.
Saddled with debt that can sometimes run into hundreds of thousands of dollars, many college graduates struggle to make payments amid an ailing economy and job market.
Dealing with swiftly mounting student loan debt has been a focus of candidates vying for the White House in 2016.
Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders, who has vowed to make tuition free at public universities and colleges, and has pledged to cut interest rates for student loans, tweeted in support of the movement on Thursday afternoon.
His rival Hillary Clinton has said she would increase access to tuition grants, let graduates refinance loans at lower interest rates, and streamline income-based repayment plans.
Florida U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, the most prominent Republican candidate to lay out a concrete proposal, says he would establish an income-based repayment system for federal student loans and would simplify applications for federal aid.
Demonstrators on Thursday also widened their message to echo protests at the University of Missouri, three days after the school's former president resigned amid student anger over failure to address racial discrimination on campus.

"BUENOS AIRESArgentina's central bank
chief accused the opposition of leveling false charges to force
him from office and vowed on Thursday to stay until the end of
his term in 2019, despite calls from the leading presidential
candidate for him to resign.
Monetary policymaker Alejandro Vanoli was accused by a state
prosecutor on Wednesday of selling U.S. dollar reserves at a
cheaper rate than that set by the international foreign exchange
futures market. The accusation has yet to go before a judge.
But it added to the pressure on Vanoli after opposition
presidential candidate Mauricio Macri, the business-friendly
mayor of Buenos Aires who is leading the opinion polls ahead of
the Nov. 22 election, urged him to resign.
""My term ends in 2019 and I intend to stay until then,""
Vanoli told radio station Vorterix, saying the accusation 
against him was baseless and politically motivated.
He was appointed by outgoing President Cristina Fernandez,
who was revered by the poor for strengthening the social safety
net and reviled by investors for her interventionist policies.
She is constitutionally barred from running for a third term
this year. Fernandez has endorsed Buenos Aires Governor Daniel
Scioli for president, but his platform of mixing Fernandez's
generous social spending with gradual free-market reforms has
not won popularity with voters.
Macri is campaigning on a mandate to unwind state controls
on the currency and trade that critics blame for stunted
investment and stalled growth in Latin America's No. 3 economy.
If Macri wins the presidency, his public show-downs with
Vanoli may continue. Macri blames Argentina's double-digit
inflation rate on Fernandez's and Vanoli's unorthodox policies.
The central bank chief denies any wrongdoing in the selling
of dollars and said in a statement on Wednesday he would
cooperate with investigators.
""The accusation from certain sectors of the opposition about
the sale of dollars in the futures market is without merit and

A Macri spokesman could not be immediately reached.
With Argentina's official exchange rate of 9.6 to
the U.S. dollar 61 percent stronger than the black market rate,
the pace of the peso's devaluation next year is a hot point of
contention in the presidential campaign.
Macri would unify Argentina's exchange rates at a stronger
level than the current official rate. Scioli and Vanoli say such
a sharp devaluation would erode salaries and spur inflation.

"WASHINGTONU.S. President Barack Obama said on Thursday Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's plan for mass deportation of illegal immigrants is unrealistic.
""The notion that we're gonna deport 11, 12 million people from this country - first of all, I have no idea where Mr. Trump thinks the money’s gonna come from. It would cost us hundreds of billions of dollars to execute that,” Obama said in a White House interview with ABC News, according to excerpts released by the network.
""Imagine the images on the screen flashed around the world as we were dragging parents away from their children, and putting them in what, detention centers, and then systematically sending them out,"" the president said. “Nobody thinks that is realistic. But more importantly, that’s not who we are as Americans.""
Trump, a real estate billionaire who has been leading in opinion polls among candidates for the Republican nomination in the 2016 election, calls for building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and deporting all illegal immigrants.
The immigration issue has driven a wedge between Hispanics, a voting bloc with increasing clout, and Republicans, many of whom take a hard line on illegal immigration, to the benefit of Obama's fellow Democrats. Most of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants are Hispanic.
Obama said there has always been a streak of anti-immigrant sentiment in the United States. ""We don’t want, I think, a president or any person in a position of leadership to play on those kinds of fears,"" he told ABC.

"BUENOS AIRESArgentina's central bank
chief accused the opposition of leveling false charges to force
him from office and vowed on Thursday to stay until the end of
his term in 2019, despite calls from the leading presidential
candidate for him to resign.
Monetary policymaker Alejandro Vanoli was accused by a state
prosecutor on Wednesday of selling U.S. dollar reserves at a
cheaper rate than that set by the international foreign exchange
futures market. The accusation has yet to go before a judge.
But it added to the pressure on Vanoli after opposition
presidential candidate Mauricio Macri, the business-friendly
mayor of Buenos Aires who is leading the opinion polls ahead of
the Nov. 22 election, urged him to resign.
""My term ends in 2019 and I intend to stay until then,""
Vanoli told radio station Vorterix, saying the accusation 
against him was baseless and politically motivated.
He was appointed by outgoing President Cristina Fernandez,
who was revered by the poor for strengthening the social safety
net and reviled by investors for her interventionist policies.
She is constitutionally barred from running for a third term
this year. Fernandez has endorsed Buenos Aires Governor Daniel
Scioli for president, but his platform of mixing Fernandez's
generous social spending with gradual free-market reforms has
not won popularity with voters.
Macri is campaigning on a mandate to unwind state controls
on the currency and trade that critics blame for stunted
investment and stalled growth in Latin America's No. 3 economy.
If Macri wins the presidency, his public show-downs with
Vanoli may continue. Macri blames Argentina's double-digit
inflation rate on Fernandez's and Vanoli's unorthodox policies.
The central bank chief denies any wrongdoing in the selling
of dollars and said in a statement on Wednesday he would
cooperate with investigators.
""The accusation from certain sectors of the opposition about
the sale of dollars in the futures market is without merit and
motivated purely by electoral politics,"" the statement said.
A Macri spokesman could not be immediately reached.
With Argentina's official exchange rate of 9.6 to
the U.S. dollar 61 percent stronger than the black market rate,
the pace of the peso's devaluation next year is a hot point of
contention in the presidential campaign.
Macri would unify Argentina's exchange rates at a stronger
level than the current official rate. Scioli and Vanoli say such
a sharp devaluation would erode salaries and spur inflation.

"HILTON HEAD, S.C.Republican presidential rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio exchanged blows over illegal immigration on Thursday in what could mark the start of a protracted battle between two candidates who have been on the rise.
Many Republican strategists believe that while Donald Trump and Ben Carson are the current front-runners in the race for the Republican nomination, the battle could end up being between Cruz and Rubio, who are getting a close look from voters because of strong debate performances.
That is why it was notable that Cruz, speaking to conservative radio talk show host Laura Ingraham, cited Rubio's 2013 attempt to gain passage in Congress of comprehensive immigration reform.
The reform proposal was criticized by conservatives but promoted by Rubio and seven other Senators from both parties who were known as ""the gang of Gang of Eight."" The plan would have included a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants who met all the requirements.
The effort collapsed amid partisan acrimony, and illegal immigration is one of the biggest flashpoints in the fight to win the Republican nomination for the presidential election in November 2016. 
Cruz, a Texas senator, said that he had sought to add amendments to the 2013 legislation as part of ""a concerted strategy to beat the Gang of Eight amnesty bill.""
Rubio, he said, ""opposed every single one of them. Every single amendment,"" Cruz said. ""The Gang of Eight voted as a gang against enforcing and securing the border."" 
Rubio was pressed by reporters on the issue in Hilton Head after participating in a presidential forum sponsored by the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce.
""Ted is a supporter of legalizing people that are in this country illegally,” he said. ""In fact, when the Senate bill was proposed, he proposed giving them work permits.""
Rubio said ""every single person"" on the Republican debate stage where the issue was debated among eight candidates in Milwaukee on Tuesday ""has supported the legalization of people who are not here legally.""
Rubio, a Florida senator, told the South Carolina forum that any reform effort must include at the outset ensuring that the U.S. border with Mexico is sealed off from illegal immigrants because only then would Americans have confidence to move forward with granting a legal status to as many as 11 million people.

"WASHINGTONPresident Barack Obama said on Thursday Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's plan for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants is unrealistic.
""The notion that we're gonna deport 11, 12 million people from this country - first of all, I have no idea where Mr. Trump thinks the money’s gonna come from. It would cost us hundreds of billions of dollars to execute that,” Obama said in a White House interview with ABC News, according to excerpts released by the network.
""Imagine the images on the screen flashed around the world as we were dragging parents away from their children, and putting them in what, detention centers, and then systematically sending them out,"" the president said. “Nobody thinks that is realistic. But more importantly, that’s not who we are as Americans.""
Trump, a real estate billionaire who has been leading in opinion polls among candidates for the Republican nomination in the 2016 election, calls for deporting all illegal immigrants and has said he would get the Mexican government to pay for building a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border.
The immigration issue has driven a wedge between Hispanics, a voting bloc with increasing clout, and Republicans, many of whom take a hard line on illegal immigration, to the benefit of Obama's fellow Democrats. Most of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants are Hispanic.
Obama said there has always been a streak of anti-immigrant sentiment in the United States. ""We don’t want, I think, a president or any person in a position of leadership to play on those kinds of fears,"" he told ABC.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Thursday the Mexican government would not build or pay for Trump's proposed wall, CNN said.
The network said when Kerry was asked about the proposal in an interview on CNN's Farid Zakaria GPS program, he replied: ""I knew you were trying to drag me right into the middle of the presidential politics ... I think it’s a foregone conclusion that Mexico is not going to build that wall.""

"Students held demonstrations on university campuses across the United States on Thursday to protest ballooning student loan debt for higher education and rally for tuition-free public colleges.
The demonstrations, dubbed the Million Student March, were planned just two days after thousands of fast-food workers took to the streets in a nationwide day of action pushing for a $15-an-hour minimum wage and union rights for the industry.
About 50 students from Boston-area colleges gathered at Northeastern University carrying signs that read ""Degrees not receipts"" and ""Is this a school or a corporation?""
""The student debt crisis is awful. Change starts when people demand it in the street. Not in the White House,"" said Elan Axelbank, 20, a third year student at Northeastern, who said he was a co-founder of the national action.
Photos and videos posted on Twitter, where #MillionStudentMarch was trending worldwide, showed marches involving dozens to hundreds of demonstrators at schools including Texas State, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and Depaul University in Chicago.
A few hundred students rallied on the campus of the historically progressive University of California Berkeley, and posted placards on the outside of a class building showing their individual student debt loads, ranging from just several thousand dollars to more than $100,000.
Organizers are demanding tuition-free public colleges, cancellation of all student debt and a $15-an-hour minimum wage for campus workers.
The total volume of outstanding U.S. student loan debt has more than doubled to $1.2 trillion, according to the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, compared with less than $600 billion in 2006.
Saddled with debt that can sometimes run into hundreds of thousands of dollars, many college graduates struggle to make payments amid an ailing economy and job market.
Dealing with swiftly mounting student loan debt has been a focus of candidates vying for the White House in 2016.
Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders, who has vowed to make tuition free at public universities and colleges, and has pledged to cut interest rates for student loans, tweeted in support of the movement on Thursday afternoon.
His rival Hillary Clinton has said she would increase access to tuition grants, let graduates refinance loans at lower interest rates, and streamline income-based repayment plans.
Florida U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, the most prominent Republican candidate to lay out a concrete proposal, says he would establish an income-based repayment system for federal student loans and would simplify applications for federal aid.
Demonstrators on Thursday also widened their message to echo protests at the University of Missouri, three days after the school's former president resigned amid student anger over failure to address racial discrimination on campus.

 which sells PCs and printers, authorized a dividend of 12.4 cents.
Both dividends are payable Jan. 6, 2016, to shareholders of record on Dec. 9.
The decision to split the former Hewlett-Packard arose from the company’s struggles through much of the past decade with declining revenue, corporate scandals and management changes.
Most attention ahead of the split, which occurred earlier this month, has been focused on Hewlett Packard Enterprise, the corporate-computing company led by  Meg Whitman.
The company aims to build faster-growing lines of business such as next-generation data-center products and security services. The new Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that the majority of corporate spending will continue to go toward systems made for corporate data centers.
HP Inc. aims on returning cash to shareholders while expanding into new markets such as 3-D printing.

"Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz said the November 2016 general election will turn on the question of amnesty for undocumentedÂ immigrants in November, and described himself asÂ the lone candidate ableÂ to unite various factions of conservative Republicans.
AtÂ a press conference after officially registering for the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Cruz said that âmillionsâ of Republicans will stay home in November if they believe the GOP nominee is soft on immigration, particularly working-class voters who he says would see amnesty for undocumented immigrantsÂ as a threat to their ability to find well-paying work.
âThere is a real socioeconomic divide,â Mr. Cruz said. He contrasted himself with âelites in Washingtonâ who look to illegal immigrants as a pool of cheap labor, driving down labor prices in the process.
Running with a hard line on immigrationÂ will also help to attract Reagan Democrats who would support presumed Democratic Hillary Clinton, Mr. Cruz said.
âI will stand with the working men and women and thatâs how I think we will win the general election.. we run a populist campaign,â Mr. Cruz said. âWe run that against the bipartisan corruption of Washington that Hillary Clinton embodies.â
The Texas senator deridedÂ hisÂ Republican rivals asÂ âcampaign conservatives,â arguing only he reflects the positions of the party’sÂ hard right on all issues.
âI am the only candidate running who has been a consistent conservative, who has been a fiscal conservative, a social conservative, a national security conservative,â Mr. Cruz said.
Mr. Cruz didnât name those “campaign conservatives” there, but on Laura Ingraham’s radio show on Thursday, Mr. Cruz criticizedÂ Mr. Rubio’s past support for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and for not backing Senate amendments to the legislation that would have boosted enforcement actions.
Mr. Rubio co-sponsored a bipartisan 2013 immigration overhaul bill that would have strengthened border security while also granting an eventual path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants. The measure passed in the Senate but the Republican-led House never held a vote.
“He opposed every single one of them. Every single amendment,” Mr. Cruz said about Mr. Rubio .”My reaction in all of politics is, âtalk is cheap,â that you know where someone is based on their actions.”
South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham registered for the New Hampshire primary earlierÂ Thursday, and former Sen. Rick Santorum was also slated to do the same. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is set toÂ registerÂ on Friday.
New Hampshire holds its first in the nation primary election onÂ Feb. 9Â next year.

"The union representing postal workers is announcing its endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders for presidentÂ on Thursday, giving the underdog candidate a much-needed boost in his effort to topple Hillary Clinton, who remains far ahead in the race for union support.
Mr. Sandersâs views and record typically line up more closely with unionsâ priorities, and the American Postal Workers Union said his years of work on their causes won members over.
âPolitics as usual has not worked. Itâs time for a political revolution,â union president Mark Dimondstein said in a statement, echoing Mr. Sandersâs battle cry.
His statement appeared to dismiss concerns from some that Mr. Sanders has been a political independent for decades, not a Democrat. The union was unmoved by Mrs. Clintonâs recent opposition to the Trans Pacific Partnership, an Asian free trade agreement that unions have fought and that Mr. Sanders has long opposed.
âWe should judge candidates not by their political party, not by what they say, not by what we think they stand for, but by what they do,â Mr. Dimondstein said.
He also noted Mr. Sandersâs long-time efforts to fight privatization of the U.S. Postal Service, and to keepÂ post offices and mail facilities open amid budget cuts.
While union membership nationally has declined, the labor movement plays an important role in elections because of its ability to turn out like-minded voters to the polls.
Mrs. Clinton still has far more labor support than her rival, owing to her longtime ties with union leaders, generally liberal positions, and a belief among many that she is the most electable Democrat running. So far, she has won endorsements of 12 national unions, including a few of the largest in the nation such as the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the American Federation of Teachers, each of which have 1.6 million members.
By contrast, the postal workers union has about 200,000 members. Mr. Sanders also has support of one other major national union, the National Nurses United, with nearly 185,000 members.
Mr. Sanders, a Vermont senator, had courted labor in general and the postal workers in particular, speaking to some 2,000 members at the unionâs October conference in Las Vegas. In its announcement, the unionâs national executive board said it was encouraging members to participate in Sandersâs rallies and join Labor for Bernie, a grassroots group of supporters from unions, including some who have endorsed Mrs. Clinton and others that remain neutral.

"Wading into the publicÂ debate over interactions between campaigns and super PACs:Â Charlie Spies, the attorney for the Right to Rise super PAC backing Republican presidential candidateÂ Jeb Bush.
Attorneys for two Democratic super PACs aimed at electing congressional majorities have asked the Federal Election Commission for an advisory opinion that would clarify theÂ increasingly blurry lines between campaigns and super PACs.Â Mr. Spies suggests in his commentsÂ to the FECÂ that the attorneys are really acting on behalf of Democratic frontrunnerÂ Hillary Clinton.
Though Mr. Spies says he is intervening as an individual, not on behalf of any client, his comments certainly apply to Mr. Bush, who headlined dozens of super PAC fundraisers before he officially announced his candidacy in June. Campaign-finance watchdog groups have filed complaints that say by raising money, traveling the country and giving speeches, Mr. Bush was essentially campaigning for months before he became subject to campaign finance regulations.
Mr. Bush continued to appear at Right to Rise fundraisers after he became a candidate as a âspecial guest.â The events are frequently scheduled immediately after campaign receptions in nearby homes or even in the same hotel to accommodate Mr. Bushâs hectic schedule.
Mr. Spies rejected the idea that the FEC has jurisdiction over private individuals who are not official candidates, suggesting that would infringe on free speech and citing the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court in 2010 that helped pave the way for the unlimited flow of money to super PACs.
The attorneys add that any regulation over non-candidates âruns the risk of unintended consequencesâ — such as affecting the activities of Mrs. Clinton, before she became a candidate, on behalf of her familyâs global charity.
âWe simply cannot have our clients ceding strategic advantage to individuals who have access to a global network or foreign money that can be used to fund the exploratory stages of a prospective candidate’s run for office,â Mr. Spies wrote.

"“Ben Carson just spent a week passing through an intense crucible over his biographical credibility. After Tuesday evening’s good performance, I’d say Ben Carson isn’t going to fade,” writes our columnist Daniel Henninger. Other contenders aren’t fading either, which leads Mr. Henninger to conclude that none of the GOP candidates “looks likely to pull away and capture the majority of primary delegates before the party’s nominating convention in Cleveland next July.”

“We’ve been wondering all week what happened to the grown-ups on American university campuses, and it appears we have a sighting,” writes the editorial board. Purdue President  Mitch Daniels wrote to students and faculty to remind them of Purdue’s determination to be “a welcoming, inclusive and discrimination-free community, where each person is respected and treated with dignity” and also “to be steadfast in preserving academic freedom and individual liberty. What a proud contrast to the environments that appear to prevail at places like Missouri and Yale.”
Don’t believe bipartisan claims that lawmakers have reformed Social Security’s disability insurance program, where beneficiaries and costs are surging. Andy Koenig points out that the recently enacted budget deal will save just $4.4 billion of the program’s $340 billion projected shortfall over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. “To cover up those structural problems, the budget deal transfers $117 billion from the Social Security Old Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund,” says Mr. Koenig, who calls it “a new twist on the government tradition of robbing Peter to pay Paul.”
After receiving endorsements from teachers unions, Hillary Clinton has abandoned her support for charter schools. “Mrs. Clinton’s charter reversal suggests her Education Department would be a wholly owned union subsidiary. The losers will be the poor parents and children who Democrats claim to represent,” says an editorial.
Helmut Schmidt, a three-pack-a-day smoker who served as Chancellor of West Germany from 1974 to 1982, died this week at the age of 96. Josef Joffe recounts how he defeated terrorists without sacrificing individual liberty and stared down the Soviet Union by promoting the deployment of U.S. missiles in his country.
Karl Rove says the “biggest loser” of Tuesday night’s debate was Donald Trump. “After arguing for months that illegal immigration pushes down Americans’ wages, Mr. Trump said he opposes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Wages, he said, are already ‘too high,’ which hurts U.S. competitiveness, adding that Americans would ‘have to work really hard’ for bigger paychecks.” Mr. Rove adds that Mr. Trump’s “worst moment” came when he attacked the Pacific trade deal, “saying that Chinese currency manipulation is ‘not even discussed in the almost 6,000-page agreement.’ Mr. Paul did the takedown: ‘We might want to point out, China is not part of this deal.’ Laughter from the crowd.”
The unelected California Air Resources Board has issued a new mandate to reduce the “carbon intensity” of transportation fuels. Using more biofuels is one way to get around it, but Jacob Borden points out that “changing California’s gasoline is increasingly difficult. A federal mandate to blend renewable fuels has already pushed the ethanol content in most gasoline to the 10% limit tolerated by existing engine designs.”
It’s also increasingly difficult to get Americans to participate in a public-opinion survey. Michael Barone explains how changes in American habits and technology are making political polls less reliable.",,"Plus, Hillary abandons charter-school kids, and a bipartisan fraud on Social Security reform.",Carson's Not Going Away,http://www.wsj.com/articles/carsons-not-going-away-1447331108,"[u'budget/taxation', u'trade']","[u'Karl Rove', u'Mitch Daniels', u'Hillary Clinton', u'Michael Barone', u'Donald Trump', u'Daniel Henninger', u'Ben Carson']",wsj,0.9205759491888176,"[{u'author_id': 3011, u'fullname': u'james freeman', u'primary_org': u'wsj'}]",2015-11-12 12:50:00,"[u'Congressional Budget Office', u'Social Security', u'Education Department', u'GOP', u'Yale']",33ce3dc932983c0e566b04a314f0357f,2015-11-12 19:54:26.030409
"EXETER, N.H.—Ohio Gov. John Kasich, playing the sensible establishment candidate in a race that has favored conservative outsiders, on Thursday defended his stances on bank bailouts and a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants.
“The idea that we are going to ship 11 million people out of this country and go into neighborhoods and round them up is simply not practical,” Mr. Kasich said after speaking to senior citizens here Thursday afternoon. “I just think the practical solution is that if they haven’t violated the law, they have a path to legalization.”
Mr. Kasich has sought to contrast his views on immigration with those of hardliners such as Donald Trump and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, highlighted most recently in Tuesday’s Wall Street Journal/Fox Business debate. Mr. Kasich and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush are the only Republicans running who currently support some route to legal status for undocumented immigrants.
Mr. Trump has pledged to round up millions of illegal immigrants and deport them. Also Thursday, Mr. Cruz said that “millions” of Republicans will stay home in November if they believe the GOP nominee is soft on immigration.
On Tuesday, Mr. Kasich sparred with Mr. Cruz during the debate over what should have been done about financial institutions that neared collapse in 2008. The Ohio governor Thursday stood by his view that the Obama administration’s bailout was necessary to protect people of modest means.
“They are the folks who have to be looked out for,” Mr. Kasich said of depositors. “I’m not for bailing out the investors in the banks.”
Mr. Kasich’s strategy has yet to pay off. He was on the bubble for being included in Tuesday’s Republican primetime debate based on his national poll numbers, and he could be knocked off the main stage by the time of next month’s forum. He has focused his campaigning almost exclusively on New Hampshire, while the polls used so far to determine top-tier candidates haven’t been state specific.
Mr. Kasich said he felt good about his debate performance, and that it helped highlight a growing divide between candidates who have tangible policies to help the American people as opposed to ones that will increase the U.S. deficit, endanger entitlement programs or have “numbers that don’t add up.”
Those policies won’t stand up during a general election fight, Mr. Kasich said.
“I want to make sure we have conservative solutions with a conservative candidate who can actually get things done for our country,” Mr. Kasich said.
Speaking before a crowd of more than 100 seniors Thursday, Mr. Kasich said he stood by his view that Ohio’s minimum wage increase was helpful to the state’s economy and wouldn’t negatively impact small business owners.
He also said that Planned Parenthood should be defunded, a response that several of the seniors loudly booed. The crowd wasn’t of any one party affiliation.

"President Barack Obama took his campaign to win passage of a proposed Pacific trade pact to more than 600,000 eBay Inc. users on Thursday.
Writing to small business owners and retailers who use the online e-commerce platform, Mr. Obama said the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement would help small business owners broadly and Internet vendors in particular.
The agreement “levels the playing field for you and your employees, bringing down trade barriers like high taxes and red tape, while preserving free and open digital data flows between you and your customers in the Asia-Pacific,” Mr. Obama wrote in a message that was sent by email to hundreds of thousands of eBay sellers and posted on a company website.
The outreach effort represents a new front in Mr. Obama’s effort to sell the agreement to policymakers and the public â enlisting small business owners in the effort to ratify one of Mr. Obama’s final priorities. Major business lobbying groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable have backed the trade agreement.
The 12-nation free trade pact was completed earlier this year and will now need to be ratified by Congress. Many Democrats and progressives oppose free trade agreements broadly, saying they cost American jobs and lower environmental and labor standards. Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders both oppose the agreement.
Republicans in Congress have been more supportive of the agreement â though some specific provisions and sections of the TPP have rankled top Republicans.
In making his case to business owners, the president pointed to sections in the trade agreement that would govern data sharing and ensure that the internet remains open.
He also noted the agreement included a chapter on small businesses â and would help reduce regulation and trade barriers for smaller companies trying to do global business.
Those benefits include “eliminating 18,000 taxes that various countries place on Made-in-America products, streamlining standards and technical regulations, strengthening intellectual property rights to fight counterfeiting and theft of your creative work, and more,” Mr. Obama wrote.

HIGHLIGHTS
POPULISM ON THE RISE IN GOP RACE FOR PRESIDENT: The latest presidential debate vividly captured how the 2008 financial crisis has reshaped the Republican Party by unleashing a potent populist strain that could further scramble an already unpredictable primary contest. Candidates vying for the 2016 GOP nomination have grown distinctly more leery of big banks, corporations and international trade deals, and outright hostile toward the Federal Reserve.
Some of these impulses gave rise to the tea-party movement in 2009 and flared in the 2012 GOP primary contest, but they faded with the nomination of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a private-equity executive. The debate in Milwaukee didnât appear to fundamentally alter the state of the race. But with candidates heading off to Iowa and New Hampshire on Wednesday, it showed how their jockeying to carry the populist banner could intensify in the run-up to those statesâ early nominating contests next February. Nick Timiraos reports.
More on 2016: Republican presidential candidates worked to turn debate moments into campaign momentum after a GOP showdown that highlighted policy differences but did little to shuffle the standingsÂ  â¦ Donald Trump and Marco Rubio won Tuesdayâs night primetime Republican debate, according to an overnight poll of Internet users who watched the contest, but Mr. Trump came out as the favorite among Republicans and left the best impression about his ability to serve as presidentÂ â¦ The Trump show may be fading on social media.Â â¦ For those wondering how Mr. Trump will go about deporting millions ofÂ  illegal immigrants if elected president, they got their answer in Tuesday nightâs debate. His plan: follow the model used in the 1950s whereby people living in the U.S. illegally were rounded up and sent back to Mexico en masse.
LAURA MECKLER: POSTAL UNION GIVES BERNIE SANDERS A BOOST
The union representing postal workers endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders for president on Thursday, giving the underdog candidate a much-needed boost in his effort to topple Hillary Clinton, who remains far ahead in the race for union support. Mr. Sandersâs views and record typically line up more closely with unionsâ priorities, and the American Postal Workers Union said his years of work on their causes won members over. âPolitics as usual has not worked. Itâs time for a political revolution,â union president Mark Dimondstein said in a statement, echoing Mr. Sandersâs battle cry. Laura Meckler reports.

WSJ STORIES YOU SHOULDN’T MISS
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES TAKE AIM AT WALL STREET: Democratic presidential candidates are pushing a Wall Street tax that has been debated since Keynes as a way to corral financial markets, a sign of how much the finance industry remains in the cross hairs seven years after the meltdown of Lehman Brothers. With the next Democratic debate set for Saturday in Iowa, the three candidates planning to take partâ Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin OâMalleyâare competing for who can be tougher on Wall Street. Bob Davis reports.
U.S. URGES BODYCAMS FOR LOCAL POLICE, BUT NIXES THEM ON FEDERAL TEAMS: The Justice Department is publicly urging local police departments to adopt body cameras, saying they are an important tool to improve transparency and trust between officers and citizens. But privately, the department is telling some of its agents they cannot work with officers using such cameras as part of joint task forces, according to people familiar with the discussions. The reason: The federal government hasnât yet adopted guidelines on how and when to use body cameras, rules that would be important to determining how any footage could be used in court, released publicly, or stored by law-enforcement agencies. Devlin Barrett reports.
U.S. ARRESTS KIN OF VENEZUELA PRESIDENT ON DRUG CHARGES: U.S. agents have arrested two relatives of Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro on charges they conspired to transport 800 kilograms of cocaine to the U.S., according to two people familiar with the matter.The arrests come amid U.S. accusations that the top echelon of the government in Caracas is involved in the narcotics trade. The two men, EfraÃ­n Antonio Campo Flores and Francisco Flores de Freitas, were first arrested in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Tuesday by local police, turned over to U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents and flown the same day to New York in a DEA jet, these people said. The two were scheduled to go before a federal judge in New York on Thursday, they said. A spokesman for the federal district court declined to comment. JosÃ© de CÃ³rdoba reports.

REPUBLICANS LOOK FOR VOTES TO DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD, REPEAL PARTS OF HEALTH LAW: Republicans are having difficulty unifying around legislation to carry out two top GOP priorities: defunding Planned Parenthood and repealing part of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. GOP lawmakers debated for months about what measures to pass under a special procedure tied to the budget process, known as reconciliation, which enables legislation to pass with just a simple majority. But there is a problem with the combination they settled on: It may go too far for some Republicans and not far enough for others. Kristina Peterson reports.
RUSSIAN PROPOSAL ON SYRIA FAILS TO GAIN TRACTION AT UN: A proposal by Russia for a settlement of the conflict in Syria sparked criticism from Western and Arab officials concerned that it doesnât address President Bashar al-Assadâs fate. The proposal lists eight steps toward ending the conflict: establishing an 18-month constitutional reform period; creating a united delegation from the hodgepodge of opposition groups; identifying terrorist factions; coordinating international military strikes on Islamic State; and holding simultaneous presidential and parliamentary elections. But the proposal doesnât clarify how or when Mr. Assad might step down and leaves open the possibility that he could continue to rule Syria if he were to be re-elected. Farnaz Fassihi and Jay Solomon report.
Plus:Â The Syrian regime and its allies boasted Wednesday about a Russia-backed operation that broke a long-running siege by Islamic State militants on an air base near the northern city of Aleppo… A military operation by Kurdish forces against Islamic State began Thursday morning, according to a Kurdish government announcement, as thousands of fighters converged on the northern Iraqi town of Sinjar and sought to choke off a supply line to the militants.

TODAY’S VIDEO
SEIB VIDEO: WHO WON THE GOP DEBATE?
After a substantive conversation on economic policy during the GOP debate on Tuesday, WSJ’s Jerry Seib discusses which GOP candidates came out on top.
HERE’S A LOOK AT THE DAY AHEAD
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION: President Barack Obama awards the Medal of Honor at a White House ceremony to Capt. Florent âFloâ Groberg for conspicuous gallantry during combat in Asadabad, Afghanistan. In August 2012, Capt. Groberg tackled a man wearing a suicide vest and shoved him away from his patrol before the device detonated. Secretary of State John Kerry talks about the U.S. strategy in Syria at the U.S. Institute of Peace at 2 p.m.
CONGRESS: Both the Senate and the House are out.
ECONOMIC INDICATORS: The Labor Department releases weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m., and its Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for September at 10 a.m. The Treasury Department releases its monthly statement on the federal budget at 2 p.m.
WHAT WE’RE READING AROUND THE WEB
The 2020 Census may be heading toward the same sort of technology mess that bedeviled the 2010 headcount, writes Danny Vinik at Politicoâs The Agenda. âWith the government facing an increasing number of cyberattacks, the 4,300-person Census Bureau is now facing an immense challenge for 2020. The technology available is better, faster and cheaperâbut the bureau has struggled to knit together the governmentâs hodgepodge of information systems while securing them.â
Brian Castner, writing at Motherboard, tells the story of Reese and Yuri Himes, brothers serving in the âForever Warâ in the Middle East, where nearly 51,000 of the veterans have deployed six or more times. Unique to this war, he writes, is “saving a life within a very small world. So small, in fact, that using small world theory, the math tells us that statistically they are not saving the lives of strangers, but of known quantities.â
At the Washington Post, Charles Lane writes about Congress, presidential power and closing the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He asks: If the only way for President Obama to close Guantanamo is to do so unilaterally, can he do that?
The protests at the University of Missouri wonât be the last, writes Libby Nelson at Vox. For the first time in decades, students are forcing college and university administrations to address racism on campus, she says.
Robert Litan, writing in WSJâs Think Tank, says candidatesâ answers on whether they would bail out Bank of America  in another financial crisis are disconcerting. âTheir answers suggest that either the candidates have not absorbed much information about this issueâor that the people briefing them donât understand it,â he writes.
MILESTONE
569
The number of kilograms of carbon dioxide emitted in producing, transporting, refining and burning a barrel of Canadaâs oil-sands crude, 81 kilograms more than an average barrel of U.S. crude. The U.S. could have coupled approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline with a plan to offset that difference, writes Greg Ip in his Capital Account column.
