{"body": "\u201cBen Carson just spent a week passing through an intense crucible over his biographical credibility. After Tuesday evening\u2019s good performance, I\u2019d say Ben Carson isn\u2019t going to fade,\u201d writes our columnist Daniel Henninger. Other contenders aren\u2019t fading either, which leads Mr. Henninger to conclude that none of the GOP candidates \u201clooks likely to pull away and capture the majority of primary delegates before the party\u2019s nominating convention in Cleveland next July.\u201d\nClick here to receive WSJ Opinion headlines and commentary via email.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been wondering all week what happened to the grown-ups on American university campuses, and it appears we have a sighting,\u201d writes the editorial board. Purdue President  Mitch Daniels wrote to students and faculty to remind them of Purdue\u2019s determination to be \u201ca welcoming, inclusive and discrimination-free community, where each person is respected and treated with dignity\u201d and also \u201cto be steadfast in preserving academic freedom and individual liberty. What a proud contrast to the environments that appear to prevail at places like Missouri and Yale.\u201d\nDon\u2019t believe bipartisan claims that lawmakers have reformed Social Security\u2019s disability insurance program, where beneficiaries and costs are surging. Andy Koenig points out that the recently enacted budget deal will save just $4.4 billion of the program\u2019s $340 billion projected shortfall over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. \u201cTo cover up those structural problems, the budget deal transfers $117 billion from the Social Security Old Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund,\u201d says Mr. Koenig, who calls it \u201ca new twist on the government tradition of robbing Peter to pay Paul.\u201d\nAfter receiving endorsements from teachers unions, Hillary Clinton has abandoned her support for charter schools. \u201cMrs. Clinton\u2019s charter reversal suggests her Education Department would be a wholly owned union subsidiary. The losers will be the poor parents and children who Democrats claim to represent,\u201d says an editorial.\nHelmut Schmidt, a three-pack-a-day smoker who served as Chancellor of West Germany from 1974 to 1982, died this week at the age of 96. Josef Joffe recounts how he defeated terrorists without sacrificing individual liberty and stared down the Soviet Union by promoting the deployment of U.S. missiles in his country.\nKarl Rove says the \u201cbiggest loser\u201d of Tuesday night\u2019s debate was Donald Trump. \u201cAfter arguing for months that illegal immigration pushes down Americans\u2019 wages, Mr. Trump said he opposes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Wages, he said, are already \u2018too high,\u2019 which hurts U.S. competitiveness, adding that Americans would \u2018have to work really hard\u2019 for bigger paychecks.\u201d Mr. Rove adds that Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cworst moment\u201d came when he attacked the Pacific trade deal, \u201csaying that Chinese currency manipulation is \u2018not even discussed in the almost 6,000-page agreement.\u2019 Mr. Paul did the takedown: \u2018We might want to point out, China is not part of this deal.\u2019 Laughter from the crowd.\u201d\nThe unelected California Air Resources Board has issued a new mandate to reduce the \u201ccarbon intensity\u201d of transportation fuels. Using more biofuels is one way to get around it, but Jacob Borden points out that \u201cchanging California\u2019s gasoline is increasingly difficult. A federal mandate to blend renewable fuels has already pushed the ethanol content in most gasoline to the 10% limit tolerated by existing engine designs.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also increasingly difficult to get Americans to participate in a public-opinion survey.
