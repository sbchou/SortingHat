That was on minimum wage and it was how we're going to compete with other countries,\" Trump told \"Fox and Friends\" in a telephone interview. \"They were talking about increasing the minimum wage. And whether it's taxes or minimum wages, if they\u2019re too high, we\u2019re not going to be able to compete with other countries.\"\nStory Continued Below\nDuring the debate, Trump also said that he would not raise the minimum wage.\n\"But, taxes too high, wages too high, we're not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is,\" he told debate moderator Neil Cavuto when asked if he would raise wages. \"People have to go out, they have to work really hard and have to get into that upper stratum. But we cannot do this if we are going to compete with the rest of the world. We just can't do it.\"\nTaxes are \"so high in this country,\" the Republican candidate went on to say Thursday, touting his tax plan \"that is going to lower them greatly.\"\n\"That\u2019s what I\u2019m referring to, and anybody should be able to see that. It was very clear,\" he added, going on to reference an on-screen chyron that read \"TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN.\" \n\"And interestingly, this is the first time I\u2019ve even heard, you put a headline about 'Trump doubles down,'\" he told the hosts. \"It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve even heard about it. I just called in and I\u2019m hearing about it now for the first time, so obviously it can\u2019t be much of a story.\"\nThe explanation is \"pretty simple,\" he added, noting that he is \"talking about the fact that we have to keep competitive both in wages and you know the cost, and we also have to be competitive in taxes, because our taxes are so high that we can\u2019t compete with other countries.\"\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Trump defends minimum wage comments", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/donald-trump-minimum-wage-215787", "topics": ["guns", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Joe Pompeo", "Kenneth P.
