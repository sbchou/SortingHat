The former secretary of state met with Turner in October before her appearance at the Women's Leadership Forum. While she never formally endorsed Clinton, Turner was also involved in the Ready for Hillary super PAC, appeared at a Clinton organizing event, and served on the pro-Clinton super PAC Correct the Record until recently. Former President Bill Clinton was also involved in Turner\u2019s unsuccessful run for Ohio Secretary of State last year.\nStory Continued Below\n\"Yes, I was out there, 'ready' [for Clinton], because I wanted to make sure Democrats were ready,\" Turner said to Cleveland.com. \"I thought it was important to show that Democrats were ready to go right back at it for 2015 and 2016. This has nothing to do with the secretary.\"\n\u201cI'm very attracted by his message and his style and that he has held pretty much strong on his beliefs and the world is catching up with him,\" Turner said about Sanders, who she formally endorsed Thursday. \nOn Monday Turner will introduce Sanders at a rally at Cleveland State University.\n\"Sen. Turner is a star in the Democratic Party. Bernie is very proud to have someone with so much talent and commitment join the grassroots campaign to fix the rigged economy propped up by a corrupt campaign finance system,\" Michael Briggs, Sanders' communication director said in a statement emailed to POLITICO.\nThe Vermont senator's campaign manager Jeff Weaver said the campaign was \"extremely, extremely humbled\" by Turner's support.\n\"She is nationally known as a voice for voting rights, for workers' rights and for marginalized people. The support of someone with that record of standing up for middle-income and working people is tremendously important,\" Weaver said in a statement emailed to POLITICO.\nThe Republican National Committee jumped on the news, sending out the Cleveland.com article Thursday afternoon in an email that started, \u201cGuess somebody\u2019s going on the \u2018enemies list\u2019 \u2026\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Ohio&apos;s Nina Turner jumps from Clinton to Sanders", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/nina-turner-endorses-bernie-sanders-215809", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "trade"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Michael Briggs", "Elena Schneider", "Richard Shelby", "Steven Shepard", "Jeremy Herb", "Jenny Hopkinson", "Kevin Robillard", "Brian Mahoney", "Caitlin Emma", "Bill Clinton", "Nahal Toosi", "Josh Gerstein", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Rich Lowry", "Bryan Bender", "Bernie Becker", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Jeff Weaver", "Neera Tanden", "Noah Weiland", "Alex Isenstadt", "Bernie Sanders", "Donald Trump", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Jeff Greenfield", "Eric Wolff", "David Vitter", "Tim Starks", "Zachary Warmbrodt", "Jason Kander", "Tony Romm", "Nina Turner", "Daniel Strauss", "Hillary Clinton", "Doug Palmer", "Rick Reed", "Brianna Ehley", "Darren Goode", "Darius Tahir", "Ben Carson", "Paul Ryan"], "orgs": ["Congress", "Swift Boat", "Democratic Party", "UFCW", "NAFTA", "Medal of Honor", "U.N.", "Yale University", "Republican National Committee", "Drake University", "AT&T", "GOP", "WTO"], "election_confidence": 0.9723648897892211, "authors": [{"author_id": 30897, "fullname": "darren goode", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-12 23:15:14", "org": "politico", "article_id": "9d0e05b475d794ce73dcd00f02b32c7b", "date_access": "2015-11-12 23:46:26.456787"}
