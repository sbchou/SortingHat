{"body": "After a week of debate over whether Ben Carson really won a scholarship to West Point, Republicans have refocused the question of military service on Hillary Rodham Clinton, expressing doubts about her claim that she tried to join the Marines in the 1970s.\n\nThe matter came up after an event in New Hampshire this week, when Mrs. Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, shared a story with voters about her interest as a young woman in becoming a Marine.\n\n\u201cHe looks at me and he goes, \u2018Um, how old are you?'\u201d Mrs. Clinton recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, I\u2019m 26, I\u2019ll be 27.\u2019 He goes, \u2018Well, that\u2019s kind of old for us.\u2019 He says to me, \u2018Maybe the dogs will take you,\u2019 meaning the Army.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are suggesting that the story is an embellishment, as Mrs. Clinton would have been seeking to join the military in 1975, the year she married Bill Clinton in Fayetteville, Ark.\n\nThe story of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s military aspirations has come up before, as have questions about her honesty\u00a0on the subject. In 1994, The New York Times\u2019s Maureen Dowd noted that joining the military seemed to clash with the future first lady\u2019s persona:\n\nAfter all, Hillary Rodham was an up-and-coming legal star involved with an up-and-coming political star. She had made a celebrated appearance in Life magazine as an anti-establishment commencement speaker at Wellesley College, where, as president of the student government, she had organized teach-ins on her opposition to the Vietnam War.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign did not respond to questions about the circumstances of her application to the Marines.\n\n\u201cG.I. Hillary?\u201d the Republican National Committee wrote in an email that suggested she had a pattern of fudging her biography. \u201cClinton\u2019s claim that she tried to join the Marines doesn\u2019t add up.\u201d\n\nWhile running for president in 2008, Mrs. Clinton faced an uproar after she said that her plane landed under sniper fire during a 1996 trip to Bosnia. In fact, she was greeted by children rather than bullets.\n\nOn Thursday, Senator John McCain, who was the Republican presidential nominee that year, suggested that Mrs. Clinton might have misremembered trying to join the Marines.\n\n\u2014 John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) November 12, 2015\n\n", "byline": "ALAN RAPPEPORT", "description": "After a week of debate over whether Ben Carson really won a scholarship to West Point, Republicans mocked a claim by Hillary Rodham Clinton that she tried to join the Marines in the 1970s.", "title": "First Draft: Republicans Mock Hillary Clinton\u2019s Claim of Trying to Join the Marines", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/12/republicans-mock-hillary-clintons-claim-of-trying-to-join-the-marines/", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["Hillary Rodham", "Bill Clinton", "Hillary Clinton", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Maureen Dowd", "Ben Carson"], "orgs": ["Marines", "Republican National Committee", "Marine", "Army"], "election_confidence": 0.9093769768781514, "authors": [{"author_id": 8381, "fullname": "alan rappeport", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-11-12 20:51:25", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "afe0e2956ee04d9fe1d43dbd5f50aba6", "date_access": "2015-11-12 21:38:09.724903"}
