The schedule virtually guarantees that a significant volume of records about Clinton, who is the leading Democratic candidate for president, will be emerging through the primary and caucus season and into the heart of the general election next fall.\nThe order (posted here) came in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by Vice News reporter Jason Leopold. It originally sought virtually all records the State Department possessed pertaining to Clinton's four-year tenure as secretary.\nThe State Department already agreed to release redacted versions of about 30,000 emails Clinton kept in a private account and returned to her former agency last December at its request. Leopold has now narrowed the request to a variety of topics ranging from WikiLeaks to the Keystone XL pipeline and to emails and other records used by top aides to Clinton.\nMore details on the dispute are here.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "A federal judge issued an order Thursday that will sharply ramp up the volume of documents being release in a lawsuit demanding memos and emails from top aides to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.", "title": "Judge ramps up releases in FOIA suit for Clinton aides&apos; records", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2015/11/judge-ramps-up-releases-in-foia-suit-for-clinton-aides-records-215803", "topics": ["trade", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Elena Schneider", "Richard Shelby", "Steven Shepard", "Jenny Hopkinson", "Kevin Robillard", "Brian Mahoney", "Jeremy Herb", "Nahal Toosi", "Josh Gerstein", "Darius Tahir", "Nick Gass", "Bernie Becker", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Noah Weiland", "Alex Isenstadt", "Bernie Sanders", "Jason Kander", "Jake Sherman", "Darren Goode", "Paul Ryan", "Eric Wolff", "David Vitter", "Tim Starks", "Zachary Warmbrodt", "Brianna Ehley", "Tony Romm", "Daniel Strauss", "Jason Leopold", "Hillary Clinton", "Ben White", "Doug Palmer", "Rick Reed", "Eliza Collins", "Ben Carson", "Rudolph Contreras", "Caitlin Emma"], "orgs": ["Courts , Transparency , & More", "Fed", "State Department", "Congress", "Swift Boat", "Freedom of Information Act", "UFCW", "NAFTA", "Medal of Honor", "U.N.", "Yale University", "Drake University", "AT&T", "GOP", "WTO"], "election_confidence": 0.9824986892406062, "authors": [{"author_id": 30899, "fullname": "zachary warmbrodt", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-12 21:55:43", "org": "politico", "article_id": "f1599f56a2e00895a86c971d3256ae5e", "date_access": "2015-11-12 23:00:06.056148"}
