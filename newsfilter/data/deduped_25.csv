Calm Manner Has Ben Carson Rising in Polls,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/us/politics/calm-manner-has-ben-carson-rising-in-polls.html,nyt,"AMES, Iowa — Donald J. Trump, who is rarely at a loss for words, admitted “I don’t know what’s going on” when confronted by Ben Carson’s surge past him in early-voting Iowa, where Mr. Trump had led the Republican presidential field for months.

Mr. Trump has derided Mr. Carson for lacking the vigor and fortitude to be president, but voters here are drawn to the retired neurosurgeon’s low-pitched manner.

“That smile and his soft voice makes people very comforted,” said Miriam Greenfield, a farmer in Jewell, Iowa.

In an election season that has confounded party leaders and experts, the rise of Mr. Carson is another unexpected twist. His supporters cite Mr. Carson’s character, not his positions, as the main reason they back him. And they say his low-key approach is precisely what would tame Washington’s bitter partisanship, rather than Mr. Trump’s swagger.

“He is kind when he speaks, and he doesn’t have an agenda to set himself up as wonderful,” said Donna Christensen, a retiree in Ames.

What is more, Mr. Carson’s provocative comments on topics like abortion and slavery, which pundits and commentators regularly denounce, seem only to deepen the enthusiasm his evangelical base feels for him. He has connected with Republican women here, who prefer him to Mr. Trump. And he has built momentum far off the radar of the political establishment, which was unimpressed with his debate performances and his lack of governing experience. He conducts personal chats on Facebook and visits medical clinics and churches rather than the usual political stops.

In a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics released on Friday, not only was Mr. Carson the top choice among Republicans, with 28 percent, but he was also described by those surveyed as the most presidential candidate, the most pragmatic and the one they would trust most with a finger on the nuclear button.

And unlike some other candidates popular with the party’s evangelical base, Mr. Carson has built a muscular financial base through grass-roots outreach. His $20.8 million raised over the summer, most in small donations, was more than the total of any other Republican candidate. On Friday, he released his first television ad in the four early nominating states.

On Facebook, Mr. Carson answers nightly questions for his 4.3 million “friends,” covering personal topics (his ailing mother is “doing much better”), policies like a recent suggestion he would end Medicare (he denied it), and the campaign (the debates are “just a boxing match”).

Book sales are another below-the-radar means of cultivating support. He is on a 26-day book tour, notably wending through Iowa, Florida and South Carolina, that critics derided as a campaign vacation. But Mr. Carson attracts buyers by the hundreds, who exchange a few words with him as they stop for a signature.

Jason Walke, a trial lawyer in Des Moines, said that neither Mr. Trump nor another fiery outsider, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, “has a snowball’s chance of changing things in Washington the way Ben Carson does.”

“I believe someone as mild-mannered and gentlemanly as Ben Carson is just about the only kind of person that could,” said Mr. Walke, who heard Mr. Carson speak to a modest crowd on the lawn of a fraternity house at Iowa State University on Saturday.

Similar views surfaced in a focus group of Republicans last week in Indiana: Many criticized Mr. Trump as divisive while praising Mr. Carson as “wise” and a “gentleman.”

“Trump is rough; Carson is reassuring,” said Peter D. Hart, who led the focus group. “And the unknown elements of Carson are calming, and the known elements of Trump are disturbing.”

Mr. Carson’s events have a distinct feel. Voters approach him with something close to reverence, and he appears gracious and unhurried when interacting with them one on one. On Saturday, his wife, Candy, a Yale-trained classical violinist, sang an a cappella version of the national anthem on the lawn of the fraternity house.

Mr. Carson swept past Mr. Trump in two polls of Iowa Republicans last week despite rarely visiting the state. Now, he is promising to return at least twice monthly leading up to the Feb. 1 caucuses. “The key thing for me is I don’t sit down and strategize like politicians because I’m not a politician,” he told reporters. “I don’t want to be a politician. I think we need some authenticity. We need some honesty in our country right now.”

Statements he has made on the unsuitability of a Muslim to be president and the link between Nazis, gun control and the Holocaust, and his likening of President Obama’s health care law to slavery, which appalled some critics, have not dimmed Mr. Carson’s support. On the contrary, 57 percent of Republicans in the Register poll rated as “very attractive” his comparison of the health care law to slavery. Seventy-three percent said his opposition to a Muslim as president made him more attractive.

On Sunday, he again invoked slavery, this time comparing it to abortion as he called for a ban on the procedure even in cases of rape and incest.

Mr. Carson’s rise in Iowa is driven by his consolidation of evangelical voters, who represent close to 60 percent of Republican caucus-goers, a trend that could carry him strongly into later voting states in the South with similar demographics.

“People are very attracted to Ben Carson’s bedside demeanor,” said Bob Vander Plaats, a leader of the Christian right in Iowa.

Traditionally, a single anti-establishment candidate has emerged from the state, finishing in the top two or three, around whom conservative Republicans rally. Mr. Carson, Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz are all vying for the role.

In two surveys last week, Mr. Carson led Mr. Trump soundly by eight and nine percentage points. A third survey by CBS News released Sunday showed the two tied in the state, but Mr. Trump held a robust lead in two other early voting states, New Hampshire and South Carolina.

“I don’t understand Iowa because frankly, I just left and we had tremendous crowds and tremendous enthusiasm,” Mr. Trump told CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “Frankly, even to be tied, I’m a little surprised.”

Mr. Trump appeals to a somewhat different demographic from Mr. Carson’s: working-class voters with high school educations, for whom social issues and religious beliefs are less important. The rally he described, which drew thousands, was in the Democratic-leaning eastern side of the state, where he has done most of his campaigning.

Many of those drawn to Mr. Carson and Mr. Trump have not participated in Iowa’s caucus system before, making them more difficult to organize. The two are undertaking among the most aggressive efforts by any of the 15 Republicans running to encourage caucus participation.

Much of Mr. Carson’s organizing is done by a “super PAC,” which stationed volunteers at the Books-A-Million store in Ames, where he appeared Saturday. They buttonholed customers, collecting email addresses and phone numbers. The super PAC, known as the 2016 Committee, began training supporters about how to caucus recently.

“People that are following Ben, a lot of them support him but have never caucused and they need to know what to do,” said Rita Davenport, a county chairwoman for the super PAC working the bookstore crowd.

“We have the resources to go into each community and do these types of things,” she said. “The campaign would be stretched far too thin to even think about going to each of these small towns and doing caucus training.”

Darren Westercamp, who emerged from the store with a signed Carson book, said he became curious about the candidate when he visited his father, a retired farmer, and noticed a Carson sticker on his vehicle.

“I grew up in a family that did not have stickers on their vehicles,” he said. “When I saw that, I said I need to listen to this man.”",0.98258226708541829
AP-GfK Poll: Republicans view Donald Trump as most electable,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/AQM7KdYdMyE/,fox,"mboxCreate('FoxNews-Politics-Autoplay-Videos-In-Articles');

WASHINGTON –  Republican voters view Donald Trump as their strongest general election candidate, according to an Associated Press-GfK poll that highlights the sharp contrast between the party's voters and its top professionals regarding the billionaire businessman's ultimate political strength.

Seven in 10 Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters say Trump could win in November 2016 if he is nominated, and that's the most who say so of any candidate. By comparison, 6 in 10 say the same for retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who, like Trump, has tapped into the powerful wave of antiestablishment anger defining the early phases of the 2016 contest.

""It's the lifelong establishment politicians on both sides that rub me the wrong way,"" said registered Republican Joe Selig, a 60-year-old carpenter from Vallejo, California. ""I think Trump is more electable. He's strong. We need strength these days.""

Trump and Carson are considered among the least electable general election candidates by the Republican Party's professionals, those who are in the business of helping candidates run campaigns and win elections.

Experienced political strategists note that winning a general election and winning the Republican nomination are often very different tasks. The GOP's most conservative voters — a group that is older and whiter than the nation as a whole — wield extraordinary influence in picking the nominee. Independents, moderate voters and minorities are far more important in general elections that draw many more people to the polls.

While Trump and Carson are popular in primary election polls, both have used divisive rhetoric in recent months that alienated some minorities. Trump called Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals during his announcement speech; while Carson said he would not support a Muslim presidential candidate.

""Republicans think (Democrat) Hillary (Rodham Clinton) is weaker than she is. They are wrong,"" said GOP operative Katie Packer, who was deputy campaign manager for 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney. ""They think we don't need to win more women or more Hispanics to win. They're wrong.""

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who has embraced a welcoming tone with Hispanics, tops the field of experienced political leaders on the question of electability, running about even with Carson and slightly behind Trump.

Six in 10 Republicans say Bush could win the general election and 54 percent say the same about Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. There's a drop-off among the rest of the GOP's 2016 crowded class. None of the other candidates is viewed as electable in a general election by more than half of Republican voters.

Carson and Trump are the candidates most likely to receive positive ratings from Republican voters, with 65 percent saying they have a favorable opinion of Carson and 58 percent saying the same of Trump. Republicans are somewhat less excited about Bush, with 48 percent giving him a favorable rating.

""If he weren't a Bush, I wouldn't even know his name,"" said Republican Leslie Millican, a 34-year-old housewife from Magnolia, Arkansas. ""I like the other Bushes. Something about (Jeb Bush) — he ain't grown on me yet.""

Trump and Bush have the highest negative ratings within their own party: 37 percent of Republican voters say they have an unfavorable opinion of Bush and 36 percent say the same of Trump.

Their negatives are even more pronounced among the broader electorate. The AP-GfK poll found Trump is viewed unfavorably by 57 percent of those surveyed, the highest negatives of any Republican candidate. Bush is next with unfavorable ratings from 48 percent of all respondents.

Overall, all but one GOP candidate is viewed more unfavorably than favorably by all those questioned. Carson is the exception, drawing about equally positive and negative views. He remains unknown by a significant portion of the electorate.

Among Republican voters, all the candidates except New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie have a net positive rating. Carson tops the list, followed by Rubio, former technology executive Carly Fiorina and then Trump.

The poll also found a sharp difference between the political parties over experience.

By an overwhelming 77 percent to 22 percent margin, Republican registered voters and leaners say they prefer an outsider candidate who will change how things are done, rather than someone with experience in Washington who can get things done. They prefer someone with private sector leadership experience over experience holding elected office, 76 percent to 22 percent.

Trump, Carson and Fiorina are the only Republican candidates who have never held elective office. Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, is a former first lady, secretary of state and senator.

Perhaps that helps explain why Democrats prefer experience over outsider status, 67 percent to 32 percent, and experience in office over private sector experience 66 percent to 33 percent.

Republican strategist John Feehery says Trump is considered electable now only because he hasn't yet been the subject of a multimillion dollar negative ad campaign, which will happen should he maintain his lead in the polls.

""Right now, he serves a valuable purpose as a front-runner, especially for the Democrats,"" Feehery said. ""They would love him to be our nominee.""",0.99991078237661668
Biden opted out on 2016  Dem race because he 'couldn't win',http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-10-25-US--DEM%202016-Biden/id-71f86fb6abca46bf96b3f2d0d4ffb184,ap,"(AP) â Vice President Joe Biden says he decided against running for president because he ""couldn't win,"" not because he would have had too little time to get a campaign up and running.

""I'll be very blunt. If I thought we could've put together the campaign ... that our supporters deserve and our contributors deserved, ... I would have done it,"" he said in an interview aired Sunday on CBS's ""60 Minutes.""

In the wide-ranging interview, in which Biden took questions for a time joined by his wife, Jill, the vice president also said he would not have gotten into the race just to stop Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton.

""I've said from the beginning, 'Look, I like Hillary. Hillary and I get along together,"" he said. ""The only reason to run is because ... I still think I could do a better job than anybody else could do.""

He used the interview to play down suggestions his announcement not to run, made at the White House Wednesday with President Barack Obama standing at his side, included a jab at Clinton.

At the White House event, Biden lamented partisan bickering in Washington politics and said, ""I don't think we should look at Republicans as our enemies."" Clinton had made a statement to that effect during the Democratic presidential debate earlier this month.

""That wasn't directed at Hillary,"" Biden told ""60 Minutes.""

""That was a reference to Washington, all of Washington,"" he said.

The 72-year-old Biden also sought in the interview to dispel recurrent rumors that his late son Beau, who died earlier this year at age 46 of brain cancer, had made a last-minute plea to his father to run for president.

Biden said there was no such ""Hollywood moment ... Nothing like that ever, ever happened,"" he said. ""Beau all along thought that I should run and I could win.""

""But there was not what was sort of made out as kind of this Hollywood-esque thing that, at the last minute, Beau grabbed my hand and said, 'Dad, you've got to run,' like win one for the Gipper,"" Biden said.

The vice president did say he wants to continue to have a voice in party affairs and will speak up whenever he wishes. He has not endorsed a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.

""I will make no bones about that,"" he said. ""I don't want the party walking away from what Barack and I did.""

"In face of criticism, S.F. supervisor reaffirms city's sanctuary policies",http://www.latimes.com/la-me-sf-sanctuary-20151026-story.html,latimes,"In an emotional hearing here, Supervisor Malia Cohen took an unapologetic stand on behalf of her city's sanctuary policies, giving the brush-off to conservative Republicans and commentators nationwide who placed San Francisco in their crosshairs in the months since an undocumented immigrant was charged in the shooting death of a woman.

""We cannot allow one event to dictate 25 years ... of our city's policies toward undocumented immigrants,"" Supervisor Malia Cohen said Tuesday to wild applause from a roomful of immigrants, two of them undocumented women who had earlier recounted to a board committee their years of suffering as victims of domestic violence, afraid to turn to police for fear of deportation.

""More importantly,"" Cohen continued, we ""cannot allow hateful conservative news stations to dictate how we respond to incidents in our city. I'm not afraid of Fox News, and they don't influence how I make my policy decisions.""

Soon after, all 11 supervisors voted to pass a resolution affirming that San Francisco, which first declared itself a ""City of Refuge"" in 1989, shall remain so.

San Francisco's sanctuary policies have drawn harsh criticism since Kate Steinle, 32, was shot and killed on a tourist-friendly waterfront walkway here last summer.

Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, now charged with her murder, is a five-time deportee who had been brought here in March from a federal prison in Southern California on a 2-decade-old marijuana-related bench warrant. But prosecutors declined to charge him, and the Sheriff's Department released him without honoring a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that he be detained beyond his release date so he could be picked up and placed yet again in deportation proceedings.

The supervisors' resolution rejected cooperation with ICE's new Priority Enforcement Program, which largely moves away from the so-called detainer requests and instead asks local authorities to simply notify ICE before a release occurs. Supervisors allowed an exception to the rule if an inmate has been convicted of a violent felony in the last seven years and is being held to answer by a magistrate on a comparable charge.

San Francisco's vote came just hours after the failure of a bill in Washington by U.S. Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) to cut federal funding to municipalities that don't cooperate fully with immigration authorities. The legislation included a provision, known as Kate's Law, that would have increased criminal sentences for immigrants who repeatedly enter the U.S. illegally.

GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump lashed out at San Francisco in the days after Steinle's death, and the city and its sanctuary policies — shared by more than 300 other jurisdictions nationwide — became fodder for conservative newscasters and bloggers.

San Francisco's initial sanctuary policy came in response to a wave of undocumented immigrants fleeing war-torn countries in Central America. It was followed in 2013 by the ""Due Process for All"" ordinance, signed with fanfare by Mayor Ed Lee, which limited the Sheriff's Department's discretion to honor ICE requests to detain inmates beyond their release dates for pickup. It laid out the same exceptions that supervisors affirmed Tuesday.

That law — and tensions between ICE and hundreds of local jurisdictions — stems from the Priority Enforcement Program's predecessor, Secure Communities. Under it, all fingerprints taken at the time of booking are shared with immigration authorities.

The program, implemented as a means to focus deportation efforts on convicted felons, was widely criticized for ensnaring many minor offenders and those never charged with any crime, including some domestic violence victims.

Hundreds of cities and counties — and a number of states — rebuffed the program as a threat to public safety, since undocumented immigrants were wary of coming forward to police as victims or witnesses to crimes.

ICE this summer largely abandoned the detainer requests, acknowledging that several federal courts have deemed them unconstitutional. In addition to moving largely to requests for notification, the Priority Enforcement Program narrowed the conditions under which it will seek out inmates held in local custody.

San Francisco remains wary but disagreements do exist over the community's policy.

The mayor and Supervisor Mark Farrell are among those who believe that despite its sanctuary city status, San Francisco should give individual law enforcement officers discretion to notify ICE of potential deportees when they deem it appropriate.

The city's 1989 ordinance allows for that discretion. And a 1996 federal statute states that no jurisdiction can ""prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from [ICE] information regarding the citizenship or immigration status … of any individual.""

Steinle's family has sued San Francisco over a policy enacted by Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi in March that requires all communication with ICE to be cleared with him or his legal department, saying it violates federal statutes.

Both Mayor Lee and Farrell have said Lopez-Sanchez's previous crimes should have prompted someone to ""pick up the phone"" and turn him over. But Farrell's resolution asking the sheriff to rescind his policy was tabled by a 6-5 vote Tuesday.

Noting in a statement that he believes in the Sanctuary City policy, Farrell said he was ""deeply disappointed"" in the rejection of his measure.

Political Memo: Democratic Dinner Drives Home Hillary Clinton’s Focus on Iowa,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/us/politics/democratic-dinner-drives-home-hillary-clintons-focus-on-iowa.html,nyt,"DES MOINES — She began her campaign with small-town round tables, not big-city rallies. She pleads for Iowans to caucus for her at the end of her events. And long after the Democratic Jefferson-Jackson dinner ended here late Saturday, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bill Clinton were still shaking people’s hands, as if to send a signal that they had learned a painful lesson about not taking Iowa for granted.

Nearly eight years after Mrs. Clinton was humbled by a third-place finish in Iowa, she has gone to great lengths to demonstrate her commitment to winning the state that first propelled Barack Obama to the presidency. But in a campaign that seems to be testing every long-held assumption about the electorate, Mrs. Clinton is facing a stiff challenge from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont that is again showcasing her difficulties with liberal activists in a state where she and her husband do not have deep ties.

She lacks the enthusiasm that Mr. Sanders enjoys. If he is able to turn out his backers from the progressive wing of the party and augment them with liberal independents new to the caucus process, he could be a threat to defeat her. Even some of Mrs. Clinton’s supporters here are reluctant to project much confidence, believing that the populist fervor gripping the left makes it dangerous to dismiss Mr. Sanders as a mere protest candidate.

“I really don’t think we have a clue,” said Representative Dave Loebsack, an Iowa Democrat and Clinton backer. “This year, not just on the Republican side but over all, there’s so much instability among the electorate.”

But Mr. Sanders has his own challenges here, and, for now, Mrs. Clinton leads him in Iowa polls. With Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. not seeking the Democratic nomination, she will most likely receive an additional boost from Democrats who were still considering supporting the vice president. Mr. Biden’s decision, along with her sure-footed performances at the first Democratic debate and before the congressional panel investigating the 2012 attack on the United States mission in Benghazi, Libya, has lifted Mrs. Clinton’s spirits.

Her sense of assuredness was on display at the party dinner Saturday, the same gathering where eight years ago, Mr. Obama gave the best speech of the night and soon after vaulted ahead of her and the rest of the field.

Mrs. Clinton, after directly engaging Mr. Sanders at the debate this month, only obliquely referred to him. At what is the highest-profile event on the Iowa political calendar before the caucuses, she reprised her stump speech targeting Republicans. Hers was the address, her advisers said afterward, of a candidate they believe has hit her stride.

Yet success has a way of breeding trouble for Mrs. Clinton, and as some of her supporters eyed the Sanders supporters streaming into the convention center where the dinner was held, they warned her not to let confidence slip into complacency.

“This is not a slam dunk for her,” said former Senator Tom Harkin, who served Iowa in Congress for 40 years, stating flatly that Mr. Sanders could win. “He’s got this enthusiasm like Obama did,” Mr. Harkin said. “The Hillary forces better not sit back.”

Mr. Sanders’s backers boast that he is poised to deliver an upset because Mrs. Clinton has again misread the electorate. “Establishment politicians don’t always see the anti-establishment things staring them in the face,” said Erin Rial of Fort Dodge, who was captivated by Mr. Sanders early on.

Mrs. Clinton’s allies argue that this time they are better prepared. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, sent a message about how invested she is in a state she considered pulling out of in the 2008 campaign. Mr. Mook, an evangelist for grass-roots organizing, showed up for the Jefferson-Jackson festivities, emphasizing the importance of building an infrastructure. Attendees at a pre-dinner rally featuring Mrs. Clinton and the pop singer Katy Perry were required to provide their contact information before gaining admittance.

Many activists here noted a distinct difference from 2008. Bill Stammerman, a longtime Democrat in the Des Moines suburbs of Dallas County, recalled an out-of-state organizer from that campaign who did not relate well.

“He wanted to run this campaign like it was in New York City and everything else, the big time,” said Mr. Stammerman, a Clinton supporter then and now. “I said, no, you don’t do that in Iowa. In Iowa, you talk to small-town people and small-town newspapers and small groups.” This campaign, Mr. Stammerman said, “is more down to earth.”

The dinner Saturday illustrated the distinct voting blocs represented by Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton — and illuminated Mr. Sanders’s limitations. His progressive followers are driven by his appeals to address income inequality and other class inequities, and are especially stirred by his attacks on what he portrays as a corrupt political system manipulated by the wealthy. Mrs. Clinton’s backers are traditional Democrats, many of them women inspired by the prospect of the first female president.

The competing chants filling the hall captured their differences. Mr. Sanders backers bellowed: “You can’t buy us! You can’t buy us!” and “Hey, hey, ho, ho — the oligarchy has got to go.” Mrs. Clinton’s supporters preferred a more straightforward “I’m with her! I’m with her!”

But Democrats got a reminder that Mr. Sanders, an independent and self-described democratic socialist, is not a member of their party. As Mrs. Clinton began her remarks well into the evening, hundreds of his supporters left the building to catch waiting buses or attend parties. It offended the polite sensibilities of some Iowans, and was a reminder of why he may find it difficult to appeal to the sort of mainline party activists who have backed the eventual Democratic nominee in all the contested caucuses here since 2000.

“Are the Sanders folks going to walk out on the Democrats if he’s not the nominee?” John Deeth, a liberal blogger from Iowa City, pointedly asked on his way out of the dinner.

Unlike Mrs. Clinton and Martin O’Malley, the other Democratic presidential candidate at the dinner, Mr. Sanders offered no homage, or mention at all, of Mr. Biden, a well-liked figure in the party. And he delivered a speech that he could have given in any state, making little attempt to highlight Iowa issues. Mrs. Clinton, conversely, paid homage to Iowa Democrats by name and attacked Iowa Republicans on health care.

Mr. Sanders signaled on Saturday night that he was prepared to fight. He is said to have hired a pollster for the first time this campaign, and repeatedly struck notes about areas where Mrs. Clinton has changed positions. Mrs. Clinton’s advisers are girding for a better-prepared version of Mr. Sanders in the next debate.

But while Mr. Sanders did use his remarks to portray the Clintons as inconsistent progressives, he could not bring himself to confront her directly the way she confronted him in their debate this month. Nor did he raise the issue of gun control, which Mrs. Clinton and Mr. O’Malley discussed and which polls show could hurt Mr. Sanders in Iowa. (Mrs. Clinton’s Iowa brochure now includes “Acting on Gun Violence” as one of four issue priorities.)

A Clinton triumph in Iowa could hasten the end of the Democratic primary season. Even if Mr. Sanders won in New Hampshire, the Clinton forces would seek to frame that victory as an anomaly resulting from his hailing from a neighboring state and New Hampshire’s traditional affection for insurgents.

The political dynamic that has elevated Iowa, the state that haunted Mrs. Clinton’s White House ambitions eight years ago, could now pave her way to the nomination. The difference now, say Mrs. Clinton’s supporters, is that “she’s not running against Obama,” as Iowa’s attorney general, Tom Miller, put it. “That was a magical campaign eight years ago.”",0.89374822479857352
"Biden calls Paul Ryan 'good guy,' hopes for progress with Congress",http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/AlhsC-9enwA/story01.htm,reuters,"WASHINGTON Vice President Joe Biden, calling former campaign opponent Paul Ryan a ""good guy,"" voiced hope in an interview that the White House could make progress with Congress on the budget and other issues if Ryan becomes House of Representatives speaker.

Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, was Mitt Romney's running mate in the 2012 presidential race and debated Biden in a televised encounter. Democratic President Barack Obama and Biden went on to win re-election.

""I think we can make some real progress, particularly with Paul Ryan, who is a good guy, on working toward an accommodation on the budget and on keeping the government open,"" Biden said in the interview on CBS's ""60 Minutes"" airing on Sunday.

Asked about the White House's difficulty getting much done with the Republican-led Congress and if a Ryan speakership could change things, Biden replied: ""Yes. This is a decent guy. And he knows you cannot function - this government can’t function without reaching some consensus and he wants to do that.""

Ryan announced his candidacy last week to succeed John Boehner as head of the bitterly divided House after gathering support from conservative and moderate Republican groups. Republicans are scheduled to nominate a new speaker on Wednesday, with a vote by the full House on Thursday.

Biden, who said last week he would not run for president in 2016 because he was ""out of time"" to mount a winning campaign, told ""60 Minutes"" he had no plans ever to seek elective office again.

Biden, 72, who became vice president in 2009, served as a U.S. senator from Delaware for 36 years and was a two-time Democratic presidential candidate.

He said he felt ""good"" about the decision not to seek the 2016 nomination, although his wife, Jill, said in the interview she was disappointed because she believed ""he would've been the best president.""

When asked if he would ever run for political office again, Biden said: ""No. No.""

""I hope I leave office ... as a respected figure who can convene people and bring people together."" he said. ""And I just think the president and I talked about what we do together. What we each want to do out of office.""

Joe Biden Says Family Held Sway in Decision Not to Run,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/us/politics/joe-biden-says-family-held-sway-in-decision-not-to-run.html,nyt,"WASHINGTON — Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. delayed launching a presidential campaign for months, in part because of the tears of his 11-year-old granddaughter. That time for family healing after the death of the vice president’s son ultimately meant he would not be able to win, Mr. Biden said.

Mr. Biden recalled a moment by the family swimming pool this summer when his granddaughter Natalie was sitting on his lap. She “turns around and puts her arms around me and starts sobbing and says: ‘Pop, I see Daddy all the time. I see Daddy all the time. Pop, you smell like Daddy. You’re not going to leave me, are you, Pop?’ ” Mr. Biden said in an interview televised on Sunday night on CBS’s “60 Minutes.”

Mr. Biden suggested that just a week ago Natalie was in a better place emotionally, and he described how she had crossed the finish line of a cross-country running race and said: “Daddy would be happy, wouldn’t he? Wouldn’t he?”

“It just takes time,” Mr. Biden said to the interviewer, Norah O’Donnell. “And until you get there, you know, it’s not — not an appropriate thing to throw your — and by the way, you can’t run for president unless you throw your entire being into it.”

The vice president’s son Beau Biden died on May 30 of a cancerous brain tumor. He was 46.

Mr. Biden acknowledged that the delay in launching a campaign meant that he could not win a presidential contest.

“If I thought we could’ve put together the campaign that our supporters deserve and our contributors deserved, I would have gone ahead and done it,” Mr. Biden said.

Mr. Biden said his wife, Jill Biden, was pressing him to run, mentioning such issues as potential Supreme Court nominations and attention to education issues to spur him on.

But constant speculation in the news media, often inaccurate, about his intentions “was driving us crazy,” he said.

“I’d get up some mornings,” he continued, “and say: ‘Let’s just end this thing, man. We don’t have time to, I don’t want to go keep getting buffeted like this.’ ”

Mr. Biden also said reports that his son had made a dying wish for Mr. Biden to run for president were false. Beau Biden had long thought his father should run for president, “but there was not what was sort of made out as kind of this Hollywood-esque thing that at the last minute Beau grabbed my hand and said, ‘Dad, you’ve got to run,’ like ‘Win one for the Gipper,’ ” Mr. Biden said. “It wasn’t anything like that.”

Mr. Biden said he now had no intention of running for office again. He also said his comment last week that Republicans were not “my chief enemy” was not intended as a subtle criticism of Hillary Rodham Clinton, who had listed Republicans as among her enemies in answer to a question in the Democratic debate.

He insisted that he and Mrs. Clinton “get along together” and that he liked her.

“The only reason to run is because I still think I could do a better job than anybody else could do,” Mr. Biden said. “That’s the reason to run. I wouldn’t run against Hillary.”",0.48654821821260841
Biden opted out on 2016 Dem race because he 'couldn't win',http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/hM5VI51xeps/,fox,"mboxCreate('FoxNews-Politics-Autoplay-Videos-In-Articles');

WASHINGTON –  Vice President Joe Biden says he decided against running for president because he ""couldn't win,"" not because he would have had too little time to get a campaign up and running.

""I'll be very blunt. If I thought we could've put together the campaign ... that our supporters deserve and our contributors deserved, ... I would have done it,"" he said in an interview aired Sunday on CBS's ""60 Minutes.""

In the wide-ranging interview, in which Biden took questions for a time joined by his wife, Jill, the vice president also said he would not have gotten into the race just to stop Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton.

""I've said from the beginning, 'Look, I like Hillary. Hillary and I get along together,"" he said. ""The only reason to run is because ... I still think I could do a better job than anybody else could do.""

He used the interview to play down suggestions his announcement not to run, made at the White House Wednesday with President Barack Obama standing at his side, included a jab at Clinton.

At the White House event, Biden lamented partisan bickering in Washington politics and said, ""I don't think we should look at Republicans as our enemies."" Clinton had made a statement to that effect during the Democratic presidential debate earlier this month.

""That wasn't directed at Hillary,"" Biden told ""60 Minutes.""

""That was a reference to Washington, all of Washington,"" he said.

The 72-year-old Biden also sought in the interview to dispel recurrent rumors that his late son Beau, who died earlier this year at age 46 of brain cancer, had made a last-minute plea to his father to run for president.

Biden said there was no such ""Hollywood moment ... Nothing like that ever, ever happened,"" he said. ""Beau all along thought that I should run and I could win.""

""But there was not what was sort of made out as kind of this Hollywood-esque thing that, at the last minute, Beau grabbed my hand and said, 'Dad, you've got to run,' like win one for the Gipper,"" Biden said.

The vice president did say he wants to continue to have a voice in party affairs and will speak up whenever he wishes. He has not endorsed a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.

""I will make no bones about that,"" he said. ""I don't want the party walking away from what Barack and I did.""

Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley are still in the race.",0.80643355894547508
"Ryan gets more, key support ahead of big vote this week to become next GOP House speaker",http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/kdrVZmKdwss/,fox,"mboxCreate('FoxNews-Politics-Autoplay-Videos-In-Articles');

Wisconsin GOP Rep. Paul Ryan got added support Sunday from a key part of the chamber’s Republican conference when the leader of the House Freedom Caucus said he was the “right guy” to be the next speaker.

“We think Paul has the kind of vision and is the kind of messenger our party needs to accomplish the things we told the voters we’re going to accomplish,” group Chairman Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan said on ""Fox News Sunday.""

Ryan, House Ways and Means Committee chairman and 2012 vice presidential candidate, was recruited by Capitol Hill Republicans to become the next House speaker.

Ryan agreed to run for the post after talking last week with members of the Freedom Caucus -- part of the chamber’s most conservative wing, which largely forced House Speaker John Boehner to resign in late-September.

“He didn’t quite get the endorsement threshold we have in our group, but a super majority of our members said we think Paul Ryan is the right guy at the right time to lead our conference,” Jordan also said Sunday.

The small-but-powerful wing continuously disagreed with Boehner and members of the leadership team, accusing them of not digging in hard enough on spending cuts, repealing ObamaCare and other important conservative issues.

Ryan in talking with the caucus members reportedly agreed to address their concerns including committee leadership assignments and legislation from rank-and-file members not getting more consideration.

The speaker vote is expected later this week.

“We have a commitment from Paul to work on changing the rules and we may even get a change before the vote this coming Wednesday and Thursday,” Jordan said.

Ryan was recruited after a couple of wild weeks after Boehner’s resignation. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the second-in-command, dropped out of the race after suggesting the House Select Committee on Benghazi was responsible for damaging the campaign of Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton. And South Carolina GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy, chairman of the Benghazi committee, was mentioned for the job, but he quickly and emphatically declined.

Ryan needs 218 votes from the chamber’s 434 members, including 246 Republicans.

He has made clear he doesn't want to squeak by in the vote. Last week, he got support from the Republican Study Committee and the Tuesday Group, two key groups that should help him get enough votes.",0.88825845464308739
Joe Biden: Grief kept me from making earlier decision on whether to run for president,http://www.latimes.com/la-na-joe-biden-60-minutes-20151025-story.html,latimes,"During the summer of often-breathless speculation about whether Vice President Joe Biden would run for president, the voice that was missing was the normally loquacious Biden's. On Sunday, he finally offered his own view, saying that in times when he leaned toward entering the race, he was pulled back by fresh grief over the recent death of his son.

In an interview with ""60 Minutes,"" his first since he announced last week that he'd decided not to campaign, the vice president openly acknowledged his struggle to make a decision while he and his family mourned the death of his eldest son, Beau, in May.

At one point in late summer when he felt inclined to run, he told CBS’ Norah O’Donnell, Beau's only daughter began weeping in his arms during a family dinner.

“ ‘Pop, I see Daddy all the time,’ ” he recalled his granddaughter saying to him. “ ‘You’re not going to leave me, are you, Pop?’

“When that happens,” Biden said, “you go, ‘I don’t know, man.’ ”

At other times, Biden said the frenzied media speculation almost led him to prematurely announce he would not run. He’d read stories citing unnamed sources with often-contradictory claims about his decision.

“That used to drive me crazy,” he said. “I’d get up some mornings and say, ‘Let’s just end this thing.’ ”

But his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, often portrayed as one of the figures close to him who was least supportive of a run, would nonetheless challenge him in such moments. She would ask him such questions as: “What about the Supreme Court?”

“I felt like everything we worked so hard for in the administration, you know, could just all change,” she said in the interview.

The vice president also disputed the assertion made in some media reports that his son made a final deathbed plea for him to join the race.

Hillary Rodham Clinton warned Saturday that returning the White House to a Republican would jeopardize the nation's economic recovery under President Obama, as she tried to build on her campaign's recent momentum while her Democratic rivals stepped up their criticisms.

“We need to defend the progress...

Hillary Rodham Clinton warned Saturday that returning the White House to a Republican would jeopardize the nation's economic recovery under President Obama, as she tried to build on her campaign's recent momentum while her Democratic rivals stepped up their criticisms.

“We need to defend the progress...

“There was not what was sort of made out as some kind of this Hollywood-esque thing, that at the last minute, Beau grabbed my hand and said, ‘Dad, you’ve got to run.’ … It wasn’t anything like that,” he said.

Still, both Beau and Biden’s younger son, Hunter, were his best political advisors, Biden said, and Beau “all along thought that I should run and could win,” the vice president added. 

Ultimately, Biden repeated that his final decision against running was simply a matter of timing.

“I’ll be very blunt. If I thought we could’ve put together the campaign that our supporters deserve and our contributors deserved, I would have gone ahead and done it,” he said.

Still, Biden said he sees a future for himself in the party even if it’s not as a candidate for president. He acknowledged that his announcement from the Rose Garden on Wednesday did sound like a political speech.

“There’s some truth to that,” he said. “I was making a case that I do want to influence the Democratic Party.”

But he denied sending a message to Clinton in recent days. Repeatedly over the past week, he has criticized Democrats who view the GOP as “enemies,” as Clinton recently said she did. Biden said he was not directing his complaints of a lack of bipartisanship at her but instead at Washington as a whole.

He said that he didn’t want Democrats walking away from what he and President Obama have accomplished, and that although Clinton may not be following his advice to run on the administration’s record, “it doesn’t mean she won’t be a great president,” Biden said.

“Go back and find anybody who says for the four years we worked together Hillary and I weren’t friends,” he said of the idea that he’d come to resent her.

Biden said he believes he can still accomplish a lot even as he said he would not run for office again. He also expressed hope that the White House could work with Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), the most likely candidate to be the new House speaker, to avoid a government shutdown and agree on a new budget.

“I hope I leave office as a respected figure who can convene people and bring people together,” he said.

10/25/15 06:43 PM EDT

DES MOINES — He's glad they weren't around when he was running for office, but former President Bill Clinton says he loves a good ""selfie.""

“I think on balance, it’s been a great thing for people,” he told reporters Saturday night, while working the rope line after the high-stakes Democratic Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Iowa. Close to an hour after the other candidates and most of the attendees had cleared out of the Hy-Vee Center in downtown Des Moines, Bill and Hillary Clinton were still schmoozing with a small group of lingering fans.

Story Continued Below

And while Hillary Clinton ignored reporters and focused on the Iowans there to meet her, Bill Clinton proved once again there’s no subject he doesn’t want to expound on— and that he can’t resist chatting with reporters.

After posing for a string of selfies, he engaged reporters who asked him how the iPhone has changed his interactions with voters. While people used to approach politicians with a question, he said, now they simply hold out their phones for a picture.

“It’s a dominant force that’s allowed to interrupt conversations,” he said, “I think, on balance, it’s been a great thing for people.”

But he admitted that if iPhones had been around when he was governor of Arkansas, “I might never have lived to run for President. I spent my time doing uber retail politics.”

The former president, making his first official appearance on the campaign trail for his wife over the weekend, also waxed philosophical about the art of the selfie. “It has democratized picture-taking and record-keeping — and that’s good,” he said.

Clinton said he even requests his own selfies sometimes.

“I’ve been with people who are taking selfies with me, and I thought they were interesting looking people, total strangers, but I thought it was an interesting setting,” he said of when he has requested his own copy. He didn’t answer when a reporter asked him what, in his view, constituted an interesting looking person.

Senate Republicans’ carefully-laid plans to use a powerful fast-track tool to send an Obamacare repeal to President Barack Obama is running into fresh resistance, with new opposition from high-profile conservatives and bubbling concerns from moderates.

For months, the GOP-led Congress has planned to use the procedural maneuver known as “reconciliation” to finally shepherd a major Obamacare repeal bill to the president’s desk. The fast-track process ensures Democrats in the Senate can’t filibuster the legislation and foil yet another attempt to gut the law.

But three conservative members of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s conference — Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah — have already vowed to vote against the current reconciliation package that repeals major parts of Obamacare, arguing it doesn’t go far enough. If those votes don’t budge, McConnell can’t afford to lose any more votes from his 54-member ranks.

Meanwhile, a provision in the reconciliation bill that defunds Planned Parenthood for one year could cause some heartburn for moderates who don’t support stripping money from the women’s health group. The group has come under significant Capitol Hill scrutiny, particularly from Republicans, over whether the organization profited from sales of fetal tissue.

“It is a mistake to do anything less than a full Obamacare repeal on reconciliation,” Cruz, who is vying for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, told Politico in a brief interview. “That’s what Republicans promised the voters we would do, and that’s exactly what we should do.”

From the other ideological end of the GOP spectrum, Maine Sen. Susan Collins said she was concerned that the reconciliation bill defunded Planned Parenthood. Still, she said: “I would look at the whole bill.”

Another moderate Republican, Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, has voted against measures to defund the women’s health group, and would likely come under criticism in his uphill reelection bid in the blue state if he switched course on Planned Parenthood on reconciliation. He referred a reporter to a spokeswoman, who declined to comment.

Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski is a third Senate Republican who has voiced objections in the past to broadly defunding Planned Parenthood. A Murkowski spokeswoman said it was premature to comment on the reconciliation package.

With a 240-189 vote on Friday, the House passed the reconciliation bill repealing key elements of Obamacare, including the individual and employer mandates as well as two taxes in the health care law – the Cadillac tax on pricey benefit plans and a tax on medical devices. The bill now goes to the Senate, where leaders have not indicated when senators will take up the legislation.

But Senate conservatives, as well as activist groups off the Hill, are prodding Republican lawmakers to do more to rip apart Obamacare. Lee said significant portions of the health care law could be addressed through reconciliation, but those provisions are not included in the current version. For example, Lee would like the measure to roll back provisions such as Medicaid expansion and subsidies provided to millions of consumers who purchase health care coverage through the Obamacare exchanges.

“If we’re going to be using reconciliation at all, we ought to use it to repeal as much of Obamacare, as much as we can,” Lee said. “If we’re not going to do that … we ought not to use it.”

The Utah senator joined Cruz and Rubio — who like Cruz is a 2016 presidential contender — to issue a statement last week that said the trio of conservatives would vote against the reconciliation bill unless it’s changed to repeal as much of Obamacare that is allowed under Senate rules.

That group didn’t include Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is also running for the GOP presidential nomination and would likely feel pressure to align with Cruz and Rubio in making more conservative demands on gutting the health care law.

“If it’s repealing Obamacare, I’ll be a yes,” Paul told Politico. When asked whether the partial repeal in the House package is problematic for him, Paul responded: “I’m for repealing the whole thing. I don’t know exactly what will come forward yet.”

Paul, along with Cruz, voted against the Senate Republican budget earlier this year that helped set up the fast-track procedures.

The reconciliation push is largely a political exercise, since Obama will veto any legislation that shreds key elements of his signature domestic policy achievement. But Republicans want to put the president in a position that forces him to take out his veto pen on an Obamacare repeal — a position that unifies the GOP, more than five years after the controversial law was enacted.

The Senate is working with a narrower margin of error than in the House, where just seven House GOP lawmakers opposed the reconciliation package on Friday. And some of those Republicans are moderate members who have previously opposed their party’s attempts to strip funding from Planned Parenthood.

The limited dissension from House Republicans, some aides said, also showed some waning influence of the feisty outside group Heritage Action, which lobbied GOP lawmakers to oppose the package because it didn’t go far enough to dismantle the health care law.

“The only thing that’s changed since the budget debate is that the House ignored Heritage Action’s attempt to get members to vote against Obamacare repeal and for Planned Parenthood funding,” one senior Republican aide said. “Even the Freedom Caucus thought that was a ridiculous demand.”

Heritage Action, like the three conservative Senate Republicans who have vowed to oppose the reconciliation bill as written, are pushing GOP lawmakers to go much bigger and more fully repeal Obamacare under the fast-track budget procedure.

But the Senate is limited by special procedural rules that precisely define what can actually be done under reconciliation. The chamber’s parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, would have the final word on what would be allowed under the so-called Byrd rule, named after the late Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.).

Earlier this year, MacDonough privately hinted to Senate Republican aides that a full repeal of the health care law would not be allowed under the Byrd rule. But, when asked about the parliamentarian’s role in the reconciliation fight, Cruz said last week that “at the end of the day, the Senate parliamentarian is an employee of the Senate” and stressed that all Republicans campaigned on Obamacare repeal.

But McConnell will allow amendments to the House reconciliation package, and conservatives are sure to offer changes to shape the Obamacare measure more to their liking. There has also been speculation on the Hill that the Planned Parenthood provisions might be subject to the Byrd rule.

Regardless, Democrats are likely to use the health care package — particularly its measures stripping funding from Planned Parenthood — as a political cudgel against Senate Republicans up for reelection in blue and purple states in 2016.

“Vulnerable Republican senators who have already voted repeatedly to defund Planned Parenthood are desperate to erase their records of reducing access to women’s health care,” said Sadie Weiner, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “But voters in 2016 will know without a doubt that these senators are more interested in scoring political points than in supporting women’s health care.”

GOP presidential candidate and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie had to leave an Amtrak “quiet” car for talking on his cellphone Sunday morning, shortly after boarding a north-bound train from Washington, D.C.

A fellow passenger told the website Gawker that Christie boarded the 9:55 a.m. train at the last minute and had a loud discussion with his two-man security detail about seating, then had an “intense” talk on his cellphone before being approached by a conductor.

The conductor purportedly asked Christie, known for his bombastic manner, to either concluded the call or move to a talking-permissible car.

Campaign official Samantha Smith acknowledged the incident but said Christie mistakenly sat in the no-talking car “on a very full train” and apologized for the mistake and inconveniencing fellow passengers

“After breaking the cardinal rule of the quiet car, the governor promptly left once he realized the serious nature of his mistake and enjoyed the rest of his time on the train from the cafe car,” Smith said in a statement. “Sincere apologies to all the patrons of the quiet car that were offended.”

She also said Christie wasn't asked to leave and referred FoxNews.com to a Twitter feed of a purported female passenger who said the conductor only pointed out to Christie that he was in a quiet car. 

The passenger also told Gawker that Christie was drinking a McDonald’s strawberry smoothie and kept repeating into his phone: “This is frickin’ ridiculous” and “seriously?”

Amtrak conductors generally urge passengers to maintain a ""library-like atmosphere"" in the quiet car. It's not uncommon for conductors to ask noisier passengers to change cars.

The Republican presidential hopeful had appeared on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" earlier in the morning.

Governor Christie apologizes for loud speech in Amtrak quiet car,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/225iXayieG4/story01.htm,reuters,"New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican presidential hopeful, apologized for speaking too loudly on Sunday in a designated quiet car on an Amtrak train, a spokeswoman said.

Christie accidentally took a seat in ""Amtrak's notorious quiet car"" on Sunday morning, spokeswoman Samantha Smith said.

""After breaking the cardinal rule of the quiet car, the governor promptly left once he realized the serious nature of his mistake and enjoyed the rest of his time on the train from the cafe car,"" Smith said in a statement.

Smith offered sincere apologies for the governor to riders who were offended.

Christie was returning to New Jersey after an appearance on the CBS show ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday morning.

The Gawker site first reported the incident, saying that a conductor asked Christie to leave the quiet car because he was making phone calls and talking loudly. Christie representatives say he left the car once he realized his mistake.

Weekend attacks point to feisty upcoming GOP debate,http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/25/politics/sunday-shows-donald-trump-ben-carson-republican-debate/index.html,cnn,"Washington (CNN)If the weekend news shows were any indication, the next Republican debate in a few days is going to be a doozy.

In a flurry of appearances on Sunday political talk shows, Donald Trump let it be known that he's ready to take off the gloves and hammer Ben Carson. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio was increasingly willing to hit fellow Republicans. And, on the Democratic side, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders indicated he's not going to let Hillary Clinton set her campaign in cruise control, even after two strong weeks.

Here's a look at three themes that will reverberate through this week:

According to Trump, Carson is ""very weak on immigration,"" ""cannot do with trade like I do"" on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and has ""super low energy"" levels -- lower, in fact, than Jeb Bush.

The attacks -- many coming in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" -- signal that Trump has been stung by new polls that show Carson has seized the front-runner's mantle in the first state to cast votes in the presidential nominating contest.

Trump like to call himself a ""counter-puncher,"" but he's attacked Carson even while the retired neurosurgeon has largely stayed away from initiating clashes of his own.

RELATED: Trump blasts Carson, says he lacks energy to be president

The aggressive approach suggests Trump is ready to draw the typically more reserved Carson out of his shell when Republicans meet Wednesday in Colorado for the their third debate, this one hosted by CNBC.

""He can't do with a lot of things like I do, so we'll just have to see what happens,"" Trump said of Carson.

Carson, meanwhile, told NBC's Chuck Todd on ""Meet the Press"" that he has dropped his angry teenage past, one in which he was violent.

""I do have a tendency to be relaxed,"" he said. ""I wasn't always like that. There was a time when I was, you know, very volatile. But, you know, I changed.""

Trump and Carson are also exchanging shots over religion after Trump told a crowd in Iowa, of Carson's faith: ""I mean, Seventh-day Adventist, I don't know about. I just don't know about.""

As he settles in the top tier of Republican presidential candidates, Rubio, the Florida senator, is increasingly willing to slam his primary rivals.

He hit Trump on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" saying the real estate mogul is unfit to become commander-in-chief due to his limited foreign policy expertise.

""To this point in the campaign, he has not proven an understanding of these issues or the preparation necessary to be the commander-in-chief of the most powerful military force in the world,"" Rubio said.

Among the biggest questions of the GOP nominating process thus far has been whether Rubio can eventually overtake Bush as the favorite of moderate and moneyed ""establishment"" members of the party eager for an alternative to political newcomers and outsiders like Trump, Carson and Carly Fiorina.

Rubio has also begun taking aim at Clinton, the Democrat who he says is certain to be that party's nominee.

Look for Rubio to come on strong in the debate this week.

It was a big two-week string of victories for Clinton: A funny and well-received appearance on ""Saturday Night Live,"" a widely praised showing in the first Democratic presidential debate, a decision by Vice President Joe Biden to stay out of the 2016 race, and an escape from an 11-hour hearing on Benghazi without being hit by any new bombshells.

But with the more solid ground she finds her campaign on now comes a bigger target she'll wear.

With Biden staying out of the race and long-shots Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee dropping their longshot campaigns, Clinton now faces a much narrower competition against Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley.

RELATED: Sanders says he is not 'shouting' at Hillary Clinton

Sanders showed new willingness to go after Clinton on Sunday, saying on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that both Bill and Hillary Clinton supported a measure -- the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as between one man and one woman -- that was ""homophobic."" It was the latest in his efforts to cast Clinton as a late comer to liberal causes he has supported for decades.

He said the law, since struck down by the Supreme Court, was pushed by GOP lawmakers -- and ""many of them, I'm sorry to say, were homophobic.""

""I think everybody at the time knew that it was simply homophobic legislation,"" Sanders said.

""That legislation was anti-gay legislation. It was playing off the fears of a lot of Americans,"" he added. ""Now the good news -- as Hillary Clinton just indicated -- the culture has changed radically. ... We have come a long, long way since that vote in 1996.""",0.99975976752141205
"Rubio on Clinton, Trump, music and movies",http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/25/politics/marco-rubio-clinton-trump-music-movies/index.html,cnn,"Washington (CNN)Marco Rubio is sure Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic presidential nominee. And he says Donald Trump isn't ready to be commander-in-chief.

The Florida senator who is emerging as an establishment favorite for the Republican 2016 nomination criticized both Clinton and Trump in a wide-ranging interview with CNN's Jamie Gangel.

He ripped Trump for not addressing important issues ""in a serious way.""

""To this point in the campaign, he has not proven an understanding of these issues or the preparation necessary to be the commander-in-chief of the most powerful military force in the world,"" Rubio said.

He also said Clinton winning the Democratic nomination over rivals Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is a foregone conclusion.

""Well, she'll be the Democratic nominee, someone who comes from a political dynasty and that, in and of itself, is going to bring fundraising capabilities and so forth,"" Rubio said.

He lambasted her performance in a Thursday hearing in front of the House Benghazi committee, where a Clinton email showed she'd told her family right after the 2012 attacks resulting in the deaths of four Americans that they were the work of terrorists, and not a reaction to an anti-Islam video.

""She lied about Benghazi,"" Rubio said. ""I think it's just a little bit more insight into her unwillingness oftentimes to speak truth, in this case for political reasons.""

RELATED: Rubio says Trump's immigration plan 'borders on absurd'

In the interview, Rubio also demonstrated his love for 1990s-era hip-hop -- particularly West Coast rappers like Tupac Shakur.

He said lately he's a fan of electronic dance music, as well as artists who have crossed traditional lines of genre.

""In many ways it's real genius and it's a 21st-century ability to take music and use it in a way that motivates people. Some of it is blended with other sounds that are sampled from recordings that others have had in the past, and you see traditional artists being brought in and their voices used in an electronic sound track,"" he said.

He credited Tiesto and other DJs, and he said he listens to artists who have blended hip hop, rap, R&B and electronic dance music. He credited Canadians Drake and The Weeknd for doing that.

Rubio said some of his favorite music isn't quite suitable for children, though, because of the lyrics.

""You don't want kids at a young age exposed to lyrics that somehow glamorize a lifestyle that's art, it's not reality,"" Rubio said.

""So one of the issues with the '90s hip hop music is that it had lyrics that were offensive. What it actually was were people who were living in those circumstances expressing what their life was like. In the West Coast case, for example, in South Central L.A. And so it gave insight into the lives that they were living.

""But if you heard the lyrics purely without understanding that, you may think that it's glamorizing that lifestyle. To some extent it was, and so there's a difference between a 44-year-old man listening to that and a 16-year-old listening to that and not understanding the difference between artistic expression and reality.""

As for his favorite movies, Rubio -- ""like any guy in America,"" he admitted -- said he loves both Godfathers I and II. ""And No. 3, I can do without.""",0.98995338353540374
