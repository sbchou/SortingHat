{"body": "Donald J. Trump issued another call for more scrutiny of mosques in the United States as fresh fears of terrorism, spurred by the attacks in Paris, dominated the presidential campaign conversation on Monday.\n\nMr. Trump, who said last month that he would be open to shutting down mosques as part of the fight against Islamic State militants, reiterated on Monday that the idea should be \u201cstudied.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would hate it do it but it\u2019s something that you\u2019re going to have to strongly consider because some of the ideas and some of the hatred, the absolute hatred, is coming from these areas,\u201d Mr. Trump said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d program.\n\nMr. Trump said that if he were to become\u00a0president, surveillance of mosques is something that he would \u201cwatch and study\u201d because \u201ca lot of talk is going on at the mosques.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s concerns about radical Islam were echoed by another\u00a0leading Republican presidential candidate on Monday. Ben Carson, who has been running close with Mr. Trump atop many polls, called on Congress to defund its program to give safe passage to Syrian refugees. The retired neurosurgeon also suggested that Muslim clerics should be pressured to condemn the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.\n\n\u201cI believe that we need to put a lot more pressure on the clerics, the imams, to make a very distinct line between what ISIS, ISIL, the radical Islamic jihadists are doing, and what traditional Islam is about,\u201d Mr. Carson said in Nevada.\n\nJeb Bush, the former Florida governor, also expressed concern about refugees from the Middle East entering the United States and said\u00a0over the weekend that Christians and Muslims who are fleeing Syria should be treated differently.\n\n\u201cWe should focus our efforts as it relates to refugees for the Christians that are being slaughtered,\u201d Mr. Bush said, telling CNN that only a limited number of refugees should be accepted and that the creation of safe zones in Syria should be the priority.\n\nThe suggestion of basing refugee status on religion offended President Obama on Monday. Speaking at a news conference in Turkey, he called the idea un-American.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which a person who\u2019s fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted, when some of those folks themselves come from families who benefited from protection when they were fleeing political persecution \u2014 that\u2019s shameful,\u201d the president said.", "byline": "ALAN RAPPEPORT", "description": "Donald J.
