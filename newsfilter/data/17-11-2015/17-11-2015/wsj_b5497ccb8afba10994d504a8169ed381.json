The rapidly moving investigation is revealing a picture of a network of terrorists, many of them born in Europe, who were trained in Syria or elsewhere in the Middle East\u00e2\u0080\u0094a scenario that has worried authorities across Europe for years.\nBelgian and French authorities are also investigating whether a Belgian man suspected of being the mastermind behind a foiled Belgian terrorist plot in January orchestrated Friday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s onslaught, officials familiar with the probe said. Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who was raised in Brussels, may have escaped to Syria after police shot and killed two men in the eastern Belgian town of Verviers who were plotting to kill police officers. At least several of the suspects had moved undetected by both the French and Belgian governments, using an operating base just 50 miles off France\u00e2\u0080\u0099s border, in Brussels. Inti Landauro and Matthew Dalton report.\nThe latest on the Paris attacks:\u00c2\u00a0World leaders promised a forceful response to Friday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0terrorist attacks in Paris, including intensified airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, intelligence cooperation and measures to tighten border security \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The Belgian links to the Paris attacks have reignited concerns that the European Union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capital continues to be a breeding ground for radical Islamist terrorists, sparking a debate in the country about whether the government is doing enough to crack down on them \u2026 When the sound of a suicide bomber detonating an explosive vest rang out across the Stade de France, President Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Hollande was in the stadium watching France\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national soccer team take on Germany. Paris was coming under attack from Islamic State militants, and Mr. Hollande had to decide whether it was safer to evacuate the stadium or keep thousands inside \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 France and the U.S. have been on opposing trajectories in the Muslim world in recent years \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The Paris attacks are transforming Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s migration crisis into a security debate, spurring calls for a clampdown on free movement across borders, and putting proponents of an open door for refugees on the defensive \u2026 How the attacks unfolded\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Portraits of Paris attack victims begin to emerge\u2026The latest updates on the Paris attacks are at the WSJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s liveblog.\nAARON ZITNER: PARIS ATTACKS UPEND WHITE HOUSE RACE IN DIFFERENT WAYS FOR EACH PARTY\nThe terror attacks in Paris have injected an emotional and unexpected element into the U.S. presidential race. But they are likely to affect the two parties in different ways, Aaron Zitner reports.

During much of the campaign, voters have swooned over candidates who trumpet their nonpolitical r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9s. Celebrity businessman Donald Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson have led the Republican field, running far ahead of politicians who served in statehouses and Congress. On the Democratic side, self-described socialist Bernie Sanders has been drawing the largest and most enthusiastic crowds, putting a scare into the establishment candidate, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The Paris attacks and potency of Islamic State, which France blames for the deadly assaults, could reshuffle the field as voters ask: Is this the moment to turn over the presidency to an untested outsider? Peter Nicholas and Beth Reinhard report.\nPlus:\u00c2\u00a0Democrats and Republicans, based on their recent presidential debates, are set to offer voters a stark choice in 2016 about how the economy should be managed, with both sides moving toward the outer flanks of their parties\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Republican presidential candidates have criticized Mrs. Clinton\u00c2\u00a0for declining\u00c2\u00a0to use term such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cradical Islam\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cIslamic terrorism\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0to describe the extremists who have unleashed a string of terrorist attacks on Western targets recently\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Sen. Bernie Sanders had one clear mission in the presidential debate\u00c2\u00a0Saturday\u00c2\u00a0night: Put Mrs. Clinton on the defensive in hopes of peeling away Democratic voters who are coalescing behind her candidacy. That didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Still, Democrats who watched the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential candidates debate thought that Mr. Sanders won the event, an Internet survey found, though they also said Mrs. Clinton showed that she would do the best job of keeping the U.S. safe from terrorism.\nOBAMA FACES A CROSSROADS: President Obama came into office with a single, driving foreign-policy principle that shaped his approach to international crises: Avoid another protracted war like those in Iraq and Afghanistan. Friday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terrorist attacks in Paris, which killed at least 129 people, present Mr. Obama with a fundamental test of whether the approach is sustainable. With one year in office remaining, the president faces pressure to escalate what is now seen as a global, rather than regional, fight against Islamic State militants, whom France accused of carrying out the attacks. How Mr. Obama responds, in coordination with America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s European allies and potentially Russia, could define U.S. leadership for years to come. Carol E. Lee reports.\nPlus:\u00c2\u00a0The White House said the U.S. agrees with France that the terrorist attacks in Paris are \u00e2\u0080\u009can act of war\u00e2\u0080\u009d and demands stronger international commitments to combat the Islamic State group that carried out the attacks \u2026 The Paris terror attacks suggest that the U.S. and its allies overestimated recent successes against Islamic State while underestimating the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to strike far from its Middle East stronghold, according to U.S. lawmakers, analysts and former senior intelligence officials\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Thirty minutes of terror on the streets of Paris looks to become the catalyst for a broad shift in international politics with implications that could last for years.\nTRUMP COURTS GOP VOTERS IN FLORIDA: Donald Trump is staking claim to a state that helped cinch the last two GOP presidential nominations, barreling past a couple of native sons in the race. At a weekend gathering of hundreds of Florida Republican activists, he elicited a rowdier reception than Sen. Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush and he is leading them in statewide polls. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not leading them. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trouncing them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d corrected Mr. Trump in an interview Friday with The Wall Street Journal, pulling a list of the latest polling from his breast pocket. Mr. Trump is favored by 27% of state GOP voters, while Mr. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standing is at 16% and Mr. Bush has the support of 9%, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average. Florida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s winner-take-all primary will award 99 delegates\u00e2\u0080\u0094roughly 8% of the total needed to clinch the nomination\u00e2\u0080\u0094and is viewed as a must-win for Messrs. Rubio and Bush. While Mr. Trump has never held public office in Florida, he isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trespassing either. Beth Reinhard reports.\nPlus:\u00c2\u00a0Sen. Ted Cruz brought his presidential campaign to an evangelical bastion Saturday, traveling to Bob Jones University to hold a religious liberty rally that was shadowed by anxiety about the terrorist attacks in Paris.\nALSO IN THE NEWS\nLawmakers and the Obama administration are ratcheting up efforts to target pharmaceutical companies over high-priced drugs, a sign that legislators are trying to bridge partisan differences to tackle a key driver of rising health care costs.\nA year ago, the financial industry stirred up a political furor by inserting relief from post-crisis regulation into a catch-all year-end spending bill.
