Jim Jordan to serve a second term as the chair of the conservative group. \nDuring a private meeting Monday, the nearly year-old group unanimously elected Jordan as its leader. \nStory Continued Below\nIt was not a surprising outcome. Jordan is widely respected by his peers in the conservative caucus and faced no challengers.\nThe group has had a successful year under Jordan's leadership. He's maneuvered the group through its first year with a handful of political and legislative wins \u2014 notably being one of the catalysts that forced former Speaker John Boehner from that post. \nThe group was created in January to counterbalance what conservatives viewed as a growing trend of compromise of Republican policies by the GOP leadership team. The 40 lawmakers forced a temporary shutdown of the Export-Import Bank and nearly caused a partial government shutdown in protest of President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration.\nJordan will serve as chairman for the next year. The group hopes to outline in that time their policy agenda in a document conservative lawmakers have taken to calling the second \"Contract with America\" \u2014 an ode to the document outline by Newt Gingrich in the 1990s that helped usher in a commanding Republican majority in the House.\nThe Freedom Caucus also elected two new board members on Monday. Reps. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) and Steve Pearce (R-N.M.) will join the seven-member board. \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The Ohio Republican will remain the group's leader.", "title": "House Freedom Caucus re-elects Jordan", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/house-freedom-caucus-re-elects-jordan-215955", "topics": ["trade", "foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Jim Obergefell", "Kate Tummarello", "Jim Jordan", "Jeff Duncan", "Henry C.
