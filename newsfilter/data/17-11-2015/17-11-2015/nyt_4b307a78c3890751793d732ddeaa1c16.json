{"body": "Greg Sargent mocks pundits declaring that the attacks in Paris will finally convince Republican primary voters that they need to get serious, and deflate the Trump/Carson bubble. This time it will really happen!\n\nOr not. \n\nAs Sargent says, these pundits have been wrong again and again \u2014 and with holidays coming up and then the start of actual voting, there isn\u2019t much time for bubble-deflation left. But there\u2019s more.\n\nFor one thing, who exactly are the serious candidates on national security? Jeb!, who thinks that a relative handful of terrorists can destroy the West, one rock concert at a time? Rubio, who mumbled something about a clash of civilizations?\n\nFor another, pretty much the same people claiming that it\u2019s time to get serious are attacking Democrats for \u2026 not using the right catchphrases, out of petty concerns like trying not to insult a whole religion. Say it loud and proud: radicalIslamradicalIslamradicalIslam. See? Terrorism defeated.\n\nFinally, remember how we got serious after 9/11?\n\nGiven what we\u2019ve seen in the past, this might even favor Trump, who can yell \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d at the terrorists, or Carson, who might be able to defeat them with the help of Klingon Jesus. \n\nUpdate: A reminder of how knowledgable Bush and Rubio are about foreign policy \u2014 remember Chang, the mystic warrior?", "byline": "PAUL KRUGMAN", "description": "Mission accomplished.", "title": "Paul Krugman Blog: Serious Delusions", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/serious-delusions/", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Paul Krugman", "Greg Sargent"], "orgs": [], "election_confidence": 0.720661587805648, "authors": [{"author_id": 696, "fullname": "paul krugman", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-11-16 18:48:24", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "4b307a78c3890751793d732ddeaa1c16", "date_access": "2015-11-16 19:09:14.923005"}
