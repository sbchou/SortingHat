We are pursuing matching funds and will compete vigorously for the nomination.\"\nStory Continued Below\nThe former Maryland governor, who sits at around 3 percent in Iowa according to the Real Clear Politics polling average, needs to vastly improve his numbers in order to gain delegates coming out of the Iowa caucuses. But he trails Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders by large margins, leading many Democrats to question his viability in the state, and also nationally.\nThe campaign has been struggling to raise money in a field that includes the well-funded Clinton and Sanders campaigns. It raised just under $1.3 million in the third quarter while spending $1.8 million \u2014 and it was carrying over $20,000 in debt by the beginning of October.\nThe move to shift resources comes shortly after a debate performance that was widely seen as O\u2019Malley\u2019s best so far. He recently abandoned his reluctance to attack Clinton and Sanders, earning him more headlines and attention.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "O&apos;Malley campaign shifts staff from headquarters", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/martin-omalley-democrats-2016-215951", "topics": ["trade", "foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Jim Obergefell", "Bernie Becker", "Kate Tummarello", "Henry C.
