We spent months trying to find a way into Europe, and by Allah\u2019s strength, we succeeded in finally making our way to Belgium,\" Abaaoud said in the article. \"We were then able to obtain weapons and set up a safe house while we planned to carry out operations against the crusaders.\"\nThe interview came weeks after a raid in Verviers, Belgium, failed to capture Abaaoud after dismantling the terror cell after searches in Molenbeek, a downscale district of Brussels where authorities are currently searching for the eighth suspect from last week's attacks.\nNone of those arrested during the raid had been his accomplices, he said.\n\"The intelligence knew me from before as I had been previously imprisoned by them,\" Abaaoud said. \"After the raid on the safe house, they figured out that I had been with the brothers and that we had been planning operations together. So they gathered intelligence agents from all over the world \u2013 from Europe and America \u2013 in order to detain me. They arrested Muslims in Greece, Spain, France, and Belgium in order to apprehend me.\"\nAbaaoud is also suspected of being linked to the foiled August train shooting, also in France.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Alleged Paris attacks mastermind boasted of planned &apos;operations&apos; in February", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/paris-attack-mastermind-february-215918", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Bryan Bender", "Theodore Roosevelt", "Natasha Korecki", "Marc Caputo", "Ted Cruz", "Laurens Cerulus", "Kristen East", "Theodoric Meyer", "Pierre Briancon", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Andrew Restuccia", "Katie Glueck", "Nick Gass", "Alex Isenstadt", "Seung Min Kim", "Richard Nixon", "Andrew Glass", "Jeremy Herb", "Michael Crowley", "Marco Rubio", "Jake Sherman", "Glenn Thrush", "Ben Schreckinger", "Jeff Gerth", "Nicholas Vinocur", "Barack Obama", "Shane Goldmacher", "Hadas Gold"], "orgs": ["Washington And The World", "Photo Gallery", "Congress", "DNC", "J.M.", "ISIL", "GOP"], "election_confidence": 0.7096973544236799, "authors": [{"author_id": 30728, "fullname": "nick gass", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-16 12:31:01", "org": "politico", "article_id": "be32d9b1697169ed18714a8532251a92", "date_access": "2015-11-16 12:41:17.542915"}
