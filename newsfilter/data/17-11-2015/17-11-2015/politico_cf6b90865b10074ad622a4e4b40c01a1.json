Yet that's exactly what he's getting in the wake of the Paris attacks, a shift that's turned the primary contest \u2014 temporarily at least \u2014 into a test for commander-in-chief. \nFor the Vermont senator, it's already proving discomfiting as he faces off against an already-dominating front-runner on terrain that's familiar to her as a former secretary of state.\nStory Continued Below\nAs Clinton works to remind Democratic voters of her experience \u2014 \u201cI spent a lot of time in the Situation Room as secretary of state and there were many very difficult choices presented to us,\u201d she said on the Des Moines debate stage on Saturday \u2014 Sanders suddenly finds himself forced to deviate from the stump speech he\u2019s effectively been honing for decades. His once-soaring campaign, until recently firmly welded to a focus on domestic policy and income inequality, is now reliant on a work-in-progress argument that leans further into his criticism of Clinton\u2019s 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq War.\nThere's a sense of urgency to Sanders' task of proving he belongs in the national security discussion, said Democratic operative Chris Kofinis, who ran a focus group of 33 undecided Iowa Democratic caucus-goers during the debate. That group unanimously decided that Clinton would be a stronger commander-in-chief after the forum, and Kofinis found that her message on terrorism resonated particularly strongly with the Iowans.\n\u201cIt was pretty overwhelmingly clear. Not surprising given her experience as secretary of state, but two weeks ago the issue of terrorism wasn\u2019t at the forefront of the Democratic debate. Now it \u2014 at least for the time being \u2014 definitely is at the front,\u201d Kofinis explained on Monday. \u201cSanders had an electability issue going into this debate. I\u2019ve done four groups now in Iowa, and every group says the same thing: we love his message but we\u2019re not sure it\u2019s electable. He needs to address that head on, and that\u2019s now even more difficult because he has to do that as well as address the commander-in-chief question.\"\n\n2016\n\n            By \nEli Stokols\n\n\u201cWhen these kinds of drastic international events happen, they usually change the dynamic of the race, and you either react to it or you don\u2019t. The perception is that he hasn\u2019t, and he has to,\u201d Kofinis added.\nSanders has yet to schedule \u2014 or even write \u2014 the military policy speech that his top strategist, Tad Devine, has long urged him to deliver. He only has one public rally scheduled for this week \u2014 today in Cleveland. It's a reflection of doubts within the campaign, say those familiar with its thinking, that the issue of responding to the attacks will drive voters\u2019 thinking for more than a few days.\nNonetheless, Devine and other top aides expect Sanders to start making his argument shortly.\nFirst, he will more forcefully frame Clinton\u2019s Iraq vote as a question of basic judgment: \u201cArguably the most important foreign policy decision in the last 30 years,\" said Devine.\nSanders will also elaborate on his hope to build a new coalition against ISIS, continuing a discussion he began \u2014 though without offering specifics \u2014 at a rally in Indianola, Iowa, on Sunday night.\n\u201cWe have a different point of view, but Russia has got to join us,\u201d he said the evening after the debate, in the midst of a sprawling speech that focused primarily on the middle class issues he\u2019s accustomed to addressing. \u201cWe are concerned about Iran, but Iran has to join us. We have concerns about Saudi Arabia, but Saudi Arabia has to join us. If all over the world these attacks are taking place, the world has got to come together.\"\nThe senator, who often votes against increasing funding for the Defense Department, will argue that the country should shoulder less of the burden in responding to \u2014 and paying for \u2014 international crises.\nIf Sanders makes this account central to his appearances in the coming days, it will represent a dramatic departure for a lawmaker whose foreign policy work in the Senate is largely limited to his membership in the Veterans\u2019 Affairs committee. That background hasn't been a hindrance in a race that mostly centered on economic issues, as evidenced by the recent exits of both of the internationally-focused candidates pursuing the Democratic nomination \u2014 Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee. \n\n\n\n            By \nDaniel Strauss\n\nInstead, the candidates have mostly sparred over Wall Street regulation, environmental policy, and immigration. As a result, their Saturday debate opened a new window into their thinking. \nSanders traveled to Des Moines with Senate staffers who\u2019ve been briefing him on foreign policy, but after his opening statement veered away from the Paris attacks and toward the \u201crigged economy\u201d \u2014 a stark contrast to Clinton and Martin O'Malley, who stuck to responding to the attacks \u2014 Sanders immediately faced new scrutiny.\nThose questions about his preparation to be commander in chief were compounded before long, when Sanders told moderator John Dickerson that he stood by his claim that climate change is the greatest threat to national security \u2014 a position far out of sync with the polls.\n\u201cClimate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism,\u201d insisted the Vermonter, before his campaign circulated a fact-sheet backing up his claim that the military agrees with his assessment. \u201cAnd if we do not get our act together and listen to what scientists say, you\u2019re going to see countries all over the world \u2014 this is what the CIA says \u2014 they\u2019re going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops, and you\u2019re going to see all kinds of international conflict.\"\nWhile he recovered in time to engage Clinton and O\u2019Malley in a spirited debate over the country\u2019s role in the Middle East, the exchanges highlighted his difficulties convincing voters of his viability for the job: a pre-debate November CBS/New York Times poll showed that 53 percent of Democratic primary voters were \u201cvery confident\u201d in Clinton\u2019s \u201cability to handle an international crisis,\u201d compared to just 16 percent for Sanders.\nNonetheless, his team remains wedded to the strategy of using the sudden focus on foreign policy as an opportunity to underscore Clinton\u2019s past errors, rather than his own grand plan for the Middle East.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she in any way distinguished herself on foreign policy during the debate. She was secretary of state at the time ISIL emerged, so she was on defense,\u201d said a high-level Sanders aide, previewing a further line of discussion from his candidate. \u201cShe does know a lot of names and places and inside facts, but other than that she didn\u2019t distinguish herself.\"\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The Vermont senator suddenly finds himself forced to deviate from an economic message he's been honing for decades.", "title": "Sanders knocked off stride by foreign policy focus", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/bernie-sanders-foreign-policy-paris-215937", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Jim Obergefell", "Bernie Becker", "Kate Tummarello", "Henry C.
