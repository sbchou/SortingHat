Vogel\n\n11/16/15 09:34 PM EST\nThe Clinton Foundation filed three years of revised tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service on Monday, correcting errors which came to light as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign led to increased scrutiny of the charity founded by her husband, President Bill Clinton.\nClinton Foundation CEO Donna Shalala said press reports about the foundation's failure to correctly report government grants from 2010 to 2012 led the organization to conduct a thorough review involving lawyers and accountants, who found other errors. Still, she called the refiling voluntary.\nStory Continued Below\n\"Although the exhaustive review found several additional errors, our external tax reviewers informed us that the errors did not require us to amend our returns; There is no change in our bottom line numbers: assets, liabilities, and net assets; and we do not owe any taxes,\" Shalala wrote in a letter posted on the foundation's website. \n\"Our reviewers advised us the Foundation has no legal obligation to file amended returns, but that if we did file an amended return it would be important for us to correct errors found in the review.\"\nA Clinton Foundation spinoff , the Clinton Health Access Initiative, also filed at least two years of corrected returns. Amended returns for 2012 and 2013 were posted on the health-focused organization's website Monday night. \n\n\n\n            By \nLauren French\n\n\"The refiling of documents was completed in the name of greater transparency and has no impact on the bottom line,\" the Clinton Health Access Initiative said in a statement.\nA Reuters report in April noted that the Clinton Foundation's Forms 990 from 2010 through 2012 recorded zero income on a line to report government grants. Foundation officials said the payments had been inadvertently lumped in with other contributions.\nThe Clinton Foundation said the review of its tax returns was conducted by a former Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's Tax Division , Kathy Keneally, now the chair of tax litigation at DLA Piper. Keneally selected accounting firm CohnReznick to oversee the re-evaluation of the numbers, the foundation said.\n\nKenneth P.
