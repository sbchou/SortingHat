And maybe we'll put together a coalition that can for once attack this horrific terrorist element before they have ability to carry out another coordinated attack like this,\u201d North Carolina GOP Rep. Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\nHolland is scheduled to address the French Parliament on Monday, during which he could lay out his plan.\nHe said\u00a0after the attacks in and around Paris on Friday night that France \u201cwill be merciless toward the barbarians of the Islamic State group,\u201d which has claimed responsibility for the killings.\n\nWhite House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said Sunday that the United States would back France calling for Article 5.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a decision for the French to make,\u201d he told NBC. \u201cWhat we've made clear to the French is we will be shoulder to shoulder with them in this response.\u201d\nArticle 5 has been used only once, after the 9-11 terror attacks on the United States, according to NATO.\nRepublican presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio also suggest using the measure.\n\u201cThis is clearly an act of war and an attack on one of our NATO allies,\u201d the Florida lawmaker said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\nFellow GOP candidate Jeb Bush told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that France is \u201cour longest and strongest and most loyal ally\u201d but said the United States should only consider a request to use Article 5.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Martin O\u2019Malley during Saturday night\u2019s debate said the U.S. should take the lead in stopping the Islamic State.\n\u201cThis actually is America\u2019s fight,\u201d said O\u2019Malley, a former Maryland governor.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "Republican lawmakers suggested Sunday that France use NATO powers to retaliate against the Islamic State group that killed at least 129 people during a weekend terror attack that French President Francois Hollande has called \u201can act of war.\u201d", "title": "Republican lawmakers urge France to use NATO powers to help in fight against ISIS", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/LTDb7hPo1wE/", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Marco Rubio", "Jeb Bush", "Richard Burr", "Martin O'Malley", "Francois Hollande"], "orgs": ["Senate Intelligence Committee", "North Atlantic Treaty Organization", "NATO", "GOP"], "election_confidence": 0.5194721719496712, "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-11-15 21:02:04", "org": "fox", "article_id": "130216f5776fb32d382824cd18b4abc3", "date_access": "2015-11-16 08:00:13.871923"}
