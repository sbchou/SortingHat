But he was also addressing the legacy of the man he replaced, George W. Bush, who channeled Americans' pain over the 9/11 attacks into a war against a different enemy, Iraq. \nObama ran for president promising to be the anti-Bush on national security \u2013 less autocratic, more sensitive to global opinion, and more careful with his words. As president, he may have preserved some of Bush\u2019s strong-armed tactics in fighting terrorism, but rhetorically, he\u2019s fulfilled his promise of restraint.\nStill, until now, he hasn\u2019t had an occasion to buck up the country in the face of fear and shock over terrorism. And his cautious words on Paris, while consistent with past statements, left some people feeling unsoothed.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s an emotionally distant person, at least in terms of rhetoric, and he likes to lecture people,\" said Pete Wehner, a speechwriter for former President George W. Bush. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to calm anybody down. That\u2019s going deepen the divisions that exist in the country.\u201d \n\n\n\n            By \nNahal Toosi\n\nWehner pointed to Bush\u2019s speech at Washington National Cathedral just nine days after the Sept. 11 attacks as a better model for expressing national grief.\n\u201cOur grief has turned to anger, and anger to resolution. Whether we bring our enemies to justice, or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done,\u201d Bush said. A few minutes later, Bush described \u201cour war on terror,\u201d one that begins with al Qaeda but \u201cdoes not end there.\u201d \nAs it happened, the war on terror didn't end there. And that\u2019s the point for Obama, who has said that ISIL grew out of the chaotic aftermath of the Iraq invasion.\nIn Turkey, Obama batted away suggestions that he needs to change his strategy against ISIL with a weariness that seemed driven by more than just jetlag. He insisted that it's just not possible to \u201ctake out these bastards,\u201d as one reporter put it. And anyway, anger isn\u2019t going to finish off ISIL -- that\u2019s going to take a complex combination of diplomacy to end the civil war, intelligence to stop the flow of foreign fighters, and yes, some military action.\n\"If folks want to pop off and have opinions about what they think they would do, present a specific plan,\" Obama said. \"If they think that somehow their advisers are better than the Chairman of my Joint Chiefs of Staff and the folks who are actually on the ground, I want to meet them.\"\nIt's not that he offered no emotion. Obama talked about meeting wounded warriors at Walter Reed, \"a 25-year-old kid who\u2019s paralyzed or has lost his limbs\" that he had to send into battle. \n\"So I can\u2019t afford to play some of the political games that others may,\" Obama said.\nConservative candidates and commentators pounced on Obama for deriding \u201csome notion of American leadership or America winning, or whatever other slogans they come up with that has no relationship to what is actually going to work to protect the American people.\u201d \nObama said he's \"too busy for that.\u201d\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\n\"It enrages me,\" GOP hopeful Carly Fiorina told right-leaning talk radio host Hugh Hewitt on Monday afternoon. \"Let me just contrast it: What did [French] President [Francois] Hollande say? What he said was we will wage a war that is 'pitiless.' That is the appropriate response,\" she added.\nObama reserved his most passionate \u2013 one might say angry \u2013 words for those who\u2019ve called for imposing religious curbs on Syrian refugees.\n\u201cWhen I hear folks say that, well, maybe we should just admit the Christians but not the Muslims; when I hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which a person who\u2019s fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted, when some of those folks themselves come from families who benefited from protection when they were fleeing political persecution -- that\u2019s shameful,\u201d Obama said. \nThe president didn\u2019t namecheck Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has called for only letting in Christians, or Sen. Marco Rubio, who has said no Syrian refugees at all should be allowed into the U.S. following the attacks. But his reference to the presidential candidates and sons of Cuban immigrants was lost on no one. Jeb Bush has also urged prioritizing Christians who face persecution in Syria.\nObama did, however, namecheck the 43rd president, praising him at the end of the press conference. No matter how misguided his invasion, Obama said, Bush didn't turn it into a religious war. \n\u201cI had a lot of disagreements with George W. Bush on policy,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut I was very proud after 9/11 when he was adamant and clear about the fact that this is not a war on Islam.\u201d\n\nSarah Wheaton is a White House reporter for Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The president angrily defends his rhetorical restraint on the Paris terrorist attacks.", "title": "Obama is still the anti-Bush", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/barack-obama-paris-attacks-response-215947", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Jim Obergefell", "Bernie Becker", "Kate Tummarello", "Henry C.
