Clinton said her close relationship with the financial sector grew out of her work to help them rebuild after 9/11. \u201cIt was good for the economy,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.\u201d  So, by that logic, her huge personal and political buckraking was kind of a rebuke to the terrorists, itself. Her status as a Wall St. favorite certainly predates 9/11, but she suggested that the relationship she forged in those dark days spurred an even greater outpouring of support and gratitude in the form of checks.  Now, this says a great deal about Clinton\u2019s meagre gifts as a politician. But it also tells you something about where her party\u2019s priorities are.  Invoking 9/11 is something that ought to be done only when relevant, which Clinton\u2019s was not, and only when facing oblivion. In that case, Clinton was right. Her exposure on the issue of banker nuzzling is much higher in the Democratic primary than the issue of Islamist terrorism.  Republicans today can talk of little else than national security, Paris, refugees and ISIS. But Democrats, even a day after the attacks, were seemingly eager to get off the subjects. The campaign of also-ran Sen. Bernie Sanders was proud to have fought to have limited the amount of the discussion that would involve national security.  Woof.  But Sanders is probably right. There\u2019s not a lot of sense in debating the issue among Democrats since they are in substantial agreement with President Obama. While both Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley tried to look for ways to draw decorous differences with Obama, they are in tune with his larger strategy of containing ISIS and waiting for the aspiring caliphate to die of asphyxiation or, perhaps, boredom.  Clinton has some differences of opinion with Obama, but she isn\u2019t free to discuss them. Not only would she risk backlash from liberals and raise Obama\u2019s ire, but, as moderator John Dickerson ably pointed out, the last foreign intervention Clinton encouraged, the regime change plan for Libya, is a thoroughgoing disaster.  So even as Clinton should be moving beyond Obama\u2019s reach and into a no-contest Democratic nomination, he holds this power over her: If she gets too squirmy on his foreign policy, he will leave her to the foreign policy wolves on the right and left.  And on the issue that will dominate the coming week or more of the campaign \u2013 how many, if any Syrian refugees the U.S. should accept \u2013 Clinton will not be able to pioneer a position that might be attractive to voters. She will have to stand by Obama and say that she also thinks accepting tens of thousands of refugees from Syria is the right thing to do.  And you know the refugee issue is key to Obama. The only emotion beyond annoyance that he displayed in his first press conference after Paris was anger at Sen. Ted Cruz, who has suggested a religious test for the refugees in order to screen out Muslims, and Sen. Marco Rubio, who simply wants to stop the flow altogether.  WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026 It\u2019s no stretch to say that there wouldn\u2019t be an America as we know it without Gilbert du Motier, known and loved here as Marquis de Lafayette. How loved? On his return visit in 1824, some 80,000 citizens of the new republic came to greet him. And if you live east of the Mississippi, you probably live near someplace named for him.\u00a0 The love flowed from the fact that not only did the wealthy young nobleman provide financial support\u00a0and help bring the military might of the France to bear, but also because he added his flamboyant fighting spirit to a Continental force that suffered so much in its eight-year struggle against superpower Britain.  So let the good people of Mt. Vernon tell you about the dinner party that would lead to that remarkable trans-Atlantic friendship: \u201c[Lafayette] attended a dinner with the Duke of Gloucester, the younger brother of British King George III. The Duke complained about the American colonists who had risen up against British rule. He mocked their revolutionary beliefs in the equality of mankind and the right of the people to rule themselves. The Duke further explained how the colonists had organized the Continental Army under the leadership of General George Washington. Lafayette would always remember this dinner as the turning point of his life. \u2018My heart was enlisted,\u2019 he later confessed in his memoirs, \u2018and I thought only of joining my colors to those of the revolutionaries.\u2019\u201d  How many Americans today can say their hearts are enlisted with the current struggle of the people of France? Tens of millions, no doubt.  Got a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

But world events and Carson\u2019s arch-nemesis, Donald Trump, had other plans.  The inherent challenge in Carson\u2019s candidacy is how to translate the ocean of good feelings toward him in the GOP electorate into steadfast support. And for Carson, as with other outsider candidates, that tends to focus on national security issues.  Friday\u2019s Paris attacks shifted the subject matter of the 2016 race to inhospitable terrain for the former neurosurgeon. In his Sunday interview with Chris Wallace, Carson stumbled when asked how he would go about putting together a winning coalition. While Carson probably did himself well by joining Sen. Marco Rubio in calling for a moratorium on accepting Syrian refugees in the wake of the attacks, the overall effect of the discussion will deepen doubts about Carson\u2019s readiness.  And in the two days before the attack, Trump had made it his mission to sew as many doubts about Carson as possible. Trump\u2019s 95-minute tirade against Carson and other members of the GOP field won\u2019t help the polarizing billionaire broaden his base, but it did reinvigorate the same conversation about Carson\u2019s biography that he had seemingly laid to rest on the debate stage.  As we discussed before, Trump\u2019s attacks will harm him with the voters he needs most: evangelical Christians and women. But they will also mar Carson, too.  The obvious beneficiary here is Carly Fiorina, the outsider candidate who has made presidential preparation and foreign policy so much of her focus. With the catastrophic debate performance of John Kasich and the evaporation of Jeb Bush, Fiorina starts to make a more interesting pick as a dark-horse winner in New Hampshire.  1)\u00a0Ted Cruz; 2)\u00a0Marco Rubio; 3)\u00a0Carly Fiorina [+1]; 4)\u00a0Ben Carson [-1]; 5)\u00a0Donald Trump; 6)\u00a0Jeb Bush  On the radar - Rand Paul, Chris Christie Chris Christie, John Kasich, Mike Huckabee, Bobby Jindal and Rick Santorum  What would you say? - Give us your take on the 2016 Power Index we will share the best and brightest with the whole class.

Cruz was not in attendance as he was scheduled to campaign in South Carolina Monday. The Iowa Republican's support for Cruz follows a friendship the two have developed since Cruz entered the U.S. Senate in 2013\u2026King has attended many of Cruz's campaign stops in Iowa, including the first Iowa stop Cruz made\u00a0after officially announcing his run for president.

Fiorina said she was \u2018angry that just [Friday] morning, hours before the Paris attacks began and against all the evidence, President Obama declared ISIS \u2018contained\u2019 and took a victory lap.\u2019 \u2018They are not a JV team, Mr. President,\u2019 Fiorina said at the 2015 Sunshine Summit in Orlando, Fla. \u2018They are not contained. They are at our shores and their measure of victory is the body count.\u2019\u201d  [Fiorina is on the campaign trail in New Hampshire today.]  Carson lays out his one-year strategy on illegal immigration - AP:\u201cThe retired neurosurgeon said it could be done easily in a year and suggested prosecuting all first-time offenders, installing a double fence and using technology-driven surveillance to cut down sharply on the percentage of illegal crossings. Those in the U.S. without problems with their stay here would be given a six-month period to register and pay a tax penalty. They would have to pay taxes going forward by taking jobs as guest workers, but would not get citizenship and voting rights.\u201d  Trump Twitter feud over female fighter - Business Insider: \u201cReal-estate tycoon Donald Trump\u00a0went after\u00a0T-Mobile again Sunday evening after the mobile company's\u00a0CEO slammed him for mocking\u00a0UFC fighter Ronda Rousey. Earlier in the year, Trump praised Rousey as a great fighter, but she made it clear that she was no fan of the Republican presidential front-runner. So Trump noted with glee that Rousey suffered a massive upset in a Saturday-night fight. \u2018Glad to see that @RondaRousey lost her championship fight last night. Was soundly beaten - not a nice person!\u2019 Trump tweeted Sunday. T-Mobile CEO John Legere used the opportunity to bash Trump as bombastic.\u00a0\u2019Donald I dare you to get in ring with her and say that... In fact I would pay big $ to see it,\u2019 he wrote back. \u2018I wonder which intern will get blamed for this stupid tweet.\u2019\u201d  [Trump is slated to hold a rally today in Knoxville, Tenn.]  Jeb pitches war plan in S.C - Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush will talk about his military strategy \u2013 including his views on the response to the Islamist raid in Paris \u2013 today at The Citadel in Charleston, S.C. Bush previewed his talk in an interview with \u201cFOX & Friends\u201d today in which he called for a military buildup as well as taking in some Syrian refugees, with an emphasis on persecuted Christians subject to \u201cincredible screening.\u201d Bush also told CBS News that more U.S. ground forces would be needed in the region, but declined to speculate on specific numbers.  Huckabee heading to Iowa - Ahead of Friday\u2019s Family Leader forum in Des Moines, one of the key events for Iowa social conservatives, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is announcing today an eight-stop swing through the central part of the state starting Thursday.  MAZEL TOV, MONTANA Billings (Mont.) Gazette: \u201cDonna Healy jumped into action when she heard a El Al Airlines flight from Tel Aviv to Los Angeles made an unplanned stop in Billings. As a member of Congregation Beth Aaron, a Jewish community in Billings, Healy understands that many of the folks in Israel and aboard the flight keep a kosher diet. \u2026 \u201cYou just don\u2019t often get a planeload of Israelis in Billings, and we thought we should do what we could to make them comfortable, and kosher food is a part of that,\u201d Healy said. \u2026 A rabbi from Bozeman also made the trip to Billings and delivered a large quantity of food. Michael Eisenberg was one of the stranded travelers who benefited from the surprise meal. \u201cOnce the rabbis came, there was more than enough. Tons. People in Billings can eat bagels for a month,\u201d Eisenberg said.\u201d  Chris Stirewalt\u00a0is digital politics editor for Fox News. Want FOX News First in your inbox every day?
