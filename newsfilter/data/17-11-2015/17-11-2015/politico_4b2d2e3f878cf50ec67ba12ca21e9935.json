David Vitter discussed his 2007 prostitution scandal with new openness during a rowdy and contentious final debate of the Louisiana governor's race, while also facing \u2014 and dodging \u2014 the most specific question he\u2019s been publicly asked about his admitted misdeeds.\nThe 400-strong crowd packed a private high school here, with supporters of both candidates cheering, jeering, exclaiming, and applauding throughout the debate despite two warnings from the moderators to stay silent. \nStory Continued Below\nSome of the loudest outbursts came after a moderator asked Vitter specifically about the phone call made famous by the Democratic state Rep. John Bel Edwards\u2019 campaign\u2019s \u201cProstitutes over Patriots\u201d ad, questioning the specific purpose of the call. Edwards\u2019 campaign has alleged Vitter was talking to the famous \"D.C. madam\" instead of voting on a Senate resolution to honor troops who had perished in combat.\nVitter didn\u2019t answer the question, instead choosing to emphasize that the phone call took place 15 years ago and that he worked hard to earn forgiveness both from his family and from constituents in Louisiana. He blamed the media and his political opponents for keeping the issue alive.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry if that\u2019s not good enough for you,\u201d Vitter said. \u201cIt\u2019s good enough for [Vitter\u2019s wife] Wendy.\u201d\n\nWhite House \n\n            By \nSarah Wheaton\n\nAs Vitter answered, a supporters bellowed from the auditorium: \u201cGet over it!\u201d Another yelled: \u201cIt\u2019s good enough for us!\u201d\nDiscussing the issue at all is a remarkable turnabout for Vitter, who hasn\u2019t taken a question from reporters in the hallways of Senate for eight years. After a single press conference in 2007 where he admitted to a \u201cserious sin,\u201d the senator has steadfastly avoided the topic, even while easily winning reelection in 2010.\nBut in the past two debates and in recent television advertising, Vitter has been forced to bring up the scandal, casting himself as a fallen man who has found redemption with the help of his wife and family. It's a story that could resonate in a deeply religious state, but it only comes as Vitter, once considered the unstoppable favorite to be Louisiana's next governor, finds himself down by 10 percentage points or more in most public polling in the race against Edwards.\nEdwards\u2019 response was simultaneously gracious yet vicious, arguing it was appropriate to forgive Vitter but not to elect him governor.\n\u201cThe simple fact of the matter is, we are all obligated as Christians to forgive,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we have to forget.\u201d\nThe Democrat later took a more direct shot: \u201cHe surrendered his law license rather than face questions, not about a sin, but about a crime.\u201d\nIn a post-debate scrum, Vitter said his law license lapsed because he was no longer using it, not because he was afraid of facing questions.\n\u201cThat came out of left field,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I do mean left field.\u201d \n\n\n\n            By \nJake Sherman\n\nIn his closing statement, Vitter returned to the scandal, comparing his personal recovery from sin to a potential recovery for Louisiana as a state.\n\u201cFifteen years ago, I faced the darkest moment of my life when I had to face my children and tell them how badly I had failed my family,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they gave me in return was the best day in my lie when they and Wendy offered complete love and forgiveness.\u201d\n\u201cThat is the most powerful motivator I have for the rest of my life,\u201d he continued, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re in a low point in Louisiana. We can rise. We can go to great heights.\u201d\nTalking to reporters after the debate, Vitter said he was talking about the scandal because his failure and recovery were \u201cthe most important experience of my life.\u201d When reporters questioned if it was shift in strategy, Vitter waved them off.\n\u201cLook, I know my answer isn\u2019t going to satisfy y\u2019all,\u201d he said. \u201cBut quite frankly, you\u2019re the gotcha media and you\u2019re looking for headlines and you\u2019re looking to make a name for yourselves.\u201d\nThe answer also didn\u2019t satisfy Edwards.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that he\u2019s answered any of the relevant questions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is that he actually missed out on the performance of his duties. It wasn\u2019t just something that was between him and his wife.\u201d\nThe debate opened with the two candidates clashing on whether or not Louisiana should accept Syrian refugees, a topic Vitter has made the centerpiece of his campaign in recent days. Vitter accused Edwards of flip-flopping on the issue, arguing he had \u201cfour positions in forty-eight hours\u201d and would help Obama settle refugees.\n\n\n\n            By \nLauren French\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where he is,\u201d the Republican said. \u201cBut I know we can\u2019t trust where he\u2019ll end up.\u201d\nEdwards accused Vitter of lying about his position, saying he proposed a moratorium on refugee resettlement and simply wanted to have a \u201cconversation\u201d about the topic.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have a conversation,\u201d Vitter retorted. \u201cI want it to stop.\u201d\nThe two also repeated several of their earlier clashes, with Vitter accusing Edwards of backing tax hikes and questioning the Democrat\u2019s support for small businesses and opposition to abortion rights. Edwards responded to the latter with another character attack, noting the senator had backed a pro-abortion rights Republican, Rudy Giuliani, in the 2008 presidential race.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a hypocrite,\u201d Edwards said.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "A crowd of 400 packed a private high school, cheering and jeering the candidates throughout the debate.", "title": "Vitter defends self on prostitution scandal in final debate", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/louisiana-vitter-edwards-governor-215960", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Jim Obergefell", "Kenneth P.
