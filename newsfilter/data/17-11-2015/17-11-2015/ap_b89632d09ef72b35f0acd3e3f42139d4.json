(AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said he would cut down on illegal immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border by cutting all benefits that he says attracts illegal immigration.\nThe comments came during a press availability Sunday after he and his wife spent the day campaigning in southern Nevada. He spoke at an evangelical church service in Las Vegas and then at an afternoon rally in nearby Henderson.\nThe retired neurosurgeon said it could be done easily in a year and suggested prosecuting all first-time offenders, installing a double fence and using technology-driven surveillance to cut down sharply on the percentage of illegal crossings.\nThose in the U.S. without problems with their stay here would be given a six-month period to register and pay a tax penalty.
