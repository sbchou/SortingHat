The question for 2016 now turns on whether foreign policy fluency and the seasoning of elected office somehow morphs into an asset, a development which could dislodge the two outsiders who are currently perched comfortably atop the polls \u2013 Donald Trump and Ben Carson \u2013 and reorder the race.\nStory Continued Below\n\"It's one thing to have a protest vote,\" New York Republican Rep. Pete King, a member of the Homeland Security Committee and chairman of the subcommittee on counterterrorism and intelligence, told POLITICO. \"If anything good can come of this tragedy, I would hope it would steer the debate toward who can handle Al Qaeda and ISIS and away from sound bites.\"\nIt did on Sunday. As Speaker Paul Ryan ordered the flags at the U.S. Capitol lowered to half-staff to honor the 129 people killed in Paris, including one American student, Nohemi Gonzalez, the Republican presidential field was quizzed on U.S. refugee policy, no-fly zones in Syria, NATO's Article 5 and the use of military force abroad.\nJeb Bush, the former Florida governor, called for a declaration of war against the Islamic State. Sen. Marco Rubio said America was engaged in a \"clash of civilizations.\" But Carson struggled to articulate how exactly his foreign-policy vision would translate in the real world.\n\u201cWell obviously, extending, you know, our support to the French,\u201d he said Sunday on Fox News when asked what a President Carson\u2019s first steps would have been following the Paris terror attack. When host Chris Wallace pressed him three times on who he would call first to put together an international military coalition, Carson demurred three times before saying he would call \"all of the Arab states\" and \"all of our traditional allies.\"\n \"I don't want to leave anybody out,\" Carson said.\n\nWashington And The World\n\n            By \n                    J.M. Berger\n\nDonald Trump, who before the attack had said his ISIS policy would be to \"bomb the s--t out of them,\" was unusually absent, not just from the Sunday interview circuit but the discussion. He had spent the weekend shouting on Twitter in all-caps: \"When will President Obama issue the words RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM?\" \"He is just so bad! CHANGE.\" \"We need much tougher, much smarter leadership - and we need it NOW!\"\nThe violence in France comes at a time in the cycle when numerous 2016 operatives say voters are starting to shift from not just deciding who they like, but who they want to serve as president. Even before the attacks, for instance, a super PAC supporting John Kasich held a focus group in New Hampshire last week and reported that every attendee mentioned \"experience\u201d as important to them. \nIt was the first time that had happened, according to Matt David, a strategist for the Kasich super PAC.\nOn Sunday, Kasich, who has been almost alone in touting his congressional committee experience on the campaign trail, was rushing to get out all his specific prescriptions on Fox: arming the Kurds, putting in a no-fly zone, tying in the Saudis and Jordanians, coordinating intelligence better internationally. \n\"There\u2019s so many things we need to do and, frankly, we\u2019re behind the curve,\u201d Kasich said.\nBush, Kasich, Rubio and Sen. Lindsey Graham were among those who spoke fluently on foreign affairs on the Sunday shows.\n\"I have a plan. Please, for God's sake, wake up to the threats we face,\" Graham, whose poor polling caused him to be excluded from the last GOP debate, said on CNN. \"Hit them before they hit us. Fight them in their backyard, not our backyard.\" Among the most hawkish candidates in the field, Graham has called for sending 10,000 American troops to Iraq and Syria.\nBush spoke confidently about foreign affairs on both CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d and NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d But when NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd asked Bush if he thought Carson or Trump were ready to be commander in chief, he replied, \"I don't know. The words that I hear them speaking give me some concern.\"\n\n2016\n\n            By \nBen Schreckinger\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to know whether voters will more closely scrutinize foreign policy credentials in the wake of the Paris attacks \u2013 or if it will have any material effect at all. Steve Schmidt, a veteran GOP strategist and senior adviser to John McCain's 2008 campaign, predicted the current dynamic would remain unchanged so long as no one in the race \u2013 experienced or unexperienced -- was leveling with the American people about the true costs to quell the threats abroad.\n\"Simply asserting 'I will destroy ISIS' absent any honesty with the American people of what is required to do that is platitudes,\" Schmidt said. For voters, he said, \"There's no difference between an experienced politician offering platitudes and an inexperienced outsider offering platitudes.\"\n \u201cThe American people have been communicated to like children \u2013 by both parties \u2013 and with extreme dishonestly by the administration,\u201d Schmidt said.\nThe Paris attacks are reverberating on the Democratic side of the aisle, as well. \"This election is not only about electing a president,\" as Hillary Clinton said in her opening statement at Saturday's Democratic debate in Des Moines. \"It's also about choosing our next commander in chief.\"\nThroughout the weekend, Republicans trained their fire on Clinton for her refusal, along with President Obama, to label the attackers radical Islamists.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d Rubio said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\" \u201cThat would be like saying we weren\u2019t at war with Nazis because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but weren\u2019t violent themselves.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The Republican primary is shifting from a campaign for the presidency to a test for commander in chief.", "title": "GOP field takes new shape after Paris attacks", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/paris-attacks-2016-republicans-215913", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Chris Wallace", "Pete King", "Henry C.
