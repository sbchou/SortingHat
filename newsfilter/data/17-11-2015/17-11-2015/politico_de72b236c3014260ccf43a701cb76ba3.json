He is organized in every county in the first four voting states. And he has served up one strong debate performance after the next.\nNow, not three months from primary season, rivals concede they have begun to fear Ted Cruz has an increasingly clear path to the Republican nomination.\nStory Continued Below\n\"Anybody who thinks differently,\" said an operative with a rival 2016 campaign, \"is lying to you.\"\nThe 2016 field\u2019s reluctantly bullish outlook on Cruz marks a dramatic about-face for Republicans weighing the divisive senator\u2019s odds. For months, Cruz was considered a long-shot at best \u2013 a hardline conservative with a niche audience of angry evangelicals, mired in the middle of the polls and overshadowed anyway by Donald Trump. Allies of, and operatives on, campaigns as varied as Jeb Bush\u2019s and Mike Huckabee\u2019s dismissed the Texas senator\u2019s ability to court enough supporters to defeat a more mainstream Republican.\nNo longer.\nThe same Republican rivals who relegated Cruz to a second tier in discussions this summer now see this insurgent firebrand as the candidate who benefited most from Scott Walker\u2019s exit and the one who stands to gain should Donald Trump or Ben Carson decline. Indeed, Cruz is seen by most of his competition as one of the few likely to still be standing in March\n\"He's the longer-term threat,\u201d said Fergus Cullen, the former chair of the New Hampshire GOP and a Republican who does not support Cruz. \u201cI suspect once Trump goes down, people like me will have Cruz to deal with.\"\nDuring the bulk of the pre-primary season, Cruz languished in the polls behind Trump and Carson, two candidates who appealed to voters furious with Washington. This was the bloc Cruz had been expected to dominate. Deprived of oxygen, Cruz largely faded from the Republican presidential spotlight over the summer weeks. \nSaddled with a lower profile, Cruz focused on fundraising and building deep organizations. Instead of living in Iowa all of August, he embarked on a bus trip through the South, a move that surprised other Republicans at the time but allowed him to lay the groundwork for mounting a turnout operation across a region that will vote early this cycle, on March 1. Cruz, eyes on a delegate count, even developed infrastructure to compete in the primaries and caucuses in the U.S. territories, dispatching a representative to places as far-flung as Guam and American Samoa.\n\nDebate Night \n\n            By \nEli Stokols\n\nCruz also cleaned up as Walker broke down, said Tom Rath, a New Hampshire Republican who is aligned with Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Even though many of Walker's more high-profile endorsers and donors went to Marco Rubio, his departure opened up a slice of the conservative vote that is now more inclined toward Cruz. \nAll of this laid the groundwork for a strong autumn. Cruz ramped up his public activity in the early states, particularly in Iowa with a high-profile religious liberty rally, an event he replicated Saturday in South Carolina. He rolled out the endorsements he had been quietly seeking for months, and his poll numbers and his cash flow ticked up in tandem. When he offered a blistering critique of the media at the CNBC debate in Boulder, Colo. late last month, the tide turned.\n\u201cHe\u2019s done really well on the debate stage, raised a whole bunch of money, his campaign has done a good job organizing, and he does have these super PACs\u2014they don\u2019t seem very active, but at least they have money in the bank,\u201d said a source working for the rival campaign, referencing the cluster of super PACs backing Cruz that have amassed tens of millions of dollars. \nNow, Cruz enters a crucial week. The 2016 field will return to Iowa on Friday for another cattle-call, this one hosted by prominent Iowa social conservative Bob Vander Plaats, who will offer a coveted endorsement soon after. That endorsement could be pivotal for Cruz, who has worked for months to emerge as the consensus choice of evangelical conservatives. \nCarson represents Cruz\u2019s biggest obstacle to that end, but in Iowa, Cruz has already lined up a number of well-known conservative activists and is working toward engaging pastors on his behalf in all of the state\u2019s 99 counties. Vander Plaats, along with Iowa Rep. Steve King, are among the most sought-after conservative names in the state who are still up for grabs, and Cruz is thought to have a good chance with both of them. \n\nDebate Night \n\n            By \nHadas Gold\n\n\u201cHe spent much of the early season building organization in key states, and so there was some hit on him initially, that, \u2018He\u2019s not here enough, we don\u2019t see him enough,\u2019\u201d Vander Plaats said, discussing Cruz\u2019s strategy. \u201cWhat he was doing is putting up, nationally, an infrastructure to be successful long term. Add to that the cash on hand\u2026and the most recent debate performance. It seems more and more people are warming to a Ted Cruz candidacy.\u201d\nThe week will also bring new Cruz ads to the Iowa airwaves \u2013 some bought by one of his affiliated super PACs and others by the campaign itself. All of them will be used to reach the evangelicals who appear eager to reward a conservative outsider.\nCertainly, Cruz still lags Trump and Carson. But friends and foes alike say Cruz is the candidate best positioned to benefit should either of those poll-leaders stumble. He has refused to attack the candidates and in fact invited Trump to co-headline a rally opposing the Iran nuclear deal. Thanks to a reputation built by being a thorn in the side of GOP leadership, he has managed to create an image of a true outsider with an insider\u2019s understanding of policy.\n\"People are increasingly saying he has one of the better potential paths\" to the nomination, said a source from another rival campaign. \u201cThere's lots of people in D.C. who shudder at the prospect of Cruz being the nominee. He's ruffled so many feathers in town, there's a healthy dislike of him in the institutional operative class \u2026 He wears that as a badge of honor, and he should. It helps him project the outsider image even though he's a sitting U.S. senator.\" \nSince last week\u2019s Republican debate, GOP odds-makers are increasingly talking up the possibility of a Cruz-Rubio primary fight, a contest that would see two young Cuban-Americans running for the nomination of a party historically led by older white men. Indeed, this could be the outsider vs. insider, conservative vs. establishment face-off that so many on the right have been angling for.\n\n\n\n            By \nKatie Glueck\n\n\"They appear,\" said Doug Gross, an Iowa Republican who sees Cruz as unelectable, \"to be the two biggest talents in the party.\" \nIndeed, Cruz and Rubio are on a collision course. They argued last week over their records on immigration reform as Rubio\u2019s campaign sought to cast doubts on Cruz\u2019s conservative bona fides while Cruz dismissed Rubio's characterization of his position as \"laughingly, blazingly, on its face false.\u201d\nStill, as Republicans working for other candidates admit Cruz is gaining steam, rivals argue his nomination would give the White House to the Democrats.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he can win a general election. I think he would get beat really bad,\u201d said the first source from another campaign. \u201cBut I think he can win the nomination of the Republican Party.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Increasingly, the field sees a clear path for Cruz into March.", "title": "Rival campaigns starting to fear Ted Cruz", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/ted-cruz-republicans-2016-215903", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Fergus Cullen", "Henry C.
