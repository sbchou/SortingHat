Everyone scoffed, now they're attacking the oil.\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 16, 2015\n\nAfter being relatively quiet over the weekend, Trump hit the talk shows on Monday morning to speak about the attacks, saying the U.S. needs stronger intelligence and also linking the extent of carnage with what he views as excessive gun controls.\n\u201cHad there been some guys with a gun, there would have been a shootout and probably the primary people that would have got whacked would have been the killers,\" Trump said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\"You can\u2019t any tougher than Paris, and you can\u2019t get any tougher than France\u201d on gun control, he continued. \u201cThey just said, come here, boom, come here, boom\u2026shot these people at will.\"\nLindsey Graham, meanwhile, called on President Barack Obama to \"rally the world.\"\n\u201cI would encourage the president really to rally the world to marry up with the French, the Arabs,\" the South Carolina senator and Republican presidential candidate said in a joint interview from Atlanta with Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain. \"They have large armies. Let\u2019s use their armies in a strong way, integrate their forces in a regional army, get the French involved, any NATO nation that would like to help and come up with a ground component to supplement the air campaign going on the ground and destroy the caliphate at its headquarters, at its capital in Raqqa.\"\n\u201cThey\u2019re not the JV campaign, but they\u2019re certainly not 10 feet tall,\" Graham said. \"The worst possible solution is half measures.\"\nJeb Bush said that he would work on building a plan to vanquish the terror group in concert with regional allies. \"I would listen to the military commanders and build a strategy to defeat ISIS, not by ourselves but doing it with our allies in the Middle East and clearly with Europe,\" the former Florida governor told \"Fox and Friends\" on Monday morning.\nAs far as refugees, Bush said he would be compassionate as president but that ongoing screening is essential to ensuring that the wrong people do not enter the country.\n\u201cYeah, absolutely,\" he responded when asked if the U.S. should be profiling refugees who attempt to enter the country from Syria. \"That\u2019s what screening is. We should be profiling. Of course we should. This is Islamic terrorism. The Democrats have no clue about this or they just refuse to call it what it is. These are Islamic terrorists that are trying to take out our country and destroy Western civilization.\"\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Trump links Paris carnage to gun control", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/trump-paris-gun-control-215921", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Bryan Bender", "Theodore Roosevelt", "Natasha Korecki", "Marc Caputo", "Ted Cruz", "Laurens Cerulus", "Kristen East", "Theodoric Meyer", "Pierre Briancon", "Donald J.
