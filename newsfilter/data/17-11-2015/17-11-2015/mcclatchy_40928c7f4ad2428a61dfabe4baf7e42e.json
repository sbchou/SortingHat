{"body": " Mitt Romney\u2019s not running for president in 2016 \u2013 he made that clear again Monday \u2013 but if he were in the White House, he\u2019d deploy \u201cwhatever resources\u201d are needed to defeat the Islamic State.\nRomney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, reiterated his decision not to run again, after speculation last week in The Washington post that some party officials would not mind another bid. He was speaking on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d Show.\n\"I'm not running, I'm not planning on running,\" he told interviewer Savannah Guthrie. \"I'm very much engaged in the political battles but I'm doing it as a supporter of Republicans out of conservatism rather than an active candidate.\" \nHe wouldn\u2019t say who he would prefer get the GOP nomination, only that he saw perhaps two or three who could win the general election. And, he said, \u201cI think those people will have the experience necessary to lead our country at a very, very important time both domestically and internationally.\"\nRomney has been speaking out about President Barack Obama\u2019s efforts to thwart the Islamic State, calling it a cancer. He expressed that view in a Washington Post op-ed Sunday.\n\u201cWe must wage the war to defeat the enemy, not merely to harass it. For over a year, the president has clung to the hope that an air campaign is sufficient. It demonstrably is not,\u201d he added.\nThat could mean a variety of tactics.\n\u201cOnly America can lead this war, and that leadership means being willing to devote whatever resources are required to win \u2013 even boots on the ground,\" he said. \u201cWe have the best-equipped and most dedicated military for good reason. The president must stop trying to placate his political base by saying what he won't do and tell Americans what he will do.\" \nDavid Lightman: 202-383-6101, @lightmandavid", "byline": "", "description": "\u2018I\u2019m not running,\u2019 he tells \u2018Today\u2019\nSays boots on ground is a possibility\nMust defeat the enemy, not just harass it, he says\n\u2026\nClick to Continue \u00bb", "title": "Romney, out of \u201816 race, criticizes Obama on Islamic State", "url": "http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article45067551.html", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["David Lightman", "Barack Obama", "Mitt Romney", "Savannah Guthrie"], "orgs": ["GOP"], "election_confidence": 0.6625279801801833, "authors": [{"author_id": 33909, "fullname": "david lightman", "primary_org": "mcclatchy"}], "date_written": "2015-11-16 16:54:30", "org": "mcclatchy", "article_id": "40928c7f4ad2428a61dfabe4baf7e42e", "date_access": "2015-11-16 17:00:43.717625"}
