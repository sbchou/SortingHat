They need just a majority of votes to pass the legislation, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and his team are being squeezed between moderates balking at the Planned Parenthood language and a trio of conservatives that say the Obamacare repeal language doesn\u2019t go far enough.\nStory Continued Below\n \u201cWe\u2019re looking at all options. It\u2019s about 51,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) after a closed-door leadership meeting on Monday night. \u201c[When] we get a clear idea from the parliamentarian what\u2019s a go, and what\u2019s a no go, we\u2019ll start rounding up the vote.\u201d\nThe 54-member Republican majority got its first ruling from the parliamentarian last week, which found that the Planned Parenthood language withstood scrutiny but repeal of the individual and business mandates as passed by the House would need to be rewritten. The parliamentarian's ruling is being kept closely by both parties, though Democrats say the GOP\u2019s hopes of easy passage of Obamacare have been doomed.\nRepublicans say that's not the case and are confident they will eventually prevail, but they admit work remains. They\u2019d originally been aiming to pass reconciliation this month, but they now plan to use next week\u2019s Thanksgiving recess to get the measure ready to pass the Senate and accrue 51 votes. \n\n\n\n            By \nSeung Min Kim\n            ,\nJake Sherman\n             and \nBurgess Everett\n\nWhat has not been decided is whether the proposal will turn into a straight-out attack on Obamacare and lose language stripping Planned Parenthood of funding. Senators said they could try a different legislative vehicle to force that fight should they back down on reconciliation to keep moderates on board.\n\u201cThe primary purpose of this bill is Obamacare repeal,\u201d said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 Senate Republican. \u201cWe need to make sure we get 51 votes to get Obamacare repealed. So if [Planned Parenthood] gets in the way of that at this point we\u2019ll have to take a look at it.\u201d\nGOP senators Mike Lee of Utah, Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas all oppose the reconciliation measure as currently written, leaving McConnell little room for error once the proposal passes muster with the parliamentarian. And even getting there is going to take major work.\n\n\n\n            By \nJake Sherman\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an iterative process. In other words she\u2019s not going to give us a blueprint,\u201d Cornyn said of the back-and-forth with Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough. \u201cShe gives us guidance and then we try to meet the guidance in order to try to eliminate problems.\u201d\nRepublican aides say the procedural issues involving the mandates can be easily solved with new language that would make the provisions comply with Senate rules, though they have yet to say publicly how that would be done.\nSeung Min Kim contributed to this report.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Republicans may remove a Planned Parenthood provision if that will help things along.", "title": "Senate GOP reassesses plan on Obamacare repeal", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/gop-obamacare-reconciliation-planned-parenthood-215953", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "trade"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Jim Obergefell", "Bernie Becker", "Kate Tummarello", "Henry C.
