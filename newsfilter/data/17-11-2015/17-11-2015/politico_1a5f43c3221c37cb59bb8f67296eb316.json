Purdum\n\nWith Republican presidential candidates racing to condemn President Barack Obama as a reluctant warrior inept to take on Islamic State, Jeb Bush is pouncing on an opportunity to offer up what other critics aren\u2019t \u2014 a plan. \nIt\u2019s not without risk. A call to aggressively marshal resources to take on a diffuse network of fighters in the Middle East could bring back echoes of his brother\u2019s prolonged engagements in Iraq and elsewhere. And Bush has proven himself at times inept at articulating the daylight between his foreign policy vision and that of the 43rd president. \nStory Continued Below\nBut the Bush campaign and its allies have made a calculation that in this Republican race driven by emotion and dominated by more compelling personalities, the former Florida governor has an opportunity to stand head and shoulders above his rivals as he speaks to Americans shaken by last week\u2019s deadly attacks in Paris. \n\u201cAs the problems get bigger and bigger, people are going to start looking at people who are competent and capable,\u201d said Ron Kaufman, a longtime GOP adviser to presidential campaigns who is backing Bush. \u201cIn the end, that\u2019s going to matter and it\u2019s going to be good for Jeb.\u201d \nBush plans to expand on his vision on Wednesday at the Citadel in South Carolina. His team has been working to reframe a speech initially focused on the need to restore cuts to the Pentagon\u2019s budget in the more immediate context of the Paris attacks and how to fight ISIL in the Middle East. \n\u201cWe should declare war, and harness all of the power that the United States can bring to bear, both diplomatic and military, of course, to be able to take out ISIS,\u201d Bush said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\" on Sunday, offering up his initial take on how the U.S. should respond to the carnage that took more than 130 lives and wounded scores more.\n\n\n\n            By \nEliza Collins\n             and \nNick Gass\n\nHe didn\u2019t stop there, ticking off specific strategic points. \u201cDeclare a no-fly zone over Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cDirectly arm the (Kurdish) Peshmerga forces in Iraq. Reengage with the Sunni tribal leaders. Embed with the Iraqi military. Be able to create safe zones in Syria. Garner the support of our European allies and the traditional Arab states.\u201d \nMany of those are ideas Bush first outlined in a speech last summer where he laid out his strategy for combating ISIL. But now people are actually focused on that subject. \n\u201cThis window is going to be fleeting. In a very populist election cycle, his campaign is based on being a calm, judicious, thoughtful guy,\u201d said Kori Schake, a fellow at the Hoover Institution who advised John McCain on foreign policy during his 2008 campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s not that often that circumstances align like three lemons on a slot machine and allow a candidate like Jeb Bush an opportunity to sell substance.\u201d \nIn the broader Republican field, Bush is hoping to find the sweet spot as by playing the experienced, steady hand in this commander-in-chief test\u2014positioning himself somewhere between the ardor of Donald Trump, who said he would consider shuttering mosques in the U.S., and the uncertainty of Ben Carson, who stated in last week\u2019s GOP debate that getting ISIL out of Iraq would be \u201cpretty easy\u201d and on Sunday couldn\u2019t identify an ally he would call first to work on addressing this crisis. \n\u201cAt this point, campaigns are looking for moments to meet, to demonstrate why their candidate\u2019s a leader and why they should be trusted not just to handle an issue but to lead a nation,\u201d said Bruce Haynes, a Republican strategist in Washington who's not backing a specific candidate. \u201cThis is an opportunity for Jeb Bush to distinguish himself not just with a strategy but as someone who understands what it means for America to lead in the current global environment.\u201d \n\n\n\n            By \nDaniel Strauss\n\nWhile some candidates are trying to push buttons on specific issues, from bombing campaigns to blocking Syrian refugees, Bush, in framing this as a governing issue, is trying to stand out by thinking and talking big and looking like a president. \u201cWhile it may seem counter-intuitive, it\u2019s not counter-intuitive for him to say what he believes is right,\u201d said Haynes. \u201cIn spite of how people might feel about the past and his brother, he\u2019s going to stand up and say, I\u2019m Jeb Bush, this is what I believe and what I think we should do and the chips will fall where they may\u2014and that\u2019s leadership.\u201d \nBush is hardly alone in calling for a no-fly zone in Syria; six other GOP rivals including Marco Rubio and likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton all agree with him. President Obama, however, dismissed that idea during a press conference at the G-20 in Turkey on Monday. \"It is determined that it would be counterproductive to take those steps,\" the president said. \nHe also has joined rival Ted Cruz in calling for special protection for the Christian Syrian refugees, while Obama condemned any sort of \"religious test\" that would unfairly leave Muslim refugees in peril. \nBut some of Bush\u2019s rhetoric appears to be merely that: He criticized the White House for failing to declare war\u2014even though national security Ben Rhodes has referred to the U.S. actions against ISIL as part of a war; and his assertion that Clinton believes \u201cthat it\u2019s not our fight\u201d based on her statement in Saturday night\u2019s debate that combating ISIL must also involve other allies and \u201ccannot be an American fight\u201d is somewhat of a stretch. \n\u201cOf course there\u2019s a rhetorical element to this. I think the American people want a president who\u2019s going to stand up and deliver a forceful rebuke of the terrorists who committed such atrocities,\u201d said Tim Miller, Bush\u2019s campaign spokesman. \u201cAn event like that requires a serious response. I think what you saw from the president and Hillary Clinton was a pretty tepid response given the gravity of the event.\u201d \nBush expressed openness to a ground assault to root out ISIL from Iraq and Syria during his appearance on \"Meet The Press\" Sunday, laying out an idealistic scenario reminiscent of what his brother\u2019s team foresaw heading into Iraq 12 years ago. \u201cWell, you take it to them in Syria and Iraq,\u201d Bush said. \u201cYou destroy ISIS. And then you build a coalition to replace this radical Islamic terrorist threat to our country and to Europe and to the region with something that is more peace loving.\u201d \nObama on Monday rebutted that argument, saying that a ground war doesn\u2019t make sense \u201cunless we're prepared to have a permanent occupation.\u201d Without \"local populations that are committed to inclusive governance and who are pushing back against ideological extremes,\" Obama argued, Islamists would eventually resurface. \"We would see a repetition of what we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d he said. \n\nFourth Estate\n\n            By \nJack Shafer\n\nWhile Democrats blame George W. Bush for destabilizing the Middle East to the point that ISIL could take hold, Bush and Republicans blame Obama and Clinton for withdrawing U.S. troops, which, they argue, created the void. The debate over how to proceed in the Middle East will continue to be a debate about how we got to this point\u2014and that\u2019s what makes the politics exceedingly complicated for the candidate named Bush. \n\u201cIf he looks like his brother, that\u2019s probably not going to be an electoral advantage for him,\u201d Schake said. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s coming up with a fully fledged strategy\u2014because he\u2019s going to be held to a different standard than everyone else.\u201d \nAnd as fraught as the politics are for Bush, the policy questions are exceedingly more complex in the view of most foreign policy experts. \u201cI firmly understand when you\u2019re running for president, it\u2019s very attractive to wrap yourself in the flag. But the notion that we\u2019re suddenly going to get this fixed by sending troops to fight ISIS, we\u2019re kidding ourselves,\u201d said Ian Bremmer, the president of The Eurasia Group. \u201cThe long-term support in the U.S. for what would be a long war of attrition that would put even more of a bulls eye on Americans just isn\u2019t there.\"\n\u201cWe do not do well with wars where we are nowhere near as committed to the outcome as those we\u2019re fighting,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf there\u2019s any lesson out there that Jeb Bush should have taken, you\u2019d think that would be the one.\u201d \n\nEli Stokols is a national politics reporter.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The former Florida governor is staking claim as the candidate most ready to take it to Islamic State.
