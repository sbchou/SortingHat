{"body": "\u201cBelieve it or not, I just defended President Obama to a gathering of foreign nationals,\u201d Ed Rogers, a Republican political consultant who writes for the Washington Post\u2019s Insiders blog, reported on Friday:\nRogers\u2019s post carries no time stamp but appears to have preceded Friday night\u2019s Islamic State attacks in Paris, as it makes no mention of them. The next day Breitbart.com noted a similar, post-Paris criticism coming by way of the left:\nClemons was at pains to note \u201cthat I have a different view of that, that that\u2019s not my view.\u201d Yet can anyone deny that the Obama administration\u2019s response to the Islamic State has been fatuous and incoherent?\nIn a January 2014 interview with the New Yorker\u2019s David Remnick, the president famously disparaged ISIS as \u201cthe jayvee team.\u201d He elaborated: \u201cI think there is a distinction between the capacity and reach of a bin Laden and a network that is actively planning major terrorist plots against the homeland versus jihadists who are engaged in various local power struggles and disputes, often sectarian.\u201d\nEight months later Islamic State terrorists were beheading American hostages, and Obama was talking tough. \u201cYou can\u2019t contain an organization that is running roughshod through that much territory, causing that much havoc, displacing that many people, killing that many innocents, enslaving that many women,\u201d he said during a press conference at a NATO summit in Wales. \u201cThe goal has to be to dismantle them.\u201d\nLater, he contradicted that: \u201cFrom the start, our goal has been first to contain and we have contained them,\u201d the Daily Caller quotes him telling ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos. In the same interview, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re gaining strength.\u201d\nOops. That interview aired on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d last Friday, just hours before the Paris attacks. \u201cIf this is what ISIS looked like contained, I shudder to think what ISIS looks like uncontained,\u201d CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper quipped Sunday while interviewing Ben Rhodes, Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser for strategic communications. The same day Stephanopoulos asked Rhodes to defend the president against Republican criticism. \u201cWell, look, George,\u201d he said, \u201cthe president was responding very specifically to the geographic expansion of ISIL in Iraq and Syria.\u201d\nRhodes went on to acknowledge \u201cthat there is a threat posed by ISIL .\u00a0.\u00a0. in their aspirations to project power overseas.\u201d You don\u2019t say. Of course in January 2014 Obama was dismissing the ISIS threat precisely on the ground that it wasn\u2019t, in his words, \u201ca network that is actively planning major terrorist plots against the homeland.\u201d\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll have to be nimble, George,\u201d Rhodes told Stephanapoulos Sunday. Good luck with that. Reuters reports that at a press conference today in Turkey, Obama declared: \u201cWe are going to continue the strategy that has the best chance of working. .\u00a0.\u00a0. There will be an intensification of the strategy that we put forward but the strategy that we put forward is the strategy that ultimately is going to work.\u201d\nIf anything, the inevitable Democratic presidential nominee inspires even less confidence. On Saturday night Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and an unidentified man met in an Iowa debate moderated by CBS\u2019s John Dickerson, who asked surprisingly good questions and got appallingly bad answers.\nDickerson began by quoting Obama\u2019s Friday remarks and asking Mrs. Clinton, who was secretary of state during the president\u2019s first term: \u201cWon\u2019t the legacy of this administration .\u00a0.\u00a0. be that it underestimated the threats from ISIS?\u201d She began with some generalities about the need for effective leadership, then made clear she would be reluctant to provide it:\nIf American troops are risking their lives in Iraq, what in the world does Mrs. Clinton mean when she says \u201cthis cannot be an American fight\u201d? Mrs. Clinton offered a clue when Dickerson pressed her on the administration\u2019s underestimation of the Islamic State:\nTry to follow that. The U.S. withdrawal from Iraq, which Obama touted as one of his great first-term accomplishments, turns out to have been forced upon him by George W. Bush. Everything would have been fine anyway except that the Iraqis screwed it up. But now it\u2019s up to the Iraqis to make things right, along with Assad, to overthrow whom Mrs. Clinton wanted \u201cto train and equip moderates.\u201d And who stopped her from carrying out that plan, George W. Bush?\nLater came this revealing exchange:\nGeorge W. Bush again? Mrs. Clinton relies awfully heavily on what we hereby name the argumentum ad dubyam. Though we should note that Bush tended to refer to \u201cterrorism\u201d; \u201cviolent extremism\u201d is an Obama administration euphemism.\nDickerson followed up by quoting a speech in which Mrs. Clinton emphasized the importance of knowing one\u2019s enemy. \u201cCan you explain what that means in the context of this kind of barbarism?\u201d The short answer was no: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult when you deal with ISIS and organizations like that whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious that it doesn\u2019t seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power.\u201d\nMrs. Clinton is quite right to emphasize that we\u2019re \u201cnot at war with Islam\u201d or \u201cwith all Muslims.\u201d Perhaps it even overstates the case to say we\u2019re at war with \u201cradical Islam.\u201d But it is an act of willful ignorance to deny that the enemy\u2019s ideology is Islamic, or even (as per Mrs. Clinton) that the enemy has an intelligible ideology at all.\nYet Mrs. Clinton isn\u2019t even consistent in her denial. It appears she doesn\u2019t know enough to be politically correct. Note that the exchange began with Dickerson quoting her describing ISIS as \u201cradical jihadists,\u201d a term she used earlier in the debate. What exactly does she think jihad is a pillar of? She might as well say she loves Christians but can\u2019t abide trinitarians.\nGiven all this, it\u2019s hard to deny that Ed Rogers\u2019s and Steve Clemons\u2019s foreign interlocutors had a point in faulting the U.S. for its lack of leadership. Then again, when the U.S. was leading, 12 to 14 years ago, one suspects they were not among those who eagerly followed.\nTwo Websites in One!\u2014I\nTwo Websites in One!\u2014II\nOther Than That, the Story Was Accurate   \u201cIn a story Nov. 14 about former faculty members recommending ways for the University of Missouri to address racial issues, The Associated Press reported erroneously that the Columbia campus\u2019 interim chancellor, Hank Foley, is black.
