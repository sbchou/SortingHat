{"body": " (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Hillary Rodham Clinton defended her long-running ties to the nation's finance industry on Monday, bringing out allies to argue that she would take a tough approach to regulating the industry despite receiving tens of millions in both personal and campaign cash from Wall Street in her career.\nFormer Rep. Barney Frank, a driving force behind the 2010 financial overhaul law that bears his name, said it was wrong to suggest that lawmakers who pushed for the reforms were influenced by campaign donations from the financial services industry.\nFrank said the bill was approved over the strenuous objections of Wall Street lobbyists and signed by President Barack Obama, whose 2008 campaign received large contributions from the industry.\n\"It's truly stupid, because if you look at the way things have worked, if you look at what Obama got in 2008 and what we then did, if you look at those of us who pushed through a bill over the greater objection of the financial industry, there's no argument there,\" said Frank, who was joined on a conference call set up by the Clinton campaign by Gary Gensler, the former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and now a Clinton campaign adviser.\nThe issue of Clinton's ties to Wall Street are getting a fresh look after last weekend's Democratic presidential debate. The former New York senator invoked the 9/11 attacks during the event to defend herself against suggestions by her main rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, that she is too cozy with Wall Street.\n\"We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country,\" she said.\nClinton's opponents in both parties jumped on that comment, which provoked immediate blowback on social media and a rebuke from The New York Times editorial board. Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said Monday it was \"outrageous\" to suggest she was trying to politicize the 9/11 attacks and people were trying to \"make political mischief\" with her remarks.\nClinton has received far more in contributions from the financial industry than Sanders, whose campaign has been fueled mostly by small donations from across the country. Clinton's campaign has raised about $7.3 million from the finance and insurance industry, according to Crowdpac.com, a nonpartisan political research company.\nThe industry also supported her husband, former President Bill Clinton, during his two White House campaigns and backed her campaigns to serve New York in the Senate.\nBut the campaigns of two of Clinton's would-be Republican challengers are taking in far more from Wall Street than her 2016 campaign. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has raised $22 million and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush $21 million from donors working in the finance and insurance industry, according to Crowdpac.\nAfter her time as secretary of state in Obama's first term, Clinton also received lucrative speaking fees from the industry. Her family's charitable organization, the Clinton Foundation, has also received financial support from Wall Street investment banks.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley has joined in Sanders' critique, saying in an interview with NBC on Monday the question was \"about whether or not Secretary Clinton has a coziness to Wall Street and would follow the ... dictates of those architects of the Wall Street crash and those who believe that big banks are just fine.\"\n\"And the truth is, that is how she feels,\" said O'Malley, the third major Democratic candidate seeking the White House. \"She should just admit it.\"\nBoth Sanders and O'Malley support reinstating the law known as Glass-Steagall, which once separated commercial and investment banks. It was repealed in 1999 when Bill Clinton was in office. Some financial watchdog groups have said the repeal was part of the financial deregulations that worsened the 2008 financial crisis.\nBut Clinton and her advisers argue that Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the failure of large financial institutions, such as investment bank Lehman Brothers and insurer AIG, during the Great Recession.\n\"The secretary is really looking for something that is broader and stronger than an 80-year-old law,\" Gensler said.\n___\nThomas reported from Dallas.

{"body": " (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The Paris attacks are rapidly weakening U.S. support for bringing in thousands more Syrian refugees, as pressure grows in Congress and the Republican presidential campaign to reverse course and governors once open to resettlement now try to shut their states' doors.\nPresident Barack Obama held firm to current plans on Monday, appealing to Americans to \"not close our hearts\" to Syria's victims of war and terrorism and denouncing calls from Republican candidates to favor Syrian Christians over Muslims in the refugee influx. His remarks, at a summit of world leaders in Turkey, seemed aimed at heading off a wave of anti-Muslim sentiment reminiscent of the 9/11 era, as much as keeping open the pathway for refugees.\nAmerica's vision of itself as a welcoming destination for the displaced was colliding with its recent memories of devastation caused by terrorists, all part of a quandary over what to do about the masses of people escaping the brutality of the Syrian conflict, perhaps with radicals in their midst.\nOn Monday:\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Republican lawmakers called for suspension of the Syrian refugee program and threatened to try to stop it in legislation that must pass by Dec. 11 to keep the government running. New House Speaker Paul Ryan neither endorsed nor ruled out that course.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Republican presidential candidates, already skeptical if not hostile to the refugee-welcoming plan before the attacks, stepped up their rhetoric against it. Donald Trump said the U.S. should increase surveillance of mosques, consider closing any of them tied to radicals and be prepared to suspend some civil liberties. He'd been among the first to warn that the refugee crisis could represent a \"Trojan horse\" with terrorists infiltrating the ranks of innocent refugees. Calls by GOP rivals Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush to give preference to Christian refugees from Syria prompted a sharp rebuke from Obama. \"Shameful,\" he said. \"We don't have a religious test for our compassion.\"\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered his state's refugee resettlement program not to accept any more Syrians, and more Republican governors announced or suggested they were suspending cooperation with Washington on the program, at least until they are assured the newcomers were being vetted effectively for security risks. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, also a presidential contender, issued an executive order intended to block Syrian refugees from being resettled in his state. None of the governors, though, has the authority to prevent refugees from moving into a state.\nAt the heart of the debate is the Obama administration's decision to raise the nation's annual limit of 70,000 refugees by 10,000, with most of the new slots for Syrians, in the budget year that started Oct. 1.\nThat potential Syrian influx pales in comparison with the masses coming to Europe and those being accepted elsewhere. Canada, with just more than one-tenth of the U.S. population, plans to take in 25,000 Syrians in the next few months.\nBut indications that at least one of the attackers who killed 129 people in Paris may have crossed into France with refugees have given critics of Obama's plan a footing to demand a cutoff.\n\"Until we can sort out the bad guys, we must not be foolish,\" Republican presidential contender Ben Carson said after a Nevada campaign swing Monday. And he said of Syrians already in the U.S: \"I would watch them very carefully.\"\nLike Trump and others in the GOP race, Carson was critical of the resettlement program before Paris came under assault. But the attacks were persuasive to some who had been more open to the idea or on the fence.\n\"It's not that we don't want to, it's that we can't,\" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said Sunday. In September, he'd been \"open to that\" if effective screening could be assured.\nBush, too, altered his tone, asserting the \"focus ought to be on the Christians who have no place in Syria anymore,\" because \"they're being beheaded, they're being executed by both sides.\" Before the attacks, he had spoken of moderate Muslims also being slaughtered in Syria, when arguing that the U.S. had a responsibility to protect them, as well.\nThe mood in Congress may be altering as well, although the issue was just taking shape. Ryan did not tip his hand on whether he would try to use House budget powers to counter an administration initiative that did not need congressional approval.\nRepublican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama was among those suggesting such a tack. Absent congressional action, he said, \"the United States will begin resettling tens of thousands of poorly vetted Syrian refugees who will eventually be able to bring in their relatives.\" Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, the House budget chairman, said the U.S. \"must suspend our refugee program until certainty is brought to the vetting process.\"\nRep. Adam Schiff of California, senior Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said security checks must be intensified, but \"even with the most thorough precautions, there is some risk associated with allowing refugees into the country. And this is why the current crisis is a test of our character.\"\nAs in Texas and Louisiana, Republican governors in Alabama and Arkansas spoke out against Syrian resettlement. Michigan Gov.

Greg Abbott ordered his state's refugee resettlement program not to accept any more Syrians, and some other Republican governors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including two GOP presidential contenders, John Kasich of Ohio and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana \u00e2\u0080\u0094 announced or suggested they were suspending cooperation with Washington on the program, at least until assured the newcomers were being vetted effectively for security risks.

Donald Trump said the U.S. should increase surveillance of mosques, consider closing any of them tied to radicals and be prepared to suspend some civil liberties. He'd been among the first to warn that the refugee crisis could represent a \"Trojan horse\" with terrorists infiltrating the ranks of innocent refugees.

Canada, with just more than one-tenth of the U.S. population, plans to take in 25,000 Syrians in the next few months.\nBut indications that at least one of the attackers who killed 129 people in Paris may have crossed into France with refugees have given critics of Obama's plan a footing to demand a cutoff.\n\"Until we can sort out the bad guys, we must not be foolish,\" Republican presidential contender Ben Carson said after a Nevada campaign swing Monday. And he said of Syrians already in the U.S., \"I would watch them very carefully.\"\nLike Trump and others in the GOP race, Carson was critical of the resettlement program before Paris came under assault. But the attacks were persuasive to some who had been more open to the idea or on the fence.\n\"It's not that we don't want to, it's that we can't,\" said one of them, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.\nBush, too, altered his tone, asserting the \"focus ought to be on the Christians who have no place in Syria anymore,\" because \"they're being beheaded, they're being executed by both sides.\" Before the attacks, he had spoken of moderate Muslims also being slaughtered in Syria, when arguing that the U.S. had a responsibility to protect them, as well.\nThe mood in Congress, too, may be shifting, although the issue was just taking shape. Ryan did not tip his hand on whether he would try to use House budget powers to counter an administration initiative that did not need congressional approval.\nAbsent congressional action, said Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, \"the United States will begin resettling tens of thousands of poorly vetted Syrian refugees who will eventually be able to bring in their relatives.\" Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, the House budget chairman, said the U.S. \"must suspend our refugee program until certainty is brought to the vetting process.\"\nAmong governors now balking at the program, Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, who had bucked many fellow Republican leaders by embracing the initiative, said he was suspending the welcome until federal officials reviewed security procedures and clearances.\nChristie, interviewed by conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, said, \"I would not permit them in.\" When asked whether that includes orphans under 5, he said, \"I don't think orphans under 5 are being \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you know \u00e2\u0080\u0094 should be admitted into the United States at this point.\"\nThat was a distinct change of tone from September, when Christie declared that Obama, through inaction, \"has allowed these folks to be slaughtered\" in Syria. \"I frankly can't imagine as president of the United States how you could permit this to happen on this scale,\" he said.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Alicia A.

{"body": " (CNN)Along with hundreds killed and wounded, the Paris attacks have had a multitude of indirect victims -- Syrian refugees seeking safety from war. They are now being shunned stronger than before over fears that terrorists could be mixed in with them.\nOn Sunday, authorities revealed that at least one of the Paris terrorists entered Europe among the current wave of Syrians. He had falsely identified himself as a Syrian named Ahmad al Muhammad and was allowed to enter Greece in early October.\nOver the weekend, a handful of U.S. governors either opposed taking in any Syrian refugees being relocated as part of a national program or asked that they be particularly scrutinized as potential security threats. \n\nAlabama Gov. Robert Bentley rejected the possibility of allowing Syrian refugees into his state, and connected refugees with potential terror threats.\n\"After full consideration of this weekend's attacks of terror on innocent citizens in Paris, I will oppose any attempt to relocate Syrian refugees to Alabama through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program,\" Bentley said Sunday in a statement.\n\"As your Governor, I will not stand complicit to a policy that places the citizens of Alabama in harm's way.\"\nThere is currently no credible threat against the state, the governor's office said. And no Syrian refugees have been relocated to Alabama so far.\n\nMichigan Gov. Rick Snyder was more conciliatory in his language, but still resisted receiving Syrian refugees. He said the state would \"put on hold our efforts to accept new refugees.\"\n\"Michigan is a welcoming state and we are proud of our rich history of immigration. But our first priority is protecting the safety of our residents,\" he said in a statement. \nSnyder demanded that the Department of Homeland Security review its security procedures for vetting refugees, but avoided blanket suspicion of people from any region.\n\"It's also important to remember that these attacks are the efforts of extremists and do not reflect the peaceful ways of people of Middle Eastern descent here and around the world,\" Snyder said. \n\nEven before Sunday's revelation, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal complained bitterly in an open letter to President Barack Obama. On Saturday, he said the federal government had not informed his government about refugees being relocated to his state last week.\n\"It is irresponsible and severely disconcerting to place individuals, who may have ties to ISIS, in a state without the state's knowledge or involvement,\" Jindal said.\nHe demanded to know more about the people being placed in Louisiana to avoid a repeat of the Paris attacks and wanted to know if screening would be intensified for refugees holding Syrian passports. \nAnd he suggested Obama hold off on taking in more refugees.\n\"It would be prudent to pause the process of refugees coming to the United States. Authorities need to investigate what happened in Europe before this problem comes to the United States,\" Jindal said.\n\nA White House official attempted to allay concerns about the vetting of Syrian refugees.\nOn Meet the Press, White House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said, \"We have very extensive screening procedures for all Syrian refugees who have come to the United States. There is a very careful vetting process that includes out intelligence community, our National Counter Terrorism Center, the Department of Homeland Security, so we can make sure that we are carefully screening anybody that comes to the United States.\" \nNew York Rep. Pete King, speaking on Fox News, cast doubt on Rhodes' comments.\n\"What he said about the vetting of the refugees is untrue. There is virtually no vetting cause there are no databases in Syria there are no government records.  We don't know who these people are.\" \n\nThe mood had already been turning against the millions of Syrian men, women and children driven into destitution by a war that has gone on for four and a half years.\nSome countries have told them to stay out. Hungary built a razor wire fence along its border, and neighboring countries have been following suit. And previously generous countries like Sweden and Germany that opened their arms to thousands were already pulling back.\nAnd in the United States, where candidates running in upcoming Presidential elections comment on most major issues, the Paris attacks had already triggered caustic opposition to President Barack Obama's plans to scale up the number of Syrian refugees allowed into the country to 10,000.\n\"We all have heart and we all want people taken care of, but with the problems our country has, to take in 250,000 -- some of whom are going to have problems, big problems -- is just insane. We have to be insane. Terrible,\" Donald Trump said at a rally in Beaumont, Texas.\nThen, on Sunday, came news about one of the Paris bombers carrying Syrian identification papers -- that were possibly forged -- and the fear of Syrian refugees grew worse.\n\"It's not that we don't want to -- it's that we can't,\" Marco Rubio told ABC's George Stephanopoulos. \" Because there's no way to background check someone that's coming from Syria.\" \n", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "After Paris attacks, Syrian refugees shunned", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/16/world/paris-attacks-syrian-refugees-backlash/index.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Pete King", "Robert Bentley", "George Stephanopoulos", "Donald Trump", "Rick Snyder", "Marco Rubio", "Barack Obama", "Bobby Jindal"], "orgs": ["Department of Homeland Security", "United States."], "election_confidence": 0.593438954749586, "authors": [{"author_id": 2358, "fullname": "ben brumfield", "primary_org": "cnn"}, {"author_id": 4944, "fullname": "joe sutton", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-11-16 06:19:49", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "94c4b66ad473d92149ab5c8348a8dd6c", "date_access": "2015-11-16 07:01:54.599316"},

{"body": " (CNN)ISIS might be the \"face of evil,\" but President Barack Obama is determined that it will not deprive him of his chosen place in history.\nObama made clear in a sometimes testy solo news conference in Turkey on Monday that not even the bloody ISIS rampage through Paris, which opened an alarming new chapter in the war on terror, will prompt him to abandon a pillar of his worldview: the insistence that America must avoid intractable Middle East land wars.\nBut sticking to his ideological guns in order to be a president who ends wars rather than starts them, and to prove that America can defend its interests without committing thousands of ground troops, risks having his legacy instead defined by violent events on the ground that critics can blame on an unwillingness to adapt to new realities.\nStill, if a shocked world hoped for personal mea culpas, bombastic vows of vengeance or a cathartic show of public emotion from the U.S. president, it was disappointed at his first major public appearance since the horror that blighted the City of Light.\nWhat it saw instead was a cold-eyed definition of American national interest, a pragmatic acknowledgment that not every attack will be stopped and an insistence by Obama that his strategy to combat ISIS is working despite evidence to the contrary.\nREAD: Obama: More ground troops to fight ISIS would be a mistake\n\"We are going to continue to pursue the strategy that has the best chance of working even though it does not offer the satisfaction, I guess, of a neat headline or an immediate resolution,\" Obama told reporters at the G20 summit of world leaders.\nAnd he warned, with an eye on Republicans back home, that it would be \"a mistake\" to put more boots on the ground to root out ISIS, appearing to reason that a large-scale ground force would soon face the same kind of quagmire U.S. soldiers endured for a decade in Iraq.\nIn effect, Obama was staking out a position against a deeper U.S. involvement in Syria's civil war -- whose chaos has allowed ISIS to thrive -- that he will try to defend for the waning 14 months of his presidency.\nObama's political opponents, meanwhile, will try to convince 2016 voters that not only did the President underestimate the group's deadly potential but that his negligence in pursuing a more aggressive strategy now poses a grave danger to national security.\n\nThe 61-minute session before the cameras Monday offered a glimpse of the entire Obama presidency in an instant, containing his musings on the nature of war, theories on the proper use of American military force, sharp political slaps at his opponents back home and insights into the commander in chief's own character. \nIt was one of the seminal moments of a presidency that has lurched from crisis to crisis, as under political siege, and before the eyes of the world, Obama stood alone on stage and made a case for a policy to combat a virulent new threat that few politicians and experts outside his administration believe is working.\n'As is typical of his polarized political era, Obama offered plenty to gratify his backers and to infuriate his critics.\nAn Obama supporter would have seen an intellectual statesman dispassionately dispensing common sense policy and acting according to history's timetable rather than with knee-jerk action or tough-guy rhetoric tailored to the modern media environment.\nAnd as he talked about visiting troops maimed on his watch, Obama hinted at the soul-searing decision a commander in chief must make and the limits of U.S. power in the post-Iraq age.\nBut those who see him as weak and lacking the public fortitude sometimes required of an American president would also have had their belief confirmed that Obama is stubbornly refusing to acknowledge that the world is in the grip of a new global terrorist insurgency that requires bolder action.\nAnd opponents who believe that Obama undermines the possibility for the use of limited but potentially effective force by painting all military action as equaling vast infantry deployments will also have seen little to ease their frustration.\nObama did describe ISIS as the \"face of evil\" and said that the \"barbaric terrorist organization\" needed to be destroyed. And he noted that flags were flying at half staff back home in recognition of the agony in France, America's oldest ally.\nBut his appearance could hardly be described as a rallying call for Western nations wondering who is next on the ISIS hit list. For a president who made his name with soaring rhetoric, his news conference was noticeably short on Churchillian statements of resolve or promises that the civilized world would triumph over this mortal danger.\nThat's partly owing to the president's personal style -- he has always been loath to indulge in what he sees as empty made-for-the-moment political gestures -- even though other U.S. commanders in chief have seen such behavior as a vital part of the presidency's theatrical tool kit.\nBut there's also a creeping frustration evident in the President these days. With his hair now snowy and his patience brittle in the twilight of his presidency, Obama's reserve of ideas to tackle a new threat seemed to be running dry.\nAnd he betrayed exasperation, lashing out at political enemies back home even from his elevated perch on the world stage. He was visibly irked by reporters' questions that all basically boiled down to: \"Mr. President, are your policies a disaster?\"\nThe press conference, part of a global tour by Obama that now takes him to Southeast Asia, comes at a time when the President's vehement refusal to embrace new U.S. entanglements in the Middle East is facing its most grueling test, from ISIS's burgeoning threat abroad to the shifting politics of the war on terror back home.\nBut Obama, who in 2009 inherited a nation weary of war and who brought most troops in Iraq and Afghanistan home, declaringthat the \"tide of war is receding,\" is adamant he won't change tack now despite a wave of criticism.\n\nHis 2012 election rival, Mitt Romney, on Monday warned that if Obama did not change course, the United States could be hit next. Another critic, GOP presidential candidate and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, predicted that \"there's a 9/11\" coming and joined with another vanquished Obama foe, Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, to demand a troop surge into Syria to drive ISIS out of the civil-war torn nation.\nEven front-running Democrat Hillary Clinton, who is hugging Obama close on the campaign trail, implicitly rebuked her old boss on Saturday by saying that more must be done to beat ISIS.\nBut Obama -- who once called ISIS a \"JV\" team and last week insisted it had been contained -- on Monday rejected perceptions that his approach was failing, given the recent attacks in Paris, Beirut, Iraq and on a Russian airliner all claimed by ISIS.\n\"We have a comprehensive strategy, using all the elements of our power: military, intelligence, economic, development and the strength of our communities,\" he said in Antalya.\nThe White House, meanwhile, points to recent victories on the ground in Syria attributed to Kurdish troops backed by U.S. air power as proof that the operation is chipping away at ISIS's self-declared caliphate spreading across Syria and Iraq.\nREAD: How terror in France could shape an election in America\nIn remarks that may appear to some in France as offhand, Obama argued that, \"the terrible events in Paris were obviously a terrible and sickening setback.\"\nBut he added: \"Even as we grieve with our French friends, however, we can't lose sight that there has been progress being made.\"\nTo Obama's critics, who believe ISIS has morphed from a regional threat into a ravenous extremist group now spreading its tentacles through Libya, Egypt, Pakistan, Afghanistan and elsewhere and which is pulling off mass-casualty attacks on Western cities, such remarks are nothing short of delusional.\nHis attitude appeared to contrast with the hawkish rhetoric of Francois Hollande, who on Monday made a rare address by a French president to a joint session of parliament, telling the body that France is now at war.\n\"He sees the world as he likes to see it, as fantasy,\" said Republican Presidential candidate Chris Christie over the weekend, joining a rising chorus of GOP candidates seeking to use the growth of ISIS for a political lift.\nNonpartisan observers also see a gulf between Obama's position and the widening reality of ISIS as a global threat. After all, the group has now carved out a training ground in Iraq and Syria far larger than that enjoyed by al Qaeda in Afghanistan before the September 11, 2001, attacks.\n\n\"Clearly, the strategy is not working because of the terrible terrorism we have seen in Paris, in Beirut, in Ankara,\" said CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank.\n\"Sure, they have shrunk the territory they control a little bit in Syria and Iraq. But this is a group now using those countries, a huge safe haven there, as a platform for International terrorism,\" he said, calculating that they were \"the richest terrorist group in history, tens of millions if not more in the bank\" with up to 6,000 European recruits coming in.\n\"I don't think this was the speech people in Paris today wanted to hear,\" he said.\nStill, the White House has long argued that a key lesson from the bloody U.S. occupation of Iraq is that American armies -- even those with hundreds of thousands of troops -- cannot hold together a Middle East region that is splintering apart.\nThe President has often told aides privately that the situation in Syria is so dire that no sudden policy change could make a tangible difference -- and the White House indignantly points out that U.S. planes have flown thousands of sorties over Syria and Iraq to combat ISIS.\nBut despite his ambivalence, Obama seemed to relish a chance in Turkey to lay into political rivals critical of his strategy, uttering some of his most impassioned lines in an implicit rebuke that they would find things a lot tougher from behind the Oval Office desk.\n\"What I do not do is to take actions either because it is going to work politically or it is going to somehow, in the abstract, make America look tough,\" Obama said.\n\"Some of them seem to think that if I were just more bellicose in expressing what we're doing, that that would make a difference,\" he said of his critics, an implied criticism of several GOP presidential candidates.\nBut the swift manner in which the Paris attacks have factored into a presidential race long dominated by the fireworks of real estate mogul Donald Trump and the challenge of \"outsider\" candidates is a reminder that political conditions may shift.\nCertainly, candidates like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is fighting for a foothold in a Republican primary process in which hawkish rhetoric sells, think so.\nBush told Fox News on Monday that for all his effort to avoid entanglements in the Middle East, Obama was actually driving America into a \"quagmire\" because he lacked a strategy to eliminate ISIS.\nIt was a taste of the kind of politics that might hike pressure on the President for a change of course in the coming months if public criticism of his policy intensifies. \nSo, despite his resolve to stick with his current ISIS strategy on Monday, the President elected to end wars may spend his final year in office fighting to head off another U.S. incursion into the Middle East. \n", "byline": "", "description": "ISIS might be the \"face of evil,\" but President Barack Obama is determined that it will not deprive him of his chosen place in history.", "title": "Obama unyielding on ISIS", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/16/politics/obama-isis-strategy-paris-attacks/index.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Mitt Romney", "Francois Hollande", "Lindsey Graham", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Donald Trump", "Chris Christie", "Barack Obama"], "orgs": ["al Qaeda", "GOP", "Oval Office"], "election_confidence": 0.7884307729946489, "authors": [{"author_id": 2324, "fullname": "stephen collinson", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 00:08:10", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "dd6d96b86413f3bfd490cf99557d4607", "date_access": "2015-11-17 01:00:05.160033"},

{"body": " (CNN)Republicans vying to replace President Barack Obama generally begin their comments on ISIS and Syria by criticizing the White House for \"leading from behind.\"\nThat's a given, but as the presidential race shifts from the economy to foreign policy, particularly on ISIS and Syria, Republican candidates may need more than calls for greater American leadership in order to stand out from a very crowded field.\nFew have outlined a strategy that goes much beyond what the administration is already doing. A multinational coalition led by the U.S. has launched 8,000 airstrikes against ISIS, leaders have been killed in drone strikes and officials from 19 countries, including Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia, the U.S. and Turkey met in Vienna to devise a strategy for ending the conflict in Syria. Rougly 3,500 U.S. troops are in Iraq their military and the Kurds and in Syria, the U.S. is providing weapons and supplies to groups fighting ISIS. \nHere is what GOP candidates say they would do to defeat ISIS: \nDonald Trump\nA bombing campaign is the basis of Trump's ISIS strategy. The real estate tycoon said before the Paris attacks that he knows more about ISIS than current military generals, who have largely derided his approach. \n\"I would just bomb those suckers,\" Trump said Thursday in Iowa before the Paris attack. \"That's right. I'd blow up the pipes, I'd blow up the refineries, every single inch, there would be nothing left.\" \nOn Twitter, he took credit for an American air raid on trucks used to smuggle oil in eastern Syria. \"Remember, I was the one who said attack the oil (ISIS source of wealth) a long time ago. Everyone scoffed, now they're attacking the oil.\" 6\nHe has advocated for ground troops in Iraq, but not in Syria. \nBen Carson\nCarson has also said that troops on the ground -- in Iraq but not Syria -- is the best way to defeat ISIS.  Driving ISIS out of Iraq and into Syria, would centralize the fight and lead to a more concerted effort to defeat ISIS, he believes.\n\"I think we ought to take this as a warning that we need to really go in there with very serious intent not to contain them but to take them our completely,\" Carson said Monday. \"To destroy them, to eliminate them. I would use every resource available to us.\" Carson sees a multinational force with American leadership bolstering \"all of the Arab states.\"\nBen Carson asks Congress to block Syrian refugees\nMarco Rubio\nThe Florida senator has cited Article V from the NATO agreement -- an attack on one is an attack on all -- as the basis for forming a multi-national coalition to fight ISIS.  Yet he has stopped short of directly calling for a specific number of U.S. troops or troops at all. \"It's premature to say the exact numbers,\" he said, when asked on ABC This Week about an estimate from Lindsey Graham' that 10,000 would be needed.\nHe has called for increasing the number special ops forces -- fewer than 50 have been deployed to Syria to advise and assist in combating ISIS. Rubio has said that the Sunnis have \"to be bulkhead of the fight\" against ISIS, yet there is division among Sunnis in Iraq about whether to back the Shia-led Iraqi governments fight against ISIS.\nTed Cruz\nThe Texas senator has come out against U.S. troops on the ground, subtly slamming rivals who want to do so. \"There are some politicians who like to support boots on the ground in every conflict across the globe in an effort to lean forward and show how tough they are,\" he said in a CNN interview before the terrorist attack in Paris. \"I don't think this is a game of 'Risk.' I don't think it should be politicians moving armies about. I think it should be driven by the national security imperatives and the military needs on the ground.\" \nTed Cruz: Obama terror response 'shameful'\nHis approach has not changed since Paris -- in the aftermath of the attack, Cruz has described Kurdish forces as \"our boots on the ground,\" and said backs arming them with updated equipment and amping up U.S. airpower.\nJeb Bush\nBush, who is set to give a national security speech in South Carolina on Wednesday, backs ground troops and more special operation troops, embedded with Iraqi military. He would also implement a no-fly zone.\n\"I would listen to the military commanders and give them the mission, which is, how do we destroy ISIS?\" he said on CNN's State of the Union.\nBut he has stopped short of saying how many soldiers would be needed and where they would be deployed.\n\"Creating a strategy means that we -- we create a no-fly zone, create safe havens for the remnants of the Syrian Free Army to -- to be built up. We lead by getting our Arab allies and friends to be able to support one fighting force,\" Bush said.\nCarly Fiorina\nFormer Hewlett Packard CEO Fiorina would call a Camp David summit with Arab allies to discuss how the US can help in the fight against ISIS. \n\"They know this is their fight, but they must have leadership and support and resolve from the United States of America.\" She said she would arm the Kurds, whose Peshmerga forces took control of the Iraqi city of Sinjar from ISIS, with the help of US air support.\nRand Paul\nTrue to his isolationist and libertarian leanings, the Kentucky senator said that Obama's military approach to ISIS, which is mainly airstrikes, is unconstitutional.  He introduced a declaration of war resolution in December 2014. As commander in chief he wouldn't send ground troops to fight the Sunni terrorist group.\n\"I think the last war in Iraq actually made it more chaotic and made us less safe. So I think if we want to be safer as a country and safer as a people, I don't think sending 500,000 troops back into there is a good idea nor do I think sending 50 is, in fact,\" he said on CNN, prior to the Paris attack.\n\"I think if you are going to war, sending 50 people to war at a time is sort of a recipe for being surrounded and somehow having a disaster on your hands,\" he added. \"So I would never put underwhelming force. If we went to war and there was a declaration of war, I would put overwhelming force. I wouldn't mess around.\"\nChris Christie\nThe New Jersey governor backs a no-fly zone a Middle Eastern coalition and a National Security Agency with expanded capabilities that isn't hamstrung by privacy concerns in efforts to collect intelligence. A former federal prosecutor who has sent terrorists to jail, Christie has highlighted that experience as a way to stand out from the field.\n\"We cannot afford to elect another president without the requisite experience and values to effectively govern,\" he said at a Friday speech in Florida. \"This is not a job for on the job training, everybody. We need someone who's made decisions, who stuck by those decisions and who understands the ramifications not only of action, but of inaction.\"\nJohn Kasich\nOhio Governor John Kasich supports sending ground troops to fight ISIS.  He was the first to call for invoking Article V of the NATO agreement, which was used in the aftermath of 9/11.  \nKasich said Obama needs to go to Europe and convene meetings with allies to work on intelligence operations and \"develop plans for joint military action to destroy ISIS.\" But Kasich sounded much more like a realist, rather than a neoconservative in the mold of George W. Bush. \"I am not a person that believes in nation building,\" he said. \"Nation building is not something for us to risk our men and women in uniform to do. Take care of business and come home.\"\nLindsey Graham\nGraham is by far the most hawkish of the field. He wants 10,000 ground troops to fight ISIS \"to fight them in their backyard,\" in both Iraq and Syria, specifically the city of Raqqa, an ISIS stronghold that the French have been bombing for the last two days. He, along with much of the field, has also called for a no-fly zone. \nGraham's call for troops puts him in line with 62% of Republicans, according to a CNN/ORC poll, but narrowly at odds with the greater public -- 51% of Americans oppose ground troops. \"There is a 9/11 coming and it's coming from Syria if we don't disrupt their operations inside of Syria,\" Graham said.\nBobby Jindal\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's main play for differentiation is an executive order instructing his state's agencies to stop the influx of Syrian refugees. That's also a move that many other governors -- mostly Republicans -- emulated Monday. Beyond that, his approach includes no-fly zone and leaving the option of ground troops on the table. \nMike Huckabee\nThe former Arkansas governor said ISIS wants to \"destroy Western civilization,\" and that defeating them means \"taking the fight to them,\" an effort that includes air strikes and ground troops, he said in an interview with Brietbart News calling for a coalition that would \"bomb the absolute stink out of them.\"\n\"We need to build that coalition with NATO, the Middle Eastern countries who are right in this neighborhood and any nation who doesn't participate, we sanction and isolate them,\" he said.\nRick Santorum \nThe 2012 GOP runner-up has slammed Obama for launching a public relations war, rather than a war that will lead to victory. Taking back land in Iraq is key to victory, an effort that Santorum said would take 10,000 troops and backed up by stepped up air offensive in Syria. \"I would be launching a major offensive against ISIS right now,\" Santorum said in Florida Saturday. \"Four bombs a day? Are you serious? That's a public relations war.\"\n", "byline": "", "description": "Republicans vying to replace President Barack Obama generally begin their comments on ISIS and Syria by criticizing the White House for \"leading from behind.\"", "title": "How Republican candidates would respond to ISIS", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/16/politics/republican-isis-2016-election/index.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Rick Santorum", "Lindsey Graham", "Jeb Bush", "George W.

Bush.\n\u201cVoters are not turning away from the baby boomer generation,\u201d said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute of Public Opinion, which conducts the survey. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising and personally gratifying.\u201d\nAdvanced age once raised questions about how well an older person would do in the demanding job. Reagan in 1980, Bob Dole in 1996 and John McCain in 2008 all sought to assure voters they were up to the task. Reagan campaigned vigorously in 1980 to demonstrate his health, and joked about his opponent\u2019s \u201cyouth and inexperience\u201d in 1984.

Adults residing in the continental United States were interviewed in English or Spanish by telephone using live interviewers. Land-line telephone numbers were randomly selected based upon a list of telephone exchanges from throughout the nation from ASDE Survey Sampler Inc. The exchanges were selected to ensure that each region was represented in proportion to its population. Respondents in the household were then selected by first asking for the youngest male. To increase coverage, this land-line sample was supplemented by respondents reached through random dialing of cellphone numbers from Survey Sampling International. The two samples were then combined and balanced to reflect the 2013 American Community Survey one-year estimates for age, gender, income, race and region. Results are statistically significant within plus or minus 2.6 percentage points. There are 1,080 registered voters.

{"body": "", "byline": "", "description": "\nJim Cole / AP\nThe Clinton campaign saw an opportunity to damage an opponent.It was late August, back before Marco Rubio replaced Jeb Bush as the candidate many Democrats viewed as the most formidable general election opponent, and Bush had used the term \"anchor babies\" while talking about stronger immigration enforcement.The campaign's Latino team, which includes Hispanic outreach director Lorella Praeli, digital organizing director Jessica Morales Rocketto, Hispanic media director Jorge Silva, and Paola Luisi on the communications team, discussed how to best respond before settling on an SMS text blast to the campaign's growing list of Latinos who signed up to receive messages on their mobile phones.They went with an aggressive attack, comparing Bush to Donald Trump, saying this is how he speaks about Latinos \"when he thinks no one is listening\" and if recipients replied with \"HEAR\" they received an automated call with audio of Bush's remarks in English and Spanish.The campaign says the response was incredible. The Latino list saw a spike in growth, with people getting their friends to text in, as well as high numbers of people actually listening to the phone call.\"We always sort of had a theory that this was going to work, but what proved it was the Jeb Bush anchor baby text,\" Morales Rocketto said.According to the campaign, tens of thousands of Hispanics have signed up to receive the bilingual text messages (recipients can say whether they prefer English or Spanish; 75% ask to receive them in English). Unsurprisingly, the top states are some of the most populous: Texas, California, and critical Florida. Other big, reliably blue states mostly round out the top 10, but also included are Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona.In the primary, Latino voters recognize and support Clinton at significantly higher levels than her opponents. A program like this aims to keep younger Hispanics, which now make up a larger percentage of the Latino vote, engaged and ultimately send them out to volunteer or vote. But for a campaign looking to recapture the younger, more diverse Democratic coalition that elected President Obama twice, programs like this are even more likely tests for next fall.A poll released last week by Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg found motivation from the \"Rising American Electorate,\" defined as minorities, young voters, and single women, is lagging behind that of Republican-aligned voter groups.But so far, the Clinton campaign says they\u2019re seeing enthusiasm with their texting program. Amid the bevy of data they\u2019ve collected through the program (all tied to phone numbers), according to the campaign, 91% of those responding are eligible voters, with 9% not eligible to vote but still wanting to volunteer or be involved (the campaign considers the latter group to be made up significantly of undocumented immigrants).Reaching Hispanics and young adults goes hand-in-hand. In fact, a source close to Jeb Bush's super PAC, Right to Rise, said the group was pitched that 50% of Latinos are \u201cmillennials\u201d and 25% of \u201cmillennials\u201d are Hispanics. And the Clinton\u2019s push to reach these voters on their phones makes sense, said Mark Hugo Lopez of Pew Hispanic.\"More than half of Hispanic adults are cellphone-only so if you want to reach Latinos one of the best ways is mobile,\" he said, adding that Hispanics go online at higher rates than other groups.The campaign has used high-profile endorsements from well-known figures in the Latino community to grow their list (the strongest: when Marc Anthony brought Clinton on stage during his concert in Miami and pitched the texting program or when Julian Castro told those gathered at a San Antonio rally to take out their phones and text the campaign).When Dolores Huerta, a labor leader who worked with Cesar Chavez, endorsed Clinton, the action rate of people listening to her endorsement message was about three times higher than some of the broader audience messages, the campaign said.The program has also not been perfect: Saturday\u2019s immigration text misspelled the word \u2014 \u201cimmigation\u201d \u2014 and the campaign\u2019s text, typo included, was repeated again and again on Twitter during the debate.But it is providing the campaign with early returns, a lot of data, and a reliable way to reach supporters. People who sign up to receive texts are asked to self-identify (Latinos are not monolithic). Thus far, most respondents have Mexican heritage, followed by Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Salvadorans, Colombians, Cubans, Peruvians, and Ecuadorians.And they\u2019ve experimented with the language in the text, at times mixing some familiar Spanish words into the English-language texts, meant for the bicultural audience, for example. The campaign has tested messages beyond immigration, which is an issue of importance for Latinos but not the only issue, as well. During Saturday's debate it sent Spanish-language texts on health care and gun control, in addition to immigration.While the campaign says the SMS program is deeply integrated into its digital strategy as an organizing and voter-education tool, with plans to use it for get-out-the-vote efforts later on in the cycle, Democrats also view the SMS program is an effective tool for attacking Republicans, and in particular, tying them to Trump.Strategist Maria Cardona said that while Trump is favorably citing a deeply controversial 1950s policy called \"Operation Wetback\" to defend his plan to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, Clinton is engaging Latinos positively.\"A fire has been lit underneath the Hispanic community's feet and young people have been a large part of that because of what they\u2019re hearing,\" Cardona said. \"Romney lost Latinos 27% to 71% and he was just advocating self-deportation.\"\n", "title": "The Clinton Campaign Wants To Win The Latino Vote One Text At A Time", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/adriancarrasquillo/the-clinton-campaign-wants-to-win-the-latino-vote-one-text-a", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Marc Anthony", "Jeb Bush", "Lorella Praeli", "Stan Greenberg", "Cesar Chavez", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Maria Cardona", "Jorge Silva", "Mark Hugo Lopez", "Julian Castro", "Jim Cole"], "orgs": ["PAC"], "election_confidence": 0.9854301199501568, "authors": [{"author_id": 6684, "fullname": "adrian carrasquillo", "primary_org": "buzzfeed"}], "date_written": "2015-11-16 16:55:16", "org": "buzzfeed", "article_id": "80a5a063f4fa4eb70cb7d4a1ca201052", "date_access": "2015-11-16 18:13:35.395784"},

{"body": "(Updating with graphic)\nBy Paul Lienert and Joseph White\nDETROIT Nov 16 Detroit's Big Three automakers\nare accelerating plans to produce more small cars for the North\nAmerican market in Mexico as they seek to reduce labor costs,\nwhile using higher-paid U.S. workers to build their very\nprofitable trucks, sport utility vehicles and luxury cars.\nNew versions of several of their popular U.S. compact cars\nare expected to be made in Mexico, people familiar with the\ncompanies' plans said. They include General Motors Co's \nnew Chevrolet Cruze hatchback, a successor to Ford Motor Co's\n Focus compact and a replacement for Fiat Chrysler\nAutomobiles NV's Jeep Compass compact SUV.\nThe decisions are prompting three major automotive research\nfirms, who are often used by the automakers and their suppliers\nfor industry forecasting, to project a big increase in Mexican\noutput of small cars by the three companies.\nAutoForecast Solutions estimates that GM, Ford and Fiat\nChrysler will collectively produce 45 percent of their small\ncars for the North American market in Mexico by 2020, up from 18\npercent in 2014. LMC Automotive sees the 2020 figure at 37\npercent, also against 18 percent last year, while IHS Automotive\nprojects the Mexican percentage going to 42 percent in five\nyears time, though it calculates the 2014 level at a higher\nlevel than the others, at 25 percent.\nIn response to questions from Reuters, the three automakers\ndeclined to discuss their specific plans.\nGM said that the \"vast majority\" of its small cars sold in\nthe U.S. are \"produced domestically.\" Ford said it is \"committed\nto continuing to improve competitiveness and to invest where it\nmakes the best sense for our business.\" Fiat Chrysler said it\n\"has made no official announcements regarding the company's\nfuture production plans.\"\nThe Detroit automakers' plans to build more small cars in\nMexico are likely to be highly controversial ahead of the\nNovember 2016 U.S. presidential election. Businessman Donald\nTrump, who is seeking to win the nomination to be the Republican\npresidential candidate, has repeatedly blasted U.S. companies,\nincluding Ford, for any moves to shift jobs to Mexico from the\nU.S. and says he would support government incentives to keep\nauto production in the United States if he gets into the White\nHouse. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for\ncomment.\nIt is also a huge issue for the U.S. labor unions, who have\nbeen highly critical of the impact of free trade agreements,\nsuch as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with\nMexico and Canada reached when Bill Clinton was U.S. President\nin 1994. His wife, Hillary Clinton, is the leading contender to\nbe the Democrats' presidential candidate.\nThe Clinton campaign declined to comment.\nUnited Auto Workers President Dennis Williams has faced\ncriticism from union members that he has acquiesced to jobs\ngoing south. \"For someone to suggest that we endorse products\ngoing to Mexico is just nonsense,\" he wrote to UAW members last\nmonth.  The UAW declined a request for a comment for this story.\n\nTINY PROFIT MARGINS\nFor the automakers it is largely a question of cost and\nmargin. They are determined to reduce costs in production of\ncompact and midsize cars, which already suffer from small profit\nmargins or are losing money.\nOverall U.S. sales have been very strong in the past couple\nof years but larger vehicles such as SUVs and pickup trucks are\nthe big beneficiaries because the plunge in gasoline prices\nmeans that fuel economy isn't as much of an issue for consumers\nas it was a few years back. The larger vehicles typically\ngenerate profits of $10,000 and more each.\nThe Big Three are also feeling the heat from foreign rivals,\nincluding Nissan Motor Co and Volkswagen AG\n, who have been adding production capacity in Mexico.\nThe margins on small cars may erode further if production\nremains in the U.S. because new labor agreements negotiated by\nGM, Ford and Chrysler grant the first raises in a decade to\nveteran workers, and give recent hires a path to earn $30 an\nhour after eight years on the job.\nAt the same time, the Detroit automakers need to continue\nbuilding and selling small cars to meet ever-tightening U.S.\nfuel economy regulations because big pickups and SUVs have much\nlower mileage.\nMexican labor rates, which averaged about $5.50 an hour in\n2014, are about a fifth of the wages auto workers earn in the\nUnited States, according to the Center for Automotive Research\n(CAR).\nSean McAlinden, chief economist at CAR, said GM's Orion\nTownship assembly plant in Michigan, which builds Chevrolet and\nBuick subcompacts, has the lowest labor costs of any U.S. plant\nthanks to a favorable agreement with the UAW negotiated as part\nof the U.S. government's bailout of GM in 2009. And yet the Ford\nFiesta plant in Cuautitlan, near Mexico City, has a $700 labor\ncost advantage per car over GM's Orion plant, he said.\nWith small car sales waning, GM recently announced layoffs\nat Orion. According to sources at suppliers it is also expected\nto drop production of the Buick Verano next year.\n\nWEAKER CURRENCY\nMexico is an increasingly attractive production base for a\nvariety of reasons. Its infrastructure, supply base and\nproductivity all have improved in recent years, according to\nMcAlinden. A plunge in the Mexican peso against the dollar to\nalmost 17 to the Greenback from just over 13 a year ago has also\nmade the country more appealing for U.S. manufacturers, at least\nin the short term, by reducing its relative costs.\nOn the downside, shipping costs from Mexico remain high, and\nenergy sources can be unreliable.\nFord confirmed last week in its tentative contract with the\nUnited Auto Workers union that it will stop building Focus\ncompact cars at a factory in Wayne, Michigan in 2018. UAW\nofficials have said the replacement for the current Focus will\nbe made in Mexico, while the Michigan assembly plant is expected\nto start assembling a pickup truck and an SUV, according to\npeople familiar with Ford's plans. Ford has declined to say what\nvehicles it plans to build in Wayne.\nSupplier sources also said that GM plans to build the Cruze\nhatchback in Mexico while the Cruze sedan will continue to be\nbuilt in Ohio, and that Fiat Chrysler has long planned to\nproduce the Compass replacement in Mexico rather than in\nIllinois. GM and Fiat Chrysler declined to comment on where the\nvehicles will be made.\nMoving production of mass-market, fuel-efficient sedans to\nMexico is a challenge to a goal the Obama administration\nstressed when it drove government-funded restructurings of GM\nand the former Chrysler in 2009.

Ford has declined to say what\nvehicles it plans to build in Wayne.\nSupplier sources also said that GM plans to build the Cruze\nhatchback in Mexico while the Cruze sedan will continue to be\nbuilt in Ohio, and that Fiat Chrysler has long planned to\nproduce the Compass replacement in Mexico rather than in\nIllinois. GM and Fiat Chrysler declined to comment on where the\nvehicles will be made.\nMoving production of mass-market, fuel-efficient sedans to\nMexico is a challenge to a goal the Obama administration\nstressed when it drove government-funded restructurings of GM\nand the former Chrysler in 2009. Gas prices had soared to $4 a\ngallon or more during the 2008 financial crisis, killing sales\nof Detroit's trucks.\nGM and Fiat Chrysler agreed to build small cars in the U.S.\nas part of their government-funded bankruptcies. Now profitable\nand free of government ownership, their CEOs no longer must\nanswer to the White House. Ford, which restructured without\nfederal help, shifted U.S. production toward more fuel-efficient\nvehicles when truck sales swooned, but now is ramping up U.S.\nproduction of SUVs and pickups to meet robust demand.\nSteven Rattner, the investor who was the first head of the\nWhite House auto task force, said the threat to U.S. jobs was a\nconcern then and now.\n\"We were well aware of the situation with Mexico and the\npossibility that jobs would continue to migrate there,\" he told\nReuters.\n(Reporting by Paul Lienert and Joseph White in Detroit; Editing\nby Martin Howell)", "byline": "", "description": "DETROIT, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Detroit's Big Three automakers\nare accelerating plans to produce more small cars for the North\nAmerican market in Mexico as they seek to reduce labor costs,\nwhile using higher-paid U.S. workers to build their very\nprofitable trucks, sport utility vehicles and luxury cars.", "title": "INSIGHT-Detroit's Big Three accelerate plans to build more small cars in Mexico", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/cyclicalconsumergoodsNews/~3/G3hTTMJj21o/usa-autos-mexico-idUSL1N13B1TQ20151116", "topics": ["environment/energy", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Bill Clinton", "Steven Rattner", "Dennis Williams", "Hillary Clinton", "Martin Howell"], "orgs": ["Fiat", "SUVs", "United Auto Workers", "NAFTA", "United Auto Workers union", "UAW", "Ford", "Volkswagen AG", "Chrysler", "Fiat Chrysler", "General Motors Co"], "election_confidence": 0.8097439961921806, "authors": [{"author_id": 33346, "fullname": "reuters editorial", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-11-16 18:31:39", "org": "reuters", "article_id": "fa0ddbda9c3409dfc391a138eb8f4938", "date_access": "2015-11-16 19:48:49.966263"},

The rapidly moving investigation is revealing a picture of a network of terrorists, many of them born in Europe, who were trained in Syria or elsewhere in the Middle East\u00e2\u0080\u0094a scenario that has worried authorities across Europe for years.\nBelgian and French authorities are also investigating whether a Belgian man suspected of being the mastermind behind a foiled Belgian terrorist plot in January orchestrated Friday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s onslaught, officials familiar with the probe said. Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who was raised in Brussels, may have escaped to Syria after police shot and killed two men in the eastern Belgian town of Verviers who were plotting to kill police officers. At least several of the suspects had moved undetected by both the French and Belgian governments, using an operating base just 50 miles off France\u00e2\u0080\u0099s border, in Brussels. Inti Landauro and Matthew Dalton report.\nThe latest on the Paris attacks:\u00c2\u00a0World leaders promised a forceful response to Friday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0terrorist attacks in Paris, including intensified airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, intelligence cooperation and measures to tighten border security \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The Belgian links to the Paris attacks have reignited concerns that the European Union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capital continues to be a breeding ground for radical Islamist terrorists, sparking a debate in the country about whether the government is doing enough to crack down on them \u2026 When the sound of a suicide bomber detonating an explosive vest rang out across the Stade de France, President Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Hollande was in the stadium watching France\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national soccer team take on Germany.

But they are likely to affect the two parties in different ways, Aaron Zitner reports. Read Aaron Zitner\u2019s full post in Washington Wire.\nWSJ STORIES YOU SHOULDN\u2019T MISS\nPARIS TRAGEDY COULD SHAKE UP 2016 RACE: The terrorist attacks in Paris could shake up the 2016 presidential race, reminding voters of the high stakes and potentially boosting candidates who put their governing experience front and center. During much of the campaign, voters have swooned over candidates who trumpet their nonpolitical r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9s. Celebrity businessman Donald Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson have led the Republican field, running far ahead of politicians who served in statehouses and Congress. On the Democratic side, self-described socialist Bernie Sanders has been drawing the largest and most enthusiastic crowds, putting a scare into the establishment candidate, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The Paris attacks and potency of Islamic State, which France blames for the deadly assaults, could reshuffle the field as voters ask: Is this the moment to turn over the presidency to an untested outsider? Peter Nicholas and Beth Reinhard report.\nPlus:\u00c2\u00a0Democrats and Republicans, based on their recent presidential debates, are set to offer voters a stark choice in 2016 about how the economy should be managed, with both sides moving toward the outer flanks of their parties\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Republican presidential candidates have criticized Mrs. Clinton\u00c2\u00a0for declining\u00c2\u00a0to use term such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cradical Islam\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cIslamic terrorism\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0to describe the extremists who have unleashed a string of terrorist attacks on Western targets recently\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Sen.

That didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Still, Democrats who watched the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential candidates debate thought that Mr. Sanders won the event, an Internet survey found, though they also said Mrs. Clinton showed that she would do the best job of keeping the U.S. safe from terrorism.\nOBAMA FACES A CROSSROADS: President Obama came into office with a single, driving foreign-policy principle that shaped his approach to international crises: Avoid another protracted war like those in Iraq and Afghanistan. Friday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terrorist attacks in Paris, which killed at least 129 people, present Mr. Obama with a fundamental test of whether the approach is sustainable. With one year in office remaining, the president faces pressure to escalate what is now seen as a global, rather than regional, fight against Islamic State militants, whom France accused of carrying out the attacks. How Mr. Obama responds, in coordination with America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s European allies and potentially Russia, could define U.S. leadership for years to come. Carol E. Lee reports.\nPlus:\u00c2\u00a0The White House said the U.S. agrees with France that the terrorist attacks in Paris are \u00e2\u0080\u009can act of war\u00e2\u0080\u009d and demands stronger international commitments to combat the Islamic State group that carried out the attacks \u2026 The Paris terror attacks suggest that the U.S. and its allies overestimated recent successes against Islamic State while underestimating the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to strike far from its Middle East stronghold, according to U.S. lawmakers, analysts and former senior intelligence officials\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Thirty minutes of terror on the streets of Paris looks to become the catalyst for a broad shift in international politics with implications that could last for years.\nTRUMP COURTS GOP VOTERS IN FLORIDA: Donald Trump is staking claim to a state that helped cinch the last two GOP presidential nominations, barreling past a couple of native sons in the race. At a weekend gathering of hundreds of Florida Republican activists, he elicited a rowdier reception than Sen. Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush and he is leading them in statewide polls. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not leading them. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trouncing them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d corrected Mr. Trump in an interview Friday with The Wall Street Journal, pulling a list of the latest polling from his breast pocket. Mr. Trump is favored by 27% of state GOP voters, while Mr. Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standing is at 16% and Mr. Bush has the support of 9%, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average. Florida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s winner-take-all primary will award 99 delegates\u00e2\u0080\u0094roughly 8% of the total needed to clinch the nomination\u00e2\u0080\u0094and is viewed as a must-win for Messrs.

A close call doesn't help him.\"\nThe debate dominated TV ratings but was thin on policy substance. Scioli depicted Macri as a neoliberal bent on destroying Argentina's welfare economy, while Macri blamed Scioli for stagnant economic growth and rampant graft.\nBoth candidates ducked questions, and neither was left licking any serious wounds. \nThat will suit Macri, the pro-business Buenos Aires mayor whom opinion polls show as having an eight-point lead going into the Nov. 22 ballot, and hurt Scioli's chances of a late comeback.\nBuenos Aires province Governor Scioli, a moderate within the broad Peronist movement that has dominated Argentine politics for decades, told voters he would safeguard the salaries of workers and the middle class, and keep energy subsidies in place. \nThe alternative, he said, was a candidate who would favor big business, place Argentina back in the hands of ruthless creditors and engineer a painful currency devaluation.\n\"I am here to defend you,\" Scioli told voters.\nEndorsed by outgoing President Cristina Fernandez, Scioli entered the debate vulnerable to Macri's attacks against the fiery nationalist's handling of Latin America's third-biggest economy.\nThe winner of the election will inherit an economy mired in trouble. Foreign reserves are precariously low, the fiscal deficit is widening on a surge in public spending, growth is sluggish and inflation is high.\nScioli has struggled throughout the campaign to reach out to independent voters thirsting for a change to Fernandez's brand of leftist populism while also locking in her supporters.\n\"You're not change,\" Macri said during the debate. \"You chose continuity.\"\nMacri's attempts to push Scioli into defending Fernandez's divisive eight years in power rattled his opponent early on.\n\"You insist on debating with a government that is on its way out on Dec. 10,\" said Scioli, whose performance strengthened as the debate shifted to fighting crime and education.   \nArgentina's twitterati, which is generally wealthier and better-educated than average, called the debate overwhelmingly in Macri's favor. \nLower-income voters will find comfort in Scioli's steady promises to protect salaries and pensions, but without a powerful knockdown on Sunday, closing Macri's lead will be tough. \n\"Macri came out on top because the debate did not change the election's course,\" said political analyst Rosendo Fraga.    \n\n (Reporting by Richard Lough; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)", "byline": "", "description": "BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Conservative challenger Mauricio Macri heads into the final week before Argentina's presidential run-off vote ahead in polls and largely unscathed in Sunday's debate, where his ruling-party rival failed to land a knockout punch.", "title": "Argentina's Macri seen unscathed from humdrum presidential debate", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/worldNews/~3/4LqFyO5mXvI/story01.htm", "topics": ["economy"], "people": ["Cristina Fernandez", "Daniel Scioli", "Mauricio Macri", "Richard Lough", "Lisa Von Ahn"], "orgs": ["Macri"], "election_confidence": 0.5591087269635409, "authors": [{"author_id": 33346, "fullname": "reuters editorial", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-11-16 15:45:48", "org": "reuters", "article_id": "59c5b23f7f47c01b3c74d1f73fc6786a", "date_access": "2015-11-16 16:10:33.514452"},

{"body": "Chris Christie\u2019s voice was level, even soft, as he recalled his precise movements on Sept. 11, 2001. Addressing a Republican conference in Florida, he wove a tale that linked his background as a federal prosecutor to a current need for American resolve overseas, and to what he characterized as wavering leadership by a \u201clawless president.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen terror dogs us, happiness is not possible,\u201d Mr. Christie, the governor of New Jersey, said on Saturday. \u201cOf course, that means law and order must be respected. It must be respected to ensure that our way of life continues.\u201d\n\nWith the speech, a day after the deadly terrorist attacks in Paris, Mr. Christie neatly encapsulated the argument that has come to propel his long-shot presidential bid. Once a front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, he is now campaigning as a determined underdog, forcing his way into the currents of the 2016 race with an insistent message focused on terrorism and crime.\n\nThe law-and-order stance has served another purpose for Mr. Christie: It has helped him turn the page, at least for the moment, on the political retribution scandal that has threatened to unravel his presidential bid and discredit him thoroughly as a political leader.\n\nMr. Christie suffered grievous political damage after the revelation that several close associates had plotted to deliberately snarl traffic near the George Washington Bridge in September 2013, an episode of almost cartoonish lawlessness that unfolded under his own administration.\n\nIn May, federal prosecutors indicted three former Christie advisers for their roles in the events. His polling numbers plunged during a long investigation, in New Jersey and in the rest of the country, and financing for his campaign grew scarce.\n\nBut Mr. Christie has persistently ignored pronouncements of his political death. His poll numbers have risen modestly in New Hampshire, and national polls show Republican voters once again view him in a somewhat favorable light.\n\nIn some respects, Mr. Christie has been the beneficiary of forces beyond his control: A former prosecutor who was elected governor on a pledge to clean up Trenton, he has been well positioned to exploit a domestic political conversation that has shifted toward questions of policing and violent crime, and a national security debate increasingly preoccupied with Islamic terrorism.\n\nThe governor has called for a more forceful strategy for fighting Islamic radicalism, and scolded Democrats, including President Obama and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, for criticizing the police. He has vowed never to meet with Black Lives Matter protesters, whom he has described as a threat to civil order, and chided Hillary Rodham Clinton for accommodating them.\n\nJoel W. Maiola, a longtime New Hampshire strategist, said the political landscape of the campaign had grown more favorable to Mr. Christie.\n\n\u201cChris Christie kind of makes people feel, not at ease, but comfortable that he\u2019s the right person for the times that we\u2019re in,\u201d said Mr. Maiola, who announced his support for Mr. Christie last week. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a reassurance that he brings, and it\u2019s his issues that are being teed up.\u201d\n\nChristie aides and Democrats tracking his campaign said the subject of the lane-closing episode seldom came up in the early presidential states, and had been raised almost exclusively in news interviews, rather than by voters. It has not been mentioned in any of the presidential debates so far.\n\nIn the most recent undercard debate for Republican candidates, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana spoke scornfully of Mr. Christie\u2019s record in New Jersey, assailing him for increasing the state budget, allowing the growth of food stamp programs, expanding Medicaid and failing to avert nine credit downgrades.\n\nYet Mr. Jindal did not mention the bridge scandal.\n\nScott E. Hilliard, the sheriff of Merrimack County, N.H., and a supporter of Mr. Christie, said the lane-closing issue had arisen only rarely as he solicited support for the campaign.\n\n\u201cOnce in a while, when I\u2019m trying to get somebody to support the governor, they\u2019ll say, \u2018What about that bridge thing?\u2019\u201d Mr. Hilliard said. \u201cIn three months, I might have heard that once or twice.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff attributed Mr. Christie\u2019s rising fortunes in the state in part to his forceful comments in support of police. At a moment when law enforcement is under intense scrutiny, Mr. Hilliard said, voters sense that Mr. Christie \u201cunderstands how complicated the job is.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur first conversation, face to face, was really, \u2018What\u2019s going on with law enforcement in New Hampshire?\u2019\u201d he recalled.\n\nShould Mr. Christie continue to gain ground in the presidential race, there are signs that the bridge issue could again become a hindrance. While the governor has never been directly implicated in the closing of access to the George Washington Bridge, he has been repeatedly drawn into the legal wrangling surrounding the indictments of his aides.\n\nLast week lawyers for two of them, Bridget Anne Kelly and Bill Baroni, alleged in court filings that federal prosecutors and Mr. Christie\u2019s lawyers had failed to properly share evidence with defense lawyers.\n\nMr. Christie batted away the accusations, scoffing in a CNN interview that they amounted to \u201cdefense lawyer baloney.\u201d None of his opponents weighed in to disagree.\n\nIf Mr. Christie\u2019s rivals have taken a pass on the scandal, allowing him to reclaim his political brand as a no-nonsense enforcer more or less unchallenged, they say it is because the governor\u2019s presidential ambitions are already injured beyond repair.\n\nMr. Christie drew support from only 3 percent of Republican primary voters in a New York Times-CBS News poll in October. To the extent that Mr. Christie\u2019s standing has improved in the early presidential primary states, the phenomenon has largely been confined to New Hampshire.\n\nCurt Anderson, a top adviser to Mr. Jindal, said Mr. Christie had gotten a pass from other candidates because he has been such a small factor in the race.\n\nMr. Jindal, who is also polling in the low single digits, attacked Mr. Christie on the debate stage as a \u201cbig-government Republican.\u201d But he was deliberately focusing on policy areas where he could highlight his own record fighting public spending, Mr. Anderson said.\n\n\u201cNo one believes he has a chance to win or that he is a threat to win or that he is sitting on any pile of votes,\u201d Mr. Anderson said of Mr. Christie.", "byline": "ALEXANDER BURNS", "description": "Gov.

{"body": "DES MOINES \u2013 Representative Steve King of Iowa, a hard-right conservative in the state with the first nominating contest, threw his support behind Senator Ted Cruz for the Republican nomination on Monday, calling him the \u201canswer to my prayers.\u2019\u2019\n\nMr. King, known nationally for polarizing comments about illegal immigrants, offered his endorsement at a moment when Mr. Cruz and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida are engaged in a high-profile fight over their past positions on immigration, a resonant issue among conservatives in Iowa.\n\nMr. Cruz, of Texas, has called Mr. Rubio\u2019s support of a 2013 Senate reform bill as an effort to \u201cjam this amnesty\u201d down Americans\u2019 throats. Mr. Rubio, who has backed off supporting a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, has fired back that Mr. Cruz at the time supported legal status for the undocumented workers, which conservatives also consider amnesty. \n\nMr. King, who has introduced bills to revoke birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants, said, \u201cI hope this endorsement does add clarity to Ted Cruz\u2019s position on immigration and any of his competitors blurring his position.\u2019\u2019\n\nUnder President Obama, Mr. King said, \u201cWe\u2019ve watched as our already porous border was turned into a 2,000-mile-long neon sign that flashes for free health care, free education, free housing, free food and free Obamaphones.\u2019\u2019\n\nMr. King said Mr. Cruz was best suited to be the party\u2019s nominee because he has proved he can raise lots of money; he will win some support from the establishment wing of the party; and, especially, because he will  energize \u201cconstitutional Christian conservatives,\u2019\u2019 which he called the party\u2019s largest group.\n\nThe Republican nominee must fire up the \u201cfive to eight million\u201d members of the Christian right who did not vote in 2012, Mr. King said during a news conference in Des Moines announcing his endorsement.\n\nAlthough Mr. King is popular in his western Iowa congressional district, the most conservative part of the state, it is unclear how much his public support will mean for Mr. Cruz.  The Texas senator has less than half the support in recent Iowa polls as Ben Carson or Donald J. Trump, both of whom appeal to some of the same voters he seeks.  \n\nMr. King said he respects Mr. Carson\u2019s intelligence, but his lack of experience in Washington gave him pause. \u201cYou need to know what\u2019s going in that organism to do something about it,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe endorsement was long anticipated.  Mr. Cruz\u2019s Iowa campaign director is a former staff member for Mr. King, and last month Mr. Cruz joined Mr. King on a pheasant hunt in western Iowa. \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a follower of King, you should already be in Cruz\u2019s camp,\u2019\u2019 said Craig Robinson, a former state party official, who writes The Iowa Republican blog. \u201cIf anything, it creates the narrative Cruz wants, that conservatives are consolidating behind him.\u2019\u2019", "byline": "TRIP GABRIEL", "description": "Representative Steve King of Iowa, a hard-right conservative in the state with the first nominating contest, threw his support behind Senator Ted Cruz of Texas for the Republican nomination, calling him the \u201canswer to my prayers.\u2019\u2019", "title": "First Draft: Representative Steve King of Iowa Endorses Ted Cruz", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/16/representative-steve-king-of-iowa-endorses-ted-cruz/", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Steve King", "Craig Robinson", "Marco Rubio", "Donald J.

{"body": "DES MOINES \u2014  The news team at station KCCI buzzed with nervous anticipation here at Drake University on Saturday night, less than two hours before the start of the Democratic candidates\u2019 debate.\n\nIt was the first presidential debate that KCCI, the local CBS affiliate, would help present in its 60-year history, and the atmosphere had shifted dramatically in the previous 24 hours \u2014 from one charged with excitement to a grave and somber tone following the deadly terror attacks in Paris.\n\nBehind a temporary stage erected for the event, KCCI\u2019s news director, Dave Busiek, watched a live stream of CBS News coverage on his iPhone about the latest developments out of Paris. In a nearby workspace, the veteran anchor Kevin Cooney made final preparations for the questions he would pose later about national security as one of debate\u2019s four moderators.\n\nJust after 6:15 p.m., cameras flashed on the KCCI anchors Stacey Horst and Steve Karlin, who stood on the stage and welcomed viewers to an area for the news media known as the spin room; they noted how the carnage in Paris would change the focus of the debate.\n\n\u201cOur viewers are interested in that,\u201d Mr. Busiek said. \u201cThat flows into what will be a very serious discussion with who could be the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nBroadcasting from Iowa\u2019s capital city to 434,500 TV households in the country\u2019s 72nd largest television market, KCCI takes on outsize importance among the nation\u2019s local television stations every four years. Iowans are the first in the nation to vote in presidential caucuses, setting the tone for the rest of the campaign season.\n\nAs a result, presidential candidates devote significant face time to KCCI, the perennial market leader and one of 30 stations owned by Hearst, and its rival WHO-HD, the local NBC affiliate. And the stations respond in kind, adding more political coverage to the menu of news offerings.\n\nKCCI started its own Sunday morning half-hour interview program this fall called \u201cClose Up,\u201d which has featured interviews with presidential candidates from both parties. And WHO boasts that it televises 25 percent more news each week than other stations in the market, thanks in large part to a 4 p.m. newscast that presents a more in-depth look at news and politics. WHO also is hosting three special one-hour forums this week featuring the Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Bobby Jindal. The stations also count on campaigns and interest groups to open their checkbooks in the months leading up to the caucuses and the general election. KCCI and its market rivals are likely to reap a disproportionate share of the $3.3 billion in political advertising dollars that analysts project will go to local television stations for 2016 races, particularly for pre-caucus spending.\n\n\u201cTechnically, the presidential election is a national election,\u201d said Elizabeth Wilner, a senior vice president at Kantar Media/CMAG, a company that monitors political advertising. \u201cBut in reality it is a race that occurs in about 10 states. In 2012, seven states saw 84 percent of all local TV ad spend, and we expect that same dynamic again.\u201d\n\nThat swing in political ad spending is of huge importance to the big media conglomerates that own local television stations, particularly as other categories of advertisers shift a larger share of spending to digital outlets. \u201cIn political, TV is still king,\u201d said Kip Cassino, executive vice president for research at Borrell Associates.\n\nOver the last several years, a wave of consolidation has swept across the industry with station owners trying to put themselves in the path of more of political advertising dollars. In 2013, for instance, Tribune Company closed a $2.7 billion acquisition of Local TV Holdings that made it one of the country\u2019s largest station owners; it added stations in 16 markets in the transaction, including WHO in Des Moines.\n\nTribune is now expecting to gross about $200 million in political advertising sales in 2016, up 25 percent from adjusted revenues in 2012. \u201cAt this point, we\u2019re calling for it to be strong, all signs are pointing to that,\u201d Peter Liguori, chief executive of Tribune Media, said during a recent conference call, noting the company\u2019s strength in swing states. In Des Moines, station executives said that the sales strategy boiled down to waiting for the phones to ring and the orders to come in. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to actively go out,\u201d said Dale R. Woods, general manager of WHO. \u201cThey are the ones who want to obtain our real estate.\u201d\n\nAnd while ad orders have started trickling in, executives said that the deluge largely has yet to arrive, partly because of the large number of Republican candidates this year, which has prompted campaigns to hold back on paying for advertising as they wait for the field to narrow. The surprising success of Donald J. Trump, who for the most part does not use advertising, has also affected how the candidates spend.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a decent position,\u201d said Brian Sather, president and general manager of KCCI. \u201cWe\u2019re open for business.\u201d\n\nThe stations also benefit from the rise of outside political action groups. While the stations are required by law to provide equal access to candidates and to charge them the lowest unit rates, there are no laws limiting what they can charge outside groups for commercial time. Analysts project a sharp increase in spending by these groups for 2016.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing stopping stations from charging groups five to six times as much \u2014 or even 10 times as much\u201d as they charge candidates, Ms. Wilner of Kantar said. \u201cNobody weeps for the poor billionaire that has to pay 10 times as much as the candidate.\u201d\n\nBut the influx of campaign dollars creates a delicate situation for the stations, which have to juggle their limited supply of commercial time. High demand for political ads in the Des Moines market, particularly in the weeks leading up to the caucus, can put a squeeze on inventory and push out local businesses, such as car dealerships, that are the bread-and-butter advertisers year round.\n\n\u201cIt is a balancing act,\u201d Mr. Sather said. \u201cWe try to do our best.\u201d\n\nMike Schreurs, chief executive of Strategic America, an advertising agency in West Des Moines, said that it is common for businesses to see as many as one out of four commercial spots bumped from local TV during the peak political season. They also might have to pay at least a 30 percent increase in the rates. \u201cIt takes the inventory away from smaller retailers and advertisers, not including the fact that it creates something of a toxic environment,\u201d he said.Already, more than 35,000 commercials adding up to more than $22.5 million in spending have aired or are scheduled to air on Iowa television stations through Feb. 2, the day after the Iowa caucuses, according to an analysis of Federal Communications Commission records by The Des Moines Register. On KCCI alone, viewers will see more than 62 ads a day in the eight days leading up to the Iowa caucuses. And at WHO, Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s campaign has booked a single spot for $5,800 to air during prime time Monday night. A spot airing during another time the same week cost $60.\n\nBack in the spin room after the debate on Saturday night, KCCI anchors wrapped up more than four hours of related coverage. During the coming 78 days leading to the Iowa caucus, the journalists plan to return to the air to cover the twists and turns of the campaign. But, for the moment, Mr. Karlin, one of the anchors, reflected on the Des Moines station\u2019s moment in the national spotlight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a privilege for a television station like us to be part of a debate like this,\u201d he said.", "byline": "EMILY STEEL", "description": "Over the last several years, a wave of consolidation has swept across the industry with station owners trying to put themselves in the path of more of political advertising dollars.", "title": "Iowa TV Gets Its Close-Up, Enjoying Outsize Influence", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/business/media/iowa-tv-gets-its-close-up-enjoying-outsize-influence.html", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Elizabeth Wilner", "Donald Trump", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Donald J.

{"body": "DETROIT Detroit\u2019s Big Three automakers are accelerating plans to produce more small cars for the North American market in Mexico as they seek to reduce labor costs, while using higher-paid U.S. workers to build their very profitable trucks, sport utility vehicles and luxury cars. \nNew versions of several of their popular U.S. compact cars are expected to be made in Mexico, people familiar with the companies' plans said. They include General Motors Co\u2019s new Chevrolet Cruze hatchback, a successor to Ford Motor Co\u2019s Focus compact and a replacement for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV\u2019s Jeep Compass compact SUV.\nThe decisions are prompting three major automotive research firms, who are often used by the automakers and their suppliers for industry forecasting, to project a big increase in Mexican output of small cars by the three companies. \nAutoForecast Solutions estimates that GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler will collectively produce 45 percent of their small cars for the North American market in Mexico by 2020, up from 18 percent in 2014. LMC Automotive sees the 2020 figure at 37 percent, also against 18 percent last year, while IHS Automotive projects the Mexican percentage going to 42 percent in five years time, though it calculates the 2014 level at a higher level than the others, at 25 percent.     In response to questions from Reuters, the three automakers declined to discuss their specific plans.\nGM said that the \"vast majority\" of its small cars sold in the U.S. are \"produced domestically.\" Ford said it is \"committed to continuing to improve competitiveness and to invest where it makes the best sense for our business.\" Fiat Chrysler said it \"has made no official announcements regarding the company's future production plans.\"\nThe Detroit automakers' plans to build more small cars in Mexico are likely to be highly controversial ahead of the November 2016 U.S. presidential election. Businessman Donald Trump, who is seeking to win the nomination to be the Republican presidential candidate, has repeatedly blasted U.S. companies, including Ford, for any moves to shift jobs to Mexico from the U.S. and says he would support government incentives to keep auto production in the United States if he gets into the White House. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\nIt is also a huge issue for the U.S. labor unions, who have been highly critical of the impact of free trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada reached when Bill Clinton was U.S. President in 1994. His wife, Hillary Clinton, is the leading contender to be the Democrats' presidential candidate. \nThe Clinton campaign declined to comment.\nUnited Auto Workers President Dennis Williams has faced criticism from union members that he has acquiesced to jobs going south. \"For someone to suggest that we endorse products going to Mexico is just nonsense,\" he wrote to UAW members last month.  The UAW declined a request for a comment for this story.\n\nTINY PROFIT MARGINS\nFor the automakers it is largely a question of cost and margin. They are determined to reduce costs in production of compact and midsize cars, which already suffer from small profit margins or are losing money. \nOverall U.S. sales have been very strong in the past couple of years but larger vehicles such as SUVs and pickup trucks are the big beneficiaries because the plunge in gasoline prices means that fuel economy isn\u2019t as much of an issue for consumers as it was a few years back. The larger vehicles typically generate profits of $10,000 and more each.\nThe Big Three are also feeling the heat from foreign rivals, including Nissan Motor Co and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), who have been adding production capacity in Mexico.\nThe margins on small cars may erode further if production remains in the U.S. because new labor agreements negotiated by GM, Ford and Chrysler grant the first raises in a decade to veteran workers, and give recent hires a path to earn $30 an hour after eight years on the job.\nAt the same time, the Detroit automakers need to continue building and selling small cars to meet ever-tightening U.S. fuel economy regulations because big pickups and SUVs have much lower mileage. \nMexican labor rates, which averaged about $5.50 an hour in 2014, are about a fifth of the wages auto workers earn in the United States, according to the Center for Automotive Research (CAR).\nSean McAlinden, chief economist at CAR, said GM's Orion Township assembly plant in Michigan, which builds Chevrolet and Buick subcompacts, has the lowest labor costs of any U.S. plant thanks to a favorable agreement with the UAW negotiated as part of the U.S. government\u2019s bailout of GM in 2009. And yet the Ford Fiesta plant in Cuautitlan, near Mexico City, has a $700 labor cost advantage per car over GM's Orion plant, he said.\nWith small car sales waning, GM recently announced layoffs at Orion.

{"body": "DETROIT Nov 16 Detroit's Big Three automakers\nare accelerating plans to produce more small cars for the North\nAmerican market in Mexico as they seek to reduce labor costs,\nwhile using higher-paid U.S. workers to build their very\nprofitable trucks, sport utility vehicles and luxury cars.\nNew versions of several of their popular U.S. compact cars\nare expected to be made in Mexico, people familiar with the\ncompanies' plans said. They include General Motors Co's \nnew Chevrolet Cruze hatchback, a successor to Ford Motor Co's\n Focus compact and a replacement for Fiat Chrysler\nAutomobiles NV's Jeep Compass compact SUV.\nThe decisions are prompting three major automotive research\nfirms, who are often used by the automakers and their suppliers\nfor industry forecasting, to project a big increase in Mexican\noutput of small cars by the three companies.\nAutoForecast Solutions estimates that GM, Ford and Fiat\nChrysler will collectively produce 45 percent of their small\ncars for the North American market in Mexico by 2020, up from 18\npercent in 2014. LMC Automotive sees the 2020 figure at 37\npercent, also against 18 percent last year, while IHS Automotive\nprojects the Mexican percentage going to 42 percent in five\nyears time, though it calculates the 2014 level at a higher\nlevel than the others, at 25 percent.\nIn response to questions from Reuters, the three automakers\ndeclined to discuss their specific plans.\nGM said that the \"vast majority\" of its small cars sold in\nthe U.S. are \"produced domestically.\" Ford said it is \"committed\nto continuing to improve competitiveness and to invest where it\nmakes the best sense for our business.\" Fiat Chrysler said it\n\"has made no official announcements regarding the company's\nfuture production plans.\"\nThe Detroit automakers' plans to build more small cars in\nMexico are likely to be highly controversial ahead of the\nNovember 2016 U.S. presidential election.

The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for\ncomment.\nIt is also a huge issue for the U.S. labor unions, who have\nbeen highly critical of the impact of free trade agreements,\nsuch as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with\nMexico and Canada reached when Bill Clinton was U.S. President\nin 1994.

{"body": "EARLIER this month, in Des Moines, the prominent home-schooling advocate and pastor Kevin Swanson again called for the punishment of homosexuality by death. To be clear, he added that the time for eliminating America\u2019s gay population was \u201cnot yet\u201d at hand. We must wait for the nation to embrace the one true religion, he suggested, and gay people must be allowed to repent and convert.\n\nMr. Swanson proposed this at the National Religious Liberties Conference, an event he organized. Featured speakers included three Republican contenders for the presidency: the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\nMr. Huckabee later pleaded ignorance. Yet a quick web search will turn up Mr. Swanson\u2019s references to the demonic power of \u201cthe homosexual Borg,\u201d the unmitigated evil of Harry Potter and the Disney character Princess Elsa\u2019s lesbian agenda.\n\nMr. Cruz apparently felt little need to make excuses. He was accompanying another of the featured speakers at the conference: his father, Rafael Cruz \u2014 a politically connected pastor who told a 2013 Family Leadership Summit that same-sex marriage was a government plot to destroy the family.\n\nOn Saturday, father and son traveled to Bob Jones University in South Carolina to join a Rally for Religious Liberty. Among the speakers was Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, who has called L.G.B.T. activists \u201chateful\u201d and \u201cpawns\u201d of the devil.\n\nThe comfortable thing to do would be to dismiss Mr. Swanson as just another wombat from the embarrassing fringe of American politics. But that would be a mistake. Mr. Swanson\u2019s murderous imaginings did not interfere with his ability to attract senior Republican figures to his conference, including as a keynote speaker Bob Vander Plaats, an Iowa politician who will grant the \u201cMost Wanted Endorsement of 2016,\u201d according to the Conservative Review.\n\nMr. Swanson is the product of a significant political movement that has coalesced around the theme of religious liberty. Many of its leaders and their allies appear at the Family Research Council\u2019s annual Values Voters Summit. Other power centers include Liberty University (now a required stop on the campaign trail); conservative policy organizations like the American Family Association and Concerned Women for America; and Christian legal advocacy groups like Liberty Counsel (whose co-founder, Mat Staver, acted as Kim Davis\u2019s lawyer) and the Alliance Defending Freedom, the legal powerhouse behind the Hobby Lobby decision (whose president, Alan Sears, co-wrote a book in 2003 titled \u201cThe Homosexual Agenda: Exposing the Principal Threat to Religious Freedom Today\u201d).\n\nWhen talking about religious conservatives in America, we might perhaps conjure up an image of a farmer in Iowa or a small-business owner in Ohio who goes to church and holds traditional values. But the leaders to whom such conservatives deliver their votes have a distinct, often different, political vision.\n\nWhen they hail religious liberty, they do not mean the right to pray and worship with other believers. Instead, the phrase has become a catchall for tactical goals of seeking exemptions from the law on religious grounds. To claim exception from the law as a right of \u201creligious refusal\u201d is, of course, the same as claiming the power to take the law into one\u2019s own hands.\n\nThe leaders of this movement are breathtakingly radical. Like Mr. Swanson, they feel persecuted and encircled in a hostile world. Like him, they believe that America will find peace only when all submit to the one true religion.\n\nTrue, few share Mr. Swanson\u2019s taste for genocidal fantasy. But they do share the ultimate goal of capturing the power of the state and remaking society in ways most Americans would find extreme: a world in which men rule in families, women\u2019s reproductive freedom is curtailed and \u201cBible believers\u201d run the government.\n\nThis movement is a power to be reckoned with in Republican Party politics. Mr. Cruz, for one, is basing his strategy on winning its support. Ben Carson told a Liberty University convocation this month of his concern that so many people \u201care trying to push God out of our lives.\u201d And early this year, Mr. Jindal hosted a religious revival rally on the Louisiana State University campus that was sponsored by the American Family Association.\n\nBut the real influence of the movement is in the less visible realm of state legislatures. In 2015 alone, 87 religious refusal-related bills were introduced in 28 states.\n\nAll of this raises some unsettling questions about political life in the United States. When presidential candidates court support among the audience of a pastor who openly discusses the extermination of millions of their fellow citizens, why is this not major news?\n\nMost functioning democratic parties in the modern world have mechanisms for marginalizing elements whose presence will ultimately prove destructive to both the political system and the party itself.

{"body": "Former Republican state Chairman George \"Duf\" Sundheim says he gets it. He gets why \nGOP\n voters across America are turning against establishment presidential candidates and siding with outsiders.\nThe politicians in power haven't delivered on their promises, he says, and people are fed up.\nHe's counting on Californians \u2014 not just Republicans, but \nDemocrats\n and independents \u2014 also rebelling against \"professional politicians\" and propelling his long-shot candidacy for the \nU.S. Senate\n.\n\"Don't write that I'm Pollyanna-ish and I think I've got it all made and this is a walk in the park,\" he told me. \"OK?\"\nOK. All he really sees is a narrow opening that resembles the early stages of the 2016 presidential marathon.\nBut nobody would confuse Sundheim with \nDonald Trump\n or Ben Carson.\nLike those two front-runners for the GOP nomination, Sundheim has never held elective office.\nBut unlike that pair, the prosperous 62-year-old Silicon Valley lawyer has been very active politically. He presided over the state party during the recall of Democratic Gov. Gray Davis and has been pushing for public pension, education and political reforms, plus softening the California GOP's hard-right edges.\nAnd unlike Trump and Carson, he's neither bellicose nor a whisperer, neither an egomaniac nor a bit weird. Sundheim is a regular, civil guy \u2014 outgoing, smiling, thoughtful and likable.\nGeorge \"Duf\" Sundheim, a Silicon Valley lawyer and former chairman of the state \nRepublican Party\n, raised $241,000 for his campaign to replace retiring U.S. Sen. \nBarbara Boxer\n.\nSundheim touted his ability to attract such financial support for a campaign he officially launched just over a month ago,...\nGeorge \"Duf\" Sundheim, a Silicon Valley lawyer and former chairman of the state \nRepublican Party\n, raised $241,000 for his campaign to replace retiring U.S. Sen. \nBarbara Boxer\n.\nSundheim touted his ability to attract such financial support for a campaign he officially launched just over a month ago,...\nHe'd undoubtedly make a fine congressman or legislator. But he lives in a heavily Democratic region \u2014 the San Francisco Bay Area Peninsula \u2014 where no Republican need apply.\nThere's slightly more opportunity statewide, although that also has been a losing running track for the GOP in recent elections. No Republican has won a California U.S. Senate seat since 1988.\nSundheim blames it largely on the national party's image, although in California the GOP clearly has been out of sync with most voters on immigration and social issues.\n\"Obviously the message of the Republican Party isn't resonating with the people of this state,\" he says. \"A lot of that has much more to do with the national party than what is going on now with Republican positions in California.\"\n\"If it comes down to Democrat vs. Republican, I lose,\" Sundheim acknowledges. \"But if it's about who's best for the job, I have confidence the people will choose me.\"\nIt's almost always about Democrat vs. Republican.\nMoreover, Sundheim is a moderate in a state where the relative few remaining GOP voters lean conservative. He's the type of Republican pragmatist who used to win in California.\nHe's staking his chances on a voter mutiny like we're seeing nationally.\n\"You have to be ready for opportunities,\" he says. \"This election cycle is one of those opportunities when you can have change. That's why I'm running.\n\"It's why Carson and Trump are leading in the polls. There's anger with the professional political class in both parties. You see it with Carson, Trump and Carly Fiorina on the Republican side and Bernie Sanders \u2014 who until April was a socialist \u2014 on the Democratic.\n\"People are fed up. They feel nobody's listening to them and nobody cares about them. And you know what? They're right.\"\nIn the 2010 and 2014 congressional elections \"there were big [GOP] waves,\" Sundheim continues. Candidates promised \"they'd go back there and make big changes. And nothing happened. How many times are voters going to let them do 'Lucy and the football'?\n\"In Washington, are people thinking tax reform, immigration reform, job creation, or how do we get a tactical political advantage? The perception is they're thinking 'How do we hold onto our 24 [GOP Senate] seats up for reelection?'\"\nCarson and Trump, he says, \"are perceived to be saying it like it is. We'll see how long it lasts.\"\nHow long does Sundheim think it will? He won't guess, quoting the late baseball philosopher Yogi Berra: \"It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future.\"\nBerra also famously said,\"The future ain't what it used to be.\" That fits any Republican running statewide in California.\nSundheim's first tough task will be to finish at least second in the June \"top-two\" open primary and advance to the November election.\nThere are two better-known and well-funded Democrats running: Atty. Gen. \nKamala D. Harris\n and Rep. \nLoretta Sanchez\n of Santa Ana. There also are two other little-known, underfunded Republicans: Assemblyman Rocky Chavez of Oceanside and conservative Tom Del Beccaro, another former state party chairman.\nTo have any chance of finishing second, Sundheim acknowledges, the other two Republicans must drop out and back him. \"If we don't coalesce around one, it's not worth it.\"\nHe figures Harris finishes No. 1 in the primary and is vulnerable because of her liberal record on \"sanctuary cities,\" crime fighting and education reform.\nSundheim's own positions: He favors abortion rights, same-sex marriage and comprehensive immigration reform that protects the border while providing a path to citizenship for those already here illegally.\n\"In some areas, a wall may be OK,\" he says. \"But we shouldn't be relying on 5th century BC technology.\" He prefers drones.\nHe'd like to see more money spent on water recycling, storage and desalination. He's skeptical of Gov. Jerry Brown's $15.5-billion delta water tunnel plan that \"doesn't add one additional drop.\"\nUnlike many Republicans, he thinks humans are contributing to global warming and \"we should get to a more sustainable energy system as quickly as we can.\"\nSundheim could credibly carry the party banner in California \u2014 while losing.\ngeorge.skelton@latimes.com\nTwitter: @LATimesSkelton", "byline": "", "description": "<p>Former Republican state Chairman George \"Duf\" Sundheim says he gets it.

She replied that he was impugning her integrity, and said that like Mr. Sanders, she has many \u00c2\u00a0small donors. Then the former New York senator awkwardly invoked the 2001 attacks.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI represented New York.

And it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nShe then said her plan to regulate Wall Street was better than his.\nRepublicans pounced. Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, told Mrs. Clinton via Twitter that she had \u00e2\u0080\u009creached a new low\u00c2\u00a0tonight\u00c2\u00a0by using 9/11 to defend your campaign donations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nShe was also criticized by the campaign of former Maryland Gov.

Ami Bera (D-Elk Grove) in a district that encompasses much of the suburbs surrounding Sacramento.\n\"I have always had a servant's heart, and I'm not done serving,\" Jones said at a news conference surrounded by a group of law enforcement and business leaders.\nJones, first elected sheriff in 2010, said he intends to run on a platform that includes economic issues and assistance for veterans and seniors. But his kickoff event made clear that immigration and national security, two issues that are sure to dovetail with 2016's presidential politics, will be the campaign's centerpiece.\n\"Our national leaders are driving us ever closer, ever faster to disaster,\" Jones said.\nThe Republican candidate did not endorse any particular changes to the federal immigration system, nor did he align himself with any of the GOP presidential contenders. He did say, though, that while he believes in additional border security, it is \"untenable\" to deport those who are in the United States without legal status.\nJones will face Bera, a three-term incumbent who has consistently been one of the top targets for Republican backers.

Whether that infighting will translate into weakened support from traditional Democratic backers in 2016 is unclear. Nonetheless, the congressman touted his record in an email to reporters on Monday.\n\"I look forward to a substantive discussion about the issues that matter to my constituents,\" he said.\nJones made national headlines in November 2014 when he posted \na YouTube video\n\u00a0on illegal immigration, addressed to Obama. The video and its criticism of the president came just weeks after \ntwo Sacramento area deputies were killed in the line of duty\n, with one of the suspects later identified by federal officials as having been deported to Mexico twice and in the U.S. without legal authorization.\nJones also used his kickoff event to criticize the administration's approach to the war on terror, in the wake of last week's deadly attacks in Paris.\n\"When America retreats,\" he told reporters, \"the world descends into chaos.\"\nJones said he will not resign or take a leave of absence while running against Bera next year.

{"body": "Sen. Bernie Sanders is trying to put rival Hillary Clinton on the defense over one of her signature issues: paid family leave.\nMr. Sanders backs legislation in Congress\u00c2\u00a0that would create a federal fund to reimburse a portion of lost wages when workers take up to 12 weeks off after the birth or adoption of a child, to care for a family member\u00e2\u0080\u0099s serious health condition or for a serious health problem of their own.\nThe proposal is funded by new payroll tax of two-tenths of a 1% paid by both employers and employees. It is modeled on programs already in place in California, New Jersey and Rhode Island.\nMrs. Clinton talks frequently about the need for paid family leave, but she has not put out a plan. On Friday, her campaign said she would not raise taxes on families earning less than $250,000 a year, a promise that rules out the pending legislation, known as the Family Act.\nMr. Sanders is a co-sponsor of the legislation. In an interview with the Des Moines Register published Monday, Mr. Sanders noted that the plan would cost a typical worker very little each week and asked why his rival wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t backing it.\n\u201cWhat is her program? What does she intend to do other than talk about it?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf she thinks $1.38 a week is just too much to spend, let her explain that to the people of Iowa.\u201d\nA Clinton aide replied by reaffirming that Mrs. Clinton supports 12 weeks of paid family leave and suggesting she would fund it with general revenue.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe supports a different way to pay for it and so will be outlining additional ideas for ensuring the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\nThe Center for American Progress, which has deep ties to Mrs. Clinton and her campaign, is putting out a report in the coming days on family leave that offers three models for a family leave program. One is the social insurance model reflected in the pending legislation. A second approach is to publicly fund the program with general revenue. A third option is to simply mandate that employees provide paid leave.\nIt is not completely clear why Mrs. Clinton would not back the only piece of legislation out there to achieve her goal of providing family leave, but it may be related to a broader debate under way over taxes. Mr. Sanders is proposing a raft of new domestic spending, and Mrs. Clinton and her allies are questioning the taxes he would need to pay for it all. Vowing no tax increases for families earning less than $250,000 a year may make it easier for Mrs. Clinton to draw a contrast.\nMr. Sanders is generally focused on raising taxes on the rich. But in addition to the new tax on paid leave, he also supports a government-run, universal health care plan, which would require a broad-based tax. Existing versions of this idea create a new payroll tax, with the tradeoff being that workers and employers no longer have to contribute to employer-sponsored coverage.\nOn Sunday in Iowa, Mrs. Clinton went after Mr. Sanders on taxes needed for a single-payer health plan. She said middle-class families \u201cneed a raise, not a tax increase\u201d and said she was the only Democrat to commit to raising wages \u201cand not your taxes.\u201d\nA spokesman for Mr. Sanders noted that he has not yet put forward a specific health care proposal. The leading version pending in Congress is expected to cost an additional $15 trillion over a decade in new federal spending, after accounting for projected savings in the cost of care.\nSo if Mrs. Clinton wants to attack Mr. Sanders for increasing taxes on the middle class, it might be tough for her to propose the same, albeit on a much smaller scale, for family leave. It may also be that she sees a family leave program funded by taxes on the wealthy as better policy or as politically easier to enact.\n\n______________________________________________________\n2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll Standings\n\n\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops. \r\n\nCapital Journal Daybreak Newsletter: Sign up to get the latest on politics, policy and defense delivered to your inbox every morning.\r\nFor the latest Washington news, follow @wsjpolitics\r\nFor outside analysis, follow @wsjthinktank", "byline": "", "description": "Sen.

{"body": "The terror attacks in Paris have injected an emotional and unexpected element into the U.S. presidential race. But they are likely to affect the two parties in different ways.\nIn the Republican nomination race, as our colleagues Peter Nicholas and Beth Reinhard write, the apparent reach of ISIS terror machinery into Europe is likely to throw new attention onto the fact that the two leading GOP candidates, Donald Trump and Ben Carson, have no experience in government service or national security.\nThat opens the question of whether GOP primary voters will re-evaluate government experience as a qualification for office and give a second hearing to the struggling Jeb Bush and Chris Christie, both veteran political leaders, or greater consideration to Marco Rubio, who has cast himself as a foreign policy hawk and a student of international affairs.\nThose candidates may now be more eager to campaign on their time in public office.\nDemocrats, by contrast, appear close to settling on the candidate with the most foreign policy experience in their field, Hillary Clinton. Her challenge now will be to preserve her time in office as a political asset, when Republicans will be saying the administration she served help create the instability that gave rise to ISIS.\nThe terror attacks will also play out differently within the two parties because each puts a different emphasis on national security as a campaign issue.\nRepublicans consistently rank it at or near the top of the priority list; Democrats put it well below economic concerns.\nThe latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, conducted in late October, makes the point: Asked to name the top two issues deciding their vote for president, Democrats named the economy, social issues and values, and then health care. For Republicans, foreign policy and the Middle East were the second-most important issue, just after the economy.\nSimilarly, Democrats in a June Journal/NBC News survey listed two economic issues\u00e2\u0080\u0094a shrinking middle class and power wielded by the wealthy\u00e2\u0080\u0094when asked which trends alarmed them the most. Republicans listed terrorism as their second-highest cause for alarm, after declining moral values.\nThat suggests that the issue will play out far differently within the two parties\u00e2\u0080\u0094a development already seen in the hours after the Paris attack.\nDemocratic candidates walked gingerly in their debate Saturday night, calling for the U.S. to play a leadership role in battling ISIS but giving few details of how it should proceed. None of the candidates\u00e2\u0080\u0094not Mrs. Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders or Martin O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Malley, a former Maryland governor\u00e2\u0080\u0094called for committing troops.\nMrs. Clinton did not mention one element of Syria policy where she differs from her rivals and from President Barack Obama. She backs a no-fly zone and \u00e2\u0080\u009chumanitarian corridors\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to protect civilians caught in the fighting; the president doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\nOne question now is whether Democratic voters develop a greater appetite for tougher steps against ISIS, perhaps involving U.S. troops, and whether Mrs. Clinton and her rivals try to lead them to such a position. A similar question holds for independent voters, who also have ranked national security and terrorism relatively low on the priority list, at least until now.\nRepublicans over the weekend detailed more forceful steps they would take against ISIS.

{"body": "Todd Graham is director of debate at Southern Illinois University. His teams have won a national championship for the last three years, and he's been recognized twice as the national debate coach of the year. See his Facebook page. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n (CNN)It's never too early to begin prepping for your next debate.  \nWhether it's an intercollegiate debate or a presidential debate, I've found that the best time to fix both strategy and presentation is when the memory is fresh in your mind.  For the Democrats, here's what to work on from its second debate moving forward.   \n\nSanders began Saturday's debate abysmally.\nBecause of the importance of introductions, debaters must lead off with the most cogent topic.  And the opening can't be scripted or predetermined.  Current events often shift a debate's beginning. \nFor Sanders that opening statement needed to address the events in Paris.  Exclusively.  It was the deadliest attack in France, our oldest ally, since World War II.   \nLeading up to the debate, the terror attacks and killings of at least 129 innocent people in Paris were all that we read about on the Internet, watched on television, discussed at work, and thought about privately ... while wondering if it could ever happen at our own favorite clubs, theaters, or restaurants. \nSanders' introduction appeared disingenuous (although I'm sure that wasn't the intention) when he talked about the tragedy in two measly sentences before pivoting to rail about our rigged economy, our corrupt campaign finance system, and how we needed a political revolution.  The terrorism?  It appeared as an inconvenience, which he simply tacked on to his scripted introduction before advancing to issues important to his campaign.\nIt's a long debate, and he had plenty of time for his own issues. Sanders' poor decision, especially as compared to the other two candidates, who were laser focused on terrorism and security in their introductions, made him appear out of touch.   \nThis can't happen. Ever. Again.  \nSanders improved in some areas from his first debate. He was more nuanced on gun control, better on campaign finance, and stronger with issues about race relations.  He needs to continue those rhetorical changes while working on his spiel about socialism.  \n\nWhat Clinton did well was both her opening and closing.  Clinton's introduction was perfect in both content and tone.  She knew what the audience needed to hear -- the tragedy in Paris, how to deal with ISIS, and the importance of selecting a commander in chief.  Her closing was equally as solid when she asked for support in Iowa and stated that the next president should do everything \"she\" can to lift up the people.   \nClinton's weakness?  When there were areas of disagreement, it was almost always two against one. Guess who was the one? \nOn almost every single question, Martin O'Malley would compare his idea with what he considered a failure of Clinton's past or future policy, and then Sanders would jump right in and do the same, piling on.  The problem for Clinton was that O'Malley and Sanders didn't always agree on their attack point.  So Clinton was left defending herself against two distinct criticisms.\nFor future debates, she needs to channel her inner Andre the Giant (from wrestling and the Princess Bride \u2014 he always fought best against multiple opponents).  Clinton needs to slow the debate down, focus on one criticism at a time, and answer them one by one.  It's the only way to sufficiently deal with multiple areas of disagreement.      \nIndeed, her worst moment was answering the claims that she was in the pocket of big banks and Wall Street.  Clinton's answer?  \n9/11.  Yep.  \nWhile I understood the turn she was trying to make (she was the U.S. senator from New York after 9/11, therefore she helped rebuild), it's a stretch to believe that all her current campaign contributions from influence-peddlers is because of the World Trade Center attacks.   \nNot only was this answer hard to believe, it also left a bad taste in many people's mouths.  In the next debate \u2014 simply explaining her finances better, or not mentioning 9/11 at all would be an improvement over this poorly worded (or thought out) answer.\n\nSimple (but difficult): He needs to stay in the race.  O'Malley clearly won the \"most improved\" debater.  His demeanor and his comfort level were more in line with his opponents.  Plus, he fixed his habit of stumbling weakly out of the gate on each question before gaining his presence.  This debate was a step in the right direction.  \nBut to get to where the other candidates are in debate skill level, O'Malley's team should focus on his persona to make it distinct and noticeable.  He still lacks stage presence, and that's important to fix since he's competing with bigger personalities on stage.\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. \nRead CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.\n", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders: Here's how to improve", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/16/opinions/graham-second-democratic-debate/index.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Todd Graham", "Bernie Sanders", "Hillary Clinton", "Martin O'Malley"], "orgs": ["Southern Illinois University", "World Trade Center"], "election_confidence": 0.5672499184839701, "authors": [{"author_id": 36554, "fullname": "todd graham", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-11-16 23:31:07", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "be948a3e7025bd420b34c470f5c2205a", "date_access": "2015-11-17 00:01:55.039711"},
{"body": "Until last week, the threat from terrorism had received little attention from candidates or voters during the 2016 campaign. In one poll, just 3 percent of Americans rated it the most important problem facing the country.\n\nThe horrific attacks that took place Friday in Paris have, at least for the moment, changed that dynamic. CBS quickly moved to increase the emphasis on foreign policy and national security during Saturday night\u2019s Democratic debate. Candidates are scrambling to adjust to the news, which media analysis has suggested might \u201calter\u201d the character of the race, for instance by helping more experienced candidates like Hillary Rodham Clinton and hurting outsiders like Donald Trump.\n\nHow long-lasting an effect will the Paris attacks have on the United States presidential race? Absent further attacks, the suggestion that Paris will prove to be a \u201cgame changer\u201d is unlikely to be correct. Though unexpected events like Mitt Romney\u2019s \u201c47 percent\u201d taped remarks or the Ebola outbreak often seem tremendously important at the time, they typically fail to alter the dynamics of campaigns or presidencies as much as we expect. Even the killing of Osama bin Laden had little discernible effect on President Obama\u2019s approval ratings. One initial piece of evidence in favor of this hypothesis: Prices in betting markets tracked by David Rothschild of Microsoft Research over the weekend showed virtually no change in the expected winners of the Democratic and Republican presidential nominations or the general election.\n\nWe should also be careful about attributing future events to the attacks. It will be tempting to construct post-Paris narratives in which voters are more likely to select a candidate who can capably serve as commander in chief. But research and history suggest that the primary process is already likely to winnow out outsider and factional candidates like Bernie Sanders, Ben Carson and Mr. Trump who can\u2019t attract widespread support within their party \u2014 precisely the sort whose prospects the attacks might seem most likely to damage. In other words, if the Paris attacks hadn\u2019t happened, some other rationale would have probably been used to force them to the sideline.\n\nWith that said, the attacks may well prompt a renewed focus on foreign policy among Republicans, who are still searching for an issue to run on against Democrats in 2016. With the economy growing relatively steadily, the prospects for a classic referendum campaign against the party in power are uncertain. That\u2019s why so many G.O.P. candidates seized on the events in Paris, which allow them to emphasize an issue in which their party has tended to have an advantage in recent decades. A September Gallup poll found that Republicans enjoyed a 52 percent to 36 percent edge over Democrats on which party would do a better job of protecting the country from international terrorism and military threats.\n\nIf the economic expansion continues, don\u2019t be surprised if you hear Republicans frequently invoking the Paris attacks as a reminder of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s failure to help head off the ISIS threat when she was secretary of state. Politically, it\u2019s easiest for opposition parties to run against a weak economy, but fear may be second best.", "byline": "BRENDAN NYHAN", "description": "Republicans will almost certainly press their criticism on foreign policy, but forecasts of \u201cgame changers\u201d tend to be wrong.", "title": "Road to 2016: Why the Paris Attacks Probably Won\u2019t Change the Election\u2019s Outcome", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/17/upshot/why-the-paris-attacks-probably-wont-change-the-elections-outcome.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "economy"], "people": ["Mitt Romney", "Donald Trump", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Bernie Sanders", "David Rothschild", "Ben Carson"], "orgs": ["Osama bin Laden"], "election_confidence": 0.9781960153884794, "authors": [{"author_id": 338, "fullname": "brendan nyhan", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-11-16 14:23:32", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "ff5d2e633d8068a4f1d137001bbf34ec", "date_access": "2015-11-16 14:34:18.798129"},
{"body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Hillary Rodham Clinton defended her long-running ties to the nation's finance industry on Monday, bringing out allies to argue that she would take a tough approach to regulating the industry despite receiving tens of millions in both personal and campaign cash from Wall Street in her career.\nFormer Rep. Barney Frank, a driving force behind the 2010 financial overhaul law that bears his name, said it was wrong to suggest that lawmakers who pushed for the reforms were influenced by campaign donations from the financial services industry.\nFrank said the bill was approved over the strenuous objections of Wall Street lobbyists and signed by President Barack Obama, whose 2008 campaign received large contributions from the industry.\n\"It's truly stupid, because if you look at the way things have worked, if you look at what Obama got in 2008 and what we then did, if you look at those of us who pushed through a bill over the greater objection of the financial industry, there's no argument there,\" said Frank, who was joined on a conference call set up by the Clinton campaign by Gary Gensler, the former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and now a Clinton campaign adviser.\nThe issue of Clinton's ties to Wall Street are getting a fresh look after last weekend's Democratic presidential debate. The former New York senator invoked the 9/11 attacks during the event to defend herself against suggestions by her main rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, that she is too cozy with Wall Street.\n\"We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country,\" she said.\nClinton's opponents in both parties jumped on that comment, which provoked immediate blowback on social media and a rebuke from The New York Times editorial board. Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said Monday it was \"outrageous\" to suggest she was trying to politicize the 9/11 attacks and people were trying to \"make political mischief\" with her remarks.\nClinton has received far more in contributions from the financial industry than Sanders, whose campaign has been fueled mostly by small donations from across the country. Clinton's campaign has raised about $7.3 million from the finance and insurance industry, according to Crowdpac.com, a nonpartisan political research company.\nThe industry also supported her husband, former President Bill Clinton, during his two White House campaigns and backed her campaigns to serve New York in the Senate.\nBut the campaigns of two of Clinton's would-be Republican challengers are taking in far more from Wall Street than her 2016 campaign. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has raised $22 million and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush $21 million from donors working in the finance and insurance industry, according to Crowdpac.\nAfter her time as secretary of state in Obama's first term, Clinton also received lucrative speaking fees from the industry. Her family's charitable organization, the Clinton Foundation, has also received financial support from Wall Street investment banks.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley has joined in Sanders' critique, saying in an interview with NBC on Monday the question was \"about whether or not Secretary Clinton has a coziness to Wall Street and would follow the ... dictates of those architects of the Wall Street crash and those who believe that big banks are just fine.\"\n\"And the truth is, that is how she feels,\" said O'Malley, the third major Democratic candidate seeking the White House. \"She should just admit it.\"\nBoth Sanders and O'Malley support reinstating the law known as Glass-Steagall, which once separated commercial and investment banks. It was repealed in 1999 when Bill Clinton was in office. Some financial watchdog groups have said the repeal was part of the financial deregulations that worsened the 2008 financial crisis.\nBut Clinton and her advisers argue that Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the failure of large financial institutions, such as investment bank Lehman Brothers and insurer AIG, during the Great Recession.\n\"The secretary is really looking for something that is broader and stronger than an 80-year-old law,\" Gensler said.\n___\nThomas reported from Dallas.

{"body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The Paris attacks are rapidly weakening U.S. support for bringing in thousands more Syrian refugees, as pressure grows in Congress and the Republican presidential campaign to reverse course and governors once open to resettlement now try to shut their states' doors.\nPresident Barack Obama held firm to current plans on Monday, appealing to Americans to \"not close our hearts\" to Syria's victims of war and terrorism and denouncing calls from Republican candidates to favor Syrian Christians over Muslims in the refugee influx. His remarks, at a summit of world leaders in Turkey, seemed aimed at heading off a wave of anti-Muslim sentiment reminiscent of the 9/11 era, as much as keeping open the pathway for refugees.\nAmerica's vision of itself as a welcoming destination for the displaced was colliding with its recent memories of devastation caused by terrorists, all part of a quandary over what to do about the masses of people escaping the brutality of the Syrian conflict, perhaps with radicals in their midst.\nOn Monday:\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Republican lawmakers called for suspension of the Syrian refugee program and threatened to try to stop it in legislation that must pass by Dec. 11 to keep the government running. New House Speaker Paul Ryan neither endorsed nor ruled out that course.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Republican presidential candidates, already skeptical if not hostile to the refugee-welcoming plan before the attacks, stepped up their rhetoric against it. Donald Trump said the U.S. should increase surveillance of mosques, consider closing any of them tied to radicals and be prepared to suspend some civil liberties. He'd been among the first to warn that the refugee crisis could represent a \"Trojan horse\" with terrorists infiltrating the ranks of innocent refugees. Calls by GOP rivals Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush to give preference to Christian refugees from Syria prompted a sharp rebuke from Obama. \"Shameful,\" he said. \"We don't have a religious test for our compassion.\"\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered his state's refugee resettlement program not to accept any more Syrians, and more Republican governors announced or suggested they were suspending cooperation with Washington on the program, at least until they are assured the newcomers were being vetted effectively for security risks. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, also a presidential contender, issued an executive order intended to block Syrian refugees from being resettled in his state. None of the governors, though, has the authority to prevent refugees from moving into a state.\nAt the heart of the debate is the Obama administration's decision to raise the nation's annual limit of 70,000 refugees by 10,000, with most of the new slots for Syrians, in the budget year that started Oct. 1.\nThat potential Syrian influx pales in comparison with the masses coming to Europe and those being accepted elsewhere. Canada, with just more than one-tenth of the U.S. population, plans to take in 25,000 Syrians in the next few months.\nBut indications that at least one of the attackers who killed 129 people in Paris may have crossed into France with refugees have given critics of Obama's plan a footing to demand a cutoff.\n\"Until we can sort out the bad guys, we must not be foolish,\" Republican presidential contender Ben Carson said after a Nevada campaign swing Monday. And he said of Syrians already in the U.S: \"I would watch them very carefully.\"\nLike Trump and others in the GOP race, Carson was critical of the resettlement program before Paris came under assault. But the attacks were persuasive to some who had been more open to the idea or on the fence.\n\"It's not that we don't want to, it's that we can't,\" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said Sunday. In September, he'd been \"open to that\" if effective screening could be assured.\nBush, too, altered his tone, asserting the \"focus ought to be on the Christians who have no place in Syria anymore,\" because \"they're being beheaded, they're being executed by both sides.\" Before the attacks, he had spoken of moderate Muslims also being slaughtered in Syria, when arguing that the U.S. had a responsibility to protect them, as well.\nThe mood in Congress may be altering as well, although the issue was just taking shape. Ryan did not tip his hand on whether he would try to use House budget powers to counter an administration initiative that did not need congressional approval.\nRepublican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama was among those suggesting such a tack. Absent congressional action, he said, \"the United States will begin resettling tens of thousands of poorly vetted Syrian refugees who will eventually be able to bring in their relatives.\" Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, the House budget chairman, said the U.S. \"must suspend our refugee program until certainty is brought to the vetting process.\"\nRep. Adam Schiff of California, senior Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said security checks must be intensified, but \"even with the most thorough precautions, there is some risk associated with allowing refugees into the country. And this is why the current crisis is a test of our character.\"\nAs in Texas and Louisiana, Republican governors in Alabama and Arkansas spoke out against Syrian resettlement. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, who had earlier bucked many fellow Republican leaders by embracing the initiative, said he was suspending the welcome until federal officials reviewed security procedures and clearances. Michigan's \"first priority is protecting the safety of our residents,\" he said.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Alicia A.

Greg Abbott ordered his state's refugee resettlement program not to accept any more Syrians, and some other Republican governors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including two GOP presidential contenders, John Kasich of Ohio and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana \u00e2\u0080\u0094 announced or suggested they were suspending cooperation with Washington on the program, at least until assured the newcomers were being vetted effectively for security risks. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, also a presidential candidate, said not even \"orphans under 5\" should be let in because the government can't be trusted to check people properly.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Republican lawmakers called for suspension of the federal Syrian refugee program and threatened to try to stop it in legislation that must pass by Dec. 11 to keep the government running. New House Speaker Paul Ryan neither endorsed nor ruled out that course.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Other Republican presidential candidates, already skeptical if not hostile to the refugee-welcoming plan before the attacks, stepped up their rhetoric against it. Donald Trump said the U.S. should increase surveillance of mosques, consider closing any of them tied to radicals and be prepared to suspend some civil liberties. He'd been among the first to warn that the refugee crisis could represent a \"Trojan horse\" with terrorists infiltrating the ranks of innocent refugees. Calls by GOP rivals Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush to give preference to Christian refugees from Syria prompted a sharp rebuke from Obama. \"Shameful,\" he said. \"We don't have a religious test for our compassion.\"\nAt the heart of the debate is the Obama administration's decision to raise the nation's annual limit of 70,000 refugees by 10,000, with most of the new slots for Syrians, in the budget year that started Oct. 1.\nThat potential Syrian influx pales in comparison with the masses coming to Europe and those being accepted elsewhere. Canada, with just more than one-tenth of the U.S. population, plans to take in 25,000 Syrians in the next few months.\nBut indications that at least one of the attackers who killed 129 people in Paris may have crossed into France with refugees have given critics of Obama's plan a footing to demand a cutoff.\n\"Until we can sort out the bad guys, we must not be foolish,\" Republican presidential contender Ben Carson said after a Nevada campaign swing Monday. And he said of Syrians already in the U.S., \"I would watch them very carefully.\"\nLike Trump and others in the GOP race, Carson was critical of the resettlement program before Paris came under assault. But the attacks were persuasive to some who had been more open to the idea or on the fence.\n\"It's not that we don't want to, it's that we can't,\" said one of them, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.\nBush, too, altered his tone, asserting the \"focus ought to be on the Christians who have no place in Syria anymore,\" because \"they're being beheaded, they're being executed by both sides.\" Before the attacks, he had spoken of moderate Muslims also being slaughtered in Syria, when arguing that the U.S. had a responsibility to protect them, as well.\nThe mood in Congress, too, may be shifting, although the issue was just taking shape. Ryan did not tip his hand on whether he would try to use House budget powers to counter an administration initiative that did not need congressional approval.\nAbsent congressional action, said Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, \"the United States will begin resettling tens of thousands of poorly vetted Syrian refugees who will eventually be able to bring in their relatives.\" Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, the House budget chairman, said the U.S. \"must suspend our refugee program until certainty is brought to the vetting process.\"\nAmong governors now balking at the program, Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, who had bucked many fellow Republican leaders by embracing the initiative, said he was suspending the welcome until federal officials reviewed security procedures and clearances.\nChristie, interviewed by conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, said, \"I would not permit them in.\" When asked whether that includes orphans under 5, he said, \"I don't think orphans under 5 are being \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you know \u00e2\u0080\u0094 should be admitted into the United States at this point.\"\nThat was a distinct change of tone from September, when Christie declared that Obama, through inaction, \"has allowed these folks to be slaughtered\" in Syria. \"I frankly can't imagine as president of the United States how you could permit this to happen on this scale,\" he said.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Alicia A.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Sunday told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that the U.S. should admit Syrian Christians, after proper vetting. Other Republican candidates have called for a ban on allowing Syrians into the U.S. All three Democratic presidential candidates have said they would admit Syrians but only after thorough background checks.\nBut Friday night's mass killings in Paris, which left at least 129 people dead, offered evidence that may have backed up what many, including Rubio, had been warning: People with secret ties to Islamic militants could flow across borders as part of waves of refugees.\nAuthorities said a Syrian passport found near one of the Paris attackers that had been registered last month and traveled through three countries along a busy migrant corridor known for lax controls. It was not clear whether the document was real or forged. Officials on Sunday were still trying to identify people involved in the conspiracy. They said as many as three of the seven suicide bombers who died in the attacks were French citizens.\nA spokesman for President Barack Obama said Sunday that the administration is moving forward with its plan to thoroughly vet and admit as many as 10,000 Syrian refugees.\n\"What we need to be able to do frankly is sort out that foreign fighter flow, those who have gone into Syria and come out and want to launch attacks or those people who have connections with ISIL in Syria,\"  Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said on Fox News Sunday. \"At the same time, we have to recognize there's tragic victims of this conflict, there are women, and children, orphans of this war and I think we need to do our part, along with our allies, to provide them a safe haven.\"\nGOP presidential hopeful Ben Carson said Syrian refugees should not be brought to the U.S. because it is too easy for jihadis, intent on \"wreaking havoc in this country,\" to embed with them. \"There's no reason we should be facilitating such a thing,\" he said after a southern Nevada rally Sunday. Instead, he spoke of giving Syrians unspecified help to stay in their country.\nThe Paris attacks have elevated national security in the presidential contest. In Saturday night's Democratic presidential debate, which began with a moment of silence for the Paris victims, all three candidates \u00e2\u0080\u0094 former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton, Sen.

Martin O'Malley \u00e2\u0080\u0094 said the U.S. should admit far more than the 10,000 Syrians to which Obama has committed, but only with proper screening.\nRubio on Sunday said that was impossible.\n\"You can't pick up the phone and call Syria, and that's one of the reasons why I said we won't be able to take more refugees,\" Rubio said on ABC.\nThat is a switch from Rubio's other statements this fall, in which he voiced skepticism about proper vetting but still left the door open to admitting refugees.  In September, he told Boston Herald radio: \"We've always been a country that's been willing to accept people who have been displaced. And I would be open to that if it can do it in a way that allows us to ensure that among them are not infiltrated, people who are part of a terrorist organization.\"\nFormer Florida Gov.

The poll found 76 percent opposed sending regular ground troops to the region.\nRepublicans competing for their party's presidential nomination sounded out a variety of themes to appeal to conservatives who feel President Barack Obama's reliance on air strikes to counter the rise of Islamic State has been weak.\nThey called for more troops on the ground in the Middle East, a no-fly zone over Syria and better coordination with allies after the attacks in Paris that killed 129 people at a concert, restaurants and other locations.\nTrump, the billionaire businessman who has promised to deport every illegal immigrant in the United States and leads the Republican field in most polls, went perhaps the furthest in saying he would consider shutting down mosques to prevent Muslims in the United States from becoming radicalized.\n\"I would hate it do it, but it's something that you're going to have to strongly consider because some of the ideas and some of the hatred, the absolute hatred, is coming from these areas,\" Trump said.\nObama, who has been adamant about limiting the number of American ground troops and U.S. casualties, told a news conference after a G-20 summit in Turkey that it would be a mistake for the United States to switch its strategy and put U.S. troops in combat against Islamic State.\nBush, the former Florida governor who is set to give a national security speech on Wednesday in South Carolina, said American troops could provide leadership in the fight against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, but did not call for a massive reintroduction of U.S. troops into Iraq.\nBush faces a challenge to sound tough on terrorism without seeming too much like his brother, former President George W. Bush, who ordered the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq.\nJeb Bush wants a no-fly zone over Syria and a more aggressive U.S. diplomatic effort to build an international coalition, and he said more U.S. troops should be embedded with the Iraqi military, provide more training for Kurdish peshmerga forces and work more with Sunni tribal leaders.\n\"We can't do this alone ... but we can lead,\" Bush said.\nTrump also said he backed some U.S. troops, perhaps 10,000, in the region but would instead focus on targeting Islamic State's oil and banking operations.\nRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, another Republican contender, said the right number of troops was \"whatever the Pentagon says they need to accomplish that mission.\"\n\nRESETTLE REFUGEES\nThe Republican candidates raised concerns about Obama's plan to bring into the United States as many as 10,000 refugees fleeing Syria. They said militants entering the country as refugees could pose a threat, after reports that one of the Paris attackers might have traveled with a group of refugees.\n\"There simply is not a way to vet these refugees,\" said Carson, calling for any funds for resettling refugees to be withheld.\nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, a low-polling Republican candidate, said he had suspended any settlement of Syrian refugees in his state, as other governors have done.\nBush called for special protections for Syrian Christians fleeing to the United States.\n\"We should focus on creating safe havens for refugees in Syria rather than bringing them all the way across to the United States,\" Bush told MSNBC.\nObama said it was \"shameful\" to consider giving Christian refugees preference over other families seeking to escape violence. Carson said religious tests were inappropriate, but he said the United States could conduct \"ideological\" tests.\nU.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, the most hawkish on military action, called on Obama to coordinate military efforts with the French and allies in the Middle East to combat the militants.\nU.S. Senator Ted Cruz released a television ad in which he said that if he becomes president, \"enemies across this world will know the United States is not to be trifled with.\" Ohio Governor John Kasich will discuss national security on Tuesday in Washington. \nFor more on the 2016 U.S. presidential race and to learn about the undecided voters who determine elections, visit the Reuters website (here).\n\n (Additional reporting by Lisa Lambert, Erin McPike, Emily Stephenson and Ginger Gibson; Writing by Steve Holland; Editing by Bill Trott, Will Dunham and Peter Cooney)", "byline": "", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidates vowed on Monday to take a tougher approach toward Islamic State militants, with Jeb Bush saying a larger Middle East troop presence is needed and Donald Trump saying he would consider closing some mosques in the United States.", "title": "U.S. Republican candidates vow tougher approach on Islamic State", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/9XKoQrrxgp0/story01.htm", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Lisa Lambert", "Emily Stephenson", "Bill Trott", "Will Dunham", "Lindsey Graham", "Jeb Bush", "John Kasich", "Donald Trump", "George W.

{"body": "WASHINGTON \u2014  Bernie Sanders dispensed with the threat from the Islamic State in two sentences at the start of the Democratic debate before abruptly pivoting to the dangers of a \u201crigged economy.\u201d Ben Carson struggled to answer a simple question on Sunday about how he would form a coalition to fight the militant group. And Marco Rubio, after pushing out a new video about the \u201cclash of civilizations,\u201d revamped his plans for an important Monday appearance before a group of executives on the assumption that terrorism, not tax rates, would be their most pressing concern.\n\nThe assault on Paris has thrust national security to the heart of the presidential race, forcing candidates to scramble and possibly prompting voters to reconsider their flirtations with unconventional candidates and to take a more sober measure of who is prepared to serve as commander in chief.\n\nUntil now, the campaign, when it did not descend into insult comedy on Twitter or become mired in biographical disputes, was focused on a subtler sort of threat to the country\u2019s way of life: economic and racial inequality, for Democrats, and a less-defined fury about a loss of America\u2019s identity, for Republicans. But the bloodshed in the heart of Paris posed concrete questions about how the contenders would respond to an urgent and seemingly metastasizing threat.\n\n\u201cI think this incident in Paris will break down some of the false sense of separation from the experience the rest of the world is having with terrorism,\u201d said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware. He predicted that the campaign would \u201cbegin to focus as much on national security and foreign affairs as domestic matters and economic security.\u201d\n\nOr, as Tom Ridge, a former secretary of Homeland Security, put it: \u201cThe barbarians are no longer at the gate. They\u2019re inside.\u201d\n\nLess than three months before the Iowa caucuses, the attack may prompt some Democrats who have had misgivings about Hillary Rodham Clinton to come to terms with her given the potential for a general election overshadowed by terrorism. Republicans, whose primary is far more volatile, may now ask whether candidates like Mr. Carson, who claimed at one point that China was becoming involved in Syria, and Donald J. Trump, who suggested the battle against the Islamic State could be left to Russia, are wise choices in a world where Western capitals can be made into killing fields.\n\n\u201cVoters are very dubious about our ability to remake the world, but they\u2019re very serious about us defending ourselves,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker. \u201cThey have a very low tolerance for being frightened.\u201d\n\nMuch is not known about the attack\u2019s impact on the race, given short attention spans in politics and the news media and the fact that it did not occur on American soil \u2014 though it could affect the discussion of issues like the balance between intelligence-gathering and civil liberties or the closing of the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.\n\nWhat is almost certain is that the demands on the candidates will grow more exacting. As previous presidential campaigns jarred by outside events have demonstrated, how a candidate responds can be as important to a campaign as the event itself.\n\nThere have already been telling responses that could resound as the threat of terrorism becomes more central to the campaign. Mr. Sanders\u2019s cursory treatment of the attack and the larger challenge of terrorism at the start of the debate on Saturday seemed to fall short, particularly after Mrs. Clinton followed him by speaking at length about the assault and confronting the threat of terror.\n\nAnd while Mr. Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, has struggled with policy before, his inability to answer a straightforward question three times on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d about whom he would first call to put together a military alliance to confront the Islamic State appeared more consequential than it might have before Paris.\n\nMrs. Clinton was already tightening her grip on the Democratic race before the attacks. But for Republicans, the bloodshed seemed more likely to shift the direction of the campaign. What is unclear is in which direction.\n\nAs the shock of the Friday attacks wore off, many of the hard-liners in the Republican field were moving to focus on blocking Syrian refugees from coming to America. \u201cTo bring them here under these circumstances is a suspension of intellect,\u201d Mr. Carson declared Sunday.\n\nThe day before, at a rally in Beaumont, Tex., Mr. Trump was just as blunt, claiming without any evidence that President Obama wanted to take in 250,000 Syrian refugees. \u201cYou\u2019d have to be insane,\u201d he said. And Mike Huckabee called for denying entry to travelers from countries with a \u201cstrong presence\u201d of the Islamic State or Al Qaeda.\n\nOther Republicans expressed cautious optimism over the weekend that the Paris attack would snap voters out of a dalliance with contenders who display little familiarity with the military or the intelligence community, let alone with the intricacies of the geopolitical landscape on which the Islamic State is being pursued.\n\n\u201cI think that when you look at the dimensions of this tragedy, most Republican voters will not be satisfied with \u2018We\u2019ll bomb the S out of them,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Senator John McCain of Arizona, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s more pungent vow last week.\n\nMr. Ridge said: \u201cBombast doesn\u2019t cut it. Inexperience doesn\u2019t cut it. Those who have a record of governance and demonstrated leadership capabilities \u2014 their stock is going to rise.\u201d\n\nCandidates who fit that profile have wasted little time since the attacks articulating their vision for confronting terrorism and jockeying to see who can demonstrate the most resolve.\n\nMr. Rubio, the Florida senator, anticipated that a question-and-answer session with business leaders in Washington on Monday would focus on how to eradicate terrorism. Jeb Bush was recasting an address about rebuilding the military, to be delivered Wednesday at the Citadel in South Carolina, to expand on his argument for America leading the campaign against the Islamic State. And aides to Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a former federal prosecutor, and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, who had a long career in Congress, said their stump speeches, already replete with references to their national security experience, would focus even more heavily on the subject.\n\n\u201cIt does give an advantage to serious candidates,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. \u201cBecause this is an opportunity for them to emphasize their experience and give the kinds of speeches and explanations of this threat that will prompt people to say, \u2018Hey, they know what they\u2019re talking about.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n\nThere are risks, though. After the capture of Saddam Hussein in 2003, Howard Dean, then the Democratic front-runner, sought to portray himself as a more serious candidate by delivering an expansive foreign policy speech. But he inserted a line claiming that Hussein\u2019s capture had \u201cnot made America safer,\u201d which only reinforced doubts about Mr. Dean.\n\nYet the question looming over the Republican race is whether such traditional rules of politics still apply. Further, the scale of the assault, its direct link to the Islamic State and the fact that one of the attackers appeared to have been a Syrian refugee who came to Europe through Greece is also pushing the Republican candidates to speak more loudly about keeping Middle Eastern migrants out of the United States.\n\nShould the reaction to Paris become conflated with matters of migration, it could empower those candidates willing to raise the rhetorical stakes and appeal to voters who are as concerned about immigration as they are terrorism.\n\n\u201cIf in fact it becomes more clear that a critical aspect was a refugee problem, and the issue blends, that could play into somebody like Trump\u2019s hands,\u201d said Paul Maslin, a Democratic pollster. \u201cBecause then it gets to a larger narrative that the West has to shut down its borders \u2014 and then you\u2019re playing with fire.\u201d", "byline": "JONATHAN MARTIN", "description": "The assault on Paris has thrust national security to the heart of the presidential race, forcing candidates to scramble to address terrorism concerns.", "title": "Political Memo: In Presidential Campaign, It\u2019s Now Terrorism, Not Taxes", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/us/politics/national-security-thrust-into-center-of-presidential-race.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["John R.

{"body": "Washington (CNN)A clearly angry President Barack Obama on Monday used the world stage to call out Republican presidential candidates for being counterproductive, \"talking as if they're tough\" on ISIS and stoking fears about Muslim refugees from Syria.\nSpeaking to the press in Turkey at the G20 Summit with world leaders, his harshest remarks were for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, and though Obama did not name Cruz, he made it very clear he was infuriated with the GOP firebrand. \n\"When I hear folks say that maybe we should just admit the Christians and not the Muslims (refugees), when I hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which person who's fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted, when some of those folks themselves come from families who benefited from protection when they were fleeing political persecution, that's shameful. That's not American,\" Obama said, raising his voice.\nCruz's father emigrated to the United States from Cuba and said he was the victim of brutal beatings at the hands of the Cuban dictator before Fidel Castro. The presidential hopeful has also said Christians from war-torn Syria are victims and do not pose a risk of terrorism, whereas letting in Muslim refugees would be \"lunacy.\"\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush also said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday the U.S. should focus its assistance in Syria on Christians.\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio's parents also left Cuba and stayed in the U.S. for fear of political persecution, a fact he, like Cruz, often raises on the campaign trail. After the Paris attack, he has called for not accepting any Syrian refugees in the U.S., after previously being open to helping some.\nRELATED: 2016ers express alarm over refugees\nIn Monday's news conference from Turkey, where Obama is attending G20 meetings with world leaders, the President called the position a \"dark impulse\" and praised Republican former President George W. Bush for saying explicitly after the Sept. 11 attacks that we are not at war with Islam itself. \n\"The notion that some of those who have taken on leadership in his party would ignore all that, that's not who we are. On this, they should follow his example, it was the right one. The right impulse. Our better impulse,\" Obama said. \n\"The values that we're fighting against ISIL for is precisely that we don't discriminate against people because of their faith, that we don't kill people different than us,\" Obama said. \"It is good to remember that the United States does not have a religious test.\"\nObama went so far as to say promoting the notion that the terror attacks in Paris are the core views of Islam could lead to \"greater recruitment\" for the terrorist group.\nIt was not the only time during his speech and answers that he was clearly going after the Republicans running to replace him.\nIn the remarks defending his strategy against ISIS, Obama repeatedly said that the only suggestion from his critics that the U.S. isn't already pursuing is committing more troops to the Middle East, and he said that the best military minds in the U.S. believe that would be a losing strategy. \nRELATED: Obama defends 'right strategy' against ISIS\nHe said he'd consider any serious suggestions out there, regardless of where they came from, but wouldn't put up with posturing. He took a veiled swipe at front-runner Donald Trump, who is known for his \"make America great again\" slogan.\n\"What I'm not interested in doing is posing or pursuing some notion of American leadership or America winning or whatever other slogans they come up with that has no relationship to what is actually going to work to protect the American people and to protect the people in the region who are getting killed and to protect our allies,\" Obama said. \"I'm too busy for that\"\nObama also stood strongly against the notion that American leadership comes in the form of appearing tough.\n\"Some of them seem to think that if I were just more bellicose in expressing what we're doing, that would make a difference, because that seems to be the only thing that they're doing, is talking as if they're tough,\" Obama said. \nAnd Trump's close second in the polls, Ben Carson, did not escape Obama's wrath after saying last week that perhaps his sources on Syria were better than the White House's after he said China is involved in Syria. \n\"Folks want to pop off and have opinions about what they think they would do: Present a specific plan,\" Obama said. \"If they think that somehow their advisers are better than the chairman of my Joint Chiefs of Staff and the folks who are actually on the ground, I want to meet them.\"\nRELATED: Trump: Syrian refugees a 'Trojan horse'\n", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Obama slams GOP for idea of religious test for refugees", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/16/politics/obama-slams-2016-candidates-donald-trump-ted-cruz-on-syria/index.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Fidel Castro", "Jeb Bush", "George W.

{"body": "Washington (CNN)Bernie Sanders looked to the Republicans Monday night at Cleveland State University for a hand up on his answer to the attacks in Paris and ISIS and he found it.\nThe Vermont senator and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate weaved the promises of Republican governors Monday that they would not accept Syrian refugees with former President George W. Bush's press for the Iraq War in 2003 into a one-sentence policy line that lit up the crowd of roughly 6,000 in Cleveland.\n\"We gotta be tough, but not stupid!!\" Sanders yelled. \nSanders cautioned against \"Islamophobia\" amid calls from Republican governors across the U.S. that they would not accept Syrian refugees and a press by candidates to seek federal legislation barring Syrian relocations. \n\"I am disturbed by some of what I am hearing from my Republican colleagues,\" Sanders said. \"During these difficult times as Americans, we will not succumb to racism.

{"body": "Washington (CNN)Foreign policy is the new focus on the 2016 campaign trail in the wake of the deadly terrorist attacks in Paris, marking a new chapter in the race for the White House that has so far focused on issues such as immigration, the economy and bringing change to Washington.\nRepublican presidential candidates raised red flags about U.S. border security and the admission of Syrian refugees Sunday in the wake of the Paris attacks. Democrats, meanwhile, pointed to new challenges -- with Hillary Clinton calling ISIS an \"unusually effective threat\" and Bernie Sanders saying climate change remains crucial to national security. \nAs President Barack Obama huddled at an international summit in Turkey with Russia's Vladimir Putin and other world leaders, several GOP White House contenders faulted him for failing to take the rise of the ISIS more seriously and called on Obama to revisit plans to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees in 2016. \nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, issued a dire warning, saying that \"there's another 9/11 coming and it's coming from Syria.\" \n\"I believe the United States and the world needs to go on offense and stop the reason people have to leave Syria,\" Graham said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"The good people are leaving because they're being raped and murdered and some terrorists are trying to get in their ranks. The best thing the world could do for Syrian people is to create a safe haven within Syria, a no-fly zone.\"\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush called for a \"thorough screening\" of those refugees in an appearance on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \n\"I think we need to be obviously very, very cautious,\" Bush said. \nBut Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said the United States shouldn't take any of those refugees at all on ABC's \"This Week.\" \n\"We won't be able to take more refugees,\" he said. \"It's not that we don't want to, it's that we can't. Because there's no way to background check someone that's coming from Syria. Who do you call and do a background check on them?\" \nFormer Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum agreed, saying that \"under no circumstances\" should the United States take Syrian refugees. \n\"By taking in persecuted Christians, Jews, and moderate Muslims, we are complicit in helping ISIS accomplish their goal of establishing an Islamic caliphate,\" Santorum said in a statement. \"Without Christians, Jews, or moderate Muslims in the region, radical Islam will be allowed to run rampant.\"\nOn \"Fox News Sunday,\" Ben Carson said the West should \"wage a counter-war against them utilizing social media, and all the same mechanisms that they use.\" He also opposed allowing Syrian refugees into the United States. \n\"Bringing people into this country from that area of the world I think is a huge mistake,\" he said. \"Because why wouldn't they infiltrate them with people who are ideologically opposed to us? It would be foolish for them not to do that. So, we need to be very compassionate to understand that these people have been displaced and we should use our expertise and resources to help get them resettle over there, and to support them over there, but to bring them here under these circumstances is a suspension of intellect.\"\nIt wasn't just Republicans talking ISIS on Sunday. At an event with Central Iowa Democrats, Clinton talked ISIS, calling the terrorist group an \"unusually effective threat.\"\n\"I say that because this is sort of the first internet fueled terrorist group,\" the former secretary of state said. \"ISIS is very agile and quite adept at using the Internet to propagandize, to recruit even train insight. We have to be equally so to stand up for our values, to stand up for who we are as a people. Attacking Paris, the city of light, reminds us that there is no middle ground in going after these terrorists.\"\nClinton suggested \"pulling countries off the sidelines so that they work with us and contribute to this ongoing struggle against radical jihadism.\"\nOn CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Clinton's primary rival for the Democratic nomination, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, said climate change is a major national security threat -- including in the rise of ISIS. \n\"When you have drought, when people can't grow their crops, they're going to migrate into cities,\" Sanders said. \n\"And when people migrate into cities and they don't have jobs, there's going to be a lot more instability, a lot more unemployment, and people will be subject to the types of propaganda that al-Qaeda and ISIS are using right now,\" he said. \"So, where you have discontent, where you have instability, that's where problems lie. And certainly, without a doubt, climate change will lead to that.\"\nLater Sunday, during a speech at Simpson College in Iowa, Sanders called for the United States to work with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran in combating ISIS. \n\"We have different points of view ... but Russia has got to join us. We are concerned about Iran, but Iran has to join us. We have concerns about Saudi Arabia, but Saudi Arabia has to join us,\" he said. \nSanders added: \"If all over the world these attacks are taking places, the world has got to come together.\"\nIn Saturday night's Democratic debate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley cast the threat of ISIS as evidence for the need for a new generation of leaders. \n\"We must be able to work collaboratively with others. We must anticipate these threats before they happen. This is the new sort of challenge, the new sort of threat that does, in fact, require new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership,\" he said.\nGOP candidates had bashed Obama's Syrian refugee plans on Saturday, as well. \n\"We all have heart and we all want people taken care of, but with the problems our country has, to take in 250,000 -- some of whom are going to have problems, big problems -- is just insane. We have to be insane. Terrible,\" Donald Trump said Saturday at a rally in Beaumont, Texas.\nCarson expressed similar skepticism at the Sunshine Summit in Florida.\n\"If I were one of the leaders of the global jihadist movement and I didn't infiltrate that group of people with my people ... that would be almost malpractice,\" Carson said. \nFormer New York Gov. George Pataki said in a statement that \"we must put an immediate halt to granting asylum to Syrian refugees.\"\nRepublicans also complained that U.S. immigration policies and border security problems make the country vulnerable. \n\"This also calls to mind the need to make sure we protect our borders, our southern border particularly,\" Bush said. \nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said it's time for the United States \"to close our borders and keep our people safe from these radical, evil terrorists.\" \nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said the United States doesn't \"just have open borders like they do in Europe.\" \nAt the Sunshine Summit in Florida on Saturday, Carly Fiorina accused Obama of accepting refugees \"unilaterally\" and not pledging to verify that they have no ties to terrorism. She also slammed Obama over his comments right before the attack that ISIS had been \"contained.\"\n\"I am angry. I am angry that just yesterday morning, our president, against all evidence, declared ISIS contained and took a victory lap,\" the former Hewlett-Packard CEO said. \"ISIS is not a 'JV team,' Mr. President, they are not contained, they are at our shores and they measure their victory in body count.\"\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul told the gathering in Florida he \"wouldn't invite the refugees in the first place.\"\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said at the summit Saturday Obama's \"inexperience has put America at risk again.\"\n\"He sees the world as he likes to see it: as a fantasy. I see the world as it really is, and it's time for a president who sees the world as it really is, not how he wishes it would be,\" Christie said.\nOhio Gov. John Kasich said the U.S. should urge NATO to invoke Article 5, a provision that says an attack on one NATO ally -- such as France -- is an attack against all of NATO and its member states.\n\"We as Americans must assert leadership and we need to stand shoulder to shoulder with France and the French people,\" Kasich said. \"This is a moment to bring us together.\"\nOn Friday, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said the attack represented an \"escalation\" in the fight between western civilization and jihadists.\n\"We must now face the facts,\" Cruz said in a statement. \"Between the downing of the Russian jet over Egypt and this massive coordinated attack on Paris, we are seeing an unmistakable escalation of ISIS' ambitions.\"\n", "byline": "", "description": "Obama: Paris attacks 'outrageous' | Officials: No known threat to U.S. | Kasich calls for NATO action Trump: Paris victims should have been armed | Carson vows tough response | Santorum tears into Obama", "title": "Paris attacks become focus of 2016 race", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/16/politics/paris-attacks-isis-2016-reaction/index.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Rick Santorum", "Martin O'Malley", "Chris Christie", "Lindsey Graham", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "John Kasich", "Donald Trump", "George Pataki", "Marco Rubio", "Mike Huckabee", "Barack Obama", "Vladimir Putin", "Bobby Jindal", "Bernie Sanders", "Carly Fiorina", "Ben Carson", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": ["GOP White House", "NATO", "Simpson College", "United States."], "election_confidence": 0.9967712523798667, "authors": [{"author_id": 2529, "fullname": "eric bradner", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-11-16 11:18:28", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "9c35d175096cb04509adc878f7986c88", "date_access": "2015-11-16 12:01:37.277532"},

But this chart, showing the number of deaths and injuries caused by terrorist attacks in the U.S. from 1995 to 2014, paints a more complex picture.\nHere are those numbers again, this time shown as a mosaic. Each rectangle is an individual incident, scaled according to the number of deaths and injuries involved (hover or tap on the chart for more information about each).\nTo get a more detailed profile of the people who are willing to harm Americans to further their ideological goals, BuzzFeed News turned to data compiled by the New America think tank on 497 extremists indicted or killed in the U.S. since 9/11 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including 314 militant Islamists and 140 right-wing extremists.

And in the wake of last week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attacks in Paris, other contenders for the GOP nomination have called for a rethink of plans to take in Syrian refugees.\nThis chart may surprise you. According to the GTD, the number of terrorist incidents in the U.S. has declined markedly since the 1970s, when the most active groups included left-wing extremists such as the New World Liberation Front and the Weather Underground Organization.

And why do they want to hurt us? \nTo see the big picture, BuzzFeed News has crunched the numbers on deaths and injuries caused by terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, categorizing them by the extremist ideologies involved.\nMilitant Islamist terrorism dominates, but extremists from the political right also pose a potent threat. And our analysis contains a surprising message: Although another devastating event like 9/11, the Oklahoma City bombing, or last week's attacks in Paris could change everything, violent extremism has actually been in decline.\n\nTwo decades of casualties reveal the extreme ideologies that threaten American lives.\nPeter Aldhous for BuzzFeed News / Via start.umd.edu\nIn the aftermath of 9/11, it has become easy to equate terrorism with violent Islamists. But this chart, showing the number of deaths and injuries caused by terrorist attacks in the U.S. from 1995 to 2014, paints a more complex picture.\nYes, those waging a violent jihad against America are responsible for the largest number of casualties by far \u2014 but they are not alone.\nTo tally attacks, deaths, and injuries, BuzzFeed News used the most authoritative academic source, the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) maintained by START, the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, at the University of Maryland. To help make sense of the numbers, we attributed the 97 attacks involving casualties to broad ideological categories, consulting with Erin Miller, a criminologist at START who manages the GTD.\nTerrorism is notoriously difficult to define. The GTD defines it as \"the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion or intimidation.\" By this definition, the two most prolific U.S. terrorist groups over the past 20 years are the Earth Liberation Front and the Animal Liberation Front, each responsible for more than 60 incidents.\nBut environmental and animal rights extremists have mostly targeted institutions, not individuals \u2014 so although many buildings have burned, these terrorists are responsible for only two injuries and one death since 1995.\nExtremists motivated by their opposition to abortion have pursued a deadlier brand of single-issue terrorism. The most notorious was Eric Rudolph, now serving life without parole for bombing the Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta during the 1996 Olympics, killing one spectator and injuring 110 more. Rudolph acted in the name of the Army of God, later stating that he wanted to \"embarrass the Washington government in the eyes of the world for its abominable sanctioning of abortion on demand.\"\nThe attacks BuzzFeed News categorized as Islamist terrorism include some committed by Muslims who may have been motivated as much by opposition to U.S. foreign policy and military actions as by religion. These include the 2013 Boston Marathon bombers, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Although the FBI stressed the pair's extreme Islamist beliefs, the note scrawled by Dzhokhar on the boat in which he hid after a police shootout claimed he had acted in retribution for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nThere are clear parallels with the bloodiest incident in the nationalist category: In 1997, Ali Hassan Abu Kamal shot seven people, killing one, on the observation deck of the Empire State Building. He apparently wanted to punish the United States for its support for Israel in its conflict with the Palestinians.\nRight-wing extremists, meanwhile, divide into two broadly distinct groups. One, typified by the 1995 Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, is driven by distrust of the U.S. federal government.\nThen there are the white supremacists. They include Wade Michael Page, who stormed the Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, in August 2012, killing six worshippers and wounding four more. When the GTD is updated for 2015, it will also include the murder of nine black members of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, gunned down in June by 21-year-old Dylann Roof, seen posing online with the Confederate flag.\nDespite the best efforts of the FBI and researchers at START, the ideological motivation for some incidents remains obscure. These include the anthrax-tainted letters that killed five people and sickened another 17 in 2001, further terrorizing a jittery nation in the aftermath of 9/11.\n\nView Entire List \u203a", "title": "Here Are The Terrorists Who Have Killed In America Over The Last 20 Years", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/peteraldhous/american-terrorism-by-the-numbers", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Dylann Roof", "Dzhokhar Tsarnaev"], "orgs": ["University of Maryland", "FBI", "Weare", "GOP"], "election_confidence": 0.8209646497762234, "authors": [{"author_id": 6667, "fullname": "peter aldhous", "primary_org": "buzzfeed"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 01:45:12", "org": "buzzfeed", "article_id": "923331c6f8776108e193d98f1b3048e3", "date_access": "2015-11-17 02:17:43.205660"},
{"body": "When Sen. \nTed Cruz\n jumped into the \nRepublican\n presidential primary, he was largely dismissed as an attention-grabbing agitator with a knack for firing up conservatives, whose long-shot campaign was destined to remain on the fringes.\nBut as the \nGOP\n contest winnows into a defining struggle between the party\u2019s establishment and conservative factions, the ostrich-boot wearing Texan suddenly looks like the hard-right candidate best positioned to go the distance, perhaps even squaring off for the nomination.\nCruz's rise is partly the result of methodical campaign planning, but also sheer luck.\nThe surprise appeal of \nDonald Trump\n and \nBen Carson\n has redefined ideas about who is considered a political outsider. Billionaire Trump\u2019s bombastic style and sometimes offensive campaign has left Cruz looking more presidential. And compared to Carson, the first-term senator seems experienced. If those front-runners eventually fade, as some expect they will, Cruz is poised to scoop up their large base of anti-establishment supporters.\nMeanwhile, Cruz is quietly amassing a war chest from small donors and big-ticket fundraisers, giving him more cash on hand than any other GOP candidate. The average donation from his 360,000 contributors has been $73.\nHe has tirelessly built an enthusiastic army of grass-roots volunteers and local infrastructure in counties across the early-nominating states. And his billionaire-backed super PACs are flush, giving him staying power even if he doesn't win the early primaries.\nIt is an almost unthinkable ascent for a politician so broadly disliked in Washington.\nAt a recent campaign event here in the dusty Texas panhandle, Cruz told the Texas Federation of Republican Women at their convention that he often wonders whether he should have a food taster when he sits down for lunch in the Senate dining room.\n\u201cWe can count on him,\u201d said Deanne Clark, a retired insurance company secretary and former \u201cGoldwater Girl,\u201d whose support for Cruz helped him sweep the organization\u2019s straw poll. \u201cHe never embarrasses me. I know the leadership gets mad at him, but not me.\u201d\nCruz tied with Trump among Texans for the Republican nomination, according to the latest University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll.\nEarly on, Cruz staked his campaign on the party\u2019s farthest right wing, solidifying his standing with the \ntea party\n voters who first sent him to the Senate in 2012. Then he began the tougher job of scooping up the religion-and-social-values flank now flowing to other candidates, namely Carson. Unlike his rivals, Cruz has been careful to avoid publicly mocking or criticizing either Trump or Carson, mindful he might one day be courting their supporters.\nHis goal has always been to become the last-standing conservative alternative to the establishment candidate\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which once was expected to be former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush or Wisconsin Gov. \nScott Walker\n, but now increasingly appears it might be fellow Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida.\n\u201cThere is a sorting that\u2019s happening,\u201d Cruz said in Lubbock. \u201cIt is likely that this race\u00a0\u2014\u00a0as many other races have in the past \u2014\u00a0will end up at the end of the day being a battle between a strong conservative and a moderate establishment candidate. I believe the conservative will win, particularly this time.\u201d\nWhile Rubio is often compared with\u00a0\nPresident Obama\n\u00a0\u2014 a charismatic young communicator who trounced the establishment candidate \u2014\u00a0the resemblance may actually better fit Cruz\u2019s campaign strategy.\nThe Harvard-trained lawyer has shunned his party\u2019s conventional campaign wisdom, much the way Obama did, ignoring calls to be mindful of the political center that eventually will be needed to capture a broader segment of independent and moderate votes. Instead, Cruz believes the race for the White House will be won by building a conservative grass-roots political movement, tapping into voters hungering for a candidate who will animate the base and unleash enthusiasm. He has studied the playbook of former Obama campaign strategist David Plouffe. His performance could provide a test of the polarization of the American electorate.\n\u201cHe\u2019s quietly working through the grass roots \u2026 like a marathon runner,\u201d said Chris Winn, the Lubbock county treasurer who has long worked on Republican campaigns. \u201cWe need to be the cowboy again. \u2026 It does come down to almost a crusade, and Cruz has the clarion call to the nation that this is a good-versus-evil moment.\u201d\nMost other Republican candidates are relying on robust wins in the early-primary states of Iowa or New Hampshire to give their campaigns a boost of money and momentum. Cruz, though, appears to have enough of both to keep going regardless, pushing on to what is being called the \u201cSEC primary,\u201d after the collegiate Southeastern Conference, a big collection of states, including Texas,\u00a0\nAlabama\n, \nArkansas\n and \nGeorgia\n,\u00a0where thousands of voters turned out for his summer \u201cCruz Country\u201d bus tour.\nThis weekend, Cruz hosted a \u201crally for religious liberty\u201d at iconic Bob Jones University in \nSouth Carolina\n, featuring students who prayed in school and business owners who refused to serve gay couples. It was the kind of event Cruz hopes will galvanize evangelical voters who will influence the early contests.\nAnd sparring with Rubio over immigration late last week, he unveiled a plan that includes stepped up deportations and an end to automatic citizenship for children born on American soil to parents here illegally.\nCruz claims to be the only GOP candidate to have a campaign chairman in each of the 171 counties of the early-nominating states. And unlike Rubio, who is under fire for abandoning many of his Senate responsibilities to campaign, Cruz relishes the Senate stage as a valuable fundraising and messaging tool. He raised more than $100,000 the day he stood in the chamber and called Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a liar over a dispute involving a vote on the Export-Import bank.\nIn this cotton-growing region named after a former Confederate officer, Cruz lavished praise on the women\u2019s federation that helped send him to the Senate, telling them their efforts could help him win again.\n\u201cThe power in politics is in this room,\u201d Cruz said from the stage, beside a crucifix made of fresh cotton. \u201cThe women in this room, you terrify Washington.\u201d\nCruz\u2019s my-way-or-the-highway approach to politics has won him only a ragtag group of allies in Washington, where he was largely blamed for the 16-day government shutdown in 2013 as he tried unsuccessfully to undo the Affordable Care Act. But it wowed conservative voters at the women\u2019s federation of activists here, some decked out in cowboy boots and hats in the colors of the American flag, who power primary elections.\n\u201cWe love you, Ted!\u201d a voice hollered from the crowd.\n\u201cI love you too!\u201d he responded\nBut what supporters most like about Cruz\u00a0\u2014\u00a0his willingness to fight fiery battles over social issues and lower spending\u00a0\u2014\u00a0may also be his downfall among those who worry a general-election audience will find him arrogant and unyielding.\n\u201cHe\u2019s great at making flowery little sentences that don\u2019t really mean anything,\u201d said Aurora Farthing, a mother of three who runs a real estate business with her husband in Lubbock, and who prefers Rubio, Carson or Ohio Gov. \nJohn Kasich\n to Cruz. \u201cI just don\u2019t get a good feeling.\"\nThe deliberation among the women here resembled the dilemma facing GOP voters who are torn between a candidate who embraces their conservative beliefs and one with the best chance at winning a general election.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have friends up there,\u201d said Heather Fanta, who likes Cruz but worries about his political isolation in Washington. \u201cI don\u2019t know if people will work with him\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and then we\u2019d have the same stupid gridlock.\u201d\nFor the latest from Congress and 2016 campaign follow \n@LisaMascaro\nFor more, go to \nwww.latimes.com/politics\nMORE POLITICAL COVERAGE\nIn debate after Paris attacks, Clinton earns the advantage on foreign policy\nThree key areas that give Republicans trouble in California\nGOP presidential candidates, in shift from past, compete with bold tax plans", "byline": "", "description": "<p>When Sen.

Purdum\n\nWith Republican presidential candidates racing to condemn President Barack Obama as a reluctant warrior inept to take on Islamic State, Jeb Bush is pouncing on an opportunity to offer up what other critics aren\u2019t \u2014 a plan. \nIt\u2019s not without risk. A call to aggressively marshal resources to take on a diffuse network of fighters in the Middle East could bring back echoes of his brother\u2019s prolonged engagements in Iraq and elsewhere. And Bush has proven himself at times inept at articulating the daylight between his foreign policy vision and that of the 43rd president. \nStory Continued Below\nBut the Bush campaign and its allies have made a calculation that in this Republican race driven by emotion and dominated by more compelling personalities, the former Florida governor has an opportunity to stand head and shoulders above his rivals as he speaks to Americans shaken by last week\u2019s deadly attacks in Paris. \n\u201cAs the problems get bigger and bigger, people are going to start looking at people who are competent and capable,\u201d said Ron Kaufman, a longtime GOP adviser to presidential campaigns who is backing Bush. \u201cIn the end, that\u2019s going to matter and it\u2019s going to be good for Jeb.\u201d \nBush plans to expand on his vision on Wednesday at the Citadel in South Carolina. His team has been working to reframe a speech initially focused on the need to restore cuts to the Pentagon\u2019s budget in the more immediate context of the Paris attacks and how to fight ISIL in the Middle East. \n\u201cWe should declare war, and harness all of the power that the United States can bring to bear, both diplomatic and military, of course, to be able to take out ISIS,\u201d Bush said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\" on Sunday, offering up his initial take on how the U.S. should respond to the carnage that took more than 130 lives and wounded scores more.\n\n\n\n            By \nEliza Collins\n             and \nNick Gass\n\nHe didn\u2019t stop there, ticking off specific strategic points. \u201cDeclare a no-fly zone over Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cDirectly arm the (Kurdish) Peshmerga forces in Iraq. Reengage with the Sunni tribal leaders. Embed with the Iraqi military. Be able to create safe zones in Syria. Garner the support of our European allies and the traditional Arab states.\u201d \nMany of those are ideas Bush first outlined in a speech last summer where he laid out his strategy for combating ISIL. But now people are actually focused on that subject. \n\u201cThis window is going to be fleeting. In a very populist election cycle, his campaign is based on being a calm, judicious, thoughtful guy,\u201d said Kori Schake, a fellow at the Hoover Institution who advised John McCain on foreign policy during his 2008 campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s not that often that circumstances align like three lemons on a slot machine and allow a candidate like Jeb Bush an opportunity to sell substance.\u201d \nIn the broader Republican field, Bush is hoping to find the sweet spot as by playing the experienced, steady hand in this commander-in-chief test\u2014positioning himself somewhere between the ardor of Donald Trump, who said he would consider shuttering mosques in the U.S., and the uncertainty of Ben Carson, who stated in last week\u2019s GOP debate that getting ISIL out of Iraq would be \u201cpretty easy\u201d and on Sunday couldn\u2019t identify an ally he would call first to work on addressing this crisis. \n\u201cAt this point, campaigns are looking for moments to meet, to demonstrate why their candidate\u2019s a leader and why they should be trusted not just to handle an issue but to lead a nation,\u201d said Bruce Haynes, a Republican strategist in Washington who's not backing a specific candidate. \u201cThis is an opportunity for Jeb Bush to distinguish himself not just with a strategy but as someone who understands what it means for America to lead in the current global environment.\u201d \n\n\n\n            By \nDaniel Strauss\n\nWhile some candidates are trying to push buttons on specific issues, from bombing campaigns to blocking Syrian refugees, Bush, in framing this as a governing issue, is trying to stand out by thinking and talking big and looking like a president. \u201cWhile it may seem counter-intuitive, it\u2019s not counter-intuitive for him to say what he believes is right,\u201d said Haynes. \u201cIn spite of how people might feel about the past and his brother, he\u2019s going to stand up and say, I\u2019m Jeb Bush, this is what I believe and what I think we should do and the chips will fall where they may\u2014and that\u2019s leadership.\u201d \nBush is hardly alone in calling for a no-fly zone in Syria; six other GOP rivals including Marco Rubio and likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton all agree with him. President Obama, however, dismissed that idea during a press conference at the G-20 in Turkey on Monday. \"It is determined that it would be counterproductive to take those steps,\" the president said. \nHe also has joined rival Ted Cruz in calling for special protection for the Christian Syrian refugees, while Obama condemned any sort of \"religious test\" that would unfairly leave Muslim refugees in peril. \nBut some of Bush\u2019s rhetoric appears to be merely that: He criticized the White House for failing to declare war\u2014even though national security Ben Rhodes has referred to the U.S. actions against ISIL as part of a war; and his assertion that Clinton believes \u201cthat it\u2019s not our fight\u201d based on her statement in Saturday night\u2019s debate that combating ISIL must also involve other allies and \u201ccannot be an American fight\u201d is somewhat of a stretch. \n\u201cOf course there\u2019s a rhetorical element to this. I think the American people want a president who\u2019s going to stand up and deliver a forceful rebuke of the terrorists who committed such atrocities,\u201d said Tim Miller, Bush\u2019s campaign spokesman. \u201cAn event like that requires a serious response. I think what you saw from the president and Hillary Clinton was a pretty tepid response given the gravity of the event.\u201d \nBush expressed openness to a ground assault to root out ISIL from Iraq and Syria during his appearance on \"Meet The Press\" Sunday, laying out an idealistic scenario reminiscent of what his brother\u2019s team foresaw heading into Iraq 12 years ago. \u201cWell, you take it to them in Syria and Iraq,\u201d Bush said. \u201cYou destroy ISIS. And then you build a coalition to replace this radical Islamic terrorist threat to our country and to Europe and to the region with something that is more peace loving.\u201d \nObama on Monday rebutted that argument, saying that a ground war doesn\u2019t make sense \u201cunless we're prepared to have a permanent occupation.\u201d Without \"local populations that are committed to inclusive governance and who are pushing back against ideological extremes,\" Obama argued, Islamists would eventually resurface. \"We would see a repetition of what we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d he said. \n\nFourth Estate\n\n            By \nJack Shafer\n\nWhile Democrats blame George W. Bush for destabilizing the Middle East to the point that ISIL could take hold, Bush and Republicans blame Obama and Clinton for withdrawing U.S. troops, which, they argue, created the void. The debate over how to proceed in the Middle East will continue to be a debate about how we got to this point\u2014and that\u2019s what makes the politics exceedingly complicated for the candidate named Bush. \n\u201cIf he looks like his brother, that\u2019s probably not going to be an electoral advantage for him,\u201d Schake said. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s coming up with a fully fledged strategy\u2014because he\u2019s going to be held to a different standard than everyone else.\u201d \nAnd as fraught as the politics are for Bush, the policy questions are exceedingly more complex in the view of most foreign policy experts. \u201cI firmly understand when you\u2019re running for president, it\u2019s very attractive to wrap yourself in the flag. But the notion that we\u2019re suddenly going to get this fixed by sending troops to fight ISIS, we\u2019re kidding ourselves,\u201d said Ian Bremmer, the president of The Eurasia Group. \u201cThe long-term support in the U.S. for what would be a long war of attrition that would put even more of a bulls eye on Americans just isn\u2019t there.\"\n\u201cWe do not do well with wars where we are nowhere near as committed to the outcome as those we\u2019re fighting,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf there\u2019s any lesson out there that Jeb Bush should have taken, you\u2019d think that would be the one.\u201d \n\nEli Stokols is a national politics reporter.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The former Florida governor is staking claim as the candidate most ready to take it to Islamic State.

We spent months trying to find a way into Europe, and by Allah\u2019s strength, we succeeded in finally making our way to Belgium,\" Abaaoud said in the article. \"We were then able to obtain weapons and set up a safe house while we planned to carry out operations against the crusaders.\"\nThe interview came weeks after a raid in Verviers, Belgium, failed to capture Abaaoud after dismantling the terror cell after searches in Molenbeek, a downscale district of Brussels where authorities are currently searching for the eighth suspect from last week's attacks.\nNone of those arrested during the raid had been his accomplices, he said.\n\"The intelligence knew me from before as I had been previously imprisoned by them,\" Abaaoud said. \"After the raid on the safe house, they figured out that I had been with the brothers and that we had been planning operations together. So they gathered intelligence agents from all over the world \u2013 from Europe and America \u2013 in order to detain me. They arrested Muslims in Greece, Spain, France, and Belgium in order to apprehend me.\"\nAbaaoud is also suspected of being linked to the foiled August train shooting, also in France.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Alleged Paris attacks mastermind boasted of planned &apos;operations&apos; in February", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/paris-attack-mastermind-february-215918", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Bryan Bender", "Theodore Roosevelt", "Natasha Korecki", "Marc Caputo", "Ted Cruz", "Laurens Cerulus", "Kristen East", "Theodoric Meyer", "Pierre Briancon", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Andrew Restuccia", "Katie Glueck", "Nick Gass", "Alex Isenstadt", "Seung Min Kim", "Richard Nixon", "Andrew Glass", "Jeremy Herb", "Michael Crowley", "Marco Rubio", "Jake Sherman", "Glenn Thrush", "Ben Schreckinger", "Jeff Gerth", "Nicholas Vinocur", "Barack Obama", "Shane Goldmacher", "Hadas Gold"], "orgs": ["Washington And The World", "Photo Gallery", "Congress", "DNC", "J.M.", "ISIL", "GOP"], "election_confidence": 0.7096973544236799, "authors": [{"author_id": 30728, "fullname": "nick gass", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-16 12:31:01", "org": "politico", "article_id": "be32d9b1697169ed18714a8532251a92", "date_access": "2015-11-16 12:41:17.542915"},

Yet that's exactly what he's getting in the wake of the Paris attacks, a shift that's turned the primary contest \u2014 temporarily at least \u2014 into a test for commander-in-chief. \nFor the Vermont senator, it's already proving discomfiting as he faces off against an already-dominating front-runner on terrain that's familiar to her as a former secretary of state.\nStory Continued Below\nAs Clinton works to remind Democratic voters of her experience \u2014 \u201cI spent a lot of time in the Situation Room as secretary of state and there were many very difficult choices presented to us,\u201d she said on the Des Moines debate stage on Saturday \u2014 Sanders suddenly finds himself forced to deviate from the stump speech he\u2019s effectively been honing for decades. His once-soaring campaign, until recently firmly welded to a focus on domestic policy and income inequality, is now reliant on a work-in-progress argument that leans further into his criticism of Clinton\u2019s 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq War.\nThere's a sense of urgency to Sanders' task of proving he belongs in the national security discussion, said Democratic operative Chris Kofinis, who ran a focus group of 33 undecided Iowa Democratic caucus-goers during the debate. That group unanimously decided that Clinton would be a stronger commander-in-chief after the forum, and Kofinis found that her message on terrorism resonated particularly strongly with the Iowans.\n\u201cIt was pretty overwhelmingly clear. Not surprising given her experience as secretary of state, but two weeks ago the issue of terrorism wasn\u2019t at the forefront of the Democratic debate. Now it \u2014 at least for the time being \u2014 definitely is at the front,\u201d Kofinis explained on Monday. \u201cSanders had an electability issue going into this debate. I\u2019ve done four groups now in Iowa, and every group says the same thing: we love his message but we\u2019re not sure it\u2019s electable. He needs to address that head on, and that\u2019s now even more difficult because he has to do that as well as address the commander-in-chief question.\"\n\n2016\n\n            By \nEli Stokols\n\n\u201cWhen these kinds of drastic international events happen, they usually change the dynamic of the race, and you either react to it or you don\u2019t. The perception is that he hasn\u2019t, and he has to,\u201d Kofinis added.\nSanders has yet to schedule \u2014 or even write \u2014 the military policy speech that his top strategist, Tad Devine, has long urged him to deliver. He only has one public rally scheduled for this week \u2014 today in Cleveland. It's a reflection of doubts within the campaign, say those familiar with its thinking, that the issue of responding to the attacks will drive voters\u2019 thinking for more than a few days.\nNonetheless, Devine and other top aides expect Sanders to start making his argument shortly.\nFirst, he will more forcefully frame Clinton\u2019s Iraq vote as a question of basic judgment: \u201cArguably the most important foreign policy decision in the last 30 years,\" said Devine.\nSanders will also elaborate on his hope to build a new coalition against ISIS, continuing a discussion he began \u2014 though without offering specifics \u2014 at a rally in Indianola, Iowa, on Sunday night.\n\u201cWe have a different point of view, but Russia has got to join us,\u201d he said the evening after the debate, in the midst of a sprawling speech that focused primarily on the middle class issues he\u2019s accustomed to addressing. \u201cWe are concerned about Iran, but Iran has to join us. We have concerns about Saudi Arabia, but Saudi Arabia has to join us. If all over the world these attacks are taking place, the world has got to come together.\"\nThe senator, who often votes against increasing funding for the Defense Department, will argue that the country should shoulder less of the burden in responding to \u2014 and paying for \u2014 international crises.\nIf Sanders makes this account central to his appearances in the coming days, it will represent a dramatic departure for a lawmaker whose foreign policy work in the Senate is largely limited to his membership in the Veterans\u2019 Affairs committee. That background hasn't been a hindrance in a race that mostly centered on economic issues, as evidenced by the recent exits of both of the internationally-focused candidates pursuing the Democratic nomination \u2014 Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee. \n\n\n\n            By \nDaniel Strauss\n\nInstead, the candidates have mostly sparred over Wall Street regulation, environmental policy, and immigration. As a result, their Saturday debate opened a new window into their thinking. \nSanders traveled to Des Moines with Senate staffers who\u2019ve been briefing him on foreign policy, but after his opening statement veered away from the Paris attacks and toward the \u201crigged economy\u201d \u2014 a stark contrast to Clinton and Martin O'Malley, who stuck to responding to the attacks \u2014 Sanders immediately faced new scrutiny.\nThose questions about his preparation to be commander in chief were compounded before long, when Sanders told moderator John Dickerson that he stood by his claim that climate change is the greatest threat to national security \u2014 a position far out of sync with the polls.\n\u201cClimate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism,\u201d insisted the Vermonter, before his campaign circulated a fact-sheet backing up his claim that the military agrees with his assessment. \u201cAnd if we do not get our act together and listen to what scientists say, you\u2019re going to see countries all over the world \u2014 this is what the CIA says \u2014 they\u2019re going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops, and you\u2019re going to see all kinds of international conflict.\"\nWhile he recovered in time to engage Clinton and O\u2019Malley in a spirited debate over the country\u2019s role in the Middle East, the exchanges highlighted his difficulties convincing voters of his viability for the job: a pre-debate November CBS/New York Times poll showed that 53 percent of Democratic primary voters were \u201cvery confident\u201d in Clinton\u2019s \u201cability to handle an international crisis,\u201d compared to just 16 percent for Sanders.\nNonetheless, his team remains wedded to the strategy of using the sudden focus on foreign policy as an opportunity to underscore Clinton\u2019s past errors, rather than his own grand plan for the Middle East.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she in any way distinguished herself on foreign policy during the debate. She was secretary of state at the time ISIL emerged, so she was on defense,\u201d said a high-level Sanders aide, previewing a further line of discussion from his candidate. \u201cShe does know a lot of names and places and inside facts, but other than that she didn\u2019t distinguish herself.\"\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The Vermont senator suddenly finds himself forced to deviate from an economic message he's been honing for decades.", "title": "Sanders knocked off stride by foreign policy focus", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/bernie-sanders-foreign-policy-paris-215937", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Jim Obergefell", "Bernie Becker", "Kate Tummarello", "Henry C.

We are pursuing matching funds and will compete vigorously for the nomination.\"\nStory Continued Below\nThe former Maryland governor, who sits at around 3 percent in Iowa according to the Real Clear Politics polling average, needs to vastly improve his numbers in order to gain delegates coming out of the Iowa caucuses. But he trails Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders by large margins, leading many Democrats to question his viability in the state, and also nationally.\nThe campaign has been struggling to raise money in a field that includes the well-funded Clinton and Sanders campaigns. It raised just under $1.3 million in the third quarter while spending $1.8 million \u2014 and it was carrying over $20,000 in debt by the beginning of October.\nThe move to shift resources comes shortly after a debate performance that was widely seen as O\u2019Malley\u2019s best so far. He recently abandoned his reluctance to attack Clinton and Sanders, earning him more headlines and attention.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "O&apos;Malley campaign shifts staff from headquarters", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/martin-omalley-democrats-2016-215951", "topics": ["trade", "foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Jim Obergefell", "Bernie Becker", "Kate Tummarello", "Henry C.

They need just a majority of votes to pass the legislation, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and his team are being squeezed between moderates balking at the Planned Parenthood language and a trio of conservatives that say the Obamacare repeal language doesn\u2019t go far enough.\nStory Continued Below\n \u201cWe\u2019re looking at all options. It\u2019s about 51,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) after a closed-door leadership meeting on Monday night. \u201c[When] we get a clear idea from the parliamentarian what\u2019s a go, and what\u2019s a no go, we\u2019ll start rounding up the vote.\u201d\nThe 54-member Republican majority got its first ruling from the parliamentarian last week, which found that the Planned Parenthood language withstood scrutiny but repeal of the individual and business mandates as passed by the House would need to be rewritten. The parliamentarian's ruling is being kept closely by both parties, though Democrats say the GOP\u2019s hopes of easy passage of Obamacare have been doomed.\nRepublicans say that's not the case and are confident they will eventually prevail, but they admit work remains. They\u2019d originally been aiming to pass reconciliation this month, but they now plan to use next week\u2019s Thanksgiving recess to get the measure ready to pass the Senate and accrue 51 votes. \n\n\n\n            By \nSeung Min Kim\n            ,\nJake Sherman\n             and \nBurgess Everett\n\nWhat has not been decided is whether the proposal will turn into a straight-out attack on Obamacare and lose language stripping Planned Parenthood of funding. Senators said they could try a different legislative vehicle to force that fight should they back down on reconciliation to keep moderates on board.\n\u201cThe primary purpose of this bill is Obamacare repeal,\u201d said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 Senate Republican. \u201cWe need to make sure we get 51 votes to get Obamacare repealed. So if [Planned Parenthood] gets in the way of that at this point we\u2019ll have to take a look at it.\u201d\nGOP senators Mike Lee of Utah, Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas all oppose the reconciliation measure as currently written, leaving McConnell little room for error once the proposal passes muster with the parliamentarian. And even getting there is going to take major work.\n\n\n\n            By \nJake Sherman\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an iterative process. In other words she\u2019s not going to give us a blueprint,\u201d Cornyn said of the back-and-forth with Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough. \u201cShe gives us guidance and then we try to meet the guidance in order to try to eliminate problems.\u201d\nRepublican aides say the procedural issues involving the mandates can be easily solved with new language that would make the provisions comply with Senate rules, though they have yet to say publicly how that would be done.\nSeung Min Kim contributed to this report.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Republicans may remove a Planned Parenthood provision if that will help things along.", "title": "Senate GOP reassesses plan on Obamacare repeal", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/gop-obamacare-reconciliation-planned-parenthood-215953", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "trade"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Jim Obergefell", "Bernie Becker", "Kate Tummarello", "Henry C.

But he was also addressing the legacy of the man he replaced, George W. Bush, who channeled Americans' pain over the 9/11 attacks into a war against a different enemy, Iraq. \nObama ran for president promising to be the anti-Bush on national security \u2013 less autocratic, more sensitive to global opinion, and more careful with his words. As president, he may have preserved some of Bush\u2019s strong-armed tactics in fighting terrorism, but rhetorically, he\u2019s fulfilled his promise of restraint.\nStill, until now, he hasn\u2019t had an occasion to buck up the country in the face of fear and shock over terrorism. And his cautious words on Paris, while consistent with past statements, left some people feeling unsoothed.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s an emotionally distant person, at least in terms of rhetoric, and he likes to lecture people,\" said Pete Wehner, a speechwriter for former President George W. Bush. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to calm anybody down. That\u2019s going deepen the divisions that exist in the country.\u201d \n\n\n\n            By \nNahal Toosi\n\nWehner pointed to Bush\u2019s speech at Washington National Cathedral just nine days after the Sept. 11 attacks as a better model for expressing national grief.\n\u201cOur grief has turned to anger, and anger to resolution. Whether we bring our enemies to justice, or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done,\u201d Bush said. A few minutes later, Bush described \u201cour war on terror,\u201d one that begins with al Qaeda but \u201cdoes not end there.\u201d \nAs it happened, the war on terror didn't end there. And that\u2019s the point for Obama, who has said that ISIL grew out of the chaotic aftermath of the Iraq invasion.\nIn Turkey, Obama batted away suggestions that he needs to change his strategy against ISIL with a weariness that seemed driven by more than just jetlag. He insisted that it's just not possible to \u201ctake out these bastards,\u201d as one reporter put it. And anyway, anger isn\u2019t going to finish off ISIL -- that\u2019s going to take a complex combination of diplomacy to end the civil war, intelligence to stop the flow of foreign fighters, and yes, some military action.\n\"If folks want to pop off and have opinions about what they think they would do, present a specific plan,\" Obama said. \"If they think that somehow their advisers are better than the Chairman of my Joint Chiefs of Staff and the folks who are actually on the ground, I want to meet them.\"\nIt's not that he offered no emotion. Obama talked about meeting wounded warriors at Walter Reed, \"a 25-year-old kid who\u2019s paralyzed or has lost his limbs\" that he had to send into battle. \n\"So I can\u2019t afford to play some of the political games that others may,\" Obama said.\nConservative candidates and commentators pounced on Obama for deriding \u201csome notion of American leadership or America winning, or whatever other slogans they come up with that has no relationship to what is actually going to work to protect the American people.\u201d \nObama said he's \"too busy for that.\u201d\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\n\"It enrages me,\" GOP hopeful Carly Fiorina told right-leaning talk radio host Hugh Hewitt on Monday afternoon. \"Let me just contrast it: What did [French] President [Francois] Hollande say? What he said was we will wage a war that is 'pitiless.' That is the appropriate response,\" she added.\nObama reserved his most passionate \u2013 one might say angry \u2013 words for those who\u2019ve called for imposing religious curbs on Syrian refugees.\n\u201cWhen I hear folks say that, well, maybe we should just admit the Christians but not the Muslims; when I hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which a person who\u2019s fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted, when some of those folks themselves come from families who benefited from protection when they were fleeing political persecution -- that\u2019s shameful,\u201d Obama said. \nThe president didn\u2019t namecheck Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has called for only letting in Christians, or Sen. Marco Rubio, who has said no Syrian refugees at all should be allowed into the U.S. following the attacks. But his reference to the presidential candidates and sons of Cuban immigrants was lost on no one. Jeb Bush has also urged prioritizing Christians who face persecution in Syria.\nObama did, however, namecheck the 43rd president, praising him at the end of the press conference. No matter how misguided his invasion, Obama said, Bush didn't turn it into a religious war. \n\u201cI had a lot of disagreements with George W. Bush on policy,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut I was very proud after 9/11 when he was adamant and clear about the fact that this is not a war on Islam.\u201d\n\nSarah Wheaton is a White House reporter for Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The president angrily defends his rhetorical restraint on the Paris terrorist attacks.", "title": "Obama is still the anti-Bush", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/barack-obama-paris-attacks-response-215947", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Jim Obergefell", "Bernie Becker", "Kate Tummarello", "Henry C.

Everyone scoffed, now they're attacking the oil.\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 16, 2015\n\nAfter being relatively quiet over the weekend, Trump hit the talk shows on Monday morning to speak about the attacks, saying the U.S. needs stronger intelligence and also linking the extent of carnage with what he views as excessive gun controls.\n\u201cHad there been some guys with a gun, there would have been a shootout and probably the primary people that would have got whacked would have been the killers,\" Trump said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\"You can\u2019t any tougher than Paris, and you can\u2019t get any tougher than France\u201d on gun control, he continued. \u201cThey just said, come here, boom, come here, boom\u2026shot these people at will.\"\nLindsey Graham, meanwhile, called on President Barack Obama to \"rally the world.\"\n\u201cI would encourage the president really to rally the world to marry up with the French, the Arabs,\" the South Carolina senator and Republican presidential candidate said in a joint interview from Atlanta with Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain. \"They have large armies. Let\u2019s use their armies in a strong way, integrate their forces in a regional army, get the French involved, any NATO nation that would like to help and come up with a ground component to supplement the air campaign going on the ground and destroy the caliphate at its headquarters, at its capital in Raqqa.\"\n\u201cThey\u2019re not the JV campaign, but they\u2019re certainly not 10 feet tall,\" Graham said. \"The worst possible solution is half measures.\"\nJeb Bush said that he would work on building a plan to vanquish the terror group in concert with regional allies. \"I would listen to the military commanders and build a strategy to defeat ISIS, not by ourselves but doing it with our allies in the Middle East and clearly with Europe,\" the former Florida governor told \"Fox and Friends\" on Monday morning.\nAs far as refugees, Bush said he would be compassionate as president but that ongoing screening is essential to ensuring that the wrong people do not enter the country.\n\u201cYeah, absolutely,\" he responded when asked if the U.S. should be profiling refugees who attempt to enter the country from Syria. \"That\u2019s what screening is. We should be profiling. Of course we should. This is Islamic terrorism. The Democrats have no clue about this or they just refuse to call it what it is.

Jim Jordan to serve a second term as the chair of the conservative group. \nDuring a private meeting Monday, the nearly year-old group unanimously elected Jordan as its leader. \nStory Continued Below\nIt was not a surprising outcome. Jordan is widely respected by his peers in the conservative caucus and faced no challengers.\nThe group has had a successful year under Jordan's leadership. He's maneuvered the group through its first year with a handful of political and legislative wins \u2014 notably being one of the catalysts that forced former Speaker John Boehner from that post. \nThe group was created in January to counterbalance what conservatives viewed as a growing trend of compromise of Republican policies by the GOP leadership team. The 40 lawmakers forced a temporary shutdown of the Export-Import Bank and nearly caused a partial government shutdown in protest of President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration.\nJordan will serve as chairman for the next year. The group hopes to outline in that time their policy agenda in a document conservative lawmakers have taken to calling the second \"Contract with America\" \u2014 an ode to the document outline by Newt Gingrich in the 1990s that helped usher in a commanding Republican majority in the House.\nThe Freedom Caucus also elected two new board members on Monday. Reps. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) and Steve Pearce (R-N.M.) will join the seven-member board. \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The Ohio Republican will remain the group's leader.", "title": "House Freedom Caucus re-elects Jordan", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/house-freedom-caucus-re-elects-jordan-215955", "topics": ["trade", "foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Jim Obergefell", "Kate Tummarello", "Jim Jordan", "Jeff Duncan", "Henry C.

Vogel\n\n11/16/15 09:34 PM EST\nThe Clinton Foundation filed three years of revised tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service on Monday, correcting errors which came to light as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign led to increased scrutiny of the charity founded by her husband, President Bill Clinton.\nClinton Foundation CEO Donna Shalala said press reports about the foundation's failure to correctly report government grants from 2010 to 2012 led the organization to conduct a thorough review involving lawyers and accountants, who found other errors. Still, she called the refiling voluntary.\nStory Continued Below\n\"Although the exhaustive review found several additional errors, our external tax reviewers informed us that the errors did not require us to amend our returns; There is no change in our bottom line numbers: assets, liabilities, and net assets; and we do not owe any taxes,\" Shalala wrote in a letter posted on the foundation's website. \n\"Our reviewers advised us the Foundation has no legal obligation to file amended returns, but that if we did file an amended return it would be important for us to correct errors found in the review.\"\nA Clinton Foundation spinoff , the Clinton Health Access Initiative, also filed at least two years of corrected returns. Amended returns for 2012 and 2013 were posted on the health-focused organization's website Monday night. \n\n\n\n            By \nLauren French\n\n\"The refiling of documents was completed in the name of greater transparency and has no impact on the bottom line,\" the Clinton Health Access Initiative said in a statement.\nA Reuters report in April noted that the Clinton Foundation's Forms 990 from 2010 through 2012 recorded zero income on a line to report government grants. Foundation officials said the payments had been inadvertently lumped in with other contributions.\nThe Clinton Foundation said the review of its tax returns was conducted by a former Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's Tax Division , Kathy Keneally, now the chair of tax litigation at DLA Piper. Keneally selected accounting firm CohnReznick to oversee the re-evaluation of the numbers, the foundation said.\n\nKenneth P.

David Vitter discussed his 2007 prostitution scandal with new openness during a rowdy and contentious final debate of the Louisiana governor's race, while also facing \u2014 and dodging \u2014 the most specific question he\u2019s been publicly asked about his admitted misdeeds.\nThe 400-strong crowd packed a private high school here, with supporters of both candidates cheering, jeering, exclaiming, and applauding throughout the debate despite two warnings from the moderators to stay silent. \nStory Continued Below\nSome of the loudest outbursts came after a moderator asked Vitter specifically about the phone call made famous by the Democratic state Rep. John Bel Edwards\u2019 campaign\u2019s \u201cProstitutes over Patriots\u201d ad, questioning the specific purpose of the call. Edwards\u2019 campaign has alleged Vitter was talking to the famous \"D.C. madam\" instead of voting on a Senate resolution to honor troops who had perished in combat.\nVitter didn\u2019t answer the question, instead choosing to emphasize that the phone call took place 15 years ago and that he worked hard to earn forgiveness both from his family and from constituents in Louisiana. He blamed the media and his political opponents for keeping the issue alive.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry if that\u2019s not good enough for you,\u201d Vitter said. \u201cIt\u2019s good enough for [Vitter\u2019s wife] Wendy.\u201d\n\nWhite House \n\n            By \nSarah Wheaton\n\nAs Vitter answered, a supporters bellowed from the auditorium: \u201cGet over it!\u201d Another yelled: \u201cIt\u2019s good enough for us!\u201d\nDiscussing the issue at all is a remarkable turnabout for Vitter, who hasn\u2019t taken a question from reporters in the hallways of Senate for eight years. After a single press conference in 2007 where he admitted to a \u201cserious sin,\u201d the senator has steadfastly avoided the topic, even while easily winning reelection in 2010.\nBut in the past two debates and in recent television advertising, Vitter has been forced to bring up the scandal, casting himself as a fallen man who has found redemption with the help of his wife and family. It's a story that could resonate in a deeply religious state, but it only comes as Vitter, once considered the unstoppable favorite to be Louisiana's next governor, finds himself down by 10 percentage points or more in most public polling in the race against Edwards.\nEdwards\u2019 response was simultaneously gracious yet vicious, arguing it was appropriate to forgive Vitter but not to elect him governor.\n\u201cThe simple fact of the matter is, we are all obligated as Christians to forgive,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we have to forget.\u201d\nThe Democrat later took a more direct shot: \u201cHe surrendered his law license rather than face questions, not about a sin, but about a crime.\u201d\nIn a post-debate scrum, Vitter said his law license lapsed because he was no longer using it, not because he was afraid of facing questions.\n\u201cThat came out of left field,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I do mean left field.\u201d \n\n\n\n            By \nJake Sherman\n\nIn his closing statement, Vitter returned to the scandal, comparing his personal recovery from sin to a potential recovery for Louisiana as a state.\n\u201cFifteen years ago, I faced the darkest moment of my life when I had to face my children and tell them how badly I had failed my family,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they gave me in return was the best day in my lie when they and Wendy offered complete love and forgiveness.\u201d\n\u201cThat is the most powerful motivator I have for the rest of my life,\u201d he continued, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re in a low point in Louisiana. We can rise. We can go to great heights.\u201d\nTalking to reporters after the debate, Vitter said he was talking about the scandal because his failure and recovery were \u201cthe most important experience of my life.\u201d When reporters questioned if it was shift in strategy, Vitter waved them off.\n\u201cLook, I know my answer isn\u2019t going to satisfy y\u2019all,\u201d he said. \u201cBut quite frankly, you\u2019re the gotcha media and you\u2019re looking for headlines and you\u2019re looking to make a name for yourselves.\u201d\nThe answer also didn\u2019t satisfy Edwards.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that he\u2019s answered any of the relevant questions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is that he actually missed out on the performance of his duties. It wasn\u2019t just something that was between him and his wife.\u201d\nThe debate opened with the two candidates clashing on whether or not Louisiana should accept Syrian refugees, a topic Vitter has made the centerpiece of his campaign in recent days. Vitter accused Edwards of flip-flopping on the issue, arguing he had \u201cfour positions in forty-eight hours\u201d and would help Obama settle refugees.\n\n\n\n            By \nLauren French\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where he is,\u201d the Republican said. \u201cBut I know we can\u2019t trust where he\u2019ll end up.\u201d\nEdwards accused Vitter of lying about his position, saying he proposed a moratorium on refugee resettlement and simply wanted to have a \u201cconversation\u201d about the topic.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have a conversation,\u201d Vitter retorted. \u201cI want it to stop.\u201d\nThe two also repeated several of their earlier clashes, with Vitter accusing Edwards of backing tax hikes and questioning the Democrat\u2019s support for small businesses and opposition to abortion rights. Edwards responded to the latter with another character attack, noting the senator had backed a pro-abortion rights Republican, Rudy Giuliani, in the 2008 presidential race.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a hypocrite,\u201d Edwards said.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "A crowd of 400 packed a private high school, cheering and jeering the candidates throughout the debate.", "title": "Vitter defends self on prostitution scandal in final debate", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/louisiana-vitter-edwards-governor-215960", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Jim Obergefell", "Kenneth P.

And the gathering provides a new platform for President Barack Obama and other leaders to drive home an argument that they have been making for years: that climate change itself is a threat to the world's peace and security.\nStory Continued Below\nStill, pressing the terror-climate connection poses political risks at home, as was shown by the Republican derision that greeted Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders' statement during Saturday night's debate that climate change \"is directly related to the growth in terrorism.\"\nA raft of studies backs up the argument that a changing climate can worsen the tensions that help fuel terrorism and wars, including Pentagon and CIA reports that found instability from changes in the climate can contribute to conditions that breed insurgencies. But conservative critics immediately ridiculed Sanders \u2014 with one columnist, Ben Shapiro, tweeting mockingly that \"climate change causes terrorism like a fish causes a bicycle.\" \nObama and dozens of other world leaders are still scheduled to travel to Paris for the beginning of the two-week-long talks that start Nov. 30, along with thousands of activists and observers. They'll gather at a conference center in the north of the city, not far from the Stade du France, where suicide bombers detonated bombs outside a soccer match attended by French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. \nOn Sunday, Obama and several of the same world leaders pledged at the G20 summit in Ankara, Turkey, to step up their pressure on ISIL and take new steps to cope with the flow of refugees from Syria. But climate advocates seemed unfazed by the possibility that environmental issues could get squeezed off the leaders' priority list.\n\nForeign Policy\n\n            By \nMichael Crowley\n\n\"The [climate] talks won\u2019t gain as much attention in the media because it will be crowded out by other issues. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s most important,\" said Paul Bledsoe, a former climate aide in the Clinton White House. \"The resolve of world leaders is going to be redoubled to gain an agreement and show that they can deliver for populations around the world. The likelihood for a successful agreement has only increased because of these attacks.\"\nFormer U.S. climate diplomat Nigel Purvis, who now leads the consulting firm Climate Advisers, agreed. \"Nations will be more likely to work closely with France to produce a constructive outcome,\" he said in an email.\nWhile the substance of the negotiations themselves isn't likely to be affected by the attacks in Paris, the attacks will draw more attention to the links between climate change and terrorism. Activists say Obama has an unprecedented opportunity to use his trip to Paris to talk about how drought, desertification, rising seas and other effects of climate change could destabilize countries and worsen conditions that lead to radicalism. \n\nWashington And The World\n\n            By \n                    J.M. Berger\n\nConservatives, on the other hand, have mocked Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry for talking about the national security threat posed by climate change.\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump blasted Obama's comments during a recent television interview about the threat of climate change. \"He said CLIMATE CHANGE is the most important thing, not all of the current disasters!\" Trump tweeted in disbelief. Rival candidate Mike Huckabee scoffed at the notion earlier this year, saying that \"a beheading is a far greater threat to an American than a sunburn.\u201d\nKerry devoted an entire speech to the issue of climate change and national security just three days before the attacks in Paris, saying \"because the world is so extraordinarily interconnected today \u2014 economically, technologically, militarily, in every imaginable way \u2014 instability anywhere can be a threat to stability everywhere.\"\nFollowing Friday's coordinated attacks in Paris that killed at least 132 people, some worry that touting the national security threat of climate change may strike the wrong chord.\n\n2016\n\n            By \nBen Schreckinger\n\n\"I understand that it has been, and I assume will continue to be part of the argument for a climate change deal, but in light of what just happened in Paris it is going to ring hollow for an awful lot of people. It may be correct, but it just seems out of touch right now,\" said Jim Manley, a former adviser to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.\nIndeed, focusing on the climate security argument could give Republicans an opening to argue that Democrats are soft on terrorism and have their priorities mixed up.\n\"People are afraid. And it is not of global warming,\" said Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist. \"The Democrats need to start to speak to that or they will be politically dead.\"\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The Paris attacks are reshaping the optics of the international climate change talks set to kick off there in two weeks.", "title": "Climate summit under terror&apos;s shadow in Paris", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/paris-attacks-climate-change-talks-215914", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Francois Hollande", "Ben Shapiro", "Henry C.

He is organized in every county in the first four voting states. And he has served up one strong debate performance after the next.\nNow, not three months from primary season, rivals concede they have begun to fear Ted Cruz has an increasingly clear path to the Republican nomination.\nStory Continued Below\n\"Anybody who thinks differently,\" said an operative with a rival 2016 campaign, \"is lying to you.\"\nThe 2016 field\u2019s reluctantly bullish outlook on Cruz marks a dramatic about-face for Republicans weighing the divisive senator\u2019s odds. For months, Cruz was considered a long-shot at best \u2013 a hardline conservative with a niche audience of angry evangelicals, mired in the middle of the polls and overshadowed anyway by Donald Trump. Allies of, and operatives on, campaigns as varied as Jeb Bush\u2019s and Mike Huckabee\u2019s dismissed the Texas senator\u2019s ability to court enough supporters to defeat a more mainstream Republican.\nNo longer.\nThe same Republican rivals who relegated Cruz to a second tier in discussions this summer now see this insurgent firebrand as the candidate who benefited most from Scott Walker\u2019s exit and the one who stands to gain should Donald Trump or Ben Carson decline. Indeed, Cruz is seen by most of his competition as one of the few likely to still be standing in March\n\"He's the longer-term threat,\u201d said Fergus Cullen, the former chair of the New Hampshire GOP and a Republican who does not support Cruz. \u201cI suspect once Trump goes down, people like me will have Cruz to deal with.\"\nDuring the bulk of the pre-primary season, Cruz languished in the polls behind Trump and Carson, two candidates who appealed to voters furious with Washington. This was the bloc Cruz had been expected to dominate. Deprived of oxygen, Cruz largely faded from the Republican presidential spotlight over the summer weeks. \nSaddled with a lower profile, Cruz focused on fundraising and building deep organizations. Instead of living in Iowa all of August, he embarked on a bus trip through the South, a move that surprised other Republicans at the time but allowed him to lay the groundwork for mounting a turnout operation across a region that will vote early this cycle, on March 1. Cruz, eyes on a delegate count, even developed infrastructure to compete in the primaries and caucuses in the U.S. territories, dispatching a representative to places as far-flung as Guam and American Samoa.\n\nDebate Night \n\n            By \nEli Stokols\n\nCruz also cleaned up as Walker broke down, said Tom Rath, a New Hampshire Republican who is aligned with Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Even though many of Walker's more high-profile endorsers and donors went to Marco Rubio, his departure opened up a slice of the conservative vote that is now more inclined toward Cruz. \nAll of this laid the groundwork for a strong autumn. Cruz ramped up his public activity in the early states, particularly in Iowa with a high-profile religious liberty rally, an event he replicated Saturday in South Carolina. He rolled out the endorsements he had been quietly seeking for months, and his poll numbers and his cash flow ticked up in tandem. When he offered a blistering critique of the media at the CNBC debate in Boulder, Colo. late last month, the tide turned.\n\u201cHe\u2019s done really well on the debate stage, raised a whole bunch of money, his campaign has done a good job organizing, and he does have these super PACs\u2014they don\u2019t seem very active, but at least they have money in the bank,\u201d said a source working for the rival campaign, referencing the cluster of super PACs backing Cruz that have amassed tens of millions of dollars. \nNow, Cruz enters a crucial week. The 2016 field will return to Iowa on Friday for another cattle-call, this one hosted by prominent Iowa social conservative Bob Vander Plaats, who will offer a coveted endorsement soon after. That endorsement could be pivotal for Cruz, who has worked for months to emerge as the consensus choice of evangelical conservatives. \nCarson represents Cruz\u2019s biggest obstacle to that end, but in Iowa, Cruz has already lined up a number of well-known conservative activists and is working toward engaging pastors on his behalf in all of the state\u2019s 99 counties. Vander Plaats, along with Iowa Rep. Steve King, are among the most sought-after conservative names in the state who are still up for grabs, and Cruz is thought to have a good chance with both of them. \n\nDebate Night \n\n            By \nHadas Gold\n\n\u201cHe spent much of the early season building organization in key states, and so there was some hit on him initially, that, \u2018He\u2019s not here enough, we don\u2019t see him enough,\u2019\u201d Vander Plaats said, discussing Cruz\u2019s strategy. \u201cWhat he was doing is putting up, nationally, an infrastructure to be successful long term. Add to that the cash on hand\u2026and the most recent debate performance. It seems more and more people are warming to a Ted Cruz candidacy.\u201d\nThe week will also bring new Cruz ads to the Iowa airwaves \u2013 some bought by one of his affiliated super PACs and others by the campaign itself. All of them will be used to reach the evangelicals who appear eager to reward a conservative outsider.\nCertainly, Cruz still lags Trump and Carson. But friends and foes alike say Cruz is the candidate best positioned to benefit should either of those poll-leaders stumble. He has refused to attack the candidates and in fact invited Trump to co-headline a rally opposing the Iran nuclear deal. Thanks to a reputation built by being a thorn in the side of GOP leadership, he has managed to create an image of a true outsider with an insider\u2019s understanding of policy.\n\"People are increasingly saying he has one of the better potential paths\" to the nomination, said a source from another rival campaign. \u201cThere's lots of people in D.C. who shudder at the prospect of Cruz being the nominee. He's ruffled so many feathers in town, there's a healthy dislike of him in the institutional operative class \u2026 He wears that as a badge of honor, and he should. It helps him project the outsider image even though he's a sitting U.S. senator.\" \nSince last week\u2019s Republican debate, GOP odds-makers are increasingly talking up the possibility of a Cruz-Rubio primary fight, a contest that would see two young Cuban-Americans running for the nomination of a party historically led by older white men. Indeed, this could be the outsider vs. insider, conservative vs. establishment face-off that so many on the right have been angling for.\n\n\n\n            By \nKatie Glueck\n\n\"They appear,\" said Doug Gross, an Iowa Republican who sees Cruz as unelectable, \"to be the two biggest talents in the party.\" \nIndeed, Cruz and Rubio are on a collision course. They argued last week over their records on immigration reform as Rubio\u2019s campaign sought to cast doubts on Cruz\u2019s conservative bona fides while Cruz dismissed Rubio's characterization of his position as \"laughingly, blazingly, on its face false.\u201d\nStill, as Republicans working for other candidates admit Cruz is gaining steam, rivals argue his nomination would give the White House to the Democrats.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he can win a general election. I think he would get beat really bad,\u201d said the first source from another campaign. \u201cBut I think he can win the nomination of the Republican Party.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Increasingly, the field sees a clear path for Cruz into March.", "title": "Rival campaigns starting to fear Ted Cruz", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/ted-cruz-republicans-2016-215903", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Fergus Cullen", "Henry C.

The question for 2016 now turns on whether foreign policy fluency and the seasoning of elected office somehow morphs into an asset, a development which could dislodge the two outsiders who are currently perched comfortably atop the polls \u2013 Donald Trump and Ben Carson \u2013 and reorder the race.\nStory Continued Below\n\"It's one thing to have a protest vote,\" New York Republican Rep. Pete King, a member of the Homeland Security Committee and chairman of the subcommittee on counterterrorism and intelligence, told POLITICO. \"If anything good can come of this tragedy, I would hope it would steer the debate toward who can handle Al Qaeda and ISIS and away from sound bites.\"\nIt did on Sunday. As Speaker Paul Ryan ordered the flags at the U.S. Capitol lowered to half-staff to honor the 129 people killed in Paris, including one American student, Nohemi Gonzalez, the Republican presidential field was quizzed on U.S. refugee policy, no-fly zones in Syria, NATO's Article 5 and the use of military force abroad.\nJeb Bush, the former Florida governor, called for a declaration of war against the Islamic State. Sen. Marco Rubio said America was engaged in a \"clash of civilizations.\" But Carson struggled to articulate how exactly his foreign-policy vision would translate in the real world.\n\u201cWell obviously, extending, you know, our support to the French,\u201d he said Sunday on Fox News when asked what a President Carson\u2019s first steps would have been following the Paris terror attack. When host Chris Wallace pressed him three times on who he would call first to put together an international military coalition, Carson demurred three times before saying he would call \"all of the Arab states\" and \"all of our traditional allies.\"\n \"I don't want to leave anybody out,\" Carson said.\n\nWashington And The World\n\n            By \n                    J.M. Berger\n\nDonald Trump, who before the attack had said his ISIS policy would be to \"bomb the s--t out of them,\" was unusually absent, not just from the Sunday interview circuit but the discussion. He had spent the weekend shouting on Twitter in all-caps: \"When will President Obama issue the words RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM?\" \"He is just so bad! CHANGE.\" \"We need much tougher, much smarter leadership - and we need it NOW!\"\nThe violence in France comes at a time in the cycle when numerous 2016 operatives say voters are starting to shift from not just deciding who they like, but who they want to serve as president. Even before the attacks, for instance, a super PAC supporting John Kasich held a focus group in New Hampshire last week and reported that every attendee mentioned \"experience\u201d as important to them. \nIt was the first time that had happened, according to Matt David, a strategist for the Kasich super PAC.\nOn Sunday, Kasich, who has been almost alone in touting his congressional committee experience on the campaign trail, was rushing to get out all his specific prescriptions on Fox: arming the Kurds, putting in a no-fly zone, tying in the Saudis and Jordanians, coordinating intelligence better internationally. \n\"There\u2019s so many things we need to do and, frankly, we\u2019re behind the curve,\u201d Kasich said.\nBush, Kasich, Rubio and Sen. Lindsey Graham were among those who spoke fluently on foreign affairs on the Sunday shows.\n\"I have a plan. Please, for God's sake, wake up to the threats we face,\" Graham, whose poor polling caused him to be excluded from the last GOP debate, said on CNN. \"Hit them before they hit us. Fight them in their backyard, not our backyard.\" Among the most hawkish candidates in the field, Graham has called for sending 10,000 American troops to Iraq and Syria.\nBush spoke confidently about foreign affairs on both CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d and NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d But when NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd asked Bush if he thought Carson or Trump were ready to be commander in chief, he replied, \"I don't know. The words that I hear them speaking give me some concern.\"\n\n2016\n\n            By \nBen Schreckinger\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to know whether voters will more closely scrutinize foreign policy credentials in the wake of the Paris attacks \u2013 or if it will have any material effect at all. Steve Schmidt, a veteran GOP strategist and senior adviser to John McCain's 2008 campaign, predicted the current dynamic would remain unchanged so long as no one in the race \u2013 experienced or unexperienced -- was leveling with the American people about the true costs to quell the threats abroad.\n\"Simply asserting 'I will destroy ISIS' absent any honesty with the American people of what is required to do that is platitudes,\" Schmidt said. For voters, he said, \"There's no difference between an experienced politician offering platitudes and an inexperienced outsider offering platitudes.\"\n \u201cThe American people have been communicated to like children \u2013 by both parties \u2013 and with extreme dishonestly by the administration,\u201d Schmidt said.\nThe Paris attacks are reverberating on the Democratic side of the aisle, as well. \"This election is not only about electing a president,\" as Hillary Clinton said in her opening statement at Saturday's Democratic debate in Des Moines. \"It's also about choosing our next commander in chief.\"\nThroughout the weekend, Republicans trained their fire on Clinton for her refusal, along with President Obama, to label the attackers radical Islamists.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d Rubio said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\" \u201cThat would be like saying we weren\u2019t at war with Nazis because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but weren\u2019t violent themselves.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The Republican primary is shifting from a campaign for the presidency to a test for commander in chief.", "title": "GOP field takes new shape after Paris attacks", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/paris-attacks-2016-republicans-215913", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Chris Wallace", "Pete King", "Henry C.

Clinton said her close relationship with the financial sector grew out of her work to help them rebuild after 9/11. \u201cIt was good for the economy,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.\u201d  So, by that logic, her huge personal and political buckraking was kind of a rebuke to the terrorists, itself. Her status as a Wall St. favorite certainly predates 9/11, but she suggested that the relationship she forged in those dark days spurred an even greater outpouring of support and gratitude in the form of checks.  Now, this says a great deal about Clinton\u2019s meagre gifts as a politician. But it also tells you something about where her party\u2019s priorities are.  Invoking 9/11 is something that ought to be done only when relevant, which Clinton\u2019s was not, and only when facing oblivion. In that case, Clinton was right. Her exposure on the issue of banker nuzzling is much higher in the Democratic primary than the issue of Islamist terrorism.  Republicans today can talk of little else than national security, Paris, refugees and ISIS. But Democrats, even a day after the attacks, were seemingly eager to get off the subjects. The campaign of also-ran Sen. Bernie Sanders was proud to have fought to have limited the amount of the discussion that would involve national security.  Woof.  But Sanders is probably right. There\u2019s not a lot of sense in debating the issue among Democrats since they are in substantial agreement with President Obama. While both Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley tried to look for ways to draw decorous differences with Obama, they are in tune with his larger strategy of containing ISIS and waiting for the aspiring caliphate to die of asphyxiation or, perhaps, boredom.  Clinton has some differences of opinion with Obama, but she isn\u2019t free to discuss them. Not only would she risk backlash from liberals and raise Obama\u2019s ire, but, as moderator John Dickerson ably pointed out, the last foreign intervention Clinton encouraged, the regime change plan for Libya, is a thoroughgoing disaster.  So even as Clinton should be moving beyond Obama\u2019s reach and into a no-contest Democratic nomination, he holds this power over her: If she gets too squirmy on his foreign policy, he will leave her to the foreign policy wolves on the right and left.  And on the issue that will dominate the coming week or more of the campaign \u2013 how many, if any Syrian refugees the U.S. should accept \u2013 Clinton will not be able to pioneer a position that might be attractive to voters. She will have to stand by Obama and say that she also thinks accepting tens of thousands of refugees from Syria is the right thing to do.  And you know the refugee issue is key to Obama. The only emotion beyond annoyance that he displayed in his first press conference after Paris was anger at Sen. Ted Cruz, who has suggested a religious test for the refugees in order to screen out Muslims, and Sen. Marco Rubio, who simply wants to stop the flow altogether.  WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026 It\u2019s no stretch to say that there wouldn\u2019t be an America as we know it without Gilbert du Motier, known and loved here as Marquis de Lafayette. How loved? On his return visit in 1824, some 80,000 citizens of the new republic came to greet him. And if you live east of the Mississippi, you probably live near someplace named for him.\u00a0 The love flowed from the fact that not only did the wealthy young nobleman provide financial support\u00a0and help bring the military might of the France to bear, but also because he added his flamboyant fighting spirit to a Continental force that suffered so much in its eight-year struggle against superpower Britain.  So let the good people of Mt. Vernon tell you about the dinner party that would lead to that remarkable trans-Atlantic friendship: \u201c[Lafayette] attended a dinner with the Duke of Gloucester, the younger brother of British King George III. The Duke complained about the American colonists who had risen up against British rule. He mocked their revolutionary beliefs in the equality of mankind and the right of the people to rule themselves. The Duke further explained how the colonists had organized the Continental Army under the leadership of General George Washington. Lafayette would always remember this dinner as the turning point of his life. \u2018My heart was enlisted,\u2019 he later confessed in his memoirs, \u2018and I thought only of joining my colors to those of the revolutionaries.\u2019\u201d  How many Americans today can say their hearts are enlisted with the current struggle of the people of France? Tens of millions, no doubt.  Got a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

But world events and Carson\u2019s arch-nemesis, Donald Trump, had other plans.  The inherent challenge in Carson\u2019s candidacy is how to translate the ocean of good feelings toward him in the GOP electorate into steadfast support. And for Carson, as with other outsider candidates, that tends to focus on national security issues.  Friday\u2019s Paris attacks shifted the subject matter of the 2016 race to inhospitable terrain for the former neurosurgeon. In his Sunday interview with Chris Wallace, Carson stumbled when asked how he would go about putting together a winning coalition. While Carson probably did himself well by joining Sen. Marco Rubio in calling for a moratorium on accepting Syrian refugees in the wake of the attacks, the overall effect of the discussion will deepen doubts about Carson\u2019s readiness.  And in the two days before the attack, Trump had made it his mission to sew as many doubts about Carson as possible. Trump\u2019s 95-minute tirade against Carson and other members of the GOP field won\u2019t help the polarizing billionaire broaden his base, but it did reinvigorate the same conversation about Carson\u2019s biography that he had seemingly laid to rest on the debate stage.  As we discussed before, Trump\u2019s attacks will harm him with the voters he needs most: evangelical Christians and women. But they will also mar Carson, too.  The obvious beneficiary here is Carly Fiorina, the outsider candidate who has made presidential preparation and foreign policy so much of her focus. With the catastrophic debate performance of John Kasich and the evaporation of Jeb Bush, Fiorina starts to make a more interesting pick as a dark-horse winner in New Hampshire.  1)\u00a0Ted Cruz; 2)\u00a0Marco Rubio; 3)\u00a0Carly Fiorina [+1]; 4)\u00a0Ben Carson [-1]; 5)\u00a0Donald Trump; 6)\u00a0Jeb Bush  On the radar - Rand Paul, Chris Christie Chris Christie, John Kasich, Mike Huckabee, Bobby Jindal and Rick Santorum  What would you say? - Give us your take on the 2016 Power Index we will share the best and brightest with the whole class.

Fiorina said she was \u2018angry that just [Friday] morning, hours before the Paris attacks began and against all the evidence, President Obama declared ISIS \u2018contained\u2019 and took a victory lap.\u2019 \u2018They are not a JV team, Mr. President,\u2019 Fiorina said at the 2015 Sunshine Summit in Orlando, Fla. \u2018They are not contained. They are at our shores and their measure of victory is the body count.\u2019\u201d  [Fiorina is on the campaign trail in New Hampshire today.]  Carson lays out his one-year strategy on illegal immigration - AP:\u201cThe retired neurosurgeon said it could be done easily in a year and suggested prosecuting all first-time offenders, installing a double fence and using technology-driven surveillance to cut down sharply on the percentage of illegal crossings. Those in the U.S. without problems with their stay here would be given a six-month period to register and pay a tax penalty. They would have to pay taxes going forward by taking jobs as guest workers, but would not get citizenship and voting rights.\u201d  Trump Twitter feud over female fighter - Business Insider: \u201cReal-estate tycoon Donald Trump\u00a0went after\u00a0T-Mobile again Sunday evening after the mobile company's\u00a0CEO slammed him for mocking\u00a0UFC fighter Ronda Rousey. Earlier in the year, Trump praised Rousey as a great fighter, but she made it clear that she was no fan of the Republican presidential front-runner. So Trump noted with glee that Rousey suffered a massive upset in a Saturday-night fight. \u2018Glad to see that @RondaRousey lost her championship fight last night. Was soundly beaten - not a nice person!\u2019 Trump tweeted Sunday. T-Mobile CEO John Legere used the opportunity to bash Trump as bombastic.\u00a0\u2019Donald I dare you to get in ring with her and say that... In fact I would pay big $ to see it,\u2019 he wrote back. \u2018I wonder which intern will get blamed for this stupid tweet.\u2019\u201d  [Trump is slated to hold a rally today in Knoxville, Tenn.]  Jeb pitches war plan in S.C - Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush will talk about his military strategy \u2013 including his views on the response to the Islamist raid in Paris \u2013 today at The Citadel in Charleston, S.C. Bush previewed his talk in an interview with \u201cFOX & Friends\u201d today in which he called for a military buildup as well as taking in some Syrian refugees, with an emphasis on persecuted Christians subject to \u201cincredible screening.\u201d Bush also told CBS News that more U.S. ground forces would be needed in the region, but declined to speculate on specific numbers.  Huckabee heading to Iowa - Ahead of Friday\u2019s Family Leader forum in Des Moines, one of the key events for Iowa social conservatives, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is announcing today an eight-stop swing through the central part of the state starting Thursday.  MAZEL TOV, MONTANA Billings (Mont.) Gazette: \u201cDonna Healy jumped into action when she heard a El Al Airlines flight from Tel Aviv to Los Angeles made an unplanned stop in Billings. As a member of Congregation Beth Aaron, a Jewish community in Billings, Healy understands that many of the folks in Israel and aboard the flight keep a kosher diet. \u2026 \u201cYou just don\u2019t often get a planeload of Israelis in Billings, and we thought we should do what we could to make them comfortable, and kosher food is a part of that,\u201d Healy said. \u2026 A rabbi from Bozeman also made the trip to Billings and delivered a large quantity of food. Michael Eisenberg was one of the stranded travelers who benefited from the surprise meal. \u201cOnce the rabbis came, there was more than enough. Tons.

Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson released a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan on Monday seeking the termination of \u201call public funding\u201d for federal programs to resettle refugees from Syria.\n\u201cThere\u2019s currently no ability to vet these people and by doing so, we are putting America at risk,\u201d Carson said, at a press conference outside of Las Vegas.\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee also called on Ryan to \u201creject the importation of those fleeing the Middle East without assurances that we can separate refugees from terrorists.\u201d\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush told Fox News that the U.S. should profile refugees\n\u201cYeah, absolutely, that\u2019s what screening is. We should be profiling, of course we should. This is Islamic terrorism,\u201d Bush said.\n\n\n  Watch the latest video at \n  video.foxnews.com\n\nObama reacted angrily at the press conference to the calls to profile refugees, and potentially use religion as a factor.\n\u201cWhen I hear folks say that \u2018well maybe we should just admit the Christians but not the Muslims,\u2019 when I hear political leaders suggesting there would be a religious test for which a person who is fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted, when some of those folks themselves comes from families who benefited from protection when they were fleeing political persecution. That\u2019s shameful, that\u2019s not American.\"\nObama received support for his policy from Democratic presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley, who all said at Saturday\u2019s debate they would accept more than the 10,000, but only if properly screened.\nFox News' Catherine Herridge and Rich Edson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "byline": "", "description": "The Paris terror attacks may have put a clamp on President Obama's plans to resettle 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next year, as the number of governors saying they won't take them swells.", "title": "Obama plan for Syrian refugees scrambled by state opposition", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/uplxQUvbDOw/", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Asa Hutchinson", "Martin O'Malley", "Rich Edson", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Jeh Johnson", "Rick Snyder", "Marco Rubio", "Mike Huckabee", "Tom Wolf", "Paul Ryan", "Bernie Sanders", "Greg Abbott", "Catherine Herridge", "Ben Carson"], "orgs": ["House Homeland Security Committee", "Department of Homeland Security"], "election_confidence": 0.8087504569965451, "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-11-16 17:26:41", "org": "fox", "article_id": "fe4a374a4ed550a09ed9eb23cf13f9bd", "date_access": "2015-11-16 20:23:07.608706"},

Politico, CNN and the Wall Street Journal all fell short with stories that were underreported or overhyped.\nThere was no urgent need for Trump to pile on, giving the media\u2019s role in driving these stories. But he has an unerring instinct for an opponent\u2019s weakness.\nSo using a word from Carson\u2019s autobiography to describe his temper as a teenager, Trump told the crowd: \u201cHe said he's pathological and got a pathological disease. I don't want a person who's got pathological disease. If you're pathological, there's no cure for that, folks. I did one of the shows today, I said that if you're a child molester, a sick puppy, there's no cure for that.\u201d\nChild molester? That\u2019s quite a pivot.\nThen he mocked the stabbing story, grabbing his belt, his voice dripping with sarcasm: \u201cHe took a knife and went after a friend and lunged but low and behold it hit the belt and the knife broke. Give me a break.\u201d\nAnd he questioned whether the people of Iowa, and the country, were \u201cstupid\u201d to \u201cbelieve this crap.\u201d\nThe media\u2019s tone in reporting on this has ranged from disapproval to disbelief\u2014this time he\u2019s gone too far, he was desperate, he was way over the top. And it was over the top. Take this New York Times headline: \u201cSome See Attacks by Donald Trump As Start of His Downfall.\u201d Some see\u2014I wonder who.\nHow many times have we been through these media predictions of Trump\u2019s imminent demise? What Trump\u2019s fans love about him is that he does go too far, that he entertains by being outrageous, because they see that as thumbing his nose at a discredited political establishment.\nCarson, who has had very tough words for the media and their \"lies,\" always deflects questions about Trump\u2019s assaults. When I interviewed him last week, he dialed things down by calmly explaining the meaning of the word pathological.\nAt a news conference on Friday, he talked about a \u201cgratuitous attack\u201d without using Trump\u2019s name. He also invoked a signature Bill Clinton phrase from the 1992 campaign, \u201cthe politics of personal destruction.\u201d\nIt would tarnish Carson\u2019s brand to get into a street fight with Trump, who, in rhetorical terms, always carries a knife. And while Carson\u2019s reticence often frustrates reporters, that calm, measured approach is at the heart of his appeal to voters.\nWhy would a candidate volunteer that he tried to knife someone and almost hit his mother in the head with a hammer? Because his is a story of redemption. He found religion a half century ago, turned his life around and became a leading neurosurgeon.\nWhen I asked him about his account of his teenage years, Carson said: \u201cWell, I believe in full disclosure, and if I hadn't revealed that, then that would have been a story. Because then you say\u201d\u2014here he lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper\u2014\u201cdo you know what this guy did, oh my God.\u201d\nFrom Trump\u2019s perspective, the swipes against Carson both raise doubt about his temperament and reinforce the billionaire\u2019s reputation for toughness. His camp sees the same dynamic in his immigration message\u2014which now comes with talk of a \u201cdeportation force\u201d\u2014in that Trump is the guy who knocks heads and speaks uncomfortable truths. And the appalling terror attacks in Paris will only reinforce that message.\nWhether Trump goes too far\u2014or whether voters see him as an insult comic taking on worthy targets\u2014won\u2019t truly be known until the Iowa caucuses.\nClick for more from Media Buzz\nmedia-buzz\n\nMedia Buzz, hosted by Howard Kurtz, airs on Sundays at 11AM and 5PM ET on Fox News Channel.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this show\n\n\n\n", "byline": "", "description": "When a politician engages in inflammatory rhetoric, his aides often try to walk it back, tone it down, claim things were taken out of context, followed by a terse regret-if-anyone-was-offended statement.", "title": "Trump\u2019s attacks on Carson\u2019s 'crap': Why he\u2019s not backing down", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/ppGUrvalw-w/", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Bill Clinton", "Ben Carson", "Howard Kurtz"], "orgs": [], "election_confidence": 0.9585346375035915, "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-11-16 10:00:46", "org": "fox", "article_id": "490fb90f96f5fb203d8f2742f14de5d5", "date_access": "2015-11-16 10:19:05.797914"},

Paris, Beirut and the bombing of a Russian jetliner make that abundantly clear 14 years after 9/11, the worst terrorist attacks on American soil. To listen to the presidential candidates, however, is to listen to two very distinctly different worldviews. President Obama warned Monday against sending ground troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS. He argued that while American troops could clear and hold any area, unless Americans are \"prepared for a permanent occupation,\" then it would be a fool's errand. Obama, who has called for bringing in 10,000 Syrian refugees \u2014 after screenings \u2014 also argued for keeping doors open to those fleeing terrorism. \"Slamming the door in their faces would be a betrayal of our values,\" he said at the G20 Summit in Turkey. He also forcefully criticized, without saying their names, Republicans, like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who the president said would like to implement a \"religious test\" for refugees. It all sets up thorny issues to be debated over the next year over national security and the two parties' approaches. Americans will have to decide, in this post-Iraq war world, between which approach they believe is best to deal with terrorism and the fully emerged threat of ISIS. On one side, similar to President Obama's view, is a continued pursuit of multilateralism, a reluctance to use ground troops and a relative openness to refugees and immigrants. On the other, a return to a more hawkish role as the clear world leader, more willing to intervene in conflicts and more protectionist. There's also the role of surveillance, domestic and foreign, and getting private companies, like Apple, to allow the U.S. government access. That will almost certainly become a central theme in the discussions around what to do about ISIS. The debate crosses party lines. Liberals on the left and libertarians on the right argue in favor of privacy. Democratic centrists are sensitive to that debate, but are against totally shutting down NSA programs. And Republican hawks strongly support using all of the tools at the government's disposal. Jeb Bush argued immediately after the attacks essentially that the NSA's hands shouldn't be tied. It's a subject Hillary Clinton has struggled with. In February, she called for more \"transparency\" from the NSA, but waffled on what it's role should be. \"How much is too much? And how much is not enough? That's the hard part,\" she said. \"I think if Americans felt like, No. 1, you're not going after my personal information, the content of my personal information. But I do want you to get the bad guys, because I don't want them to use social media, to use communications devices invented right here to plot against us. So let's draw the line. And I think it's hard if everybody's in their corner. So I resist saying it has to be this or that. I want us to come to a better balance.\" Three months later, she came out in favor of a bill that ended the NSA's bulk data-collection program endorsed by the White House. President Obama's approval on foreign policy has nosedived since the rise of ISIS and his previous dismissing the group as a \"JV\" version of al Qaeda. Just 32 percent approved of his handling of foreign policy in a September NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. That, and more than a decade of wars after 9/11, set the backdrop of this election. Here's what candidates from both parties have laid out over the last few days since the Paris attacks Friday:  Democrats Democrats have wanted to talk about kitchen-table economic issues. Those had been dominating the Democratic side of the primary to this point. Even at Saturday night's debate, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders quickly pivoted to economic issues away from France in his opening remarks. And while the Paris attacks came up at Democratic-candidate events this weekend, they mostly focused on their stump speeches. NPR's Tamara Keith reports that Clinton, for example, spent two-and-a-half minutes on Paris and then pivoted. \"I am the only one who won't raise middle-class taxes,\" she said, an implicit shot at Sanders. The Democratic positions of what to do about ISIS Saturday exposed only minor cleavages compared to the gulf between them and Republicans. Here's a summary of the Democrats' positions from that night, plus the Obama administration's view: President Obama: Equip the Kurds and moderate forces in Syria; at the G20, seek \"additional contributions\" from allies to \"bring more force to bear,\" per White House foreign-policy adviser Ben Rhodes speaking on NBC's Meet the Press Sunday. Bernie Sanders:  Lead the world and beat ISIS, though he abandoned the topic two sentences into his opening remarks. He noted climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism, tried to use Iraq against Clinton and said the bulk of the responsibility for the growth of ISIS is the U.S.'s because of Iraq. He said the U.S. needs to lead an international coalition, particularly of Muslim nations who should \"fight and defend their way of life.\" He called for them to get their hands \"dirty\" and for them to put boots on the ground. Sanders went so far as to call it a \"war for the soul of Islam.\" He reiterated that the U.S., U.K. and France should support, but was critical of Muslim countries whom he said have not led. He spoke against U.S.-led regime changes in Latin America. But again came back to a coalition with American leadership to \"destroy\" ISIS. He noted the U.S. should bring in refugees and pointed to warfare changing and is not in favor of sending in American troops. Clinton:  She had some stronger language off the top, noting the need for \"resolve\" and to bring the world together. She said allies needed to better coordinate and took an implicit shot at President Obama, saying ISIS needed to be defeated not contained. She also took aim at Sander indirectly, saying that all other issues are dependent on being safe. She said she only supports military use as a last resort and that the U.S. needs to use diplomacy, development aid, law enforcement and intelligence coordination. She is in favor of using special ops, but in a \"support\" role. She had a flub when she said, \"This cannot be an American fight.\" That drew criticism from Democratic Gov. Martin O'Malley on stage with her \u2014 and the right. She said American \"leadership,\" though, was essential. She walked back the not an American fight line later in the weekend in the face of criticism, saying the U.S. has to be rallying partners and allies and pulling countries off the sidelines. She tried to put some space between herself and President Obama by also harkening back to her favoring training and equipping moderates fighters in Syria. She swatted at Sanders, telling him that \"jihadi\" terrorism existed before 9/11 to combat the idea that Iraq caused all of what's being seen today. She said it was more complex than Sanders, O'Malley were making it out to be on stage. She argued that people in the region need to be given a better way of life. She disagreed, in part, with Sanders on Muslim countries. She said he was being unfair to Jordan, which she said has taken risk for U.S. on refugees and more. But she agreed that Turkey and Gulf countries need to \"make up their mind\" about which side they're on and commit. She said there needs to be a whole government approach, including aid. She said she preferred the term \"jihadi\" extremism instead of \"Islamic terrorism,\" which Republicans are calling for because it is not helpful to say radical Islam if the U.S. is going to reach out to Muslim countries and try to get them off the sidelines. She said the term Republicans want used open the U.S. up for accusations that they're using \"shortcut\" language to say the U.S. is at war with Islam. She noted that George W. Bush made it a point to say the U.S. wasn't at war with a religion but with \"evil.\" She claimed that post-9/11 military force authorization covers presidential action, but she said a president should go through Congress. On refugees, she would go higher than President Obama, from 10,000 to 65,000, but only with careful screening, warning not to allow people in who could harm the U.S. She disagreed with the implication from O'Malley and Sanders that U.S. should fight differently or without Marines, as O'Malley suggested, advocating for a strong but streamlined defense. O'Malley: Collaborate, anticipate threats and lead world. It is America's fight, he told Clinton, but that the U.S. needs to pursue a multilateral approach. He stressed support for human intelligence. (Whether to emphasize HUMINT or tech surveillance is a decades-long CIA internal debate.) He stressed human intelligence despite repeatedly pointing out that the this is a 21st Century fight. He, too, chose \"radical jihadis\" as his term. And he would go to 65,000 refugees, something he says he was first to call for. (Fifteen Senate Democrats wrote a letter encouraging Obama to bring in that number in September.) He is not in favor of sending in Marines or traditional ground troops.  Republicans Terrorism and foreign policy have been a top issue for Republican primary voters for nearly a year following high-profile acts of brutality from ISIS, including the video of the beheading of a journalist. It was clear after that, the hawks were back in the GOP.  To varying degrees, Republicans are proposing: declarations of war, invoking NATO's Article 5 (which says that an attack on one is an attack on all), stop any plans to bring in Syrian refugees or focus on Christians, air power and no-fly zones, use the words \"radical Islamic terrorism,\" some want ground troops and Donald Trump wants to \"watch and study the mosques,\" and he blamed a lack of guns in France for the attacks. Because there are so many GOP candidates, below is some of what they said, by topic, in response to ISIS: Article 5/declare war: Rubio: \"First, I would ask our allies to invoke Article 5. This is clearly an act of war and an attack on one of our NATO allies. And we should invoke Article 5 of the NATO agreement, and bring everyone together to put together a coalition to confront this challenge.\" Bush: \"We should declare war and harness all of the power that the United States can bring to bear both diplomatic and military, of course, to be able to take out ISIS. We have the capabilities of doing this, we just haven't shown the will.\" Kasich: \"If the U.S. were to continue to lead from behind, we will leave the world a much more dangerous place. ... Just as France did for us in aftermath of the infamous 9/11 attacks, we should invoke Article 5, the mutual defense clause, of the North Atlantic Treaty.\" Refugees:  Several candidates have said the U.S. should halt plans to bring in refugees from Syria. Rubio: \"We won't be able to take more refugees. It's not that we don't want to, it's that we can't. Because there's no way to background check someone that's coming from Syria. Who do you call and do a background check on them?\" Bush on CNN:\"We should focus our efforts as it relates to refugees on the Christians that are being slaughtered.\" On Meet the Press, he said, the U.S. had a \"responsibility\" to help refugees, but \"focus ought to be on the Christians who have no place in Syria anymore.\" Ted Cruz: \"There is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror. If there were a group of radical Christians pledging to murder anyone who had a different religious view than they, we would have a different national security situation.\" Lindsey Graham has said he would accept Syrian refugees. Pressed on it on CNN Sunday, he demurred, saying, \"The good people are leaving because they're being raped and murdered and some terrorists are trying to get in their ranks.\" But Monday afternoon, he called for a \"timeout\" on bringing in refugees. Trump has said if he's president he will force out Syrian refugees already in the U.S. \"We all have heart, and we all want people taken care of and all of that, but with the problems our country has, to take in 250,000 people \u2014 some of whom are going to have problems, big problems \u2014 is just insane. You have to be insane. Terrible.\" (Obama announced accepting 10,000, not 250,000.) Carson said bringing in Syrian refugees would be a \"huge mistake.\" \"Because why wouldn't they infiltrate them with people who are ideologically opposed to us?\" he asked rhetorically on Fox News Sunday. \"It would be foolish for them not to do that.\" He added the U.S. needs to be \"compassionate\" and should resettle them \"over there ... but to bring them here, under these circumstances, is a suspension of intellect.\" Then he said this: \"You know, the reason that the human brain has these big frontal lobes as opposed to other animals, because we can engage in rational thought processing, we can, you know, extract information from the past, the present, process it and project it into a plan. Animals, on the other hand, have big brain stems and rudimentary things, because they react. We don't have to just react, we can think.\" No-fly zone/shooting down Russian planes:  Multiple candidates have advocated no-fly zones and even shooting down Russian planes if they violated it. (Hillary Clinton endorsed a no-fly zone last month to create \"humanitarian corridors.\") Of Republicans, Bush, Carson, Christie, Fiorina, Graham, Kasich and Rubio have all endorsed no-fly zones. Graham: \"The best thing the world could do for Syrian people is to create a safe haven within Syria, a no-fly zone.\" Carson suggested shooting down a Russian plane if it violated a U.S.-enforced no-fly zone. \"If they violate it, we will, in fact, enforce it. We'll see what happens. For us to always be backing down because we're afraid of a conflict, that's not how we became a great nation, Chris,\" he told Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday. Christie has said he would shoot down a Russian jet if it violated the airspace, and Rubio also made that suggestion a month ago. \"If you are going to have a no-fly zone, it has to be against anyone who would dare intrude on it,\" Rubio said on CNBC Oct. 5. \"And I am confident that the United States Air Force can enforce that, including against the Russians. That I believe the Russians would not test that. I don't think it's in the Russians' interest to engage in an armed conflict with the United States.\" Rand Paul is against a no-fly zone. Say 'radical Islamic terrorism': Cruz: \"As long as we have a Commander-in-Chief unwilling even to utter the words 'radical Islamic terrorism,' we will not have a concerted effort to defeat these radicals before they continue to murder more and more innocents.\" Rubio said he didn't get why Clinton wouldn't say it. \"I don't understand it. That would be like saying we were not at war with Nazis because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but weren't violent themselves.\" Bush: \"This is not a question of religion. This is a political ideology that has co-opted a religion, and I think it's more than acceptable to call it for what it is and then organize an effort to destroy it.\" Trump tweeted: \"When will President Obama issue the words RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM? He can't say it, and unless he will, the problem will not be solved!\" Ground troops:  Americans have been split on sending ground troops in to fight ISIS. A Quinnipiac poll from August found a narrow majority in support of that, but with major ideological splits \u2014 73 percent of Republicans were in favor, but just 37 percent of Democrats. That might help explain why no Democrats have proposed sending in ground forces and a handful of Republicans either have or have expressed openness to doing so. Graham, Rick Santorum, John Kasich of Ohio, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Bush, Trump and Carson have said they are in favor of ground troops to one degree or another (or in Carson's view \u2014 \"probably\"). Graham and Santorum have been the most forthright on using ground troops as a strategy. Kasich said they'd be needed. Jindal would do it if the military recommended it. Bush said on Meet the Press he'd \"absolutely\" be in favor of \"boots on the ground\" in Syria and said that the U.S. \"can't do it alone, ... but we need to lead.\" He also would continue to advocate getting rid of Assad, fight ISIS at same time and build up Free Syrian Army. Trump, when pressed on MSNBC's Morning Joe, said he'd be in favor of 10,000 troops, but would encourage Gulf states to put \"more skin in the game.\" Carson said Friday \"boots on the ground would probably be important,\" but then told Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday, \"[F]or me to pretend like I have all of that knowledge and the ability to formulate all the specific plans and how to do it, I think is foolish, and I think anybody else who thinks they know it all is foolish also.\" Cruz said Kurds should be used \"as our boots on the ground.\" French guns:  Trump Saturday in Texas: \"You can say what you want, but if they had guns \u2014 if our people had guns, if they were allowed to carry \u2014 it would have been a much, much different situation.\"\n", "byline": "", "description": "American politics are more divided than at any time in modern history \u2014 and that rift is as wide as it gets when it comes to foreign policy, something made very clear after the Paris attacks.", "title": "The Real Debate: Two Very Different World Views On Terrorism", "url": "http://www.npr.org/2015/11/16/456186628/the-real-debate-two-very-different-world-views-on-terrorism", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Donald Trump", "Chris Wallace", "Martin O'Malley", "Rick Santorum", "Lindsey Graham", "Tamara Keith", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "John Moore", "Ben Rhodes", "George W.

That fact has spurred a strong reaction from many politicians here in the United States over the resettlement of Syrian refugees, with swift opposition from many Republican governors, and one Democrat, to further resettlement of Syrian refugees in their states. \n\n\n\n    // Require.js is on the page (new Seamus)\n    if (typeof requirejs !== 'undefined') {\n        // Create a local require.js namespace\n        var require_map_refugee_blocks_20151116 = requirejs.config({\n            context: 'map-refugee-blocks-20151116',\n            paths: {\n                'pym': 'http://apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/map-refugee-blocks-20151116/js/lib/pym'\n            },\n    \t\tshim: {\n    \t\t\t'pym': { exports: 'pym' }\n    \t\t}\n        });\n\n        // Load pym into locale namespace\n        require_map_refugee_blocks_20151116(['require', 'pym'], function (require, Pym) {\n            // Create pym parent\n            var pymParent = new Pym.Parent(\n                'responsive-embed-map-refugee-blocks-20151116',\n                'http://apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/map-refugee-blocks-20151116/child.html',\n                {}\n            );\n\n            // Unbind events when the page changes\n            document.addEventListener('npr:pageUnload', function (e) {\n                // Unbind *this* event once its run once\n                e.target.removeEventListener(e.type, arguments.callee);\n\n                // Pym versions with \"remove\"\n                if (typeof pymParent.remove == 'function') {\n                    pymParent.remove();\n                // Pym version without \"remove\"\n                } else {\n                    // Unbind pym events\n                    window.removeEventListener('message', pymParent._processMessage);\n                    window.removeEventListener('resize', pymParent._onResize);\n                }\n\n                // Explicitly unload pym library\n                require_map_refugee_blocks_20151116.undef('pym');\n                require_map_refugee_blocks_20151116 = null;\n            })\n        });\n    // Require.js is not on the page, but jQuery is (old Seamus)\n    } else if (typeof $ !== 'undefined' && typeof $.getScript === 'function') {\n        // Load pym\n        $.getScript('http://apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/map-refugee-blocks-20151116/js/lib/pym.js').done(function () {\n            // Wait for page load\n            $(function () {\n                // Create pym parent\n                var pymParent = new pym.Parent(\n                    'responsive-embed-map-refugee-blocks-20151116',\n                    'http://apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/map-refugee-blocks-20151116/child.html',\n                    {}\n                );\n            });\n        });\n    // Neither require.js nor jQuery are on the page\n    } else {\n        console.error('Could not load map-refugee-blocks-20151116!

Those include: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin. In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott sent a letter directly to President Obama on Monday. He said, \"I write to inform you that the State of Texas will not accept any refugees from Syria in the wake of the deadly terrorist attack in Paris.\" Abbott cited several threats from ISIS he says the state has seen in recent years, including a May shooting in Garland, Texas, at the site of a contest for drawings of the Prophet Mohamed New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan is the sole Democratic governor to make this call. Hassan's spokesman, William Hinkle, said in a statement, \"The Governor believes that the federal government should halt acceptance of refugees from Syria until intelligence and defense officials can assure that the process for vetting all refugees, including those from Syria, is as strong as possible.\" Hassan is a candidate for the U.S. Senate from New Hampshire in 2016, challenging incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte. Ayotte made a similar statement regarding refugees on Monday. So far the U.S. has brought in about 2,000 Syrian refugees, mainly due to the arduous security procedures. The U.S. has faced pressure to take more refugees as Europe has been flooded by hundreds of thousands from conflict zones in the Middle East and Africa. At least two governors said they would continue to accept refugees on Monday, Democrats John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania. Just two months ago, the Obama administration announced a plan to resettle 100,000 refugees from conflict zones around the world, with a plan to bring in 10,000 from Syria in the next year. At the time, Secretary of State John Kerry addressed security concerns. \"One of the reasons it's difficult is that post-9/11, we have new laws and new requirements with respect to security background checks and vetting, so it takes longer than one would like,\" Kerry said. \"And we cannot cut corners with respect to those security requirements.\" Still, many Republican presidential candidates have raised serious concerns about the security risk of bringing Syrian refugees into the country. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., questioned the ability of the federal government to conduct proper screenings. He told ABC's This Week, \"There is no background check system in the world that allows us to find that out because who do you call in Syria to background check them?\" In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Trump said of Syrian refugee resettlement, \"It would be one of the great Trojan horses.\" Democratic candidates were asked about refugees during their debate on CBS Saturday night. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said proper screening is the \"number one requirement.\" She added, \"I also said that we should increase numbers of refugees.\" Instead of the 10,000 that the Obama administration has promised to bring in over the next year, Clinton and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley said the number should be 65,000. Ohio Governor John Kasich, also a GOP candidate for president, has also called for blocking refugees from entering his state on Monday. \"It would be incumbent on people to prove who they are so that we would be certain because we can't be in a position of inviting the enemy in,\" Kasich told Fox News on Sunday. (Last week, NPR reported on a Syrian family that resettled in Toledo, Ohio.) South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham called for a \"timeout\" on Syrian refugees Monday. He previously spoke of solving the humanitarian crisis in Syria. \"The good people are leaving because they're being raped and murdered and some terrorists are trying to get in their ranks,\" he told CNN. \"The best thing the world could do for Syrian people is to create a safe haven within Syria, a no-fly zone.\" Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush had a similar stance yesterday on NBC's Meet The Press. \"The great majority of refugees need to be safely kept in Syria, which means the safe zones need to be serious. We need to build a coalition that can fight both Assad and ISIS and give people safe haven,\" he said. Bush added, \"I think our focus ought to be on the Christians who have no place in Syria anymore. They're being beheaded, they're being executed by both sides. And I think we have a responsibility to help.\" That comment is similar to remarks Sen. Ted Cruz made on the trail in South Carolina yesterday. \"There is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror,\" Cruz asserted. President Obama rebuked those comments during a news conference in Antalya, Turkey, on Monday. \"When I hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which person who's fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted, when some of those folks themselves come from families who benefited from protection when they were fleeing political persecution, that's shameful,\" Obama said, apparently referring to the fact that Cruz's father fled Cuba in the 1950s after fighting the regime of dictator Fulgencio Batista. In 2014, Cruz told Fox News that the U.S. should admit refugees, given the country's history as a nation of immigrants. \"We have to continue to be vigilant to make sure those coming are not affiliated with the terrorists, but we can do that,\" Cruz said at the time. Dr. Ben Carson said during a press conference on Monday that there should not be a religious test, but an \"ideological test.\" During an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Carson had said that it's a mistake to let Syrian refugees in \"Because why wouldn't they infiltrate them with people who are ideologically opposed to us? It would be foolish for them not to do that.\" In speaking of how foolish he believes it is to allow Syrian refugees into the U.S., Carson added, \"You know, the reason that the human brain has these big frontal lobes as opposed to other animals, because we can engage in rational thought processing... Animals, on the other hand, have big brain stems and rudimentary things, because they react. We don't have to just react, we can think.\" On Monday, Carson sent letters to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., urging them to end all funding for federal programs to resettle Syrian refugees. There was more reaction from Congress, as the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Tx., raised security concerns and asked President Obama to temporarily suspend admission of Syrian refugees. Congress is currently in the process of passing appropriations bills to keep the government funded past December 11. They could use those bills to cut funding for resettlement, or pass separate legislation on the matter. House Speaker Paul Ryan has received requests from various governors and presidential candidates to do what he can to stop refugee resettlement.\n", "byline": "", "description": "Governors in more than a dozen states have asked the federal government not to resettle any more Syrian refugees in their states, as presidential candidates also question the ability to screen them.", "title": "Sweeping Reactions From Politicians Over Syrian Refugees In U.S.", "url": "http://www.npr.org/2015/11/16/456209911/sweeping-reactions-from-politicians-over-syrian-refugees-in-u-s", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["John Kerry", "Kelly Ayotte", "Martin O'Malley", "Lindsey Graham", "Fulgencio Batista", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "John Kasich", "Marco Rubio", "Tom Wolf", "Paul Ryan", "Maggie Hassan", "Greg Abbott", "Ted Cruz", "Ben Carson", "Jim Cole"], "orgs": ["Senate", "CNBC", "House Homeland Security Committee", "GOP", "Congress"], "election_confidence": 0.9898291038423089, "authors": [{"author_id": 37437, "fullname": "arnie seipel", "primary_org": "npr"}], "date_written": "2015-11-16 21:20:00", "org": "npr", "article_id": "22772a0dd2bdb2c3115f436e4dad75d9", "date_access": "2015-11-16 21:32:57.204244"},
{"body": "\u201cBelieve it or not, I just defended President Obama to a gathering of foreign nationals,\u201d Ed Rogers, a Republican political consultant who writes for the Washington Post\u2019s Insiders blog, reported on Friday:\nRogers\u2019s post carries no time stamp but appears to have preceded Friday night\u2019s Islamic State attacks in Paris, as it makes no mention of them. The next day Breitbart.com noted a similar, post-Paris criticism coming by way of the left:\nClemons was at pains to note \u201cthat I have a different view of that, that that\u2019s not my view.\u201d Yet can anyone deny that the Obama administration\u2019s response to the Islamic State has been fatuous and incoherent?\nIn a January 2014 interview with the New Yorker\u2019s David Remnick, the president famously disparaged ISIS as \u201cthe jayvee team.\u201d He elaborated: \u201cI think there is a distinction between the capacity and reach of a bin Laden and a network that is actively planning major terrorist plots against the homeland versus jihadists who are engaged in various local power struggles and disputes, often sectarian.\u201d\nEight months later Islamic State terrorists were beheading American hostages, and Obama was talking tough. \u201cYou can\u2019t contain an organization that is running roughshod through that much territory, causing that much havoc, displacing that many people, killing that many innocents, enslaving that many women,\u201d he said during a press conference at a NATO summit in Wales. \u201cThe goal has to be to dismantle them.\u201d\nLater, he contradicted that: \u201cFrom the start, our goal has been first to contain and we have contained them,\u201d the Daily Caller quotes him telling ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos. In the same interview, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re gaining strength.\u201d\nOops. That interview aired on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d last Friday, just hours before the Paris attacks. \u201cIf this is what ISIS looked like contained, I shudder to think what ISIS looks like uncontained,\u201d CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper quipped Sunday while interviewing Ben Rhodes, Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser for strategic communications. The same day Stephanopoulos asked Rhodes to defend the president against Republican criticism. \u201cWell, look, George,\u201d he said, \u201cthe president was responding very specifically to the geographic expansion of ISIL in Iraq and Syria.\u201d\nRhodes went on to acknowledge \u201cthat there is a threat posed by ISIL .\u00a0.\u00a0. in their aspirations to project power overseas.\u201d You don\u2019t say. Of course in January 2014 Obama was dismissing the ISIS threat precisely on the ground that it wasn\u2019t, in his words, \u201ca network that is actively planning major terrorist plots against the homeland.\u201d\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll have to be nimble, George,\u201d Rhodes told Stephanapoulos Sunday. Good luck with that. Reuters reports that at a press conference today in Turkey, Obama declared: \u201cWe are going to continue the strategy that has the best chance of working. .\u00a0.\u00a0. There will be an intensification of the strategy that we put forward but the strategy that we put forward is the strategy that ultimately is going to work.\u201d\nIf anything, the inevitable Democratic presidential nominee inspires even less confidence. On Saturday night Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and an unidentified man met in an Iowa debate moderated by CBS\u2019s John Dickerson, who asked surprisingly good questions and got appallingly bad answers.\nDickerson began by quoting Obama\u2019s Friday remarks and asking Mrs. Clinton, who was secretary of state during the president\u2019s first term: \u201cWon\u2019t the legacy of this administration .\u00a0.\u00a0. be that it underestimated the threats from ISIS?\u201d She began with some generalities about the need for effective leadership, then made clear she would be reluctant to provide it:\nIf American troops are risking their lives in Iraq, what in the world does Mrs. Clinton mean when she says \u201cthis cannot be an American fight\u201d? Mrs. Clinton offered a clue when Dickerson pressed her on the administration\u2019s underestimation of the Islamic State:\nTry to follow that. The U.S. withdrawal from Iraq, which Obama touted as one of his great first-term accomplishments, turns out to have been forced upon him by George W. Bush. Everything would have been fine anyway except that the Iraqis screwed it up. But now it\u2019s up to the Iraqis to make things right, along with Assad, to overthrow whom Mrs. Clinton wanted \u201cto train and equip moderates.\u201d And who stopped her from carrying out that plan, George W. Bush?\nLater came this revealing exchange:\nGeorge W. Bush again? Mrs. Clinton relies awfully heavily on what we hereby name the argumentum ad dubyam. Though we should note that Bush tended to refer to \u201cterrorism\u201d; \u201cviolent extremism\u201d is an Obama administration euphemism.\nDickerson followed up by quoting a speech in which Mrs. Clinton emphasized the importance of knowing one\u2019s enemy. \u201cCan you explain what that means in the context of this kind of barbarism?\u201d The short answer was no: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult when you deal with ISIS and organizations like that whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious that it doesn\u2019t seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power.\u201d\nMrs. Clinton is quite right to emphasize that we\u2019re \u201cnot at war with Islam\u201d or \u201cwith all Muslims.\u201d Perhaps it even overstates the case to say we\u2019re at war with \u201cradical Islam.\u201d But it is an act of willful ignorance to deny that the enemy\u2019s ideology is Islamic, or even (as per Mrs. Clinton) that the enemy has an intelligible ideology at all.\nYet Mrs. Clinton isn\u2019t even consistent in her denial. It appears she doesn\u2019t know enough to be politically correct. Note that the exchange began with Dickerson quoting her describing ISIS as \u201cradical jihadists,\u201d a term she used earlier in the debate. What exactly does she think jihad is a pillar of? She might as well say she loves Christians but can\u2019t abide trinitarians.\nGiven all this, it\u2019s hard to deny that Ed Rogers\u2019s and Steve Clemons\u2019s foreign interlocutors had a point in faulting the U.S. for its lack of leadership. Then again, when the U.S. was leading, 12 to 14 years ago, one suspects they were not among those who eagerly followed.\nTwo Websites in One!\u2014I\nTwo Websites in One!\u2014II\nOther Than That, the Story Was Accurate   \u201cIn a story Nov. 14 about former faculty members recommending ways for the University of Missouri to address racial issues, The Associated Press reported erroneously that the Columbia campus\u2019 interim chancellor, Hank Foley, is black.
