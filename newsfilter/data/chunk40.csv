Entertainment: A Song Inspired by a Bizarre Love Triangle,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/03/t-magazine/unknown-mortal-orchestra-music-video.html,nyt,"The initial concept for the psych-rock trio Unknown Mortal Orchestra’s third full-length album, “Multi-Love,” began with the title. “When I first wrote down the term ‘multi-love,’ I didn’t really know what it meant or why it resonated with me,” frontman Ruban Nielson explains. “But the meaning of it became more complex as the year went on.” Nielson set out to make a “happy record” — a seemingly painless undertaking. But when an unlikely friendship blossomed with a young woman on the road, it evolved into a love triangle between Nielson, his wife and “Woman X” — and complications set in.

The trio lived together for about a year, along with Nielson and his wife’s two children, in the family’s Portland home while Nielson recorded the album — an unlikely fairy tale, which ended when Woman X’s visa ran out and she was forced to leave the country. The anxieties of a long-distance romance, and the limitations of a device-based connection, inspired the song “Can’t Keep Checking My Phone,” the video for which premieres here. “It’s about that moment when you’re sick of waiting for someone to get back to you, so you pretend you don’t have a phone to keep yourself from going crazy,” Nielson says.

On the track, Nielson combines a thousand tiny fragments of sound into a disco-ball mosaic — psychedelic synths, rhythmic funk, electronic beats, lush falsetto — and produces a seductive dance-floor hit. The song inspired the director Dimitri Basil to create a collage of assorted images, like the “Mars Attacks!” trading cards he loved as a child. “The idea was to create a kind of deck based on strange occurrences, syndromes and phenomena,” Basil says. The resulting aesthetic is part sci-fi, part psychological thriller, where the 1950s U.F.O. craze meets “The Twilight Zone” and “The X-Files.” Some of the references are more recognizable: abduction, rapture, gender dysphoria. Others necessitate a Google search: Stendhal syndrome, panphobia, hybristophilia.

More mysterious than the esoteric phenomena illustrated in the video is the concept of love itself, particularly when expanded from one locus of affection into three. Nielson is reluctant to discuss the relationship, but its influence on the record is evident. He seems intent on looking forward and leaving that crazy year behind him. But even after the emotional turmoil he endured during “Multi-Love,” his desire to approach his life and his art from a place of instinct, rather than logic, remains. “I’m always paying close attention to weird coincidences and patterns. I go through phases where I record things that seem significant and build my life and work around that stuff,” Nielson explains. “I make some pretty wild leaps of faith based on vague intuitions.”",0.30659143915068776
First Draft: Ben Carson Shows More Strength in National Poll,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/09/03/ben-carson-shows-more-strength-in-national-poll/,nyt,"A national poll released Thursday gives more confirmation that Ben Carson has developed a head of steam in the Republican field, showing that only Mr. Carson, the retired brain surgeon, outperforms Donald J. Trump in a head-to-head matchup.

Republicans and Republican-leaning likely voters preferred Mr. Carson 55 percent, compared with 36 percent for Mr. Trump, according to the Monmouth University Poll.

“The fact that the only one who can challenge Trump is the only other candidate who has never held or run for elected office speaks volumes to the low regard G.O.P. voters have for the establishment,” Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement.

The poll found Mr. Trump’s overall support still highest when matched against the full Republican field. It rose four percentage points, to 30 percent, since an earlier Monmouth poll before the first debate in early August.

Mr. Carson was in second place in the field, with 18 percent support. Jeb Bush dropped to third since August, with 8 percent, and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin slid to eighth place with 3 percent. Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard executive, doubled her support to 4 percent.

The Monmouth poll is one that CNN will use to determine if Mrs. Fiorina is included in the top-tier debate of Republican candidates in its Sept. 16 debate. She tied for 6th place in the poll, good enough to make the cut.

Mr. Trump continued to lead all rivals among different Republican demographic groups. He was preferred by very conservative voters as well as moderate to liberal ones. He led with Tea Party supporters, with men and with women.

Other findings: Gov. John Kasich of Ohio has seen little movement in his national support since he squeaked onto the main debate stage last month in Cleveland. And Mr. Bush’s favorability has slipped to 41 percent from 52 percent last month.

The poll was conducted by telephone from Aug. 31 to Sept. 2 and has a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points.",0.99983972985182734

We listen to a lot of different kinds of music at Alt.Latino. Every now and then, we like to play material that falls outside of the Latin Alternative vein. So we asked our colleague Anastasia Tsioulcas to bring in tracks that she's collected for her blog, Latitudes, and help us dig deeper into classical and traditional music from across Latin America and Spain. We like to think of Anastasia as our own private musical explorer, but mostly we like to have her on for the fun we have when she's around: lots of laughs, great music and amazing stories. All we're missing is a few drinks and some food, but we're working on that. In the meantime, enjoy the music!",0.33690036552533253
MMA fighter seen on video applying a 'triangle choke hold' to man she says tried to rob her,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/world/~3/SYBOP8mT6us/,fox,"The cellphone video cuts in to show a bloodied, screaming man held on the ground by a woman applying a “triangle choke hold.”

Monique Bastos, an MMA fighter who was on her way to jiu-jitsu training, Esquire reported, said two men jumped her and stole her cellphone on a crowded street in Acailandia, Brazil. One fled, but Bastos said she managed to personally subdue the other.

""I tried to hold my phone, and I realized they were not armed. When they tried to escape, I lifted the rear wheel of the bike and they fell on the ground. The guy who took my phone ran away, but I was able to get the other one,” she told media.

Judging by the video, the second suspect received the brunt of Bastos’ anger.

The fighter said it was the second time she was forced to fight for her phone. In her last bid at vigilante justice, she squared off with two men armed with knives.

“It’s a huge risk, but I did it to defend myself and my friends, so I used what I learned,” she said.",0.30202738166315224
Jeb Bush went hard after Trump in New Hampshire. Then he took some heat on immigration.,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/03/jeb-bush-went-hard-after-trump-in-new-hampshire-then-he-took-some-heat-on-immigration/,washpo,"Republican presidential candidate and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush gestures while speaking during a town hall event at a VFW hall in Norfolk, Virginia, August 28, 2015. (REUTERS/Jay Westcott) HAMPTON, NH -- Jeb Bush took his offensive against Republican presidential rival Donald Trump on the road to this early voting state on Thursday, lambasting the real estate mogul's proposals in his opening remarks and defiantly responding to his jeers. He also faced some heat on immigration, Trump's signature issue. Trump has criticized Bush for speaking Spanish on the campaign trail. Bush said Thursday he believed in campaigning with ""brazos abiertos -- with our arms wide open."" Trump has accused Bush of lacking the ""energy"" to be president. Bush vowed to ""wake up each day with passion and conviction to make sure people's pocketbooks are filled with more money."" The former Florida governor also continued his efforts to cast Trump as insufficiently conservative, calling out Trump's previous praise for a single-payer health-care system; impractical, saying Trump's immigration policy ""does not embrace the American values""; and accusing him of fear-mongering, charging that Trump is ""preying on people's fear and angst."" ""My belief is that if we create the right climate, America is going to rise up and lead the world for the next generation of time,"" said Bush. ""Donald Trump's view is that the end is near."" [Inside Jeb Bush's strategy to deflate Donald Trump and court conservatives] Bush presented himself as the much more optimistic alternative. ""Whatever the issue is, there is one path that is aspirational and hopeful and there is one path that is negative and it is not the right path for this country,"" he said. Bush fielded questions on health care, money in politics and immigration, among other things. He said he would unveil more tax ideas on September 9th, and he promised that he was not ""beholden"" to the donors that have funded his campaign. His audience, a mixture of employees of Foss Manufacturing, the company that hosted the town hall, and activists, infrequently interrupted him for applause, and did not react at all to the criticism of Trump. A tracker was quick to capture and upload video of a woman apparently nodding off. And while Trump wasn't in the room, some of Trump's immigration views were represented by Dennis Lamare, 58, an unsuccessful 2010 Republican candidate for Senate. ""Right now there's an air of appeasement,"" said Lamare. ""It's, 'let them come in! Let them go where they want!'"" Bush waited as Lamare laid out a long, immigration restrictionist argument. The candidate then delivered his own familiar plan for earned legal status, before inviting Lamare to follow up. ""What are you going to do about Mexico?"" he asked. ""We’re being defensive! Why don’t we be offensive for once?"" ""They should enforce their southern border,"" said Bush. ""What about the northern border?"" asked Lamare. ""The northern border is not where, in the last five years, immigration has come from,"" said Bush. ""It has not come from Mexico."" Earlier in the day, during a national television interview, Bush responded to Trump's criticism of him speaking Spanish on the campaign trail, saying that he ""laughed"" when he learned about Trump's remarks. ""People come to this country to pursue their dreams,"" Bush said on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" ""Sometimes they start without speaking English, but they learn English and they add vitality to our country. And the fact that he would say that you only can speak English is kind of ridiculous if you think about it. Are we going to close all the foreign language classes? Why would he have a contract with Univision for his beauty pageant?"" Trump called Bush a ""nice man"" in an interview with Breitbart News published Wednesday. But he added that he ""should really set the example by speaking English while in the United States.” When asked whether he would support Trump if he wins the Republican nomination, Bush said, ""of course."" In Hampton, when the town hall ended, Bush stuck around for photos as Foss employees headed back to work. The Trump lines, heavily previewed in the media, did not generate much discussion. ""It's nice to hear people give their views on the problems we have,"" said John Mourikas, 61, who worked at Foss. ""The Trump stuff -- eh, I didn't really listen to that."" And while Lamare appreciated Bush's candor, he left with a clearer view of why he was inclined to support someone else for president. ""For him to attack Trump -- that's his job up there, to separate himself,"" Lamare said after the town hall ended. ""I can't say whether that worked, but he doesn't really have the charisma that one would expect in a setting like this."" Sullivan reported from Washington ",0.99999999999980882
Donald Trump&#8217;s Republican loyalty pledge means almost nothing,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/03/donald-trumps-loyalty-pledge-means-almost-nothing/,washpo,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump listens during a news conference Aug. 27 after speaking at the TD Convention Center  in Greenville, S.C.  (Richard Shiro/AP) At a 2 p.m. news conference Thursday, GOP front-runner Donald Trump is expected to sign a formal pledge crafted by the Republican National Committee that he will not run for president as an independent if he doesn't win the party's nomination. Which is fine. And a good thing for the RNC, which deserves credit for navigating the murky waters of Trumpworld. But  there is absolutely no reason to think that simply by the act of signing this pledge, Trump will somehow be legally bound to not run as anything but a Republican in 2016. He won't be. This pledge is not, as my colleague Bob Costa notes, a legally binding document. It's like the sort of pledge you get your kids to sign that they will do their homework, make their beds and eat their vegetables before they can play with your iPhone.  It's a statement of intention, but not a binding one. Do I think Trump is secretly plotting a third party bid if he winds up not winning the Republican nomination? No, not at present. Do I think that Trump believes that he will be bound by this pledge from running if he decides that's what he wants to do? Absolutely not. What in Trump's relatively short time as a presidential candidate (or much longer time as a person who takes positions on various issues) suggests that he would feel at all compelled to abide by a pledge put together by the head of a party that he is a) only a relatively recent convert to and b) can't really hurt him, financially or otherwise, if he decides to break it? Trump's entire candidacy is premised on how he doesn't owe anyone anything and how no one can tell him what to do.  So, for the moment, it's in Trump's interest to play nice with the GOP establishment -- since it might allay some fears of voters who are thinking about being for him but wonder if he is, actually, one of them. But  if Trump, at any point over the next few months, feels hard done by the GOP establishment -- or if his poll numbers begin to fade -- is there anything in what he will sign today that keeps him from breaking the pledge not to run? No. Yes, Trump would have to answer for his broken pledge among some Republican voters who took him at his word. But  given Trump's anti-establishment message, there would almost certainly be a big chunk of disaffected Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who would likely take his side in a fight with the national party. Point is: This is a good day for the RNC, which is showing its ability to bring some order to what has been a wild race to date. But  don't assume that Donald Trump signing a piece of paper in front of a bunch of cameras is anything more than a nicely-turned bit of political theater. Because, well, it isn't.",0.99999980441955427
State lawmakers deny &#8216;making out&#8217; in car at Minnesota park,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/03/state-lawmakers-deny-making-out-in-car-at-minnesota-park/,washpo,"Rep. Tim Kelly (R-Red Wing) and Rep. Tara Mack (R-Apple Valley). (Minnesota House of Representatives via AP) Last month, a park ranger in Minnesota issued citations to a man and a woman, whom, he reported, were ""making out"" in a car. The reason you're reading about that encounter here, on a Washington Post political blog, is because the man and woman who received the public nuisance citations are Minnesota state lawmakers. They're denying the ranger's account, which was noted in court records. State Reps. Tim Kelly and Tara Mack, both Republicans, were issued citations following an incident that allegedly occurred on Aug. 25 in a park in Eagan, Minn., according to the St. Paul Pioneer Press. [Politician reportedly leaked fake male prostitution e-mails to hide his real affair] ""The two, who are married to other people, were in Lebanon Hills Regional Park in Eagan when they were allegedly spotted by the officer 'making out' in a parked car about 4:30 p.m., according to documents,"" the Pioneer Press reported."" The officer's notes claim Mack was half undressed when he approached the vehicle."" In fact, according to the Pioneer Press, ""the ranger's notes in court records said Mack's pants were unzipped and pulled down."" (You can see images of the citation notes here.) Mack and Kelly issued separate statements about the park ranger's report, with Kelly calling it ""an absolute lie,"" and Mack describing the ranger's statements as ""egregious and false."" ""I was driving down to Red Wing through Eagan last Tuesday and met Rep. Mack to pick up some documents regarding South Country Health Alliance,"" Kelly said in his statement. ""When we met, a park ranger approached my vehicle and told me I was double-parked. I disputed his characterization and got out of the car to take a picture. He became visibly agitated and returned to his own car. ""Approximately ten minutes later, he returned to my vehicle with a parking ticket citing a nuisance. When I asked what that meant, he responded 'whatever I want it to mean.'"" Both Mack and Kelly said they planned to file complaints, though it was unclear Thursday if they had already done so. By Wednesday evening, the Pioneer Press reported, Dakota County Sheriff Tim Leslie hadn't received any. ""He doesn't know these people. He's just doing his job,"" Leslie told NBC affiliate KARE of the ranger who issued the citations. ""That's what park rangers do. They patrol and they look for problems in the parks, and that's what he was doing.""

New Yorkers, en route to work, were likely the first to see it, because it's inaugural imprint was in The New York Post, in the form of a full page advert. And it isn't at all kind to Chipotle. The ad, which features a flexing, overweight male, looking directly into the camera, smiling, almost snidely, clearly mocks the notion that eating at Chipotle is a healthy life choice. ""Eat two 'all natural' Chipotle burritos a week and you could gain 40 pounds in a year,"" the ad says, oozing with sarcasm. At the very top, large block letters read ''Chipotle' Healthy,' in large block letters. This is what it looks like. The link teased in over-sized capital letters, chubbychipotle.com, leads to a single page website. Within it, Chipotle's slogan—'food with integrity'—is altered so it says 'food with hypocrisy' instead; its commitments to sustainability, antibiotic-free meat, and GMO-free food are also disparaged. Sofrito, the website quips at one point, is a word the chain ""made up for tofu."" In all, there are four sections, and each one of them is equally harsh in its treatment, taking issue with distinct facets of Chipotle's messaging. The campaign is being funded by The Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF), which is only apparent once one scrolls to the very bottom of the website. CCF is a non-profit organization, which lobbies on behalf of the food companies. The group's mission is perhaps most clearly evident in those it deems its adversaries.

""They include self-anointed “food police,” health campaigners, trial lawyers, personal-finance do-gooders, animal-rights misanthropes, and meddling bureaucrats.""

""But there are legitimate ways to challenges these sorts of things. Launching a smear campaign isn't one of them. It's actually just pretty infantile."" Chipotle has earned both praise and skepticism in its ascent to the upper echelon of the fast food world. The company's mission, which is centered around a commitment to sourcing the most ethical ingredients possible, has proven an honest one. Earlier this year, when it became clear that a pork supplier wasn't meeting the company's standards, Chipotle took the fall, and stopped serving pork at hundreds of restaurants around country. The act was met with applause, as consumers celebrated the chain's steadfastness about its core values. Chipotle's announcement that it would no longer serve foods containing genetically modified organisms, however, was far less popular. Much of the media, including The Washington Post's editorial board, accused the chain of irresponsible fear-mongering. But CCF's campaign calls the entirety of Chipotle's messaging into question, which Arnold says is pretty ironic. ""We've always been very transparent in the way that we run our business,"" he said. ""You can't really say the same about the Center for Consumer Freedom."" Indeed, there is reason to believe that the organization's intention might be less pure than their statements make it seem.

[Senate passes No Child Left Behind rewrite, would shrink federal role] In a statement released by his office, Kline explained why he opted not to seek an eighth term. “Strengthening our nation’s classrooms and workplaces has been at the forefront of the committee’s agenda since I was first selected to serve as chairman, and it will continue to be my leading priority in the months ahead,” he said in a statement. “Whether it’s replacing No Child Left Behind, holding the Obama administration accountable for its harmful policies, or strengthening higher education, there is a lot of work to do over the next 16 months. I remain humbled by the opportunity to lead the committee, and I intend to finish strong and to continue delivering commonsense reforms America’s student, parents, workers, and employers deserve.” Kline’s district in the St. Paul suburbs was carried by President Obama in 2012 and has been targeted by Democrats, although Kline easily won reelection in 2014 when the district was labeled by the Cook Political Report as “Solid R” .",0.3084124757967095
"Archaeologists' weapon against ISIS: 5,000 cameras",http://www.foxnews.com/science/2015/09/03/archaeologists-weapon-against-isis-5000-cameras/,fox,"The 2,000-year-old Temple of Bel in Syria was recently blown up by the Islamic State. Now, archeologists are trying to digitally document other antiquities before they suffer the same fate. (Silvan Rehfeld, UNESCO via AP)

Archaeologists and thousands of volunteers are in a race against time to digitally map some of the world's oldest and most important statues, temples, and cities before they can be destroyed by the Islamic State, the Los Angeles Times reports.

If ISIS ""is permitted to wipe the slate clean and rewrite the history of a region that defined global aesthetic and political sensibilities, we will collectively suffer a costly and irreversible defeat,"" Roger Michel, director of the Institute for Digital Archaeology, tells the Telegraph.

In recent months, the terrorist group has blown up a pair of 2,000-year-old temples in Syria and destroyed Iraq's ancient city of Nimrud. ISIS considers these antiquities idolatry, and destroying them is a major facet of its propaganda, notes Forbes.

To combat the loss of history, the institute—a venture between Harvard and Oxford—is spending $2 million to send at least 5,000 high-tech cameras to volunteers in the region to take millions of photos, the Telegraph reports.

The institute will use the photos to create 3-D images, which could be used to make replicas of destroyed sites, something Forbes states MIT has offered to do.

Taking photos at these sites will be dangerous work, and volunteers will only go to sites not yet controlled by ISIS, the Times reports. Though the project started only six weeks ago, time is of the essence.

""We want to do something to document this legacy before it disappears,"" Michel tells the Times. (The group also beheaded an archaeological pioneer in the region.)

Monday whether to extradite to Austria a man who was arrested in

connection with the 71 dead refugees found in an abandoned truck

on an Austrian highway.

Tsvetan Tsvetanov, 32, was held for 72 hours under a

European arrest warrant at his home in the Danube town of Lom on

Monday.

The court in the northwestern town of Montana decided on

Thursday that Tsvetanov should remain under arrest and that the

extradition request hearing will be held next Monday.

Tsvetanov is believed to be one of the three drivers of the

refrigerated truck discovered last Thursday on a highway from

the Hungarian border to Vienna.

A baby girl and three other children were among the dead

crammed into the back of the truck.

Four Bulgarians and one Afghan citizen are already under

arrest pending an investigation in Hungary. They face up to 16

years in prison for trafficking in Hungary plus murder charges

in Austria.

Walker super PAC spends $9.25M in advertising,http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/scott-walker-super-pac-ad-buy/index.html,cnn,"Washington (CNN)Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's affiliated super PAC announced the second phase of its advertising blitz Thursday, with plans to spend $9.25 million introducing Walker to voters in New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.

That comes on top of the $7 million that the group -- Unintimidated PAC -- has already dedicated to Iowa, a state Walker supporters have said is absolutely critical to their candidate.

The PAC plans to spend a whopping $8 million in South Carolina, going on air Nov. 7 and running through that state's primary, Feb. 20.

Smaller buys of $725,000 and $400,000 are planned for New Hampshire and Nevada, respectively, to run in the week before each state's decision day.

READ: Can Scott Walker Recover?

The money is going, in part, into the first ad from Walker's super PAC, introducing him to voters and laying out his core message: that he not only fights, but wins key battles for conservatives. The spot opens with footage of thousands of union protesters at the Wisconsin statehouse, pushing their way past police and screaming.

It's the central battle which put Walker on the national stage and one that supporters have said he needs to focus on in the long run.

""Time after time Scott Walker fights, and wins,"" the narrator says in the one-minute ad.

Walker's super PAC and campaign are barred, by law, from coordinating with each other.

Walker struggled through August, following a flat debate performance, a slide in the polls and a series of gaffes and unclear stances on issues like ""birthright citizenship"" and talk of a Canadian border wall.

But Walker's team of supporters -- on the campaign side and PAC side -- have taken a long-view much like other candidates toiling in the shadow of front-runner Donald Trump: focus on the marathon through the primaries, not the sprint this summer.",0.99589370136399569
