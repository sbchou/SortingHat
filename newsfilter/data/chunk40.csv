"The 
Democratic Party
’s half-century of decline across the South was all but complete Wednesday after Kentucky elected a 
Republican
 governor who campaigned against abortion, gay marriage and, for a time, 
Obamacare
.
The victory of 
tea party
 favorite Matt Bevin affirmed the appeal of outsider candidates challenging the establishment in a year when real estate mogul 
Donald Trump
 and retired neurosurgeon 
Ben Carson
 are leading the party’s presidential race.
Bevin, an investment manager who has never held public office, branded Democratic rival Jack Conway as a “career politician.” He ran television commercials calling Conway, Kentucky’s attorney general, “pro-abortion,” “anti-coal” and a champion of President 
Obama
’s “liberal agenda” — reprising themes that swept many Republicans into office in last year’s midterm elections.
When Bevin is sworn in next month, Democrats will hold just two governorships in the South: Terry McAuliffe in Virginia and 
Earl Ray Tomblin
 in West Virginia. The sole legislative chamber that Democrats still control in the South is Kentucky’s House of Representatives.
“We’re sort of catching up to the rest of the South,” said Al Cross, a veteran Louisville political columnist and director of the University of Kentucky’s Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues.

The Democrats’ lock on the South began to erode after enactment of federal civil rights laws in the 1960s. The decline accelerated as the nation’s polarization over cultural issues intensified in the decades since then.
Kentucky’s shift away from Democrats has been slower than in some neighboring states, thanks partly to the 2005 indictment of its last Republican governor, 
Ernie Fletcher
, in a political patronage scandal, Cross said.
For Bevin, Obama’s unpopularity in culturally conservative states like Kentucky proved a major asset. His advertising leaned heavily on tying Conway to the president.
Obama is also a major factor in the Nov. 21 runoff for governor of Louisiana, where Republican U.S. Sen. 
David Vitter
 is trying to use the president’s low popularity there to damage Democratic opponent John Bel Edwards.
Since 2008, when Obama won the presidency, Democrats have lost 13 governorships and more than 900 state legislative seats across the U.S.
In Kentucky, Bevin campaigned as a Christian conservative businessman who would protect coal mining, a backbone industry in the Appalachians.
Jim Cauley, a Democratic strategist in Louisville, said that timeworn tactic was especially effective in rural areas where the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is seen as a coal-mine job killer.
“There’s this feeling that the liberal Democrats are coming to get them,” Cauley said. “They don’t have Christmas because Barack’s coming at them with the EPA.”
Bevin highlighted his “pro-life” and “pro-family” stances. He stressed his opposition to Planned Parenthood and his support for Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who spent several days in jail for refusing to obey federal court orders to issue marriage licenses after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage was legal. Bevin paid her a jailhouse visit.
He also campaigned against Obamacare, a sensitive issue in a state where the Affordable Care Act has extended coverage to more than 500,000 people, mostly through an expansion of 
Medicaid
 under Democratic Gov. 
Steve Beshear
.
Bevin wound up backpedaling on his initial pledge to stop the Medicaid expansion, saying he would continue to accept federal money to keep the newly insured covered but would require some of them to pay fees.
Bevin’s pivot came as Republican White House contenders, with a few exceptions, strike a less bellicose posture against the healthcare law than they did in 2012.
 “We went from ‘repeal, repeal, repeal’ to ‘repeal and replace,’” said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. “That, to me, is shorthand for Republicans figuring out you couldn’t just talk about repeal. Maybe someone explained to them exactly what would happen if they repealed it.”
Former Kentucky Republican Chairman John McCarthy said Democrats had counted on a boost at the polls from many who gained health coverage, but “they didn’t show up to vote.”

"LONDON — Accused of French-bashing, the Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush apologized this week for making fun of France’s work ethic, saying he was sorry for insulting America’s oldest ally.

“I made the mistake of saying that the Congress operates on a French workweek,” Mr. Bush was quoted as saying by Time magazine, with jovial flourish. “I really did a disservice to the French.”

During the Republican presidential debate last week, Mr. Bush, former governor of Florida, sought to pour scorn on his opponent Marco Rubio’s attendance record in the Senate by comparing it with the perceived idleness of the French. “I mean, literally, the Senate, what is it, like a French workweek? You get like three days where you have to show up?” Mr. Bush asked.

The assault, a seemingly well-rehearsed line that fell flat both at home and in France, stirred a backlash, with more than a few irate French people taking to social media to mock Mr. Bush’s lack of diplomacy. Moreover, some critics, including France’s ambassador to Washington, Gérard Araud, noted that Mr. Bush had muddled his facts.

“A French work week of 3 days? No but a pregnancy paid leave of 16 weeks yes! And proud of it,” Mr. Araud wrote on Twitter, with Gallic defiance.

Indeed, despite having a 35-hour week, in practice the French are far from lazy. Full-time French workers last year put in an average of 38.9 hours a week, compared with the eurozone average of 39.6 hours a week, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

At the same time, French labor productivity is sufficiently robust that The Economist recently noted that “The French could take Friday off and still produce more than Britons do in a week.”

Mr. Bush, who has been seeking to revive his flagging candidacy and this week unveiled a new campaign slogan, “Jeb can fix it,” sought to mollify France, the first ally of the United States, which, historians note, provided essential military help during the American Revolutionary War.

“I now know that the average French workweek is actually greater than the German workweek,” Mr. Bush was quoted as saying by Time magazine. “So, my God, I totally insulted an entire country — our first ally, that helped us become free as a nation. And I apologize.”

Mr. Araud, for his part, appeared willing to accept the apology, called a mea culpa by Le Monde, the French newspaper.

“Everything is forgotten and forgiven,” Mr. Araud wrote on Twitter, adding: “Errare humanum.”",DAN BILEFSKY,The Republican presidential candidate said he “made a mistake” by citing the French workweek in criticizing Marco Rubio’s Senate attendance record.,Jeb Bush Apologizes to France for Workweek Remark in Debate,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/world/europe/jeb-bush-france-apology.html,"[u'economy', u'jobs/employment']","[u'Marco Rubio', u'Jeb Bush']",nyt,0.6713882540488033,"[{u'author_id': 251, u'fullname': u'dan bilefsky', u'primary_org': u'nyt'}]",2015-11-04 20:54:12,"[u'Senate', u'The Economist', u'Congress', u'Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development']",5cb2289d3df8600346499265205e5e2f,2015-11-04 21:38:11.807994

Donald Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said on the radio this week that Trump is not taking donor money and self-funding his entire presidential campaign — claims that are demonstrably false. 
""The first thing is obviously is the inside-the-beltway guys have no control over Donald Trump and I mean that in a good way,"" Lewandowski said on Breitbart News Radio on SiriusXM on Tuesday. 
""Most of those people are bought and paid for by special interests, by lobbyists, by major donors,"" added Lewandowski. ""Mr. Trump is funding his campaign on his own, he's not taking donor money. He isn't beholden to those people and can't be accountable to those people who want special interests out of the government. He's gonna do what's right for the country.""
Trump is, in fact, accepting donations and has a donation page on his campaign website. Trump is also not, as he himself continues to say in speech and debates, entirely self-funding his campaign. Though Trump donated a large amount of his own money to his campaign early on, the majority of money Trump has raised and spent recently has come from donations.
From the New York Time's blog post on Trump's FEC filing in mid-October:
Mr. Trump revealed in a filing Thursday to the Federal Election Commission that the vast majority of the money he raised and spent this summer as he rose to the top of national polls came not from his own coffers, as it had in the spring, but from about $3.7 million in what he called ""unsolicited contributions."" Some 74,000 donors pitched in an average of about $50 to help his campaign, he reported. Mr. Trump himself contributed only about $100,000 in in-kind contributions, including rent space that he donated and payroll expenses that he covered. That represented a huge drop from the spring, when Mr. Trump donated about $1.9 million to his campaign, financing the bulk of it himself.

Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson told graduates during a commencement address in the late nineties that he believed the pyramids in Egypt were built by the biblical figure Joseph to store grain, and not, as most archeologists contend, as tombs for pharaohs. 
At the 1998 commencement for Andrews University, a school associated with Seventh-day Adventist Church, Carson also dismissed the notion that aliens were somehow involved in the construction of the pyramids. 
""My own personal theory is that Joseph built the pyramids to store grain,"" Carson said. ""Now all the archeologists think that they were made for the pharaohs' graves. But, you know, it would have to be something awfully big if you stop and think about it. And I don't think it'd just disappear over the course of time to store that much grain."" 
In the Old Testament, Joseph, one of the 12 sons of Jacob, is sold into slavery in Egypt by his jealous brothers. He eventually rose to become a top aide to the Egyptian Pharaoh, advising him of a dream vision he had of coming years of famine in the ancient kingdom. Joseph's sage advise of the coming famine (and directions to store gain) helped the Egyptians survive the famine.
Carson said the design of the pyramids made clear it was for grain storage. 
""And when you look at the way that the pyramids are made, with many chambers that are hermetically sealed, they'd have to be that way for various reasons. And various of scientists have said, 'well, you know there were alien beings that came down and they have special knowledge and that's how-' you know, it doesn't require an alien being when God is with you.""

"Donald J. Trump has appeared unconcerned with the possibility of angering Latinos since declaring during the announcement of his presidential campaign in June that Mexico was sending rapists to the United States.

On Wednesday evening, in an event organized by the League of United Latin American Citizens, about two dozen protesters gathered behind metal barricades opposite NBC headquarters at Rockefeller Center in New York to demand that the network rescind an invitation that Mr. Trump had accepted to host “Saturday Night Live” this week.  

There were claps and chants of “Dump Trump” and “Fight back.” There were placards reading “SNL stop the hate.” There were people dressed in costume, including a man appearing as a cartoon-style plutocrat, replete with a black top hat and a papier-mâché mask featuring eyeballs emblazoned with dollar signs.

Among the protesters was Juan Sanchez, 45, a translator from Midtown Manhattan, who said that he believed that Mr. Trump, racial views aside, might be driven by ego.



“It’s all ‘I do, I do, me, me, me, myself, myself,’ ” Mr. Sanchez said, shaking his head. “I don’t think America deserves that kind of leadership.”

Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, declined to comment on Wednesday evening about the protest.

Xiomara Santos, 20, said she had come to New York to join the demonstration from Washington, where she is an intern with the League of United Latin American Citizens. Mr. Trump seemed most interested in spreading negativity, she said, and it would therefore be a bad idea for NBC to provide him with yet another platform.

Asked who she supported for president, Ms. Santos said quickly that she was a fan of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, adding, “He seems more truthful than all the other candidates.

Does that mean that Mr. Trump was being less than truthful when he made his inflammatory statements?

If Mr. Trump believed what he said, “he is a racist,” Ms. Santos said. “If it’s a publicity stunt, he’s just destructive.”

Nearby, Nicola DeMarco 57, from Riverdale, in the Bronx, held aloft an illustration he had drawn of Mr. Trump with his lips pursed as if whistling and featuring his trademark haircut.

“I don’t want to see people rounded up and deported,” Mr. DeMarco said, referring to a proposal of Mr. Trump. “What he’s proposing is right out of the Nazi playbook; these are Mussolini tactics, to rile up people.”

Around 6:30 p.m. several protesters walked slowly across West 49th Street holding a cardboard box that they said contained a flash drive bearing 522,080 signatures to a petition demanding that NBC revoke Mr. Trump’s invitation. The chants stopped briefly as Juan Escalante, a member of an immigration reform group called America’s Voice, was permitted to enter the Rockefeller Center lobby to deliver the cardboard box to “someone named Adam.” Then, as he emerged from the lobby, the chants resumed.",COLIN MOYNIHAN,"In an event organized by the League of United Latin American Citizens, about two dozen protesters demanded that NBC rescind an invitation that Mr. Trump had accepted to host the show this week.",First Draft: Donald Trump’s Scheduled Appearance on ‘Saturday Night Live’ Draws Protest,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/04/donald-trumps-scheduled-appearance-on-saturday-night-live-draws-protest/,[u'immigration'],"[u'Donald Trump', u'Bernie Sanders', u'Hope Hicks', u'Donald J.

"Washington (CNN)Florida Sen. Marco Rubio continues to dominate the Republican pack on CNN's Political Prediction Market, placing his odds Wednesday of winning the GOP presidential nomination at 41%.
Before the Republican CNBC debate on October 28, Rubio's odds were at 33%. His odds went up to 37% during the debate and then rose to 39% the next morning.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who was once considered a favorite for the nomination, is now at 9% following his poor performance at the last debate. Before the event, his odds were at 15% and went down to 11% by the end of the debate.
Rubio's odds for the nomination have been rising in the Prediction Market since the last debate after giving a positive performance and handling attacks from Bush, his former mentor. On Wednesday, Rubio received questions about his finances and pushed back after being asked about a charge card that he may have reportedly misused. It's unclear if this has affected his odds in the Prediction Market yet.
Carson's odds are also on the rise in the market -- they've nearly doubled in a week. He was previously at a 9% chance for the nomination on October 29. and is now at a 17% chance for the nomination. Real estate mogul Donald Trump is at third, with his odds for the nomination at 12%.
CNN's Political Prediction Market is a live online prediction game administered by a company called Pivit that factors polls and other factors, including input from online players.
It's not to be confused with polls from actual voters. The latest Quinnipiac University survey shows that Trump and Carson are neck-and-neck in the Republican primary, at 24% and 23% respectively. Rubio comes in third in the poll, with 14% support in the national survey.

"Hugh Hewitt is a lawyer, law professor, author and host of a nationally syndicated radio show. He served in the Reagan administration in posts including assistant counsel in the White House and special assistant to two attorneys general. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.
 (CNN)In his first radio interview since becoming speaker of the House (the complete audio and transcript is here), Paul Ryan told me on Monday:
""Look, I see the whole shooting match coming up in 2016. Again, one of the reasons why I chose to do this, and one of the reasons, one of the conditions, more or less, I talked to my colleagues about, which is we've got to go on offense, big and bold, specific agenda and vision in 2016, and let the country choose, because the kind of an election we have to have is a mandate election.""
The Wisconsin Republican had come to talk with me at the radio studio at Hillsdale College's Kirby Center, near Capitol Hill. In doing so he increased by one the number of times his predecessor, former Rep. John Boehner, had been interviewed by me or any other nationally broadcast conservative talk show host while he was speaker of the House. An interesting change in tactics, that one. 
Boehner dutifully made the rounds of conservative media while rising to the speakership, then promptly abandoned the effort to talk to the Republican Party's core supporters and those independents and open-minded Democrats who listen to shows like mine.  
Interviews and selling the party's agenda to an audience beyond his GOP caucus just wasn't how Boehner saw his job. Speaker Ryan promises a much-needed, night-and-day change there, one that foreshadows crucial change in the way Congress operates.
Ryan arrived early on Monday and joined Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, in a discussion of the Democratic debate and it promises regarding student loans, then stayed on after Cotton left talk about national defense, the ""regular order"" approach he is embracing for the House and, crucially, how congressional Republicans must assist the GOP field in framing the upcoming election.
Ryan used the interview to begin doing that specifically with the conservative base that listens to my show or reads the transcripts of interviews I post from it, just as he had done so for different audiences on the weekend shows the previous day.
Ryan, like his mentor, the late congressman and GOP vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp, is a gifted communicator and an ideas guy. He loves to talk policy, even with folks who disagree with him. Unlike most older Republican stalwarts on the Hill, even the ones deeply admired by conservatives, Ryan is also very, very good at it.
Ryan comes armed for the communications battles. He has been studying up for years, beginning with his undergraduate days at Miami University. His 2012 campaign as Mitt Romney's running mate infused him with name recognition no other member of the House can rival, and the speakership gives him a platform he can use every day to sell the conservative vision.  
That he began to do so on the radio with me probably had more to do with paying a compliment to Hillsdale College, which is a lighthouse institution for conservatives, and its president Larry Arnn, who is one of the very few thought leaders respected across he conservative spectrum, than it did with me.
But the key facts are that Ryan knows the importance of Hillsdale, of Arnn, of conservative talk radio generally and of center-right media and conservative institutions all across the land. The new speaker knows he must sell ideas and help build conservative ideas infrastructure, just as Kemp did, and he is about the business of doing so. All conservatives should be thrilled about Ryan's rise -- and about other recent developments.
Yesterday, Republican Matt Bevin won a shocking upset for the governorship in Kentucky. The GOP debates are drawing huge audiences no matter how well or poorly they are managed. There is good news for conservatives everywhere.
The GOP candidates are all experienced, effective communicators, and they don't have to conceal what they were doing or where they were during the Obama years. None of them has dismissed the VA scandal as ""not as widespread"" as the public has been led to believe. None of them has a scandal that is under FBI investigation. None of them lied about a video having anything to do with a terrorist attack.
Like Speaker Ryan and his friend RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, I don't have a favorite in the GOP race but, like both of them, I have an intense interest in seeing the GOP nominate its strongest candidate and in winning the presidency a year from now.
To do that, the GOP needed new voices, like Ryan's and Cotton's and Bevin's, to emerge with a message drawn from all the presidential candidates -- ""We can fix this, we can make America great again, we can speak for and on behalf of all Americans, including all working Americans or Americans who want to find work, and we can rebuild our military and return the country to global leadership and renew the world's respect for us"" -- without favoring any one candidate. Ryan especially can lead the House in crafting legislation that would await a new Republican's president's input and signature.
The GOP doesn't need a party platform when it has a platform in which to display its legislative agenda and a Speaker who can describe it with good humor, eloquence and a command of the details.
It has been a great week for the GOP, and though the mainstream media seems to have missed yet another major development in the race for the White House -- even as it mostly missed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's pratfall on the VA or her many ""admissions against interest"" in her 11 hours of testimony two weeks ago -- the reinforcements have arrived, in the Speaker's Office, in Kentucky and across the country.  
Democrats feel a chill wind blowing. A year from now they will remember it beginning with Ryan's rise and Bevin's win.

"RYE, N.H. — Jeb Bush needs a boost. He’s getting a bus.

As his presidential campaign limps through the fall, Mr. Bush invited a small group of reporters on Tuesday aboard his new ride, with “Jeb Can Fix It” etched across the side. A recap of how it played out:

6:34 p.m. Mr. Bush comes to the back, where two long black leather couches stretch beneath the windows.

“Nice boots,” he says to a television reporter, striding over in his own. They are inscribed with his name.

6:38 Mr. Bush is asked why he’s on a bus.

“You get to hang out with people,” he says. “We’ll have people off and on the bus, not just press but people from New Hampshire. Put the full court press on ‘em. Before they leave, they’ve got to say, ‘Yes, I’m for you.’ ”

Dutiful laughter fills the bus.

“Shh. It’s a secret plan,” he says. “We’ll talk about that later.”

6:43 A local television reporter, who has been covering Mr. Bush, introduces herself.

“You don’t think we notice you?” he asks. “You’re hurting my feelings that I wouldn’t recognize you.”

He crosses his legs, boot heel angled skyward.

6:48 Mr. Bush recalls last week’s debate.

“The debate, the so-called debate, is more of a performance,” he says. “It gives you an opportunity to say whatever you want. I’ve got to train myself to say what’s on my mind rather than what the question is.”

How can he master that art? “After 62 years?” he asks. He laughs at himself.

“I don’t think any question that we prepared for was a question we were asked,” he continues, knocking the CNBC moderators, “because they didn’t do anything they said they were going to do.”

6:50 Mr. Bush is asked about his nerves.

“I felt really good about the debate I screwed up on,” he says.

He clarifies that this was before the debate started: “No, I felt bad after.”

What happened? “I got shouted down when I tried to interrupt in the beginning. Then I couldn’t finish the sentence in the Marco deal,” he said, about an exchange regarding Marco Rubio’s Senate voting record.

Mr. Bush is asked if he has to stop directly answering the debate questions to succeed.

“Yeah. I’ve got to stop doing that. It’s kind of weird, but that’s why it’s not really a debate.”

6:52 Mr. Bush decides he should keep answering questions after all, to a point.

“I’ve just got to be clear about what I want to say,” he says. “I think I know what I want to say.”

6:54 Mr. Bush discusses his media consumption habits.

“I don’t read every word of what you guys record or write,” he says. “There’s a lot of stuff. Everybody’s prolific in their reporting and stuff. And it doesn’t help me get better, per se.”

6:58 Mr. Bush discusses his actual consumption habits.

“Maybe after,” he says, waving off an aide offering M&Ms. “I’ve got another gig here.”

“A little energy?” the aide, Tim Miller, says. “A little sustenance?”

Mr. Bush becomes a bit annoyed at the echo of a Trumpian insult: “You think I need a little more energy?”

He scoops up some turkey jerky.

7:01 Mr. Bush is asked about how to reconcile his campaign message with voter frustrations. 

“You’ve got to connect with that frustration,” he says, adding, “Can you rely on someone that has no proven record of getting things done?”

7:03 Mr. Bush recalls his attack on Mr. Rubio during the debate, when he likened life in Congress to a “French workweek.”

“I really did a disservice to the French,” he says. “I now know that the average French workweek is actually greater than the German workweek. And so, my God, I totally insulted an entire country, our first ally, that helped us become free as a nation. And I apologize.”

7:05 Mr. Bush mulls the groundswell of support for Donald J. Trump and Ben Carson.

“I’m not smart enough to know, to explain the Trump or Carson phenomena yet,” he says. “Carson is such a nice person. I mean, he’s really a nice guy.”

Mr. Bush is asked if someone without any government experience can succeed as president. “We might find out,” he says.

7:07 Mr. Bush, after mentioning Richard M. Nixon’s famous visit to China, wonders if his references are connecting.

“I used the Nixon-to-China analogy once in front of a group of young people who looked at me like, ‘Who’s Nixon?’” he says.

He turns to this reporter: “Do you know what the Nixon-to-China moment is?”

I do.

7:08 Mr. Bush muses on his new physique, aided by a paleo diet. 

“Does it take getting used to?” he asks, repeating a reporter’s question. “No.”

He chides those who failed to join him at Gold’s Gym in Charleston, S.C. “At 5:30, I was there,” he says.

7:09 Mr. Bush is not done musing.

“I am in good shape,” he says for emphasis.

7:10 Mr. Bush, asked a pro forma question about how he stays positive every day, waxes surprisingly philosophical.

“I’ve learned to accept the fact that I am imperfect under God’s watchful eye,” he says. “I can get better. I don’t have a self-esteem problem and I don’t have an overstated worth problem. There’s a balance that I’ve acquired in life through my journey in life that gives me serenity.”

7:13 Mr. Bush notes his staff members’ ability to overcome obstacles during his time as Florida governor. 

“We all learned how to identify — I can’t use the terms that we used — the poo bombs that were around the corner,” he says.

He extends the analogy: “They learned how to anticipate these things happening, look up, take two steps to the side, let it splat on the sidewalk and keep going.”

7:14 Mr. Bush praises his campaign’s dedication to details.

“We’ve laid out more details, scored by all the nerdy bean counters,” he says of his policy proposals.

7:15 Mr. Bush excuses himself. 

“I’ve got to get into my mind-set here,” he says, as the bus arrives in Raymond, N.H., for a town hall.

7:16 Mr. Bush teases his campaign workers for their dedication to details. 

“You’ve got 47 minutes for Q. and A.?” he asks an aide with his schedule, in earshot of the reporters. “What about 45 and a half?”

He steps off the bus.",MATT FLEGENHEIMER,"As Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign limps through the fall, he invited a small group of reporters on Tuesday aboard his new ride, with “Jeb Can Fix It” etched across the side.

"WASHINGTON Nov 4 Democratic presidential
contender Bernie Sanders on Wednesday will unveil a
climate-change bill that would crack down on fossil fuel
extraction, a move sure to please activists who want party
front-runner Hillary Clinton to make the same commitment.
Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, wants to halt new
leases for fossil fuel extraction on public lands and for
offshore drilling in the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico. He would
prohibit drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic Ocean.
Sanders and his co-sponsor, U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley of
Oregon, will push for the legislation at a rally at the U.S.
Capitol on Wednesday, alongside environmental leaders such as
Bill McKibben, co-founder of the grassroots climate group
350.org.
The bill will face fierce opposition in the
Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and is unlikely to become
law. But it should help Sanders appeal to environmental
activists and could pressure Clinton, who has said that abruptly
halting extraction on federal lands would disrupt the U.S.
economy.
Sanders, who calls himself a democratic socialist, has been
Clinton's main rival to be the party's nominee for president in
the November 2016 elections.
His liberal stances on the environment, trade and more have
pressured Clinton to move to the left on those issues. Still,
polls have shown the former U.S. secretary of state appeared to
gain ground against Sanders after a strong showing in October.
Climate activists want Clinton to commit to be tougher on
environmental issues if she is elected president.
Clinton told an activist at a New Hampshire town hall in
July that it would be irresponsible to abruptly halt oil,
natural gas and coal extraction on federal lands. She instead
called for phasing it out and increasing fees on companies
operating on public lands.
""We still have to run our economy, we still have to turn on
the lights,"" Clinton said.
Clinton in August opposed Arctic oil exploration, putting
her at odds with the Obama administration, which had just given
Royal Dutch Shell PLC final approval to resume drilling
off the coast of northern Alaska.

"Under fire from various corners about his use of a Florida Republican Party credit card years ago, Senator Marco Rubio said Wednesday that he will “soon” release additional records that will detail those expenditures, brushing aside continued criticism about his personal finances. 

Mr. Rubio spoke in an appearance on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” after The Tampa Bay Times reported that he mingled personal expenses with his official uses of the card. 

Mr. Rubio’s top adviser, Todd Harris, told the Florida newspaper that the campaign will release detailed expenditure lists in the coming weeks. He was not more specific than that. 

Mr. Rubio took issue with the paper’s overall account, including insisting that it wasn’t actually a credit card. 

“It wasn’t a credit card, it was an American Express charge card secured under my personal credit in conjunction with the party,” Mr. Rubio said. 

Mr. Rubio added that he personally paid for anything that needed to be covered by him. 

“Every expense on that card is detailed in the Republican Party accounts that they file every month,” Mr. Rubio said. “It doesn’t say who they belong to, but every expense is on there, and as we’ve said, we’ll release those soon.”

A day earlier, Donald J. Trump seized on the issue, saying, “For years, I’ve been hearing that his credit cards are a disaster.”

The topic of Mr. Rubio’s credit cards was also raised in his 2010 campaign for the Senate, when he ran as a Tea Party favorite. It did not derail his candidacy, as he ultimately won. 

But Mr. Rubio’s critics believe that, in the context of a national election and with the senator still trying to define himself to the national electorate, the matter could be a potential liability. 

The matter came up on the campaign trail in New Hampshire on Wednesday, where former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Mr. Rubio were campaigning.

“That’s not my job to worry about that, that’s your job,” Mr. Bush told reporters on his campaign bus. 

But Mr. Bush quickly highlighted what he described as his own transparency and suggested that questions about Mr. Rubio’s personal finances were fair game.

“A candidate running for president that has a chance to be president will be thoroughly vetted,” Mr. Bush said, calling himself “the most vetted” candidate to date.

“Thirty-four years of tax returns, all the emails, my past has been discussed all sorts of way, sometimes comfortable, sometimes not so,” he said.  “And Marco and every other candidate that is a viable candidate will go through that same process.”",MAGGIE HABERMAN,"Under fire from various corners about his use of a Florida Republican Party credit card years ago, Senator Marco Rubio said Wednesday that he will “soon” release additional records that will detail those expenditures, as he brushed aside criticisms of his personal finances.",First Draft: Marco Rubio Confronts New Scrutiny Over Use of Party Credit Card,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/04/marco-rubio-confronts-new-scrutiny-over-use-of-party-credit-card/,"[u'personality', u'campaign_finance']","[u'Jeb Bush', u'Marco Rubio', u'Donald J.

" (CNN)Bernie Sanders' top strategists and advisers told CNN last month that their candidate had finally agreed to give a major speech explaining his democratic socialist views and that he would do so before the second Democratic debate on November 14.
That plan has now changed.
Tad Devine, Sanders' top strategist, told CNN on Wednesday that the speech will now come after the debate in Des Moines, citing the senator's busy schedule.
But while Sanders has started writing the speech, aides have said it has been difficult to get him to agree to give it.
Devine maintained Wednesday that the senator is ""not the least bit apprehensive"" to give the speech. 
""He's looking forward to it, but these speeches take some time,"" he added.
In the lead-up to his campaign, Sanders was routinely asked about his ""socialist"" views. He would usually rebut the questions with a quick disclaimer: He is a ""democratic socialist,"" not a socialist.
And lately he has suggested there are aspects of socialism already present in American society. 
""When you go to your public library, when you call your fire department or the police department, what do you think you're calling?"" Sanders said last month in Iowa. ""These are socialist institutions.""
At the first Democratic debate, CNN asked Sanders if he considered himself a ""capitalist.""
""Do I consider myself part of the casino capitalist process, by which so few have so much and so many have so little by which Wall Street's greed and recklessness wrecked this economy? No, I don't,"" he said forcefully. ""I believe in a society where all people do well. Not just a handful of billionaires.""
There is a difference between socialism and democratic socialism. While socialists believe in government takeover of certain large sectors of the economy, democratic socialists see government intervention -- along with private businesses -- in certain portions of the economy, like college and health care.
To date, though, Sanders has not said that outright in a major forum.
""He will reassure people he is running to be the president of the United States, on the platform of the Democratic Party, and that he will work within that system, as he has for a long time, but also will bring his own philosophy,"" Devine said last month. ""He would not be the nominee of a Democratic Socialist Party, he wants to be the nominee of the Democratic Party."" 
Sanders' Democratic rivals have subtly knocked the senator on this issue, too.
""I am a proud Democrat,"" Clinton said in Iowa in September. ""I am a true Democrat.""

"Donald Trump is taking a break from his presidential campaign this week to host “Saturday Night Live” this weekend. NBC has released a batch of promo videos for Trump’s upcoming appearance, where he appears alongside Cecily Strong. The two poke fun at his braggadocio manner, his love of the word “huge” and the equal time for candidates mandate. Trump also manages to get in a dig at Ben Carson.
This marks Trump’s second time hosting the late-night sketch show. His first time came on April 3, 2004 when his reality show “The Apprentice” was a ratings smash.
“Saturday Night Live” airs on NBC at 11:35 on Saturday night. Will you watch Trump’s appearance?

Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who is running for the Republican presidential nomination, says introducing the subject of ""gender confusion"" to children will only make those who do not have ""gender confusion"" more confused. 
Santorum, speaking on NewsMaxTV's Steve Malzberg Show last Thursday about federal officials who told a Illinois school district it broke the law by a banning a transgender student from the girls locker room, said ""I don't why children at that age are even, ya know, why this is even an issue.
""The idea that we are introducing this type of real dangerous confusion for young people at this early age. Do we really care about what we're doing to millions of children who don't have gender confusion and introducing the subject and saying, 'well maybe you should. Maybe this is something you should start thinking about.'
""At age seven, I mean this is really dangerous and it's going to far because it's gonna have — it is having — an impact on not just folks who may be in a difficult situation at an early age but many who would never have been in that situation that now are being confronted with it,"" continued Santorum.
Earlier this year, the former senator said of Caitlyn Jenner's public transition that if Jenner ""says he's a woman, then he's a woman."" He then clarified by saying two weeks later, ""I know what obviously and biologically he is. That doesn't change by himself identifying himself.""

" (AP) â GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio said Wednesday he'll release in the next few weeks all of the statements detailing his use of an American Express card he shared with the Republican Party of Florida.
Rubio, a former speaker of the Florida House, had the party-issued card from February 2005 to November 2008. During his successful 2010 bid for U.S. Senate, news broke that Rubio had charged personal items such as grocery bills, plane tickets for his wife and repairs to the family minivan to the card. Rubio says he reimbursed the party for any personal expenses. The statements from late 2006 to late 2008 are now public, but those from 2005 and most of 2006 are not.
Rubio's personal finances are gaining new scrutiny as he tries to break out of the crowded GOP nomination fight.
The American Express card is part of a litany of financial problems â from a bank moving to foreclose on a house he part-owned in Tallahassee to questionable accounting of political funds â that have dogged Rubio during his career.
GOP rival Donald Trump criticized Rubio on his personal finances on Tuesday, saying ""he is a disaster with his credit cards.""
Rubio dismissed the charges as old news and said he did nothing wrong.
""Every month I would get a bill at my home and I would review it. If there was something on it that was personal, I would pay it, and if it wasn't, the party paid it,"" Rubio told reporters in New Hampshire on Wednesday.
""What I would do differently is that I just wouldn't have done any personal things on it because I would have avoided all the confusion that it's created in the minds of some,"" he said.
During his 2010 campaign, Rubio's aides said the charges were legitimate, contending that the minivan had been damaged while being used on GOP business. They also said Rubio paid American Express more than $16,000 to cover nonparty expenses when they happened. He also sent a check to the party as reimbursement for personal airline flights he said were mistakenly charged to the GOP card. Rubio blamed an accounting error.
Rubio was among several state GOP lawmakers given access to American Express cards through the Republican Party of Florida, which offered a way for lawmakers to get around the state's strict ban on accepting gifts that was put into law in 2006. The ban prevents lawmakers from taking gifts from lobbyists, but the state party doesn't face the same restrictions. The Florida Republican Party was responsible for paying off the cards on a monthly basis.

" (AP) â Donald Trump's campaign for president will begin airing radio ads on Thursday in the three earliest-voting states, marking the first time the billionaire businessman has spent money on paid advertising since he launched his bid.
Trump's team announced Wednesday that its first two radio ads will run through the end of November in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. It says the ad buy is valued at $300,000.
The spending comes as Trump continues to adjust to the new realities of an evolving campaign in which he is no longer the undisputed front-runner of the Republican field. While he remains on top in many opinion surveys, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has surged past him in others. And candidates like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz of Texas are drawing new attention from voters and donors as the opening contests near.
On Wednesday, Trump told reporters in New Hampshire, where he officially filed to appear on the state's primary ballot, that the ads would be ""very, very positive, about good things and great things about the country.""
But he added a warning to rivals who may be considering negative ads against him. ""If they hit me, they will get smacked like they never got smacked before,"" he said.
Trump has so far spent little of his own fortune on his campaign, relying mainly on donor contributions to fund his operation and on the news media to promote his message.
Trump often brags that he'd originally expected to spend $20 million or $25 million for ads by this point in the campaign, but hasn't needed to because he's doing so well. He's continuing to holding back on television ads, which are significantly more expensive than radio.
Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski declined to discuss which firm had produced the radio ads, saying the information would be contained in the campaign's next financial disclosure report.

" (CNN)Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is set to host NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" on November 7. 
This will be the businessman's second time hosting the network's iconic sketch show -- he first hosted in 2004, while serving as the host of the NBC reality show ""The Apprentice.""  
The Donald's relationship with SNL is unique and long-running. He and his wife Melania walked the red carpet at SNL's 40th anniversary show in February. 
He's also been a consistent character — played by some of the show's most famous cast members — for more than two decades, even before his career in television and shift to politics. During the late 1980s, Phil Hartman was the first cast member to regularly play Trump. Darrell Hammond played Trump for more than a decade, and Taran Killam took the reins this season. 
Trump's adult children and all three of his wives have been characters on the show as well.
Franken predicts 'entertaining' Trump on 'SNL'
During his last hosting gig, Trump embraced SNL's portrayal by endorsing Hammond's performance during his opening monologue. He went on to play himself in a few sketches, living up to the out of touch, ratings-crazed, power-hungry, borderline-delusional character that the show's audience had come to expect. 
While most major presidential candidates and political figures are lampooned by the show's cast, it's  rarer for politicians to play themselves. President George H.W. Bush appeared on the show after leaving office, then-Senator Barack Obama made a cameo during the 2008 campaign cycle, and current Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton played a bartender on the show last month.

"The conservative Club for Growth has released a “White Paper” on Donald Trump and it’s unsurprisingly not complimentary.
The group -- which has publicly tussled with the real estate magnate -- says its conclusion is that the contender for the Republican presidential nomination “would not be a pro-growth president.”
Club for Growth President David McIntosh said Trump held “anti-growth” positions on taxes, trade, entitlements and government regulations before 2015 “and still defends a massive government role in health care, a mostly hands-off approach to entitlement reform, and protectionist policies that would likely spark trade wars and lead to higher business and consumer costs.”
Club for Growth’s political action committee announced in August it would steer donations to Sens. Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, along with former Gov. Jeb Bush and Gov. Scott Walker, who has since dropped out of the race.
Trump on the campaign trail has accused the group of writing a bad mouthing him because he wouldn’t contribute $1 million. A spokesman at the time said it was Trump who had indicated an interest in donating to the group. 
""But that doesn’t change the fact that the Club for Growth PAC thinks he’s an unserious candidate and would make a terrible president, just as we publicly pointed out during his last political publicity stunt in 2011,"" spokesman Doug Sachtleben said at the time.
In its review of Trump’s policies, the Club says, among other things, that Trump’s “hostility towards free trade is unmatched by any other major presidential candidate, with the possible exception of Bernie Sanders” who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.
It notes that Trump has frequently given to Democrats and “anti-growth Republicans who later left the party,” including former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist.
“While Trump has clearly touched a nerve with Americans who are frustrated with Washington, his approach to politics is not unlike the worst of Washington politicians,” the group says. “Instead of taking consistent and principled stands, he has jumped on popular bandwagons.”",,"Torches Trump for backing Democratic candidates
Says he has consistently supported a government-run, single-payer health care system
Charges that he has used the legal system as a tool for ‘publicity or political gain over legal remedy’

HIGHLIGHTS
WSJ/NBC POLL FINDS ANGER AT POLITICAL SYSTEM: Amy West, a 61-year-old retired schoolteacher, traces her frustration with the rest of the country to a local fight banning prayer at area schools more than a decade ago. âI have to have the Bible in my life,â she said. A Republican from Vilonia, Ark., she plans to support Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in next yearâs GOP presidential primary. She thinks he is best equipped to tackle her concerns, starting with the dwindling influence of religion in Americansâ daily lives.
Republican primary voters are overwhelmingly unsettled by societal changes transforming the country, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds, while Democratic primary voters describe themselves as proud that the country has moved further to protect the rights of minority groups and to accept gay marriage. The results show that, in many ways, Republican and Democratic presidential candidates are being forced to tailor their messages for deeply disparate groups. If there is a unifying theme, it is anger at the political system, the Journal/NBC News poll suggests. Patrick OâConnor and Janet Hook report.
More on 2016:Â Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson overtook businessman Donald Trump as the top pick of GOP presidential primary voters, the poll found, and he posted the strongest numbers in test match-ups against Hillary Clinton …Â Drug deaths are becoming a 2016 presidential election issue. Across New Hampshire, overdoses are on track to break last yearâs record of 326 deaths. The pattern is so alarming that participants in an October WMUR Granite State poll ranked drug abuse as the most important issue in the 2016 presidential campaign …Â In a new TV ad and on the stump,Â Hillary ClintonÂ vowed Tuesday to push for new gun restrictions.
ELECTION-DAY TAKEAWAYS:Â Republican Matt Bevin won a bitterly fought race for Kentucky governor, handing the GOP a coveted seat that extends its hold on the South and imperiling the state’s closely watched implementation of the federal health lawÂ â¦ In a victory for social conservatives,Â voters in HoustonÂ on Tuesday overwhelmingly rejectedÂ a ballot measure to extend nondiscrimination protections to gay and transgender peopleÂ â¦Â Former Bridgeport, Conn., Mayor Joseph Ganim,Â who spent seven years in prison, was returned to office, completing a stunning political comeback in the stateâs most populous cityÂ â¦Â Ohio voters rejected a ballot measure Tuesday legalizing marijuanaÂ for recreational and medical uses …Â San Francisco voters soundly rejectedÂ a ballot measure that would have limited short-term housing rentals to 75 nights a year, a victory for Airbnb Inc.
JANET HOOK: FEUD WITH CRUZ FOLLOWS BOEHNER OUT THE DOOR
John Boehner may have retired from Capitol Hill, but he is living on a bit longer in the airwaves of the 2016 presidential campaign. The former House speaker, who stepped down last week under pressure from conservative critics, is the villain of a new radio ad by a super PAC supporting Ted Cruz for president. Read Janet Hook’s full post in Washington Wire.
WSJ STORIES YOU SHOULDN’T MISS
SEN. CORKER PROFITS ON QUICK STOCK TRADES:Â In the course of his Senate career, Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee has made many short-term trades in shares of a little-known Chattanooga real-estate company. Until recently, he hadn’t made public a dozen stock purchases in the firm, including several that resulted in his most profitable investments. In one previously unknown purchase, Mr. Corker purchased between $1 million and $5 million in shares of the firm, CBL & Associates Properties Inc., in late 2011 and sold them five months later for a 42% gain. A pair of purchases in 2009 in accounts in the name of his daughters likely netted more than $1 million, though in that case the exact gain is impossible to calculate. The trades are among the CBL stock purchases that Mr. Corker disclosed only recently after questions from The Wall Street Journal about apparent discrepancies in his Senate financial-disclosure reports. Congressional ethics rules require lawmakers to make public their financial investments in broad ranges each year. Brody Mullins and Tom McGinty report.
WITH RYAN AT HELM, HOUSE BEGINS SCUFFLING OVER HIGHWAY BILL: The House has begun skirmishing over a multiyear highway bill that includes an extension of the Export-Import Bank and other nontransportation items, providing an early test of House Speaker Paul Ryanâs ability to manage the chamberâs disparate factions. The legislation, which sets out policies for building roads and maintaining bridges for six years, already is facing skepticism from Senate Democratic leaders, who say the $325 billion raised by the bill is too little. Some Republicans complain that the measure, a version of which has already passed the Senate, includes only three years of funding for the programs. Mr. Ryan, following through on promises to conservatives, has allowed a number of amendments, in a debate that was expected to run into Tuesday and Wednesday evenings, with a final vote set for Thursday. Siobhan Hughes and Kristina Peterson report.
Plus: The Senate fell short of advancing legislation to repeal environmental regulations that bring more waterways and wetlands under federal protection, a victory for the Obama administration on rules that have faced a series of legal and political setbacks over the past few months.

WHAT WE’RE READING AROUND THE WEB
The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg writes that “a White House exhausted and frustrated” by its relationship with Israel is asking Defense Secretary Ash Carter to take on increasing responsibility for managing Israeli ties.
The Republican Party keeps the field of contenders allowed at a debate platform so large because “the idea seems to be for everyone to keep hanging on until,Â miraculously, the Trump-Carson dynamic fundamentally changes,” writes The New Yorker’s Amy Davidson.
Michael Gerson and Peter Wehner, in a lengthy essay forÂ Christianity Today, Â explore how evangelical Christians can deal with their unease at social and political change: “Cultural retreat would betray our faith, because it would betray the call and responsibility to seek the common good. Evangelical Christians clearly require a new model of social engagement, not pious cover for disengagement.”
The Washington Post’s Dana Milbank writes that there is no such thing anymore as a moderate Democrat. “The handful of centrists in office have ceased to play a meaningful role in the party, much as moderates long ago ceased to influence the Republican Party.”
In the WSJ’s Think Tank, Peter D. HartÂ  writes thatÂ “itÂ is time at least to entertain the thought that 2016 GOP primary voters are not going to fall into the well-established patterns.”
