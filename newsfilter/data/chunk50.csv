Is Chipotle evil? This ad campaign says absolutely,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/09/03/is-chipotle-evil-this-ad-campaign-says-absolutely/,washpo,"This morning, a new, controversial ad campaign hit the press. New Yorkers, en route to work, were likely the first to see it, because it's inaugural imprint was in The New York Post, in the form of a full page advert. And it isn't at all kind to Chipotle. The ad, which features a flexing, overweight male, looking directly into the camera, smiling, almost snidely, clearly mocks the notion that eating at Chipotle is a healthy life choice. ""Eat two 'all natural' Chipotle burritos a week and you could gain 40 pounds in a year,"" the ad says, oozing with sarcasm. At the very top, large block letters read ''Chipotle' Healthy,' in large block letters. This is what it looks like. The link teased in over-sized capital letters, chubbychipotle.com, leads to a single page website. Within it, Chipotle's slogan—'food with integrity'—is altered so it says 'food with hypocrisy' instead; its commitments to sustainability, antibiotic-free meat, and GMO-free food are also disparaged. Sofrito, the website quips at one point, is a word the chain ""made up for tofu."" In all, there are four sections, and each one of them is equally harsh in its treatment, taking issue with distinct facets of Chipotle's messaging. The campaign is being funded by The Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF), which is only apparent once one scrolls to the very bottom of the website. CCF is a non-profit organization, which lobbies on behalf of the food companies. The group's mission is perhaps most clearly evident in those it deems its adversaries. ""A growing cabal of activists has meddled in Americans’ lives in recent years,"" CCF's about section says. ""They include self-anointed “food police,” health campaigners, trial lawyers, personal-finance do-gooders, animal-rights misanthropes, and meddling bureaucrats."" Chipotle, CCF holds, falls firmly into that family of enemy activists. ""A lot of what Chipotle says about its food is based on misconceptions,"" said Will Coggin, who is the director of research at CCF. ""We launched this campaign, because we wanted to take this stuff head on."" Specifically, Coggin points to the chain's self-aggrandizing statements about its food. ""They've built up this idea that somehow their food is better for you, that it's healthier for you,"" he said. ""We're not going to take it."" Chipotle, for its part, is neither surprised by the attack nor impressed by it. ""What they're saying, what they're accusing us of, it's nothing new,"" said Chris Arnold, Chipotle's director of communications. ""They're just rehashing things others have been making up about us for years."" ""There's nothing false at all about our advertising or marketing,"" he added. ""But there are legitimate ways to challenges these sorts of things. Launching a smear campaign isn't one of them. It's actually just pretty infantile."" Chipotle has earned both praise and skepticism in its ascent to the upper echelon of the fast food world. The company's mission, which is centered around a commitment to sourcing the most ethical ingredients possible, has proven an honest one. Earlier this year, when it became clear that a pork supplier wasn't meeting the company's standards, Chipotle took the fall, and stopped serving pork at hundreds of restaurants around country. The act was met with applause, as consumers celebrated the chain's steadfastness about its core values. Chipotle's announcement that it would no longer serve foods containing genetically modified organisms, however, was far less popular. Much of the media, including The Washington Post's editorial board, accused the chain of irresponsible fear-mongering. But CCF's campaign calls the entirety of Chipotle's messaging into question, which Arnold says is pretty ironic. ""We've always been very transparent in the way that we run our business,"" he said. ""You can't really say the same about the Center for Consumer Freedom."" Indeed, there is reason to believe that the organization's intention might be less pure than their statements make it seem. CCF, after all, was founded by Rick Berman, a lawyer and lobbyist, famous for arguing on behalf of big food companies and against big health initiatives. Initially, the group was founded to fight smoking curbs in restaurants. The money, of course, came from the coffers of tobacco companies and restaurants. But it has since shifted its focus to the food and beverage industry, where many large players are worried about the impact of health, nutrition, and animal welfare concerns. ""Our general goal is to push against activist groups,"" Coggin says. ""We're very clear about that."" What CCF isn't clear about is who exactly funds its work. Coggin holds that no company, or even group of companies, helped spearhead the anti-Chipotle campaign. ""It's just a project of ours."" But it's impossible for people to know, because the center is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization, and, as such, doesn't have to disclose individual donors. Instead, it offers transparency by sharing only a vague sense of where it gets its money. ""The Center for Consumer Freedom is supported by restaurants, food companies and thousands of individual consumers,"" the organization's website says. ""Mr. Berman is being paid to advocate the interests of a company or group of companies or industry, but won't say who those are,"" said Arnold. ""I don't know about you, but that seems kind of shady."" Shady or not, the public attacks are likely only to pick up speed, and prominence. Asked whether the full-page ad in the New York Post and new Web site were the extent of the campaign, Coggin assured that it's only the start. ""Oh, there is more to come,"" he said. ""But I won't say anymore, I can't talk about it at this time.""",0.41363656667534715

John Kline (R-Minn.), the chair of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, announced Thursday that he will not seek reelection in 2016. Kline, who turns 68 next week, has been working for years to rewrite the main federal education law. He and other House leaders are now in negotiations with the Senate over such a replacement for No Child Left Behind. [Senate passes No Child Left Behind rewrite, would shrink federal role] In a statement released by his office, Kline explained why he opted not to seek an eighth term. “Strengthening our nation’s classrooms and workplaces has been at the forefront of the committee’s agenda since I was first selected to serve as chairman, and it will continue to be my leading priority in the months ahead,” he said in a statement. “Whether it’s replacing No Child Left Behind, holding the Obama administration accountable for its harmful policies, or strengthening higher education, there is a lot of work to do over the next 16 months. I remain humbled by the opportunity to lead the committee, and I intend to finish strong and to continue delivering commonsense reforms America’s student, parents, workers, and employers deserve.” Kline’s district in the St. Paul suburbs was carried by President Obama in 2012 and has been targeted by Democrats, although Kline easily won reelection in 2014 when the district was labeled by the Cook Political Report as “Solid R” .",0.3084124757967095
"Archaeologists' weapon against ISIS: 5,000 cameras",http://www.foxnews.com/science/2015/09/03/archaeologists-weapon-against-isis-5000-cameras/,fox,"The 2,000-year-old Temple of Bel in Syria was recently blown up by the Islamic State. Now, archeologists are trying to digitally document other antiquities before they suffer the same fate. (Silvan Rehfeld, UNESCO via AP)

Archaeologists and thousands of volunteers are in a race against time to digitally map some of the world's oldest and most important statues, temples, and cities before they can be destroyed by the Islamic State, the Los Angeles Times reports.

If ISIS ""is permitted to wipe the slate clean and rewrite the history of a region that defined global aesthetic and political sensibilities, we will collectively suffer a costly and irreversible defeat,"" Roger Michel, director of the Institute for Digital Archaeology, tells the Telegraph.

In recent months, the terrorist group has blown up a pair of 2,000-year-old temples in Syria and destroyed Iraq's ancient city of Nimrud. ISIS considers these antiquities idolatry, and destroying them is a major facet of its propaganda, notes Forbes.

To combat the loss of history, the institute—a venture between Harvard and Oxford—is spending $2 million to send at least 5,000 high-tech cameras to volunteers in the region to take millions of photos, the Telegraph reports.

The institute will use the photos to create 3-D images, which could be used to make replicas of destroyed sites, something Forbes states MIT has offered to do.

Taking photos at these sites will be dangerous work, and volunteers will only go to sites not yet controlled by ISIS, the Times reports. Though the project started only six weeks ago, time is of the essence.

""We want to do something to document this legacy before it disappears,"" Michel tells the Times. (The group also beheaded an archaeological pioneer in the region.)

on an Austrian highway.

Tsvetan Tsvetanov, 32, was held for 72 hours under a

European arrest warrant at his home in the Danube town of Lom on

Walker super PAC spends $9.25M in advertising,http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/scott-walker-super-pac-ad-buy/index.html,cnn,"Washington (CNN)Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's affiliated super PAC announced the second phase of its advertising blitz Thursday, with plans to spend $9.25 million introducing Walker to voters in New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.

That comes on top of the $7 million that the group -- Unintimidated PAC -- has already dedicated to Iowa, a state Walker supporters have said is absolutely critical to their candidate.

The PAC plans to spend a whopping $8 million in South Carolina, going on air Nov. 7 and running through that state's primary, Feb. 20.

Smaller buys of $725,000 and $400,000 are planned for New Hampshire and Nevada, respectively, to run in the week before each state's decision day.

READ: Can Scott Walker Recover?

The money is going, in part, into the first ad from Walker's super PAC, introducing him to voters and laying out his core message: that he not only fights, but wins key battles for conservatives. The spot opens with footage of thousands of union protesters at the Wisconsin statehouse, pushing their way past police and screaming.

It's the central battle which put Walker on the national stage and one that supporters have said he needs to focus on in the long run.

""Time after time Scott Walker fights, and wins,"" the narrator says in the one-minute ad.

Walker's super PAC and campaign are barred, by law, from coordinating with each other.

Walker struggled through August, following a flat debate performance, a slide in the polls and a series of gaffes and unclear stances on issues like ""birthright citizenship"" and talk of a Canadian border wall.

But Walker's team of supporters -- on the campaign side and PAC side -- have taken a long-view much like other candidates toiling in the shadow of front-runner Donald Trump: focus on the marathon through the primaries, not the sprint this summer.",0.99589370136399569
