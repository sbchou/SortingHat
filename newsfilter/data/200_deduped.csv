Bush says will lay out tax reform plan next week in North Carolina,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/8HRORSO-pbA/story01.htm,reuters,"HAMPTON, N.H. Jeb Bush will lay out a tax plan next week aimed at lowering corporate and personal tax rates and giving the U.S. economy a jolt, the Republican presidential candidate said on Thursday.

Bush said he would announce details of his plan on Wednesday in Raleigh, North Carolina. He said he would seek to enable U.S. companies which have an estimated $2 trillion in cash abroad to bring that money home to reinvest in American businesses and create jobs.

Companies keep those funds overseas to avoid having it taxed twice, in the country in which they are doing business and again when brought back to the United States.

""The basic notion of this is to make our tax code the economic driver of investment in our own country,"" the former Florida governor told a town hall event in Hampton, New Hampshire.

Bush did not give a lot of details about his plan, but said the idea would be to ""lower the rates, corporate rates and personal rates, as low as you possibly can, eliminating as many of the deductions as you can.""

Republicans have long sought to pass legislation reducing the U.S. corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have talked about tax reform during President Barack Obama's second term, but the effort has stalled.

""The tax code is rife with all sorts of deductions and credits and make people feel compelled to kind of follow the script rather than say 'I’m going to invest in this business,'"" Bush said.

Bush is a leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, and is one of the many contenders who have made repeated swings through New Hampshire, one of the earliest states to vote in the runup to the November 2016 election.

He said small foreign companies are buying larger American companies in order to take advantage of lower rates.

""I want to reverse that,"" he said, and do this by ""eliminating the worldwide taxation of income.""

Bush said if the tax code can be reformed, it would lead to massive capital investment in the United States.

Bush's goal is to achieve 4 percent economic growth in the United States, a level that has not been reached in years.

He also said he will release the names of his major campaign donors, so-called ""bundlers"" who persuade a group of people to contribute money at the same time.

Bernie Sanders took a moment during an interview with the Des Moines Register's editorial board on Thursday to give his best impression of Donald Trump.

The Vermont senator, in response to a question about whether Trump could also say he's waging a political revolution, said that he and the Republican presidential candidate didn't actually have much in common.

""Not really,"" Sanders said. ""Is Donald Trump bringing big crowds? Yes, he is.""

And then Sanders went into his Trump voice.

""But essentially what Trump is saying is, 'Hey, I'm the smartest guy in the history of the world and I'm tough and anyone who disagrees with me I'm going to take on, even the Des Moines Register here,'"" Sanders said, sparking chuckles from some of the editorial board.

""And Kareem was making the point, and Trump confirmed the point — he starts personal attacks against Kareem Abdul Jabbar because Kareem disagreed with him. And that is a profound difference.""

Sanders then got a bit more serious.

""What I am saying is, I can't do it alone,"" Sanders continued. ""Don't just vote for me. I appreciate your vote [but] you've got to be with me the day after the election because there are some very powerful people and institutions we have got to take on,"" Sanders continued. ""What Trump is saying [is], 'Hey, I'll take care of it. I can do it all myself. That's a pretty profound difference, I think.""

Is Snapchat worth its political salt?,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/09/03/is-snapchat-worth-its-political-salt/,washpo,"A billboard displays the logo of Snapchat above Times Square in New York March 12, 2015. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson What is Snapchat, and can it actually shift outcomes in a presidential race? Seasoned political hands are asking in response to a blitz of media coverage for Snapchat, a four-year-old mobile application that lets users trade messages that disappear after 24 hours or less. That fact is a feature, not a bug for the platform, which promotes a kind of fun, cryptic Internet banter that can leave curious baby boomers scratching their heads. If you’re a young person and you’ve got an inside joke with friends, there’s a good chance it’s been communicated in some form on Snapchat. Not that you could ever go back and find it or anything. The company defied low expectations — who would use the service except for sexting? — and now sees activity from nearly 100 million people every day, including more than 60 percent of 18-to-34-year-old Americans who use smartphones. The younger skew has made Snapchat the buzziest application of the 2016 election cycle, and the company now promotes itself as the prime venue for political advertising and content designed to sway that elusive and coveted demographic: millennials. Why does Hillary love Snapchat? Watch and learn: https://t.co/ZkevdcvZOY — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) August 15, 2015 Snapchat’s foray into politics only just recently began. The app landed its first political spot on June 6, one month after the company snagged former Google executive Rob Saliterman to sell advertising to campaigns. Washington readers will remember Saliterman as a spokesman for former President George W. Bush and an early pioneer on the White House-to-Silicon Valley career trail. In May, the company plucked another D.C. player to run its news division: former CNN political reporter Peter Hamby. Headlines were positive. The company was eager to play in the presidential race. Snapchat made quick headway. Nearly every 2016 team is using the app in some form or another, whether running advertisements targeted by state (the app can’t hone in closer, for now) or posting “snaps” from behind the scenes. Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush used Snapchat to document their campaign kick-offs. Scott Walker is an active user, aided by his sons, both under 25. John Kasich might not post much original content, but he’s advertised on the platform, as has Walker: Part of Saliterman’s 2016 pitch is the intimacy of viewing ads on the app. Paid content takes up the entire mobile screen, interrupting Snapchat users’ flow of activity (a good thing) to deliver a message that hits them up close, “within arm’s length,” as Saliterman says. Snapchat’s immersive “live story” feature also provides candidates with an opportunity to upload content related to events, like a primary debate. “One of the game changers in the 2016 cycle compared to the 2012 cycle is that a much higher percentage of people involved in the election have smartphones,” Saliterman said in an interview. “This means that almost everyone has a video recording device right in their pocket. And that video can be broadcast instantly through Snapchat.” Snapchat argues it can play a big role in the early primary states by galvanizing millennial voters, increasing a candidate’s standing in the primary and even putting them over the edge. After all, Rick Santorum finished only 34 votes ahead of Mitt Romney in the Iowa caucuses in 2012. Could a Snapchat ad for Romney have made the difference? It’s almost impossible to know, but you can’t rule it out an era when social media has become the primary source of news for millennials. Read more: LinkedIn tries to become destination for candidates, voters From rap lyrics to political speeches: the evolution of Genius Can Medium replace the op-ed page? Still, there’s plenty of skepticism about the app’s political worth. Compared with Facebook and Twitter, Snapchat’s ability to target advertisements and connect viewers back to the campaign are rudimentary. The app’s search function is unwieldy and candidates’ accounts are hard to find. Like other tech firms, the company is also secretive about its plans and analytics, which might prove problematic for campaign ad buyers. For example: how many people view political ads on Snapchat to completion? (Ad buyers have complained that Snapchat charges them for ads viewed for less than one second.) And do candidates reach much of anyone with the content they post themselves? Snapchat won’t say. Wired magazine summed up these critiques in a recent piece titled, “Sorry Snapchat, But You’re Not Winning This Election.” The use of new online platforms has become a defining aspect of the 2016 presidential race, and every candidate wants to prove they’re on board with the latest trends. But sometimes, that just means throwing ideas at the wall, including on Snapchat. Cue the latest experiment from John Kasich: In Hooksett, N.H., Post reporter David Weigel tests out the bacon-themed snapchat geo-filter that presidential candidate John Kasich's campaign rolled out for New Hampshire social media users Sept. 2.

A majority of millennials don&#8217;t think they are millennials,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/03/a-majority-of-millennials-dont-think-they-are-millennials/,washpo,"Millennials doing millennial stuff. (Photo by Kyle Gustafson / For The Washington Post) One of the first big media explorations of the term ""millennial"" came from the pages of Advertising Age magazine. There was a book that came out in September 2000 called ""Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation,"" and within a few months, AdAge's Bonnie Tsui laid out a few thousand words about what this new generation meant for brands. Her savviest point was this: In the past, generations were defined largely by the year in which one was born. Now target marketing has reached the point where generational attitudes are discerned and used as a starting point for media planning. Put another way? Generations mean more in marketing terms than in sociological ones. Which mirrors what Columbia University sociologist Tom DiPrete said when we spoke last year. ""The media in particular wants [generational] definitions, identities,"" he said. ""I don't know that the definitions are as strong or as widely shared across all the boundaries. … At the end I think it gets fuzzy."" A new survey from Pew Research shows that ""millennial"" isn't really how millennials see millennials, either. Pew asked respondents to identify the generation with which each identified, and sorted them by their ""actual"" generation. Obligatory reminder, to DiPrete's point: There is no ""actual"" generation for any group besides the Baby Boomers, which is a statistically defined group. Pew's definition of what counts as millennial -- defined by year of birth -- isn't the same as other organizations'. That said, millennials were less likely than other groups to identify as their ""correct"" generation. (Wearing out my scarequote key here.) Forty percent of people born within Pew's millennial boundaries saw themselves as millennials. Eight percent ... saw themselves as Boomers. Pew notes that the generational self-identity of Millennials (born 1981 to 1997) is lower than that of Generation X (1965 to 1980) or Baby Boomers (1946 to 1964). It's higher than the ""silent generation,"" those born (1928 to 1945). Just as older millennials see themselves as part of Generation X (43 percent of those aged 27 to 34), the silent generation prefers to identify as Boomers or the ""greatest generation"" -- those that fought in World War II. ""In part, this reflects the low visibility of the term 'Silent Generation,'"" Pew's researchers write. But also it probably reflects that the name is lousy. If you gave me the choice between saying I was in the Greatest Generation or the Silent Generation, you know what I'd pick? Pew's question was ""How well would you say the term GREATEST GENERATION applies to you?"" Pretty well, thanks! Eight percent of millennials say they're in the greatest generation, but very, very few of them fought in World War II. I am in Generation X, to the extent that any non-Boomer is anything.* And I remember with great clarity how we were all terrible cynical slackers that wore flannel to Ethan Hawke movies. Well, guess what! Millennials see themselves as more cynical than we do. They see themselves as more wasteful and more self-absorbed. Generations now come of age in a world that analyzes and markets and leverages and social medias everything they do, a world in which older people look at younger people and their newfangled music and contraptions, package them into ad hoc groups and judge them poorly. Happened to us; it's happening to them. Millennials, though, are probably more aware of this process. Many of them no doubt know that when we talk about ""millennials,"" we don't actually mean and aren't actually describing them. It's marketing! And in the lingo, ""millennial"" means ""young"" or ""new."" It's a framework that allows things like this 2007 exploration of how millennials behave and think, produced as sponsored content for ABC family by AdAge. It means that millennials often see ""millennials"" in those defined terms -- which often aren't complimentary. Millennials see themselves as less patriotic than Boomers see themselves -- and less responsible, hard-working, moral, self-reliant, etc. ""To be sure, some of these differences may be related more to age and life stage than to the unique characteristics of today’s generations,"" Pew writes. And since each generation sees itself more positively in the contexts of these positive terms, per Pew, that's likely right. The media made up millennials and then constantly talks about how millennials are young selfie jerks, and voila. No wonder older millennials see themselves as Gen X, given the chance. No Boomer would have chosen that in 1995. And now the kicker. The term ""millennial"" itself apparently stems in part from an informal survey conducted by ABC News in late 1997. When Peter Jennings revealed the results during World News Tonight, he explained that ""the second largest number though there should be no label [for the generation] at all, and the greatest interest was in the millennium generation, or the millennials."" As often happens, the runners-up had the better point. * Weirdly enough, one sociologist I spoke with thinks that the millennial generation may end up sharing enough sociological indicators to be a ""real"" generational cohort! For now, though, it's still mostly marketing.",0.99226916031240353

Weekly Jobless Claims Rise; Trade Deficit Narrows,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/business/economy/weekly-jobless-claims-rise-trade-deficit-narrows.html,nyt,"WASHINGTON — The trade deficit in the United States fell in July to its lowest level in five months as exports rose broadly, signaling underlying strength in the economy despite concerns about a global growth slowdown.

The Commerce Department said the trade gap narrowed 7.4 percent to $41.9 billion, the smallest level since February. The trade deficit for June was revised to $45.2 billion from the previously reported $43.8 billion.

When adjusted for inflation, the deficit fell to $56.2 billion in July from $59 billion the previous month.

The smaller deficit implied a modest contribution to gross domestic product from trade early in the third quarter. Trade contributed 0.3 percentage point to the economy's 3.7 percent annualized growth rate in the second quarter.

Other data released on Thursday showed an increase in the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits. The trend in jobless claims, however, remained consistent with a strengthening labor market.

The Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 282,000 for the week that ended on Tuesday.

The claims data has no bearing on Friday’s closely watched employment report for August as it fell outside the survey period. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls most likely increased by 220,000 last month after rising 215,000 in July.

But job gains could come in below expectations as the first reading of August payrolls has tended to be weaker in the last several years before being revised higher.

The August employment report will be released less than two weeks before the Federal Reserve's Sept. 16-17 policy-setting meeting. There is speculation the central bank could raise interest rates at that meeting.

The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it smooths out week-to-week volatility, rose 3,250 to 275,500 last week.

It was the 23rd consecutive week that the four-week average remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is usually associated with a strengthening labor market.

In July, exports increased 0.4 percent to $188.5 billion. While that was the first increase since April, exports remain constrained by a strong dollar. The dollar has gained 16.8 percent against the currencies of the United States’ main trading partners since June 2014.

Exports to China fell 1.9 percent, and imports from that country dipped 0.2 percent. That left the politically sensitive United States-China trade deficit at $31.6 billion, up 0.4 percent from June. The trade deficit with China will be closely watched in the coming months after that country devalued its currency in August.

Exports to Canada fell 8.3 percent in July and could come under more pressure after the Canadian economy slipped into recession in the second quarter.",0.69611056128451287
Make a Monthly Content-Marketing Check-In a Must-Do,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/national/~3/BLZpmyGA0jY/,fox,"A monthly content-marketing check-in gives you the opportunity to measure the success of your campaigns. Without a regular review, you won’t be able to take a strategic approach to your efforts, and if you don’t understand where you’re at, you can’t create a clear path for where you’re going.

Entrepreneurs that fully invest in content marketing will generate an abundance of data as their campaigns grow. It’s crucial that you have a plan for analyzing these numbers and making adjustments to your efforts along the way.

Content marketing is a dynamic effort. You’ll want to test different things and see what works and what doesn’t. The only way to truly know that is through regular check-ins.

Review progress of overall goals.

Start the check-in with a brief review of your overall goals. Your content-marketing team should have set these initial goals in the beginning of your efforts.

( source)

Goals are important because they set the baseline for all other analyses. For example, an increase in traffic doesn’t have value if there isn’t a business goal to measure it against. But if you knew that your overall goal was an increase in monthly revenue, you can measure your financial results against your traffic to see if you’re on track with your goals.

That said, things change. Make sure to reevaluate your goals once a quarter to be sure they’re still applicable.

Related: How to Use Content Marketing to Build a Brand with Purpose

Measure traffic changes.

Review your traffic and see how it changed compared to last month. If you’re investing in content marketing, you’ll want to see that your efforts are continuing to bring in new traffic from different sources. Some questions to ask yourself include:

Which traffic source increased/decreased?

Did any product launches or events create a large bump in traffic this month?

Have we recently done a trade show, mailer or other marketing campaigns that could account for the increase in traffic?

Have we started or ended any prominent partnerships with industry leaders?

Try to find the reason for any major shift in traffic. It will help you evaluate what’s working and what isn’t.

Recap campaign performance.

Look at how your content-marketing efforts have impacted your marketing performance overall. Specifically, you’ll want to analyze:

Traffic to landing pages from content-marketing efforts, such as blogging or guest blogging.

Lead-generation numbers compared to last month.

Results of A/B tests on content-related items such as call-to-action copy on blog posts.

Conversion rates and traffic from social-media campaigns.

You’ll learn a lot when you evaluate your content marketing against your other digital-marketing campaigns, as doing so will help you see the true impact of your efforts.

Look at your content-marketing landing pages.

For the most part, you’ll be creating landing pages focused on lead generation. These types of landing pages typically include a form that aims to convert viewers to email list subscribers. But there are other types of landing pages as well.

In content marketing, you can develop things such as resources pages and in-depth guides that serve as landing pages. If you’ve developed this type of content, evaluate its success.

Look at metrics such as the number of social shares, traffic increases or decreases, conversion rate and new leads acquired this month. Knowing this data can help you evaluate whether this type of content works with your audience. If it does, you can make plans to do more of it in the future.

Related: How Much Should Your Content Marketing Really Cost?

Identify top-performing blog posts.

Some of your blog posts will out-perform others. Identifying the types of posts that are performing best on your website gives your team special insight. You can use this information to guide your future topics, hone in your buyer personas, direct your marketing team and locate opportunities for blog-post optimization.

Specific metrics you can use to gauge success include:

Number of views

Conversion rate

Number of social shares

Number of comments

Keyword rankings

I particularly like this part of the check-in because it directly correlates to the type of content that resonates with your audience. The more you can narrow down those topics, the better.

Track social-media impact.

Content marketing is great, but it won’t accomplish much if you don’t promote it. Social media is one of the main ways many marketers promote their content. Review how much traffic is coming from your social-media channels. Also, measure how many people arrive on your site and then share your content to their social profiles.

I’ve found that it’s one thing for someone to retweet my content. But it’s far more valuable if I get them to my site and they share it themselves.

Establish opportunities for the upcoming month.

Once you have all this information, it’s time to make plans for the upcoming month. I like to ask myself a few questions:

Should I alter my strategy based on this month’s findings?

Are my content-marketing efforts serving my business goals? If not, what adjustments should I make to realign my efforts?

The Kentucky county clerk who refuses to issue marriage licenses to gay couples has been jailed, and she's OK with it.

Kim Davis was ordered to jail Thursday after a federal judge found her in contempt for refusal to issue marriage licenses, according to The Associated Press.

“I’ve weighed the cost and I’m prepared to go to jail, I sure am,” she told Fox News’ Todd Starnes before her court appearance. “This is a heaven or hell issue for me and for every other Christian that believes … This is a fight worth fighting.”

The Rowan County clerk stopped issuing marriage licenses — for all couples — after the Supreme Court ruling that legalized gay marriage in June. She was elected to the post in November; her mother was the county clerk for nearly 40 years before her.

According to the AP, U.S. District Judge David Bunning told her she would be jailed until she complied with his order to issue the licenses. The AP reported that Davis said “thank you” before she was led out of the courtroom by a U.S. marshal.

The American Civil liberties Union attorneys who filed the motion on Monday did not ask for jail time; instead they requested Davis be fined because she ""continues to collect compensation from the Commonwealth for duties she fails to perform,” according to the motion.

The judge told the AP that Davis left him with no alternative but to jail her, since fines alone would not serve to change her mind.

Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee weighed in on Twitter within minutes of the sentencing.

“Kim Davis in federal custody removes all doubts about the criminalization of Christianity in this country. We must defend #ReligiousLiberty!” he tweeted.

Many other GOP candidates have weighed in on Davis’ circumstances over the past week, though they have been split on her choice as an elected official.

Rubio named Del. Timothy D. Hugo (R-Fairfax) chairman of his Virginia campaign. Hugo, who ranks third in House of Delegates leadership, praised the freshman senator from Florida as a “generational leader.” “Marco will be an excellent President, and I look forward to supporting him and building his team in Virginia,” Hugo said in a written statement.

""The road to the White House goes through Virginia,"" said state Sen. William M. Stanley (R-Franklin). Two days ago, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas named Stanley chairman of his campaign.

Who’s Who in the Hillary Clinton Email Controversy,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/09/03/whos-who-in-the-hillary-clinton-email-controversy/,wsj,"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton‘s aides have been drawn into the lawsuits and investigations into her use of a private email server for government business.

Two top aides are on Capitol Hill this week testifying in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, while another has said he will invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions in the course of the investigation.

Here’s a guide to who is who in the Clinton email drama:

Ms. Mills is a longtime attorney, campaign aide and adviser to the Clinton family. She most recently served as chief of Staff to Mrs. Clinton at the State Department. Before that she served in Bill Clinton‘s White House and on Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign. She is on Capitol Hill Thursday testifying behind closed doors before the Benghazi committee.

***

Another top aide to Mrs. Clinton at the State Department, Mr. Sullivan is a foreign-policy expert and an adviser to her 2016 campaign. He also served on Vice President Joe Biden‘s national security staff. He is expected to testify in front of the Benghazi committee on Friday.

***

Ms. Abedin worked for Mrs. Clinton at the State Department as deputy chief of staff and currently serves on her 2016 campaign. Ms. Abedin obtained permission to work as a special State Department employee, and was also on the payroll of the Clinton Foundation and the consulting firm Teneo. The State Department’s inspector general found this year that she was overpaid by almost $10,000 by the State Department — a finding that Ms. Abedin’s attorneys are challenging.

***

Mr. Reines served as a senior adviser to Mrs. Clinton at the State Department, often handling her media requests. His emails are the subject of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the website Gawker seeking access to his correspondence with reporters.

***

Mr. Pagliano served as an information technology staffer on Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign before going to work for the State Department. He set up the server in question for Mrs. Clinton before it was later transferred to a professional IT company based in Denver. Through an attorney, he announced this week that he would invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions in the congressional investigations into the email server.

***

A longtime friend and political confidant of the Clinton family, Mr. Blumenthal was denied a job in the State Department under pressure from the White House. He nevertheless stayed in close contact with Mrs. Clinton during her time in office. He testified in a closed door session in front of the Benghazi committee in May.

Jeb Bush Broadens Attack on Donald Trump,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/09/03/jeb-bush-broadens-attack-on-donald-trump/,wsj,"HAMPTON, N.H. â Jeb Bush broadened his attack on Donald Trump Thursday, saying the Republican Party faces a stark choice–both on issues and worldview between himself and the real estate mogul and reality television celebrity who is the front-runner for the 2016 GOP nomination.

âThereâs one candidate in the Republican Party that is preying on peopleâs angst and fears that has a philosophy not about goodness and greatness of the American people,â Mr. Bush said in a town hall meeting here. âDonald Trumpâs view is that the end is near.â

Mr. Bush said the party is better off with a more upbeat conservative message because âwhen we give people hopeâ¦we can lift them up.ââ

âI choose that path because the other path will lead to defeat, but more importantly, it will lead to more angst, more angerâ said Mr. Bush, drawing differences with Mr. Trump on taxes, immigration and other policies. âWhatever the issue, there is one path that is aspirational and hopeful and there is one path that is negative and is not the right path for this country.”

And one day after Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Bush for speaking in Spanish on the campaign trail, the bilingual former Florida governor slipped in a Spanish phrase when he called on Republicans to campaign âwith our arms wide open.â

Mr. Trump on Wednesday complained about Mr. Bushâs use of Spanish saying that he shouldÂ  âset the exampleâ by speaking English while in the U.S.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Bush on ABCâs âGood Morning Americaâ responded to that complaint by saying, âIÂ think Donald Trump is trying to insult his way to the presidency and it’s not going to work. People want an uplifting hopeful message. People come to this country to pursue their dreams, sometimes they start without speaking English but they learn English and they add vitality to our country.â

The town hall was held on a factory floor after Mr. Bush toured a plant of Foss Manufacturing, a synthetic fabric firm. Workers in attendance included fans, foes and the indifferent. Employees said attendance was not mandatory, but the plantâs production line was shut down to make it easier for them and their families to attend.

One questioner attacked Mr. Bushâs immigration policies, saying it amounted to âappeasementâ to propose allowing a pathway to legal status for millions of people in the U.S. illegally,

âWe are pissed off right now,â said Dennis Lamare of Lee, N.H. âThere is an air of appeasement.â

Responding to Mr. Lamare, Mr. Bush took a swipe at two of Mr. Trumpâs signature immigration proposals â building a wall on the southern border and having Mexico pay for it, which Mr. Bush called âludicrous,â Â and deporting people here illegally and their families.

âRounding people upâ Mr. Bush said, would âcreate real chaosâ and cost hundreds of billions of dollars.

"Ben Carson Wins in Matchup With Donald Trump, Poll Shows",http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/09/03/ben-carson-wins-in-matchup-with-donald-trump-poll-shows/,wsj,"If Donald Trump has an Achilles’ heel in the Republican presidential nominating contest, it just might be the candidate who is least like him: soft-spoken retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.

A Monmouth University poll released Thursday found that in head-to-head matchups with nine top members of the GOP field, the real-estate mogul beat each of his rivals—except for Mr. Carson. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who for months was the field’s front-runner, lost with 37% to Mr. Trump’s 56%. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio‘s margin was similarly poor: 38% to 52%. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker lost 38% to 53%; Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul 27% to 60%; Ohio Gov. John Kasich 29% to  62%; and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie 30% to 63%. Former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz came the closest, losing 37% to  50% and 41% to 48%, respectively.

In a matchup with Mr. Carson, Mr. Trump didn’t even come close. He lost with 36% of GOP voters’ support, compared with 55% for Mr. Carson. Neither candidate has ever held elected office.

“The fact that the only one who can challenge Trump is the only other candidate who has never held or run for elected office speaks volumes to the low regard GOP voters have for the establishment,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, in a statement.

Mrs. Fiorina has also never held elected office, and has seen a distinct bump in polling following her widely praised performance in the second-tier debate held last month.

As Mr. Trump draws hefty crowds around the country and lands in the headlines for his bombastic, often controversial remarks, little attention has been paid to Mr. Carson, who rocketed to fame in conservative political circles after criticizing the health-care law in a 2013 National Prayer Breakfast speech while President Barack Obama sat just feet away. But Mr. Carson has been quietly building support, with a recent survey by TargetPoint Consulting, a top GOP polling and data-research firm, finding that roughly two-thirds of likely Republican voters would consider backing him—the highest level of support for any candidate in the field. Just 16% said they wouldn’t, the lowest such tally.

Mr. Carson is currently polling second among GOP voters, according to a Real Clear Politics average of recent national polls. He has 13.2% of support, to Mr. Trump’s 27.2%, according to that average.

Prosecutors plan to seek death penalty for accused Charleston church gunman Dylann Roof,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/09/03/prosecutors-plan-to-seek-death-penalty-for-accused-charleston-church-gunman/,washpo,"Dylann Roof (R), the 21-year-old man charged with the killings. (Randall Hill/Reuters) Prosecutors in South Carolina intend to seek a death sentence for Dylann Roof, the man accused of killing nine black parishioners in a Charleston, S.C., church earlier this year. Roof has been charged with nine counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder for the June massacre. Scarlett A. Wilson, the prosecutor in the case, has a news conference scheduled for Thursday afternoon to make an announcement regarding the case. Court documents filed Thursday show that the state intends to seek the death penalty for Roof. Under South Carolina law, prosecutors can seek a death sentence if there are certain aggravating factors in a case, including if someone is charged with murdering more than one person during a single act.

How To Make Gravlax (and Save Big on Cured Salmon),http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-make-gravlax-and-save-big-on-cured-salmon-1441298027,wsj,"IN BEVERLY HILLS, where I grew up, Sunday mornings meant trekking off to Nate ’n Al and stuffing myself with enough lox, bagels and cream cheese to last until dinner and beyond. I could hardly imagine anything more delicious than the deli’s lox—mildly salted, lightly cold-smoked Nova Scotia salmon. As time passed, however, I graduated to Scottish, Irish and Norwegian smoked salmons and liked them even better. But their high price relegated them to the “special occasion food” category.

The real game-changer first appeared to me on a Stockholm restaurant menu. Gravlax, thinly sliced and rosy-orange, looked like smoked salmon, but its meltingly tender texture and cleaner taste were new, and wonderful. I learned that preparing gravlax was smoke-free and dead simple, a mere matter of smothering a very fresh salmon fillet in salt, sugar and abundant fresh dill, and refrigerating it for a couple of days. Here was something even a kitchen novice could manage at home—and quite inexpensively to boot.

Guests devour my home-cured gravlax enthusiastically whether it’s served as an hors d’oeuvre, a sandwich filling, a brunch-buffet anchor or a light main course. If I’m feeling traditional, I’ll serve dark or rye bread and a sweet mustard-dill sauce as accompaniments. Sometimes, however, I go all Nordic-minimal, presenting the thinly sliced gravlax with nothing but cracked pepper and a drizzle of lemon juice or champagne vinegar.

Whether you opt to serve your gravlax naked or sauced, use only the very freshest fish to make it. Once cured, if well-wrapped and refrigerated, gravlax will last up to a week. But if you smell any off odors, discard it sooner.

This style of preparation dates back to the middle ages, when Scandinavian fishermen simply buried salted salmon on the beach to preserve it, and the process hasn’t gotten any more complicated in the intervening centuries. Once you’ve mastered the making of gravlax you may want to experiment. The salt-to-sugar ratio is a question of personal taste. And some cooks include additional spices—caraway, coriander and fennel seeds all nicely complement the fresh dill.

I’ve even dallied with versions spiked with aquavit—which, by the way, also makes a delicious and appropriately brisk drink pairing for this herbed and salty food. The curing time is not set in stone either. Longer equals a stronger flavor, and vice versa.

Making it at home not only saves you the money you’d otherwise spend on all those imported salmons; it also means you can have your gravlax just as you like it. What a luxury.

1. Combine salt, sugar, toasted fennel seeds and crushed peppercorns in a small bowl.

2. Line a deep dish or plastic container with a long piece of foil, letting ends trail out of dish. Cut salmon in half crosswise and place one half, skin-side down, on top of foil.

3. Sprinkle half of spice mix evenly over fish, top with bunch of dill and sprinkle remaining spice over dill. Place remaining salmon, skin-side up, on top.

4. Wrap with foil, place a bowl on top of foil and weight with a heavy can. Refrigerate 48-72 hours, turning foil packet periodically and replacing weight. At end of curing, unwrap, discard dill and wipe spices from fish. (Rinse fish for a less-salty result.) Sprinkle with chopped dill. To serve, thinly slice gravlax against the grain.",0.32027119441894059
Texans WR Strong learning value of sacrifice in the NFL,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/sports/~3/5mAOn3x5ZHg/,fox,"Aug 22, 2015; Houston, TX, USA; Houston Texans head coach Bill O'Brien talks with wide receiver Jaelen Strong (11) before a game against the Denver Broncos at NRG Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports

Houston Texans wide receiver Jaelen Strong has helped turn tough love from the coaching staff into a productive preseason performance.

Strong, a third-round pick out of Arizona State, has two touchdown receptions though Houston's first three exhibition games.

It's a noticeable improvement for the rookie, who was featured on 'Hard Knocks' two weeks ago being lectured by coaches. Strong credits advice he's received from veteran receiver Nate Washington and receivers coach Stan Hixon, among others, for helping him settle in during camp.

""Study, study, study, study,"" Strong said, per ESPN's Tania Ganguli. ""Sacrifice a lot of things. I'd rather give up everything just to be perfect on the football field. That's just how my mindset has changed. Before I was trying to take little pieces here, little pieces there. You've got to make that sacrifice.""

Strong, who was taken with the 70th pick in the draft, has impressed the coaching staff with his skillset in camp.

""He's improved every week,"" Texans coach Bill O'Brien said. ""I think that he's taken the coaching to heart. He's a very talented guy. He's big, he's strong, he's a very instinctive player, he makes contested catches. I think that he's improved every week. The key for Jaelen is the key for every rookie, is to keep improving.""

The 21-year-old said Washington has helped provide valuable perspective on what it takes to be successful in the NFL.

""He told me he's in his 11th year and he's still trying to make the team,"" Strong said. ""There's always somebody coming for your spot. Always somebody trying to take that food off your plate. Granted these are your teammates, you go out there to win together. But it's your job. This is how you feed your family. Everything you do you've gotta do it the right way.""

Report: Patriots don't plan to play Tom Brady in preseason finale,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/sports/~3/CdQMqflHbvg/,fox,"Tom Brady is officially available to start for the New England Patriots in Week 1 following the nullification of his four-game suspension, but fans will have to wait until next Thursday to see their quarterback on the field.

According to Jeff Howe of the Boston Herald, a source said that the Patriots are unlikely to play Brady in the preseason finale on Thursday night.

This should come as no surprise, as the majority of starters across the NFL will be relegated to being cheerleaders on the sidelines tonight.

With Brady now available to play in the regular season opener, the Patriots could now play Jimmy Garoppolo for some time in the preseason finale. He's no longer going to be the starter this season and can still benefit from extra preseason time to work on some things -- even if it is against the Giants' backup defense.

While it's disappointing Brady won't be on the field Thursday night against the Giants, Patriots fans are just a short week away from seeing the quarterback back in action against the Steelers in Week 1.

Small Business and the Secret of Big Growth,http://www.wsj.com/articles/small-business-and-the-secret-of-big-growth-1441234231,wsj,"Tired of plodding growth, stagnant wages and widening inequality, most Americans have little positive to say about the U.S. economy. With one notable exception. In a Gallup poll this summer, almost two-thirds expressed confidence in small businesses. That’s three times as many as said the same about big business. Only the U.S. military ranks consistently as high.

The faith in small business runs deep but rests on an increasingly unsure foundation. Small firms have been slow to recover from the recession, and business deaths now outpace births for the first time since the Census Bureau began keeping records more than three decades ago. A July survey by the National Small Business Association showed that only 35% of owners are optimistic about the direction of the economy.

These warning signs should light a fire under Democrats and Republicans. The health of small local firms is one of the vital signs of democracy, a key indicator of community well-being.

Small businesses continue to create most new jobs and employ about half of the private workforce, according to data from the Small Business Administration. They are launchpads for innovation and opportunity. As chairman of McLarty Cos., a fourth-generation family-owned automotive firm that began as a single car dealership in Hope, Ark., I’ve seen firsthand how small businesses can transform Main Street into an avenue to the American dream.

That avenue is now strewn with potholes and obstacles, including taxes and regulations. Despite the gilded image of startups like Uber and Airbnb, many new small firms struggle to find financing. Wendy Guillies, president of the Kauffman Foundation, reported earlier this year that more than half of young companies that applied for credit were turned down. Her conclusion: “Across the board, the American economy appears to be getting less dynamic.”

Where can we look for big thinking about small business? Neither the sweeping promises of economic populism, aimed largely at Wall Street, nor the antigovernment reflexes of some on the right, squarely address the problems of small business. But policies that help smaller firms compete, thrive and create good jobs are needed, and there are good ideas from both sides of the political aisle.

Tax reform is one such idea. Small businesses can’t compete with large corporations that find creative ways to lower their taxes. The money they must spend to comply with the complicated tax code is a heavy burden. Addressing these points last month, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton proposed a program of “tax relief and simplification” for entrepreneurs, and promised “less red tape” and “easier access to capital.”

Mrs. Clinton has said that she wants to be “the small business president.” She will not be alone on the campaign trail. Among Republicans, Gov. John Kasich pushed this year to eliminate the income tax in Ohio on most small businesses. Jeb Bush’s supporters cite his record as governor when Florida was the nation’s leader in small business creation.

In Congress, bipartisan efforts are seeking to curb some onerous regulations for small businesses. The Small Business Healthcare Relief Act is sponsored by Sens. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) and Heidi Heitkamp (D., N.D.) and Reps. Charles Boustany Jr. (R., La.) and Mike Thompson (D., Calif.). It would protect firms with fewer than 50 employees that offer health reimbursement accounts being penalized under the Affordable Care Act for providing this cost-sharing option to employees.

Congress and the White House also should rally bipartisan support for the expansion of vocational training and apprenticeships. In a recent survey by the National Federation of Independent Business, about half of small business owners seeking new employees said they had difficulty finding qualified applicants. Training costs for small businesses should be offset by tax breaks and other incentives.

A thread running through these efforts is an opportunity to find common political cause, the antithesis of today’s unfortunate division and distrust. After all, it takes cooperation to launch a small business. As the late Republican Congressman Jack Kemp once said, “You can’t create more employees without first creating more employers.” And you can’t sustain employers without a well-trained, fairly paid and engaged workforce.

Small business owners are clear about what they want from Washington. Asked in last month’s National Small Business Association survey to rank their priorities for the administration and Congress, the top responses were simplify and cut taxes, reduce the national deficit, and “end the partisan gridlock and work together.” The message to the country’s political leadership is clear: Lead, or get out of the way.

Hillary Could Lose Iowa---and New Hampshire,http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-could-lose-iowaand-new-hampshire-1441234267,wsj,"Political junkies are focused on Donald Trump, but Hillary Clinton’s weakness remains a huge story. Her support among Iowa’s likely Democratic caucusgoers has dropped to 37%, down 20 points since May, according to an Aug. 26 Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll. Meanwhile, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is up 16 points to 30%, and Vice President Joe Biden, who isn’t even running, is up six points to 14%.

The poll caused great consternation among Mrs. Clinton’s supporters, as it should have. Some of her advocates tried to claim that the survey contained good news, in that the former secretary of state’s favorable rating among Democratic caucusgoers remained at 77%.

But if Mrs. Clinton’s favorables remained high while she hemorrhaged support, then Iowa Democrats are moving to Mr. Sanders not because they dislike her but because she doesn’t excite them, and they like him more. That too was polled. Only 2% of Mr. Sanders’s backers said that their decision to support him was because they don’t support Mrs. Clinton.

But is there a Democrat who—absent something extraordinary, say, Mrs. Clinton’s indictment over mishandling classified information on her private email account—can beat her for the nomination?

If this is the field, the answer is probably no. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee are vying to avoid being asterisks in the polls.

Things will probably get worse for Mrs. Clinton in the short term. It’s possible, even likely, that she will lose both the Feb. 1 Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary eight days later. Mr. Sanders will appeal in a state like Iowa, where there is a strong left-wing sentiment, and the caucus format is dominated by more ideologically committed activists. He could carry New Hampshire in a multicandidate field.

But then the calendar becomes Mrs. Clinton’s friend. South Carolina and Nevada are next. Neither is fertile ground for Mr. Sanders, the self-proclaimed democratic socialist. On March 1 come primaries in Arkansas, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas, all states Mrs. Clinton carried in 2008. She will probably fare well on super Tuesday again, except perhaps in Massachusetts, a next-door neighbor to Mr. Sanders’s home state.

There also will be primaries that day in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, Vermont and Virginia, states that then-Sen. Barack Obama carried in 2008. Vermont will go for its favorite son, but Mrs. Clinton stands a better chance than Mr. Sanders in the others if she has the backing of black Democratic leaders who voted for Mr. Obama seven years ago.

Competing in these primaries will be expensive. A reasonable flight of three or four weeks of television ads in those states will cost north of $30 million, even at the low rates candidates are guaranteed by the FCC, and more if the ads are bought by a super PAC. Mrs. Clinton is likely to have the cash; Mr. Sanders is not, even if his fundraising gets a boost from early victories.

The contests between March 5 and March 15 appear inhospitable for Mr. Sanders as well. Mrs. Clinton carried Florida, Michigan and Ohio in 2008 and virtually tied in Missouri, even with Sen. Claire McCaskill helping out Mr. Obama. This time she will be helping Hillary. Mr. Obama carried his home state of Illinois, Kansas (where he claimed family ties), Louisiana and Mississippi. All four, especially the Southern states, seem better turf for Mrs. Clinton this time.

There are also March caucuses in Colorado, Minnesota and Nebraska. Unprepared for most caucuses in 2008, Mrs. Clinton got walloped. Even if she’s learned a lesson, Mr. Sanders could be competitive in parts of Colorado and Minnesota.

Mr. Sanders’s problem is simply that there aren’t enough left-wing enclaves like Portland and Berkeley, Madison and Ann Arbor, Burlington and Boulder for him to beat her for the nomination.

Could Vice President Joe Biden, though? Mr. Biden would do better in the blue-collar parts of Missouri and Michigan than Mr. Sanders—and maybe even Mrs. Clinton. But once the contest runs through the South, he would have to pick up a substantial part of the black vote. It’s one thing to vacation in South Carolina, as Mr. Biden does. It’s another thing to generate the level of support that Mr. Obama enjoyed there in 2008.

Still, the more candidates in the Democratic race, the more Mrs. Clinton’s numbers will drop, and the more unconventional the nominating process will become. And in this election, unconventional is doing better than expected.

Small-Business Hiring Picks Up,http://www.wsj.com/articles/small-business-hiring-picks-up-1441279409,wsj,"Hiring at small businesses increased in August, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. Its monthly employer survey finds that NFIB members added a net 0.13 workers per firm in recent months, which was better than July’s 0.05 reading and represents “a large improvement in hiring activity,” according to the NFIB’s William Dunkelberg. Morning Editorial Report reviewed the survey results, which will be released later today.

Click here to receive Opinion headlines and James Freeman’s commentary via email.

The good news is that business conditions are improving and small employers did not freak out over the August volatility on Wall Street. The bad news is that the improvement is likely not large enough to pull the economy out of “the same old 2-2.5% rut” for GDP growth in the second half of the year, according to Mr. Dunkelberg. Still, based on today’s numbers, he expects the Department of Labor’s August employment report to show job gains of 250,000 or more.

After a solid second quarter for GDP growth, your correspondent wonders if low fuel prices are finally starting to drive the economy out of the Obama-era malaise and offset Washington’s myriad policy mistakes.

Speaking of policy mistakes, Hillary Clinton is proposing an FDR-style tax distortion for investments, and Alan Reynolds describes what happened after this policy was implemented in the 1930s. “In the 12 months between February 1937 and 1938, the Dow Jones Industrial stock average fell 41%...That crash presaged one of the nation’s worst recessions, from May 1937 to June 1938, with GDP falling 10% and industrial production 32%,” writes Mr. Reynolds.

As for Mrs. Clinton’s most famous recent mistake, a Journal editorial notes her “self-serving decision to use a private email server for official communications may have resulted in far greater mishandling of classified information.”

The big mistake for Senate Democrats is giving the President enough support to sustain a veto of GOP efforts to block his Iran nuclear deal. The Democrats “now own the Ayatollahs,” notes a Journal editorial.

Next comes the “spectacle” of “the President’s party using a procedural dodge to avoid voting on the merits” of a hugely consequential international agreement. “Previous arms-control pacts of this magnitude were submitted as treaties requiring two-thirds approval by the Senate. Mr. Obama and Senate Democrats maneuvered the Iran deal as an ‘executive agreement,’ so he is able to commit America to trusting the Ayatollahs with the support of a mere partisan minority. At least ObamaCare had a partisan majority,” notes the Journal.

Also today, Daniel Henninger explains why much of the Obama crowd wants Joe Biden to run, and Karl Rove explains why Hillary Clinton could lose both Iowa and New Hampshire.

"Trump, RNC leader meet on pledge",http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/donald-trump-2016-rnc-pledge-meeting/index.html,cnn,"New York (CNN)Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus arrived at Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan on Thursday around 1:35 p.m. for a private meeting with GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump.

On the agenda: whether Trump will sign an RNC pledge ruling out a future third-party run.

Trump has enjoyed a sustained lead in national polls, and the sit-down with Priebus comes amid unease about whether the billionaire businessman would rebuff the party and seek the White House as an independent. Though he's expressed a strong preference for running as a Republican, Trump has yet to definitively rule out a third-party run.

RNC officials began circulating a pledge to various GOP presidential campaigns this week, measuring up how much appetite there is in the field to commit to supporting the eventual nominee.

""I, ________, affirm that if I do not win the 2016 Republican nomination for President of the United States I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is,"" it reads.

RELATED: Source says Trump likely to rule out independent bid

The pledge continues: ""I further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party.""

Sources familiar with the discussions said Wednesday that all signs indicate Trump will sign the paper. And advisers to the candidate have said all along that Trump was never seriously interested in launching an independent run, which is an arduous -- and costly -- process.

The pledge is not only putting pressure on Trump to commit to the party, it's also forcing some of his rivals to promise to support Trump if he were to clinch the GOP nomination.

It's a particularly uncomfortable position for a candidate like Jeb Bush, who in recent weeks has publicly clashed with Trump. The two men have released attack videos on social media, and openly criticized one another on the trail.

On ABC's ""Good Morning America"" Thursday morning, Bush lashed out at Trump again, saying, ""I think Donald Trump is trying to insult his way to the presidency and it's not going to work.""

However, pressed on whether he would support Trump if he were to become the nominee, the former Florida governor answered in the affirmative.

""Yes, I would, of course. We need to be unified. We need to win,"" Bush said.

Meanwhile, others are raising questions about just how enforceable a loyalty pledge is.

""You're right, it's unenforceable,"" said Carly Fiorina on CNN's ""New Day."" ""It is, more than anything else, your word.""",0.9999999555825847
Normally loquacious Biden hits the road but stays mum on 2016,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/JFspO2hOSe0/story01.htm,reuters,"MIAMi, Fla When you are Joe Biden, it's not easy being quiet.

While the normally loquacious vice president got the feel and taste for the campaign trail during a two-day trip to the political battleground of Florida, he really didn't want to talk about it.

On his first public trip since he began pondering whether to jump into the presidential race, Biden ignored reporters’ shouted questions about his plans and poked fun at the booming media interest in him.

He defended President Barack Obama's nuclear deal with Iran and backed policies to ease economic equality and help the middle class in speeches that would have fit nicely at a Democratic campaign rally.

Biden remained as garrulous as ever. He told Jewish leaders at a gathering on Thursday that he would speak for 10 minutes and then take questions.

He wrapped up more than 40 minutes later, drawing a laugh after promising several times he was making his ""last point.""""I know I've said that a few times,"" he said.Each step of the campaign-style trip, which also featured a Democratic fundraiser and concludes with a foreign policy speech in Atlanta on Thursday night, has been overshadowed by the overriding question: Will he or won't he launch a challenge to former Senate and Cabinet colleague Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Biden joked about his newfound celebrity status, acknowledging that the dozens of camera crews and reporters who greeted him at a Miami community college were not there for his planned talk on education initiatives.

""Their interest in community colleges impresses me,"" he joked to students, gesturing to the media mob. ""I hope that's what they're going to write about.""

The timing of the trip ramped up speculation about his intentions and opened up even his most innocent comments to new interpretations - a potentially dangerous trend for a man known for his verbal gaffes.

""People who aren't willing to risk failure never succeed,"" Biden said during the education speech, in what could be the motto for his deliberations on whether to run for the White House.

Earlier, on a tour of a biotech lab at the college, he told one of the students he preferred to watch rather than help with her experiment.

""I can see the press headline: 'Biden screws up experiment,'"" he said.

Biden, 72, has been huddling with advisers for weeks to determine whether he will challenge Clinton, who has seen her favorability ratings plummet from the fallout over her use of a private email server while working as the nation's top diplomat.

On a conference call with Democratic National Committee members last week, Biden said he was still trying to see if he had the energy and commitment for a campaign. He has been recovering from the death of his son, former Delaware attorney general Beau Biden, from cancer in May.

But his travel schedule is picking up as he nears a decision, with trips to Pittsburgh and an appearance on Stephen Colbert’s talk show scheduled next week.

His trip to south Florida, a Democratic enclave in one of the biggest presidential battleground states, included a fundraiser for the Democratic Senate campaign committee. But Biden didn't even address a possible run, or get asked about it, during that private event, participants said.

And he ignored a well wisher who had some advice for him after his education speech. ""Run, Joe!"" he yelled.

Biden didn't respond.

Gretchen's Take: Will he or won't he? Trump's bid decision,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/IAfTaPZrrSw/gretchens-take-will-or-wont-trumps-bid-decision.html,fox,"Will he or won't he?

GOP front-runner Donald Trump has a big decision to make today. Trump will meet with RNC chair Reince Preibus in New York City about signing the ""pledge"" to promise to support the Republican nominee for president (if it is not Trump) and more importantly for the RNC -- pledge to not run as a third party candidate.

Every other GOP candidate in the field has vowed to sign the pledge or has done so already -- but why wouldn't they? None have the bravado of a Trump to make any kind of a case as an independent voice.

So will Trump do it? I say yes -- especially with Dr. Ben Carson now tied with him for first place at 23 percent in the latest poll out of Iowa.

I also think signing the pledge takes a huge hit away from other candidates at the next GOP debate in two weeks.

If Trump doesn't sign the pledge they could have gone after him for not being a true Republican and handing the election to the Democrats if he decided to run as an independent.

But -- Donald Trump is always full of surprises and defies conventional wisdom almost daily.

Be sure to tune into ""The Real Story"" today at 2 ET to hear Trump himself with his decision.

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) The campaign of presidential hopeful Martin O’Malley has made several unsuccessful overtures to rival Bernie Sanders’s camp in recent weeks to jointly buck the Democratic National Committee’s schedule of six debates. In private conversations, confirmed by aides to both candidates, O’Malley representatives have suggested that both Sanders and O’Malley agree to accept invitations to debates not sanctioned by the DNC in a bid to open up the process, which O’Malley last week characterized as being “rigged” to limit the exposure of front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton. The DNC has threatened to exclude candidates from its debates if they take part in a non-sanctioned gathering. But aides to O’Malley, the former Maryland governor, say they are skeptical of the threat, particularly if Sanders and O’Malley stand up together against the DNC. [O’Malley blasts Democratic leaders for ‘rigged’ 2016 debate process] Though Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont, has been vocal about wanting more debates, aides say his campaign is more reticent to cross the DNC, reasoning that a chance to appear with O'Malley and other lower-polling Democrats is not worth the risk of losing his shots on stage with Clinton. Recent polling has shown Sanders with an apparent lead over Clinton in New Hampshire and closing in on her in Iowa. O'Malley remains mired in the single digits in both early nominating states. ""At the end of the day, I do want to be on the stage with Hillary Clinton,"" Sanders said in an interview last week. Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said Thursday that the campaign’s thinking has not changed in recent days, emphasizing that Sanders would like there to be more debates in which all the Democratic candidates participate [Sanders to Democratic Party elite: Consider me, not Hillary Clinton] Briggs said Sanders would also like to debate Republican candidates, a dynamic that could highlight differences between the competing agendas of the major parties without running afoul of DNC debate rules. O’Malley aides suggest that if both O'Malley and Sanders agree to take part in other debates, it is unlikely that Clinton would skip the gathering. DNC officials defend the debate schedule as a sufficient opportunity to size up candidates against one another, noting that multiple groups will also be hosting less formal forums. Critics of the schedule note that only four of the six debates are scheduled to occur before the Iowa caucuses. On Thursday, DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz declined to answer several questions from reporters on the subject following a meeting she hosted between Vice President Biden and prominent Jewish activists and Democratic donors at a Jewish community center in Davie, Fla. She said she was appearing there only in her role as a Florida congresswoman. O’Malley aides say they have also been heartened by what appears to be growing pressure on the DNC from a variety of sources to open up the schedule. A grass-roots group, for example, has been formed to pressure the party for more debates and plans a demonstration later this month outside DNC headquarters in Washington. [O’Malley forwards a ‘flattering’ Clinton e-mail in an attempt to make a point] O'Malley has made the cry for more debates part of his pitch on the campaign trail for a few weeks now. During an appearance in Hollis, N.H., last week, for example, he told his audience at a house party that Democratic debates would be an effective way to advance issues important to the middle class that are getting drowned out by all the media attention on the Republicans. ""What is our message in the Democratic party?"" O'Malley said. ""It seems our brand is what did Hillary Clinton know about her e-mails and when did she know it, and did she wipe her server or did she not?""

Jeb Bush to unveil tax proposals,http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/jeb-bush-tax-proposals-north-carolina-2016/index.html,cnn,"Hampton, New Hampshire (CNN)Jeb Bush will announce his tax plan next week in Raleigh, North Carolina, the former Florida governor said Thursday.

Speaking in Hampton, New Hampshire, Bush said he'll lay out his tax proposals next Wednesday. The speech marks the next phase of a series of policy address he's already given on government reform and foreign policy.

While he didn't unveil specific details about his plan, he said he wants to lower corporate and personal rates ""as low as you possibly can, eliminating as many of the deductions as you can.""

""The tax code is rife with all sorts of deductions and credits that make people feel compelled to kind of follow the script rather than say I want to invest in this business cause I know if I take recycled plastic bottles and use the right technology with the right workers, that we can out compete China,"" he said.

His remarks came during a campaign event at Foss Manufacturing, which creates polyester fiber out of recycled plastic PET bottles.

""If you create a system where you're providing real incentive to capital investment that you are going to create higher wage jobs and that should be the objective,"" he said.

Bush also drew a contrast with Donald Trump, who favors raising taxes on the wealthy.

Bush spokeswoman Allie Bradenburger said next week's event will take place at Morris & Associates in North Carolina.

""Morris is the sort of small manufacturer that will benefit from Governor Bush's economic policies that will foster an environment to create 19 million news jobs and raise middle-class incomes,"" she said.",0.93819739960048054

"Hillary Clinton's email controversy, explained",http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/hillary-clinton-email-controversy-explained-2016/index.html,cnn,"Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton's email controversy is older than her 2016 presidential campaign -- and it's been forced into the headlines again Thursday and Friday when two top aides testify behind closed doors for a House committee.

The former secretary of state's use of a private email server might not have been broken laws, particularly if her claims that she never knowingly shared information that was classified at the time holds true.

But the Justice Department's investigation, the State Department's processing and release of her emails, a House panel's separate investigation and dozens of impending lawsuits are weighing on the 2016 Democratic presidential front-runner's campaign.

Here's what's happened so far:

News broke in March that Clinton used personal email addresses connected to a privately-owned server, rather than a government email, during her four years as President Barack Obama's first-term secretary of state.

Some previous secretaries of state -- including Colin Powell -- have also used private email accounts, but Clinton's approach was particularly controversial because it's out of step with typical government practice now and gave Clinton a major measure of control over what remains private and what's public.

Clinton's lawyers turned over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department, and the department has since processed those -- releasing some, under a judge's orders, at the end of each month.

But she didn't hand in the server itself until last month, after five months of intense scrutiny over whether she flouted transparency laws or put government secrets at risk.

Clinton has chalked it all up to convenience, saying she preferred not to carry two phones -- one with a personal email address and one with a work email.

There's some legitimacy to that: Government BlackBerrys could only include one address.

But having her own personal server also gave Clinton -- as well as her closest aides -- much greater control over which emails were accessible under public records requests.

Clinton acknowledged, both in March when her private email use was first reported and again in Iowa last month, that it ""clearly wasn't the best choice"" to skip using a government email address.

It's mostly innocuous -- with Clinton asking for scheduling updates, fitting in trips to her hair stylist, checking on a strange trade dispute over gefilte fish and receiving notes about the balance of a career and a family from a top policy aide.

But the emails also offer insight into Clinton's closest contacts. Among them: Sidney Blumenthal, who sent what Clinton has said were unsolicited -- yet were clearly warmly received -- notes with advice and guidance on domestic and international politics.

Many of the emails are, in part or in full, redacted. That makes it tough to tell what behind-the-scenes policy conversations were taking place as Clinton navigated tricky international waters.

Of the 7,000 emails released by the State Department this week, 125 were retroactively classified.

There are laws intended to keep government records transparent -- but one that requires officials to transfer emails sent to private addresses onto government servers wasn't enacted until 2014, after Clinton departed the State Department.

Still, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan suggested last month that Clinton violated government policy and made the process of responding to open records requests more difficult.

""We wouldn't be here today if this employee had followed government policy,"" he said at a hearing on one of the dozens of lawsuits over Clinton's emails.

Looming larger is the question of how classified information was handled -- the subject of a Justice Department investigation and the question that ultimately forced Clinton to turn over her private server to the FBI.

Clinton has insisted she never sent or received information that was classified at the time -- though many of her emails have been classified retroactively as the State Department has prepared them for release.

Probably not, said Anne M. Tomkins, the former U.S. attorney who oversaw the prosecution of Gen. David Petraeus over his having showed classified materials to his mistress and biographer.

Tomkins wrote this week in USA Today that Clinton committed no crime because she didn't ""knowingly"" share classified materials.

""Clinton is not being investigated for knowingly sending or receiving classified materials improperly,"" Tomkins wrote.

""Indeed, the State Department has confirmed that none of the information that has surfaced on Clinton's server thus far was classified at the time it was sent or received,"" she wrote. ""Additionally, the Justice Department indicated that its inquiry is not a criminal one and that Clinton is not the subject of the inquiry.""

All government agencies are responsible for determining which of their own materials are classified.

But Clinton's emails are being reviewed by a team of about 12 interagency officials, who are making recommendations on what should and shouldn't be classified.

State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters in August that ""there's an exhaustive, extensive review process for each and every email, which includes not just State Department reviewers going through them but having intelligence community reviewers with us at the time as we go through them in real-time to help make determinations.""

Kirby added, ""Some of those determinations are fairly easy -- yes or no. Some of them require additional review and discussion.""

It's not just the State Department's email releases forcing fresh headlines about the issue.

The House's Benghazi committee chaired by Rep. Trey Gowdy is calling two top Clinton aides in for closed-door depositions this week. Cheryl Mills, Clinton's State Department chief of staff, will appear Thursday, while policy adviser Jake Sullivan is expected Friday.

Another former State Department employee Bryan Pagliano who worked on Clinton's private email server has informed Congress that he will invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid testifying before the House Select Committee.

Clinton herself will appear before the committee for an open hearing -- one likely to attract the most television cameras of any congressional hearing in recent memory -- on Oct. 22.

There are also dozens of lawsuits seeking Clinton's emails. They range from news organizations like Gawker and The Associated Press to conservative groups like Judicial Watch.

The State Department said Tuesday that it will ask for all of those lawsuits to be consolidated under a single judge.

Among Clinton's biggest challenges in the presidential race is demonstrating her authenticity -- and part of that is showing voters she's trustworthy.

Increasingly, though, voters say they distrust Clinton. The numbers have shifted dramatically since news of her private email server was first reported in March.

Her campaign has shifted tactics in recent weeks, dropping the jokes Clinton had cracked about what she'd once portrayed as a non-issue and sending aides out in an attempt to diffuse the issue in television appearances -- signaling that it's an increasingly serious challenge.",0.99967737470474594
Bush confronted by voter over immigration,http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/jeb-bush-voter-confrontation-immigration/index.html,cnn,"Hampton, New Hampshire (CNN)Just minutes after Jeb Bush bashed Donald Trump in his stump speech on Thursday, Bush was questioned by a frustrated voter on what he would do about illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border.

In the six-minute exchange that grew tense at times, the former Florida governor was asked why he didn't support the idea of cutting off aid or other funds to Mexico until the country does more to stop illegal crossings into the United States.

""They don't do anything about the border. We're being defensive. Why don't we be offensive for once?"" the voter asked, echoing sentiments that have been trumpeted by Trump.

He described himself as ""pissed off"" about the flood of undocumented immigrants and argued that ""they're all criminals because they are breaking the law.""

""(Mexico) should enforce their Southern border -- that I agree with,"" Bush responded, pointing out that most undocumented immigrants who have streamed into the U.S. in recent years have come from Central America.

But Bush argued that a ""wall won't solve this problem.""

RELATED: Jeb Bush to unveil tax proposals next week

While he conceded it makes sense to have a wall in urban areas like in between Juarez and El Paso, Texas, or by San Diego, California, there are other places where it doesn't make sense.

""The notion that another country is going to pay for a wall that we're building is just ludicrous beyond belief,"" he said, referring to Trump's proposal.

Bush went on to lay out his immigration plan, saying he would use technologies at the border to help detect illegal crossings and pointed to his own experience as a ""border governor"" because of migrants who came from the Caribbean to Florida.

He reiterated that he supports earned legal status for those that are already in the country illegally if they meet certain criteria.

The voter, however, argued that the government has already been granting amnesty to too many people.

""You tell me if this is amnesty,"" Bush said, before launching into the requirements he would enforce for anyone wanting legal status.

""You come out from the shadows. You receive a provisional work permit. You pay taxes. You don't receive federal government assistance. You learn English ...You work,"" he said. ""You don't commit crimes ... You earn legal status, not citizenship. That, to me, is the most practical way of dealing with this problem.""

Bush also found himself on defense, standing by his position that most immigrants come to the country out of good intentions -- a position that Trump attacked him on this week with an Instagram video.

""99% of people that come across the border ... are coming to provide for their families. The ones that are criminals, we ought to be kick them out. There's no disagreement about that,"" Bush said. ""To ascribe bad motives people who are trying to provide for their families, I'm not going to change my views on that.""

Earlier in the event, Bush described Trump as a doomsayer who espouses ""pessimistic"" views that are dividing the country by preying on peoples' ""angst and fears.""

""Donald Trump's view is that the end is near,"" Bush said. ""His pessimistic view is let's close the borders, let's create tariffs, let's do this, let's do that--all based on negativity, and the net result is all of us will suffer if that philosophy gains favor.""

His comments come as Bush has stepped up his attacks against his Republican rival.

Bush spent considerable time explaining how the two candidates differ not only on immigration, but on taxes and health care.

""Whatever the issue is, there is one path that is aspirational and hopeful, and there is one path that is negative, and it is not the right path for this country,"" he said. ""So here I am.""

The former governor also ripped into President Barack Obama and Democrats for making immigration a wedge issue.

""You're angry. I'm frustrated. A bunch of people are angry. The left loves it,"" he told the voter. ""They don't care about fixing this problem. President Barack Obama could have fixed this his first year in office...he didn't even lift a finger to do it 'cause they want to win elections.""

Mike Allen's must-read briefing on what's driving the day in Washington

09/03/15, 08:40 AM EDT

By Mike Allen (@mikeallen; mallen@politico.com) and Daniel Lippman (@dlippman; dlippman@politico.com)

Good Thursday morning. DRIVING THE DAY: RNC Chair Reince Priebus and chief strategist Sean Spicer meet Trump after 1 p.m. at Trump Tower, ahead of a 2 p.m. presser by The Donald. Speculation is that Priebus hopes to seal the deal on a loyalty pledge – no third-party run – that the RNC circulated yesterday, as first reported by Politico’s Alex Isenstadt. The RNC waited to push the pledge until it looked like Trump was on board.

What’s in it for Trump? If he were the nominee, the others would have to support HIM!

Asked if Trump is expected to sign the pledge, campaign manager Corey Lewandowski tells Playbook: “I don’t think you can ‘expect’ ANYTHING from Mr. Trump.” Asked if he assumes Trump will sign the pledge, Lewandowski parried: “I don’t assume ANYTHING, anymore.” As for the topic of the presser, “I don’t get out in front of my boss. ... He hasn’t said.” Wonder if there’ll be any coverage?

Hillary Clinton will sit down with veteran NBC News correspondent Andrea Mitchell on Friday for the third national interview of her presidential campaign.

The exclusive interview, which will first air on Mitchell's 12 p.m. MSNBC program, comes one day ahead of the 20th anniversary of Clinton's Beijing speech on women’s rights, which Mitchell covered for the network in 1995.

""Mitchell will ask the former Secretary of State about her presidential campaign, the GOP field, her email controversy"" as well as the Beijing speech, NBC News said in a press release.

The interview comes amid ongoing scrutiny over Clinton's limited media availability. In her nearly five-month-long campaign, the candidate has given just two national television news interviews -- one in English (with CNN), one in Spanish (with Univision) -- despite promises from both her and her campaign that she intended to do more.

Last month, amid renewed criticisms, Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon told the On Media blog that there would be ""more interviews to come,"" but pointed only to an interview with daytime talk show host Ellen DeGeneres as evidence of that commitment.

As far as actual news interviews go, Mitchell is an obvious choice for Clinton. In addition to being present in Beijing in 1995, the chief foreign affairs correspondent covered Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign, the Clinton White House, and Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State.

Josh Gerstein on the Courts, Transparency, & More

09/03/15, 12:44 PM EDT

The Justice Department is unlikely to succeed in its new effort to put dozens of Freedom of Information Act lawsuits related to Hillary Clinton's emails in front of a single judge, one judge handling such a case suggested Thursday.

""I don't know how successful you will be,"" U.S. District Court Judge Reggie Walton said during a hearing on a suit brought by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch. ""Some information I've heard indicates there may be a reluctance on the part of judges to go along with that because [some cases] are so far along"" in the process, Walton added.

The Justice Department filed a motion Wednesday night (posted here) asking that a ""coordinating judge"" manage schedules for production and preservation of records in at least 32 pending FOIA lawsuits where plaintiffs are seeking or may be entitled to documents from the set of 54,000 pages of emails former Secretary of State Clinton returned to State last year or other sets of records former Clinton State Department aides Cheryl Mills, Jacob Sullivan, Huma Abedin, and Philippe Reines returned in recent months in response to agency requests.

Justice Department lawyers directed the motion to Judge Richard W. Roberts, the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington. They argue that similar coordination has taken place in the past, namely in a flood of hundreds of cases involving Guantanamo detainees challegning the legality of their detention.

However, Walton said he was unsure whether judges could be forced to submit to what the government is proposing.

""I don't know if anybody, even the chief judge, would have the authority to order us to do that,"" Walton said.

Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Shapiro said the move was an effort help the State Department cope with a flurry of lawsuits filed or reactivated after Clinton's use of a personal email server was revealed in March. She also said at least two judges on the court, Emmet Sullivan and Rudolph Contreras, had urged the Justice Department to take steps to coordinate or consolidate the cases.

""We filed that with the hope it will will bring some order to what is a a chaotic situation,"" Shapiro said. ""They [State Department officials] are struggling to keep up with the obligations that they have.""

The comments came at a hearing on a Judicial Watch case filed in 2012 that sought records about TV advertisements aired in Pakistan featuring Clinton and President Barack Obama criticizing an anti-Islam film initially blamed for the deadly attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi earlier that year. The case was closed in November 2014 but reopened in May of this year to address the emails Clinton exchanged and kept on her private server.

Last month, Clinton's server was turned over to the FBI, which is investigating potential breaches of classified information related to the former secretary's email system.

Shapiro said in court that the State Department sent a letter Wednesday to the FBI asking for copies of any official State Department records the law enforcement agency finds on the Clinton server. The action was taken to comply with an order Judge Sullivan issued two weeks ago in connection with another FOIA case.

However, Judicial Watch attorney Chris Fedeli asked Walton to take additional steps to address the more than 31,000 emails Clinton has said she ordered deleted after her lawyers determined the messages were purely personal in nature. He said it's possible those messages still exist either in the possession of Clinton attorney David Kendall, on back-up servers maintained by a tech company Clinton hired, Platte River Networks, or perhaps even on State Department systems.

""No one has said these 31,000 emails don't exist anywhere in the world,"" Fedeli said. ""We do think it's reasonable to believe those emails exist.""

When Shapiro dismissed as ""wild speculation"" Fedeli's suggestions about more copies of the deleted email, Walton suggested that the messy situation was Clinton's fault because she relied on the personal server for official business.

""Unfortunately, if this private server had not been used, we would not be in this situation,"" the judge said.

Walton also appeared to reject Shapiro's suggestion that the court defer to Clinton's determination--some 22 months after she left office--about which records were official and which were personal.

""We're not sure exactly what type of evaluation was made of that 31,000"" messages,"" the judge said.

Fedeli noted that the government cannot escape its FOIA obligations by transferring records to a contractor and he argued Clinton's action was akin to that. But Walton said the records were not transferred out of the government, but never placed in official systems in the first place.

""This is sort of a unique situation,"" the judge said. ""The State Department never had possession of these records.""

Walton said he would rule by next week on Judicial Watch's proposal for an order requiring the State Department to reach out to Kendall and Platte River to confirm whether any back up copies of Clinton's purportedly personal emails exist.

Larry Lessig hits the presidential campaign trail,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/03/larry-lessig-just-hit-the-presidential-campaign-trail/,washpo,"He's running. (Courtesy Lessig Equal Citizens Exploratory Committee) SALEM, N.H. -- Larry Lessig has been a Harvard Law professor, an author, an copyright innovator, and the leader of an anti-corruption ""super PAC to end super PACs."" On Wednesday night, he took on a new role: A potential candidate for president, taking a whack at a rival. Standing in an Italian restaurant's dining room, addressing two dozen local Democratic activists, Lessig argued that his Citizens Equality Amendment was the best weapon the party could take into the 2016 election. ""We have an extraordinary opportunity right now to claim a big idea that America can rally around,"" said Lessig, ""as opposed to the idea that everyone should have equal wealth. I agree with Bernie Sanders about that -- there is a terrible inequality in our society. But the reality is, in America, if you stand up and say we become Sweden, America is not going to rally around you. As much as I wish we would, that's not America. But if you stand up and say, citizens should be equal, who is on the other side of that?"" The crowd was not initially on his side. Lessig made a late, surprise entry into the presidential race, saying that he would run to become ""the first referendum president"" -- winning, passing his reform bill, then resigning -- if he raised $1 million by September 8. By the time he said that, a wave had already built behind the democratic socialist presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Sure, Lessig had literally walked through New Hampshire to raise awareness of campaign finance reform. In conversations, many of the Salem Democrats said they'd already gotten behind the Vermont senator. But Lessig, who said he had raised ""around $750,000"" of the needed Kickstarter funds, got a friendly reception. He showed up for his first New Hampshire event since the announcement in his standard traveling TED Talk outfit of black blazer, black pants and blue shirt, fiddled with a temperamental microphone, and got plenty of polite admiration. ""It was fun,"" said Cecilia Cassidy, 66. ""It was like a free lecture at Harvard Law School."" Lessig had a tougher time selling Democrats on the one-term pledge, especially as he praised everyone else running -- even Hillary Clinton. ""I think it's very promising, and it's very clear what his goals are,"" said Valerine Roman, 59. ""Whether he can actually run for president, I'm not sure. He would win, and then resign? I haven't lived my life to watch that sort of thing happen."" [Lawrence Lessig wants to run for president -- in a most unconventional way] Lessig spoke and took questions for an hour, and the topic rarely moved from campaign finance reform. A Monday trip to Ferguson, Missouri, taught Lessig that too many people were being ruined by petty fines, ""taxation by citation,"" and the lesson was that ""the people who pay the taxes are not effectively represented."" The almost-candidate cautioned Democrats not to blame all the ills of the system on the 2011 Citizens United decision. ""Democracy was already dead by then,"" Lessig said. ""The Supreme Court might have shot the body, but the body was already cold."" Everything came back to political money, and the failure of current candidates to address it before they addressed anything else. Lessig noted that former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley had issued a 15-point itinerary for a first presidential term, and ""campaign reform came in at number 15."" Exactly wrong, said Lessig. ""Bernie Sanders put it at number eight on his list,"" he added, ""and after we made our announcement it went to number two. Okay. That was a little better."" On the way into the speech, Lessig had noticed a Donald Trump bumper sticker on someone's car. The owner of the car, a man unironically wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" baseball cap, occasionally ambled over to the open dining room to hear what the fuss was about. ""I'll say this about Donald Trump,"" said Lessig. ""As much as I think his views about immigrants are vile -- immigrants are some of the hardest-working people in our country, and in my view they should be citizens -- and his views about women are outrageous; when he stands on the Republican debate stage and says 'I own you guys,' Republicans begin to acknowledge that this money is corrupting our democracy. That is progress. That is hopeful."" At 8 p.m., an hour after the presentation started, Lessig apologized -- he had to make a 9:30 train from Boston to New York. On the way to a car, accompanied by a single aide, Lessig gave a positive assessment of his audience, and said they'd proved Brookings Institution scholar Thomas Mann wrong. ""I thought that they were right there with every step,"" he said. ""They could see the value of talking about this in a more fundamental and elevated wall.

"Committee grills Clinton aides, ramps up email scrutiny",http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/hillary-clinton-bryan-pagliano-cheryl-mills/index.html,cnn,"Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton says her use of a private email server didn't break the law -- but she could be damaged by a former State Department employee's refusal to testify before Congress about it.

Two of Clinton's top State Department staffers, chief of staff Cheryl Mills and policy aide Jake Sullivan, are answering questions behind closed doors Thursday and Friday from the House's committee investigating Benghazi.

But Bryan Pagliano, who worked on Clinton's private email server, tried to fend off a subpoena by telling lawmakers Monday that he'll invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination rather testify.

In doing so, he raised the specter of criminal actions -- even if only out of caution.

That could create a fresh opening for Clinton's opponents in the 2016 presidential race to attack her, this time citing a former staffer's actions rather than leveling their own charges, like Donald Trump's suggestion that the controversy surrounding Clinton's emails could force the end of her campaign.

Clinton's aides sought to minimize the damage, saying they'd encouraged Pagliano to testify because he has nothing to hide.

RELATED: Former Clinton aide expected to plead the 5th

""We had hoped Bryan would also agree to answer any questions from the committee, and had recently encouraged him to grant the committee's request for an interview,"" a Clinton aide told CNN.

""Bryan is an utter professional and a wonderful young man who does not live in the public eye and understandably may not wish to be drawn into a political spectacle,"" the aide said. ""So his decision is both understandable and yet also disappointing to us, because we believe he has every reason to be transparent about his IT assistance.""

A Clinton aide said full cooperation has been encouraged with the Benghazi investigation.

""From the beginning, Hillary Clinton has continued to encourage cooperation even as the committee's inquiry has ventured beyond the events at Benghazi, which had been the original scope of its mandate, to also include her use of a personal email account,"" a Clinton aide said. ""Already, several of Clinton's senior-most aides from the State Department are scheduled to give interviews to the committee, as Clinton herself will do at an open hearing in October.""

Even without Pagliano's testimony, the House panel will hold several hearings connected to Clinton's private email server.

Mills is on Capitol Hill on Thursday, and Sullivan is due Friday. Both hearings are private -- a decision made by the committee's chairman, Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, despite Mills' request for hers to be made public amid fears that Republicans will selectively leak bits and pieces.

""We have not had a public interview with any other witness, and is there a myriad of reasons for that ... not the least of which is, if you're serious about getting the most amount of information, you're going to do it in a transcribed interview session not a public session,"" Gowdy told reporters Thursday outside the hearing room.

The committee's top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings, disagreed with Gowdy's decision and said he hoped that her entire transcript would be released immediately.

""This has turned into a derail Clinton mission,"" he said just outside the hearing room. ""$4 million in taxpayer money spent, and not looking at the issues we should be looking at.""

Clinton herself is due to answer the committee's questions publicly on October 22.

The contents of Clinton's emails have increasingly come into the committee's focus as it seeks evidence that members argue might have been deleted from a private server, but would have been maintained had Clinton used a government email account.

The committee's meetings with Clinton and her aides come as the Justice Department investigates whether Clinton's emails contained classified information -- and whether that information was kept secure.

Clinton has insisted she never sent or received information that was classified at the time -- though many of her emails have been classified retroactively as the State Department has prepared them for release.

Responding to dozens of open records requests, the department is releasing new batches of emails at the end of each month.

Before Clinton's emails are released, though, they are being reviewed by a team of about 12 inter-agency officials, who are making recommendations on what should and shouldn't be classified.

State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters in August that ""there's an exhaustive, extensive review process for each and every email, which includes not just State Department reviewers going through them but having intelligence community reviewers with us at the time as we go through them in real-time to help make determinations.

""Some of those determinations are fairly easy -- yes or no. Some of them require additional review and discussion,"" Kirby said.

Legion of Tech Volunteers Lead a Charge for Bernie Sanders,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/us/politics/bernie-sanders-presidential-campaign-tech-supporters.html,nyt,"Dawn crept into Daniela Perdomo’s Brooklyn apartment, her bleary eyes still focused on her bright computer screen. The founder of a nearly three-year-old communications start-up, she had been up all night again, orchestrating the work of more than 100 other developers, web designers, researchers and writers.

But they were not working for Ms. Perdomo’s company. They were not even getting paid. Instead, the all-night sessions were devoted to the Aug. 12 unveiling of FeeltheBern.org — a website they created to explain Bernie Sanders’s positions on issues in the 2016 presidential campaign.

Throughout the summer, a largely unseen legion of technology professionals across the country — software developers and designers, product managers and more — have been moonlighting online on Mr. Sanders’s behalf. They have been applying their initiative, creativity, organizational skills and, above all, technical prowess in their off hours to support an underdog candidate who has been more than grateful for the help.

They have built interactive maps of campaign events and are working on an automated flier generator to spit out polished promotional materials with a few clicks. They have set up an app to let volunteers and staff members at Mr. Sanders’s huge rallies use iPads to collect donations by swiping supporters’ credit cards. They have pioneered a tool to pair volunteers with lists of voters to call, automating what otherwise requires many paid campaign workers. And they have built dozens of websites for supporters of Mr. Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, like Ms. Perdomo’s FeeltheBern.org.

Like so many online minutemen, they have given Mr. Sanders an enormous lift in his campaign for the Democratic nomination. But this is no ragtag militia: The people who have enlisted include top-flight digital talent.

“It really blows me away,” Mr. Sanders said of the coders donating their services. “The volunteers we’ve mobilized all over this country, especially all the young people, are helping our campaign move to the next level.”

Indeed, while every political campaign relies on the enthusiasm of youthful volunteers, Mr. Sanders has quickly — and effortlessly — tapped into an unexpectedly large and capable cadre of computer jockeys with years and years of experience. They came forward of their own volition, with hundreds joining a Coders for Sanders thread on Reddit. And they organized themselves so thoroughly that one built an Internet “bot” to help match newcomers to tasks appropriate to their skills.

They are a diverse bunch, too: Ms. Perdomo said FeeltheBern.org grew to 125 volunteers “from every demographic I could imagine.” They include former aides to Mitt Romney, self-described libertarians, high school students (“Because I’m young, I can’t vote, so this is a great way to get involved,” said Justin Zheng, 14, of San Mateo, Calif.) and even an Australian programmer, Jordie Bodlay, who said that a Sanders administration would indirectly improve his own life in Sydney. Nearly everyone interviewed had never been politically involved before, and most cited Mr. Sanders’s views on issues like income inequality or his unconventional style of campaigning.

Most are younger than 35, members of the so-called millennial generation, one that has been dismissed at times as too focused on “hashtag activism,” lazily posting harangues on social media while shying away from the difficult work of organizing. But several who described themselves as introverted to begin with said the chance to do valuable political work from the sanctuary of their computers was irresistible.

“When the opportunity came along to do something I love doing anyway, to make a difference somewhere, I’ll always jump on that boat,” said Rob Pieta, 23, a mobile developer in Illinois.

Kenneth Pennington, the digital director for the Sanders campaign, said features like the donation app, which incorporates the Square credit card processing software, were “the kind of tech that other organizations would pay expensive app developers for.”

But Federal Election Commission regulations treat donated tech work like “the 21st-century equivalent of having volunteers build a stage for a campaign event,” said Brett G. Kappel, a partner at the law firm Akerman LLP and an expert on campaign law. “As long as the volunteers aren’t compensated for their services by anyone, their work is not considered an in-kind contribution.”

Other gifts to the Sanders campaign that could have cost tens of thousands of dollars on the open market include a custom interactive map of events and rallies, which wound up on the campaign website to promote a national organizing day and continues to be highlighted there.

“They asked, ‘What do you want for it?’ and I said, ‘Nothing,’ ” said Ralph Castillo, a software engineer from Queens who built the map over one weekend. “ ‘I just want my husband and me to meet Bernie.’ ”

The stampede of coders to Mr. Sanders’s aid can be traced to Kyle Pierce, a mobile software developer who, on a whim, created the Coders for Sanders thread on Reddit in June.

“I have a decent amount of free time, and I can put together a website in a few hours,” Mr. Pierce said. He said he was curious to see if he had much company. Within weeks, hundreds more had joined in.

Their buzzing nerve center is not on Reddit, though, but on Slack, an online chat program popular in the tech world, where the volunteers brainstorm at all hours, ask for help on projects, swap code and design mock-ups.

To help speed the integration of new volunteers, Atticus White, a 26-year-old developer from Boston, built a bot — an app programmed to respond to chat commands — that points users in the right direction. The tuxedo-avatared-app, @butler, begins a conversation with new arrivals (often peppered with an encouraging “Awesome” or “Great”) about their skills and points them toward suitable projects.

Slack is also the volunteers’ pipeline back to the campaign. Sanders aides check in regularly there, offering feedback, encouragement, requests and guidance, like asking those building the flier generator to make sure that union shops were hired to do the printing. Aides also ask that new sites be designed differently from the campaign’s own and include disclaimers saying they have no official tie to Mr. Sanders.

Unaffiliated or not, builders of those websites are free to amplify on Mr. Sanders’s campaign message: “We’re regular people, unassociated with any super PACs or billionaires,” says the fine print at FeeltheBern.org.

Ms. Perdomo said she had been spurred to seek out coders who shared her admiration for Mr. Sanders after she contributed to his campaign and was laughed at. “I was telling friends that I donated this money and they should do it, too, and I got a bunch of L.O.L.’s back saying, ‘He’s great and everything, but I don’t see it happening,’ ” she said.

Her website had more than a million page views in its first two weeks.

As their projects take off, or become absorbed by the Sanders campaign, the coders keep coming back for more. The volunteers who worked with Ms. Perdomo, for example, now are putting together a message board to help people car-pool to campaign events.

“There were too many nights when I would go to sleep with the sun coming up, and I felt like a zombie and would question my sanity,” Ms. Perdomo said with a laugh. “But now, it’s so worth it.”",0.99714927310130486

Entertainment: A Song Inspired by a Bizarre Love Triangle,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/03/t-magazine/unknown-mortal-orchestra-music-video.html,nyt,"The initial concept for the psych-rock trio Unknown Mortal Orchestra’s third full-length album, “Multi-Love,” began with the title. “When I first wrote down the term ‘multi-love,’ I didn’t really know what it meant or why it resonated with me,” frontman Ruban Nielson explains. “But the meaning of it became more complex as the year went on.” Nielson set out to make a “happy record” — a seemingly painless undertaking. But when an unlikely friendship blossomed with a young woman on the road, it evolved into a love triangle between Nielson, his wife and “Woman X” — and complications set in.

The trio lived together for about a year, along with Nielson and his wife’s two children, in the family’s Portland home while Nielson recorded the album — an unlikely fairy tale, which ended when Woman X’s visa ran out and she was forced to leave the country. The anxieties of a long-distance romance, and the limitations of a device-based connection, inspired the song “Can’t Keep Checking My Phone,” the video for which premieres here. “It’s about that moment when you’re sick of waiting for someone to get back to you, so you pretend you don’t have a phone to keep yourself from going crazy,” Nielson says.

On the track, Nielson combines a thousand tiny fragments of sound into a disco-ball mosaic — psychedelic synths, rhythmic funk, electronic beats, lush falsetto — and produces a seductive dance-floor hit. The song inspired the director Dimitri Basil to create a collage of assorted images, like the “Mars Attacks!” trading cards he loved as a child. “The idea was to create a kind of deck based on strange occurrences, syndromes and phenomena,” Basil says. The resulting aesthetic is part sci-fi, part psychological thriller, where the 1950s U.F.O. craze meets “The Twilight Zone” and “The X-Files.” Some of the references are more recognizable: abduction, rapture, gender dysphoria. Others necessitate a Google search: Stendhal syndrome, panphobia, hybristophilia.

More mysterious than the esoteric phenomena illustrated in the video is the concept of love itself, particularly when expanded from one locus of affection into three. Nielson is reluctant to discuss the relationship, but its influence on the record is evident. He seems intent on looking forward and leaving that crazy year behind him. But even after the emotional turmoil he endured during “Multi-Love,” his desire to approach his life and his art from a place of instinct, rather than logic, remains. “I’m always paying close attention to weird coincidences and patterns. I go through phases where I record things that seem significant and build my life and work around that stuff,” Nielson explains. “I make some pretty wild leaps of faith based on vague intuitions.”",0.30659143915068776
First Draft: Ben Carson Shows More Strength in National Poll,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/09/03/ben-carson-shows-more-strength-in-national-poll/,nyt,"A national poll released Thursday gives more confirmation that Ben Carson has developed a head of steam in the Republican field, showing that only Mr. Carson, the retired brain surgeon, outperforms Donald J. Trump in a head-to-head matchup.

Republicans and Republican-leaning likely voters preferred Mr. Carson 55 percent, compared with 36 percent for Mr. Trump, according to the Monmouth University Poll.

“The fact that the only one who can challenge Trump is the only other candidate who has never held or run for elected office speaks volumes to the low regard G.O.P. voters have for the establishment,” Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement.

The poll found Mr. Trump’s overall support still highest when matched against the full Republican field. It rose four percentage points, to 30 percent, since an earlier Monmouth poll before the first debate in early August.

Mr. Carson was in second place in the field, with 18 percent support. Jeb Bush dropped to third since August, with 8 percent, and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin slid to eighth place with 3 percent. Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard executive, doubled her support to 4 percent.

The Monmouth poll is one that CNN will use to determine if Mrs. Fiorina is included in the top-tier debate of Republican candidates in its Sept. 16 debate. She tied for 6th place in the poll, good enough to make the cut.

Mr. Trump continued to lead all rivals among different Republican demographic groups. He was preferred by very conservative voters as well as moderate to liberal ones. He led with Tea Party supporters, with men and with women.

Other findings: Gov. John Kasich of Ohio has seen little movement in his national support since he squeaked onto the main debate stage last month in Cleveland. And Mr. Bush’s favorability has slipped to 41 percent from 52 percent last month.

The poll was conducted by telephone from Aug. 31 to Sept. 2 and has a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points.",0.99983972985182734

MMA fighter seen on video applying a 'triangle choke hold' to man she says tried to rob her,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/world/~3/SYBOP8mT6us/,fox,"The cellphone video cuts in to show a bloodied, screaming man held on the ground by a woman applying a “triangle choke hold.”

Jeb Bush went hard after Trump in New Hampshire.

(REUTERS/Jay Westcott) HAMPTON, NH -- Jeb Bush took his offensive against Republican presidential rival Donald Trump on the road to this early voting state on Thursday, lambasting the real estate mogul's proposals in his opening remarks and defiantly responding to his jeers. He also faced some heat on immigration, Trump's signature issue. Trump has criticized Bush for speaking Spanish on the campaign trail. Bush said Thursday he believed in campaigning with ""brazos abiertos -- with our arms wide open."" Trump has accused Bush of lacking the ""energy"" to be president. Bush vowed to ""wake up each day with passion and conviction to make sure people's pocketbooks are filled with more money."" The former Florida governor also continued his efforts to cast Trump as insufficiently conservative, calling out Trump's previous praise for a single-payer health-care system; impractical, saying Trump's immigration policy ""does not embrace the American values""; and accusing him of fear-mongering, charging that Trump is ""preying on people's fear and angst."" ""My belief is that if we create the right climate, America is going to rise up and lead the world for the next generation of time,"" said Bush. ""Donald Trump's view is that the end is near."" [Inside Jeb Bush's strategy to deflate Donald Trump and court conservatives] Bush presented himself as the much more optimistic alternative. ""Whatever the issue is, there is one path that is aspirational and hopeful and there is one path that is negative and it is not the right path for this country,"" he said. Bush fielded questions on health care, money in politics and immigration, among other things. He said he would unveil more tax ideas on September 9th, and he promised that he was not ""beholden"" to the donors that have funded his campaign. His audience, a mixture of employees of Foss Manufacturing, the company that hosted the town hall, and activists, infrequently interrupted him for applause, and did not react at all to the criticism of Trump. A tracker was quick to capture and upload video of a woman apparently nodding off. And while Trump wasn't in the room, some of Trump's immigration views were represented by Dennis Lamare, 58, an unsuccessful 2010 Republican candidate for Senate. ""Right now there's an air of appeasement,"" said Lamare. ""It's, 'let them come in! Let them go where they want!'"" Bush waited as Lamare laid out a long, immigration restrictionist argument. The candidate then delivered his own familiar plan for earned legal status, before inviting Lamare to follow up. ""What are you going to do about Mexico?"" he asked. ""We’re being defensive! Why don’t we be offensive for once?"" ""They should enforce their southern border,"" said Bush. ""What about the northern border?"" asked Lamare. ""The northern border is not where, in the last five years, immigration has come from,"" said Bush. ""It has not come from Mexico."" Earlier in the day, during a national television interview, Bush responded to Trump's criticism of him speaking Spanish on the campaign trail, saying that he ""laughed"" when he learned about Trump's remarks. ""People come to this country to pursue their dreams,"" Bush said on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" ""Sometimes they start without speaking English, but they learn English and they add vitality to our country. And the fact that he would say that you only can speak English is kind of ridiculous if you think about it. Are we going to close all the foreign language classes? Why would he have a contract with Univision for his beauty pageant?"" Trump called Bush a ""nice man"" in an interview with Breitbart News published Wednesday. But he added that he ""should really set the example by speaking English while in the United States.” When asked whether he would support Trump if he wins the Republican nomination, Bush said, ""of course."" In Hampton, when the town hall ended, Bush stuck around for photos as Foss employees headed back to work. The Trump lines, heavily previewed in the media, did not generate much discussion. ""It's nice to hear people give their views on the problems we have,"" said John Mourikas, 61, who worked at Foss. ""The Trump stuff -- eh, I didn't really listen to that."" And while Lamare appreciated Bush's candor, he left with a clearer view of why he was inclined to support someone else for president. ""For him to attack Trump -- that's his job up there, to separate himself,"" Lamare said after the town hall ended. ""I can't say whether that worked, but he doesn't really have the charisma that one would expect in a setting like this."" Sullivan reported from Washington ",0.99999999999980882
Donald Trump&#8217;s Republican loyalty pledge means almost nothing,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/03/donald-trumps-loyalty-pledge-means-almost-nothing/,washpo,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump listens during a news conference Aug. 27 after speaking at the TD Convention Center  in Greenville, S.C.  (Richard Shiro/AP) At a 2 p.m. news conference Thursday, GOP front-runner Donald Trump is expected to sign a formal pledge crafted by the Republican National Committee that he will not run for president as an independent if he doesn't win the party's nomination. Which is fine. And a good thing for the RNC, which deserves credit for navigating the murky waters of Trumpworld. But  there is absolutely no reason to think that simply by the act of signing this pledge, Trump will somehow be legally bound to not run as anything but a Republican in 2016. He won't be. This pledge is not, as my colleague Bob Costa notes, a legally binding document. It's like the sort of pledge you get your kids to sign that they will do their homework, make their beds and eat their vegetables before they can play with your iPhone.  It's a statement of intention, but not a binding one. Do I think Trump is secretly plotting a third party bid if he winds up not winning the Republican nomination? No, not at present. Do I think that Trump believes that he will be bound by this pledge from running if he decides that's what he wants to do? Absolutely not. What in Trump's relatively short time as a presidential candidate (or much longer time as a person who takes positions on various issues) suggests that he would feel at all compelled to abide by a pledge put together by the head of a party that he is a) only a relatively recent convert to and b) can't really hurt him, financially or otherwise, if he decides to break it? Trump's entire candidacy is premised on how he doesn't owe anyone anything and how no one can tell him what to do.  So, for the moment, it's in Trump's interest to play nice with the GOP establishment -- since it might allay some fears of voters who are thinking about being for him but wonder if he is, actually, one of them. But  if Trump, at any point over the next few months, feels hard done by the GOP establishment -- or if his poll numbers begin to fade -- is there anything in what he will sign today that keeps him from breaking the pledge not to run? No. Yes, Trump would have to answer for his broken pledge among some Republican voters who took him at his word. But  given Trump's anti-establishment message, there would almost certainly be a big chunk of disaffected Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who would likely take his side in a fight with the national party. Point is: This is a good day for the RNC, which is showing its ability to bring some order to what has been a wild race to date. But  don't assume that Donald Trump signing a piece of paper in front of a bunch of cameras is anything more than a nicely-turned bit of political theater. Because, well, it isn't.",0.99999980441955427
State lawmakers deny &#8216;making out&#8217; in car at Minnesota park,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/03/state-lawmakers-deny-making-out-in-car-at-minnesota-park/,washpo,"Rep. Tim Kelly (R-Red Wing) and Rep. Tara Mack (R-Apple Valley). (Minnesota House of Representatives via AP) Last month, a park ranger in Minnesota issued citations to a man and a woman, whom, he reported, were ""making out"" in a car. The reason you're reading about that encounter here, on a Washington Post political blog, is because the man and woman who received the public nuisance citations are Minnesota state lawmakers. They're denying the ranger's account, which was noted in court records. State Reps. Tim Kelly and Tara Mack, both Republicans, were issued citations following an incident that allegedly occurred on Aug. 25 in a park in Eagan, Minn., according to the St. Paul Pioneer Press. [Politician reportedly leaked fake male prostitution e-mails to hide his real affair] ""The two, who are married to other people, were in Lebanon Hills Regional Park in Eagan when they were allegedly spotted by the officer 'making out' in a parked car about 4:30 p.m., according to documents,"" the Pioneer Press reported."" The officer's notes claim Mack was half undressed when he approached the vehicle."" In fact, according to the Pioneer Press, ""the ranger's notes in court records said Mack's pants were unzipped and pulled down."" (You can see images of the citation notes here.) Mack and Kelly issued separate statements about the park ranger's report, with Kelly calling it ""an absolute lie,"" and Mack describing the ranger's statements as ""egregious and false."" ""I was driving down to Red Wing through Eagan last Tuesday and met Rep. Mack to pick up some documents regarding South Country Health Alliance,"" Kelly said in his statement. ""When we met, a park ranger approached my vehicle and told me I was double-parked. I disputed his characterization and got out of the car to take a picture. He became visibly agitated and returned to his own car. ""Approximately ten minutes later, he returned to my vehicle with a parking ticket citing a nuisance. When I asked what that meant, he responded 'whatever I want it to mean.'"" Both Mack and Kelly said they planned to file complaints, though it was unclear Thursday if they had already done so. By Wednesday evening, the Pioneer Press reported, Dakota County Sheriff Tim Leslie hadn't received any. ""He doesn't know these people. He's just doing his job,"" Leslie told NBC affiliate KARE of the ranger who issued the citations. ""That's what park rangers do. They patrol and they look for problems in the parks, and that's what he was doing.""

Wonkblog: Is Chipotle evil?

New Yorkers, en route to work, were likely the first to see it, because it's inaugural imprint was in The New York Post, in the form of a full page advert. And it isn't at all kind to Chipotle. The ad, which features a flexing, overweight male, looking directly into the camera, smiling, almost snidely, clearly mocks the notion that eating at Chipotle is a healthy life choice. ""Eat two 'all natural' Chipotle burritos a week and you could gain 40 pounds in a year,"" the ad says, oozing with sarcasm. At the very top, large block letters read ''Chipotle' Healthy,' in large block letters. This is what it looks like. The link teased in over-sized capital letters, chubbychipotle.com, leads to a single page website. Within it, Chipotle's slogan—'food with integrity'—is altered so it says 'food with hypocrisy' instead; its commitments to sustainability, antibiotic-free meat, and GMO-free food are also disparaged. Sofrito, the website quips at one point, is a word the chain ""made up for tofu."" In all, there are four sections, and each one of them is equally harsh in its treatment, taking issue with distinct facets of Chipotle's messaging. The campaign is being funded by The Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF), which is only apparent once one scrolls to the very bottom of the website. CCF is a non-profit organization, which lobbies on behalf of the food companies. The group's mission is perhaps most clearly evident in those it deems its adversaries. ""A growing cabal of activists has meddled in Americans’ lives in recent years,"" CCF's about section says. ""They include self-anointed “food police,” health campaigners, trial lawyers, personal-finance do-gooders, animal-rights misanthropes, and meddling bureaucrats."" Chipotle, CCF holds, falls firmly into that family of enemy activists. ""A lot of what Chipotle says about its food is based on misconceptions,"" said Will Coggin, who is the director of research at CCF. ""We launched this campaign, because we wanted to take this stuff head on."" Specifically, Coggin points to the chain's self-aggrandizing statements about its food. ""They've built up this idea that somehow their food is better for you, that it's healthier for you,"" he said. ""We're not going to take it."" Chipotle, for its part, is neither surprised by the attack nor impressed by it.

""They're just rehashing things others have been making up about us for years."" ""There's nothing false at all about our advertising or marketing,"" he added. ""But there are legitimate ways to challenges these sorts of things. Launching a smear campaign isn't one of them. It's actually just pretty infantile."" Chipotle has earned both praise and skepticism in its ascent to the upper echelon of the fast food world. The company's mission, which is centered around a commitment to sourcing the most ethical ingredients possible, has proven an honest one. Earlier this year, when it became clear that a pork supplier wasn't meeting the company's standards, Chipotle took the fall, and stopped serving pork at hundreds of restaurants around country. The act was met with applause, as consumers celebrated the chain's steadfastness about its core values. Chipotle's announcement that it would no longer serve foods containing genetically modified organisms, however, was far less popular. Much of the media, including The Washington Post's editorial board, accused the chain of irresponsible fear-mongering.

"Archaeologists' weapon against ISIS: 5,000 cameras",http://www.foxnews.com/science/2015/09/03/archaeologists-weapon-against-isis-5000-cameras/,fox,"The 2,000-year-old Temple of Bel in Syria was recently blown up by the Islamic State. Now, archeologists are trying to digitally document other antiquities before they suffer the same fate. (Silvan Rehfeld, UNESCO via AP)

Archaeologists and thousands of volunteers are in a race against time to digitally map some of the world's oldest and most important statues, temples, and cities before they can be destroyed by the Islamic State, the Los Angeles Times reports.

If ISIS ""is permitted to wipe the slate clean and rewrite the history of a region that defined global aesthetic and political sensibilities, we will collectively suffer a costly and irreversible defeat,"" Roger Michel, director of the Institute for Digital Archaeology, tells the Telegraph.

In recent months, the terrorist group has blown up a pair of 2,000-year-old temples in Syria and destroyed Iraq's ancient city of Nimrud. ISIS considers these antiquities idolatry, and destroying them is a major facet of its propaganda, notes Forbes.

To combat the loss of history, the institute—a venture between Harvard and Oxford—is spending $2 million to send at least 5,000 high-tech cameras to volunteers in the region to take millions of photos, the Telegraph reports.

The institute will use the photos to create 3-D images, which could be used to make replicas of destroyed sites, something Forbes states MIT has offered to do.

Taking photos at these sites will be dangerous work, and volunteers will only go to sites not yet controlled by ISIS, the Times reports. Though the project started only six weeks ago, time is of the essence.

""We want to do something to document this legacy before it disappears,"" Michel tells the Times. (The group also beheaded an archaeological pioneer in the region.)

Connecticut-based firm Mission Control will handle Hillary Clinton's multi-million dollar direct mail program, POLITICO has learned.

By

Annie Karni

09/03/15, 12:24 PM EDT

Hillary Clinton’s campaign has awarded a coveted contract to oversee what is expected to be a robust, multi-million dollar direct mail program to the Connecticut-based firm Mission Control, POLITICO has learned.

It is the latest outside consultant hired by the campaign, joining firms that have been hired to oversee polling and media.

A campaign official confirmed the hire, noting that Mission Control has a long track record of winning highly competitive races for prominent Democratic women candidates, such as Kirsten Gillibrand, Kay Hagan, Maggie Hassan and Elizabeth Warren.

Mission Control managing partner Ed Peavy and principal Maren Hesla will serve as the lead strategists overseeing Clinton’s operation, and the firm may have a staff member working out of Clinton’s Brooklyn headquarters. Internally, the direct mail operation will be overseen by Oren Shur, who handles paid media for the campaign.

Clinton staff met with the largest direct mail firms on the Democratic side, a campaign official said. But the choice of Mission Control was not a surprise, sources said, because Peavy has worked in the past with Shur, as well as campaign manager Robby Mook.

A campaign spokesman said it was too early to say how much money Clinton will spend this election on direct mail, or when the targeted campaign literature will begin showing up in voters’ mailboxes.

But the snail mail will likely be a major allocation of Clinton's resources.

In 2008, the Clinton campaign spent about $26 million on expenses that appear to be related to direct mail. But because campaigns have a lot of discretion in how they list expenses, there is no way to definitively track direct mail spending. Delivering glossy campaign literature to people's homes is expensive, and some consultants say it has lost some of its power in a digital age.

“Digital is just a vastly superior voter engagement and mobilization tool,” said political consultant Neal Kwatra, founder and CEO of Metropolitan Strategies. “It would be malpractice of the highest order for any top tier candidate with broad name recognition to be deploying a direct mail heavy voter contact effort in 2015.”

But others said it is still a necessary expenditure for a winning campaign, in part because it can be highly targeted.

“Direct mail is still an important arrow in your quiver: it’s a way to get much more targeted and specific in your messaging than television ads,” said Mo Elleithee, a veteran of Clinton’s 2008 campaign.”I don’t think we’re close to an age when campaigns are going to give up mail -- it’s still an effective way to target a message to a specific household or individual. People in different homes on the same block can get different messages based on their interests.”

Walker super PAC spends $9.25M in advertising,http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/scott-walker-super-pac-ad-buy/index.html,cnn,"Washington (CNN)Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's affiliated super PAC announced the second phase of its advertising blitz Thursday, with plans to spend $9.25 million introducing Walker to voters in New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.

That comes on top of the $7 million that the group -- Unintimidated PAC -- has already dedicated to Iowa, a state Walker supporters have said is absolutely critical to their candidate.

The PAC plans to spend a whopping $8 million in South Carolina, going on air Nov. 7 and running through that state's primary, Feb. 20.

Smaller buys of $725,000 and $400,000 are planned for New Hampshire and Nevada, respectively, to run in the week before each state's decision day.

READ: Can Scott Walker Recover?

The money is going, in part, into the first ad from Walker's super PAC, introducing him to voters and laying out his core message: that he not only fights, but wins key battles for conservatives. The spot opens with footage of thousands of union protesters at the Wisconsin statehouse, pushing their way past police and screaming.

It's the central battle which put Walker on the national stage and one that supporters have said he needs to focus on in the long run.

""Time after time Scott Walker fights, and wins,"" the narrator says in the one-minute ad.

Walker's super PAC and campaign are barred, by law, from coordinating with each other.

Walker struggled through August, following a flat debate performance, a slide in the polls and a series of gaffes and unclear stances on issues like ""birthright citizenship"" and talk of a Canadian border wall.

But Walker's team of supporters -- on the campaign side and PAC side -- have taken a long-view much like other candidates toiling in the shadow of front-runner Donald Trump: focus on the marathon through the primaries, not the sprint this summer.",0.99589370136399569

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump waves to the crowd after speaking at the National Federation of Republican Assemblies on Saturday, Aug. 29, 2015, in Nashville, Tenn.

Mark Humphrey/AP

Donald Trump may be backing down — sort of. The billionaire businessman was the only GOP presidential candidate not to raise his hand at last month's debate to pledge he wouldn't run as a third-party candidate. Now, however, it seems he's poised to promise not to undertake an independent bid if he loses the Republican nomination. Trump's announcement is expected at a 2 p.m. EST press conference at Trump Tower in New York City. That's after a 1 p.m. meeting with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, where he's expected to sign the pledge. But a GOP source stresses, ""With Trump, nothing is certain until it's final."" Even if Trump inks the pledge, it's not a given that he won't mount a third-party run — or that he'll even stand by this one. The RNC pledge isn't legally binding, and there's nothing holding him to it if he decides the party at a later date isn't treating him fairly. The move appears to be aimed at making sure he qualifies for early primary ballots. South Carolina, which holds the first primary in the South, has a similar pledge affixed to its ballot qualifications, which must be submitted by the end of September. Speaking in the Palmetto State last week, Trump demurred on whether he would sign it, insisting there was plenty of time.

But Trump seemed to be leaning toward signing it at an event last weekend in Nashville. ""We're going to make a decision very soon,"" he told reporters. ""And I think a lot of people are going to be very happy."" With the clock ticking and pressure mounting, Trump appears to be bending to the party — at least for now. Bottom line — Trump has to sign these pledges if he wants to be considered a serious candidate in the short run. He wouldn't even be able to get on the GOP ballot in some important states like South Carolina and possibly Virginia and North Carolina, which are also considering loyalty pledges. Whether those are enforceable is another matter. There's a history of loyalty pledges in parties Parties can determine who gets on their ballot. And when candidates have refused to sign a loyalty oath, they haven't been permitted to run in the primary. In 2008, then-Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich sued to try to get on the Texas Democratic ballot after he wouldn't sign the party's pledge, but courts upheld the decision. Richard Winger, editor of Ballot Access News, said while the primary ballot is enforceable, the general election is a different story. Trump is stating, in good faith, that he won't run as any other party's candidate or an independent if he doesn't win the nomination, but there's still no legal muster behind such a pledge. ""They only have moral force. They can't enforce it,"" Winger said. ""But it's embarrassing for people to give their word that they would not do something and then do it."" Some states do have sore-loser laws. If a candidate loses a primary, that candidate can't run as an independent in the general election. While that's mostly been in congressional races, some may also try to get it to apply to presidential elections, if it came to that. But Winger said that could be a difficult argument, too. In his most recent issue of Ballot Access News, he notes that 34 states who do have sore-loser laws have precedents where they have allowed a candidate to run again, even if they lost the primary. In some cases, that may apply only to an independent run. In 2012, former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson sought and lost the GOP nomination for president. Instead, he ran as the Libertarian Party's nominee, and wasn't allowed on the Michigan ballot. However, that was because he was running under another party's banner — had he simply been running as an independent, he would have been allowed. And in states that hold caucuses instead of primaries, enforcement of a pledge could also prove difficult. So, while there is plenty of legal wiggle room for Trump, this is the surest sign yet that he is trying to play within GOP rules. His actions could engender goodwill from some in the establishment, even though many remain skeptical of his intentions. With where he stands in the polls and with the size of crowds he's drawing, party leaders have to recognize his staying power and that there is feasibly a chance he could be the Republican nominee. For Trump, there is a bright side in signing the pledge, too. If he does win the GOP nomination, now his other rivals, who have badmouthed and beat up on him, will be the ones eating crow — and backing his candidacy.",0.99999999593496436
"Poll: Trump leads GOP nationally, but Carson gains",http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/monmouth-poll-donald-trump-ben-carson-jeb-bush/index.html,cnn,"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump is expanding his strong lead over the other GOP presidential candidates nationally, according to a new poll, but Ben Carson is also posting a big jump in support.

In the first national Monmouth University poll out since the first Republican presidential debate, released Thursday, the real estate mogul is showing a commanding lead at 30% support. That's up 4 points from a poll taken just before the debate last month, but within the poll's margin of error.

It's also a new high for Trump, narrowly topping the 28% support he registered in a Quinnipiac poll late last month.

But Carson, a neurosurgeon, posted the biggest gain in support since August, jumping 13 points to second place. He is holding down 18% support now among Republicans. That continues a trend of recent polls that show him moving up the list.

It's also Carson's highest recorded number in a national poll, topping a 13% mark in a Fox news poll this spring.

Trump's lead also evaporates when the field is narrowed to just him and Carson. Asked about a head-to-head match-up between those two, Republican voters picked Carson over Trump, 55% to 36%.

Carson was the only candidate to beat Trump in a head-to-head, the poll found.

The poll confirms recent trends of Trump's lasting lead and Carson's surge -- as well as steep drops in support for some more establishment candidates.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush fell out of second place, dropping from 12% support in August to 8% now, though that fall is within the margin of error. That tied him for third place with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker also fell. He was in third place at 11% in August, and dropped 8 points to just 3% on Thursday.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio was in fourth place at 5% and businesswoman Carly Fiorina and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee tied in the fifth spot at 4%.

Monmouth surveyed 366 Republican voters between Aug. 31 and Sept. 2 by telephone interview for the poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 5.1 percentage points.

"Why is Ben Carson surging? Once again, it&#8217;s the media.",http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/03/why-is-ben-carson-surging-once-again-its-the-media/,washpo,"Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson attends an antiabortion rally opposing federal funding for Planned Parenthood on July 28, 2015 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Olivier Douliery/Getty Images) The surge of support for Ben Carson is making some people curious. Howard Kurtz suggests Carson’s surge is “under the media radar.” That’s exactly backwards. Carson’s surge is arguably because he got back on the media’s radar. Even though Carson is not receiving a lot of news coverage, the trends in Carson’s polling numbers are easily understood as responses to trends in how much he’s covered in news — much as is true of Donald Trump. [Why is Trump surging? Blame the media.] Here is a graph showing the percentage of news stories that mention Carson and his national polling numbers. As in my previous posts, I draw on social analytic tools provided by Crimson Hexagon. These tools are devised to gather and reveal the volume and tone of media coverage on major news sites. UCLA political scientist Lynn Vavreck and I are analyzing the news coverage of presidential candidates as part of our joint work on the 2016 election. Carson declared his candidacy on May 3. Our data starts on May 16, at which point we are still picking up the bump Carson received from his announcement. In addition, Carson got spikes of attention for speeches at Sen. Joni Ernst’s “Roast and Ride” event in Iowa and the Freedom and Faith Coalition Conference. His coverage then began to wane, as did his poll numbers. The spike in his poll numbers came only after he began to get more attention around the Aug. 6 debate and thereafter. [Why does Trump remain atop the polls? You can still blame the media.] To see this more clearly, let’s take an average of Carson’s poll numbers and graph that against his news coverage. This graph puts news coverage on the left-hand axis and the poll average on the right-hand axis. It shows the correlation more clearly. (And despite all the bumps and wiggles in news coverage, there is a statistically significant correlation here.) An underappreciated fact is that Carson was also polling reasonably well in May and June — when he was getting, on average, some degree of news coverage after announcing his candidacy and giving these speeches. Then, after the Faith and Freedom speech, he got much less attention. His poll average followed suit. Finally, after he began to get more attention at the beginning of August, his poll average increased. Again, it is possible that news coverage responds to poll numbers. Increasing polling numbers always make for horse-race coverage. But, as I’ve argued in the past, we should expect the news coverage to come first. People’s views about a candidate are likely to change only when the information they’re getting about that candidate changes. News coverage isn’t the sole source of information, but it’s an important one. Certainly being on the media’s radar has been crucial for Carson.",0.99943370105834206
Carly Fiorina has now officially qualified for the main stage at CNN&#8217;s debate,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/03/carly-fiorina-has-now-officially-qualified-for-the-main-stage-at-cnns-debate/,washpo,"With the release of a new Monmouth University national poll on Thursday, former HP executive Carly Fiorina is now virtually guaranteed a spot on the main debate stage for CNN's Sept. 16 Republican presidential debate. Fiorina takes four percent in the poll, well behind the leaders -- Donald Trump stands at 30 percent and Ben Carson places second with 18 percent. But, that show of support puts her in the top 10 of all the polls conducted after Fox News' debate last month. And with CNN’s rule change earlier this week, that means she gets to appear on-stage even though she’s still only 11th in all of the polls they’re considering. One other note: Ted Cruz has now passed Marco Rubio in overall poll standing and so will be slightly closer to the center of the stage than he was at the Fox debate.",0.908083331072291

Not only was he one of the best right-handed hitters of his time, but his goofy, lovable personality made him even more intriguing to watch.

In a career filled with many unforgettable ""Manny being Manny"" moments, it's only fitting that his first major-league hit was one of those highly entertaining Manny bloopers.

It was on this day, 22 years ago, ManRam brought in his big league career with a bang -- on a base-running blunder.

We take you back to Sept. 3, 1993, when the Indians were facing the Yankees at the old Yankee Stadium. Ramirez was playing in his second-ever major-league game and swung for the fences. And he reached them, but it was on a ground-rule double and not a home run, like he had thought.

Manny proudly circled the bases, taking in what he assumed was his first big league dinger, but the ball had bounced over the wall. As he rounded third, Ramirez noticed his teammates cackling in the dugout and headed back to second.

Ramirez quickly made up for the gaffe, as he went on to hit not one, but two homers later in the game.

And that, everyone, was the birth of ""Manny being Manny.""

Hospitals have found loopholes to avoid penalties linked to ObamaCare, but at the expense of patients' wallets.

The controversial law puts an impetus on improving the quality of care, doling out penalties or incentives for certain measures. Hospitals that have too many Medicare patient readmissions within 30 days of the patient getting discharged, for example, receive reduced Medicare payments.

But hospitals have found a way to game the system, a new study concludes.

Hospitals are increasingly ""observing"" Medicare patients instead of readmitting them, according to a study in the journal Health Affairs. The practice can increase out-of-pocket costs for patients based on how they are classified by the hospital.

As Donald Trump and Jeb Bush continue to spar, the outspoken Manhattan billionaire remains the one to beat in the crowded race for the Republican nomination, according to the results of a national Monmouth University poll released Thursday afternoon.

But if the latest head-to-head numbers are any indication, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, not Bush, might represent his greatest obstacle yet.

The businessman leads the field of 17, with 30 percent pledging their support to him, followed by Carson at 18 percent. For Trump, it's an overall increase of four percentage points since last month's survey before the first GOP debate, while Carson jumped 13 points.

As for Bush, if his new strategy of aggressively taking on Trump is working, there's no evidence of it in the Monmouth poll: His overall numbers continued to sink, putting him in third place with 8 percent, along with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

It's a decrease of 4 points since the last Monmouth national poll in August and comes amid concerns about the former Florida governor's fundraising and the daily volley of personal attacks from Trump, who on Wednesday suggested that Bush should only speak English while he is in the United States.

By

Nick Gass

Bush's fellow Floridian, Sen. Marco Rubio, picked up 5 percent, while former Hewlett-Packard executive Carly Fiorina and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee followed with 4 percent each. Rounding out the field, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker picked up 3 percent, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul each earned 2 percent, with all other candidates earning 1 percent or less.

Overall, 67 percent of those polled — registed voters who said they are Republicans or lean Republican — said they would prefer the next president to come from outside government, while just 26 percent said they would prefer someone who had government experience. Neither Trump nor Carson have ever served in elected office.

Trump's advantage cuts across ideological, tea party, age and gender lines, with Carson in second place in all subgroups.

And in matchups among Republican voters and those leaning Republican, Trump prevailed in all but one: against Carson, who got 55 percent to Trump's 36 percent in a hypothetical matchup.

Carson earned the highest favorability numbers among all candidates, with 67 percent favorable and 26 percent unfavorable, a net positive of 41 points.

Trump, meanwhile, earned strong numbers himself, at 59 percent to 29 percent, as did Fiorina (43 percent to 13 percent) and Walker (42 percent to 15 percent), though the Wisconsin governor did not rank among the top finishers in this survey. Voters were split on Bush, with 41 percent viewing him favorably but 39 percent having an unfavorable opinion of him.

A Monmouth poll in Iowa last week found that Trump and Carson were tied among Hawkeye State Republicans, with Fiorina coming in third.

According to a POLITICO analysis of the latest polling, Fiorina would qualify for the main stage at the CNN debate on Sept. 16 in Simi Valley, California, but only by virtue of the this week's rules change, which stipulated that candidates placing in the top 10 of a national polling average between Aug. 6 and Sept. 10 would be eligible.

Had the rules not been adjusted, Fiorina's overall main average of 2.2 percent would rank in 11th place behind New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie with 3.1 percent. With the change, she is eligible and is highly likely to qualify for the main stage, in seventh place in POLITICO's average of all polls conducted after the Aug. 6 debate.

Likely headed for the early 6 p.m. stage are Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, former New York Gov. George Pataki and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. Former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore would not qualify for either debate, based on his current polling average of 0.1 percent.

The poll was conducted by telephone from Aug. 31-Sept. 2, surveying 366 registered voters who identified themselves as Republican or leaning toward the GOP. The margin of error is plus or minus 5.1 percentage points.

Why Judge Berman Threw Out Tom Brady’s ‘Deflategate’ Suspension,http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/09/03/why-judge-berman-threw-out-tom-bradys-deflategate-suspension/,wsj,"A federal judge in New York on Thursday threw out the NFLâs four-game “Deflategate” suspension of Tom Brady, giving the New England Patriots star quarterback a hard-fought victory and dealing an embarrassing legal setback to league management.

It’s notÂ clear if the NFL will appeal U.S. District Judge Richard Berman’s decision. And Mr. Brady didn’t immediately comment.

He was accused by the NFL of scheming to deflate footballs during last yearâs AFC Championship game. A report by Paul Weiss lawyer Ted Wells said Brady was âgenerally awareâ of the alleged tampering. After Commissioner Roger Goodell upheld the suspension, Mr. Brady took the case to federal court with a lawsuit.

Judge Berman gave several reasons for vacating theÂ punishment. Here are key excerpts from his 40-page opinion:

â¢ Inadequate notice of punishment:

The Court finds that Brady had no notice that he could receive a four-game suspension for general awareness of ball deflation by others or participation in any scheme to deflate footballs, and non-cooperation with the ensuing Investigation. Brady also had no notice that his discipline would be the equivalent of the discipline imposed upon a player who used performance enhancing drugs.

It is the “law of the shop” to provide professional football players with (advance) notice of prohibited conduct and of potential discipline … Because there was no notice of a four-game suspension in the circumstances presented here, Commissioner Goodell may be said to have “dispense[d] his own brand of industrial justice.”…

The Court concludes that, as a matter of law, no NFL policy or precedent notifies players that they may be disciplined (much less suspended) for general awareness of misconduct by others. And, it does not appear that the NFL has ever, prior to this case, sought to punish players for such an alleged violation.

â¢ Misplaced reliance on NFL’s ‘conduct detrimental’ policy:

Commissioner Goodell contends that Brady’s discipline stems from the general [Collective Bargaining Agreement] policy precluding players from engaging in any conduct that is “detrimental to the integrity of, or public confidence in, the game of professional football.”

Goodell’s reliance on notice of broad CBA “conduct detrimental” policy — as opposed to specific Player Policies regarding equipment violations — to impose discipline upon Brady is legally misplaced. In both the Ray Rice case and the Adrian Peterson case, the players could, perhaps, be said to appreciate that acts of domestic violence might be deemed “conduct detrimental.” And yet, in both of these cases, the players were disciplined only after findings were made under the specific domestic violence policy

â¢ Brady was denied the opportunity to examine a lead investigator:

Denied the opportunity to examine [Jeff] Pash at the arbitral hearing, Brady was prejudiced. He was foreclosed from exploring, among other things, whether the Pash Wells Investigation was truly “independent,” and how and why the NFL’ s General Counsel came to edit a supposedly independent investigation report…Brady was also prejudiced because there was no other witness, apart from Pash, who was as “competent to address the substantive core of the claim.”…As co-lead investigator and senior executive with the NFL, Pash was in the best position to testify about the NFL ‘s degree of involvement in, and potential shaping of, a heralded “independent” Investigation.

â¢ Brady was denied equal access to investigative files from the Paul Weiss report:

The Court finds that Commissioner Goodell’s denial of the Players Association’s motion to produce the Paul, Weiss investigative files, including notes of witness interviews, for Brady’s use at the arbitral hearing was fundamentally unfair and in violation of 9 U.S.C. Â§ 10(a)(3) and that Brady was prejudiced as a result. The interview notes were, at the very least, the basis for the Wells Report, and Brady was prejudiced by his lack of access to them. Brady was denied the opportunity to examine and challenge materials that may have led to his suspension and which likely facilitated Paul, Weiss attorneys’ cross-examination of him.

Compounding Brady’s prejudice is the fact that, as noted, Paul, Weiss acted as both alleged “independent” counsel during the Investigation and also (perhaps inconsistently) as retained counsel to the NFL during the arbitration. Paul, Weiss uniquely was able to retain access to investigative files and interview notes which it had developed; was able to use them in direct and cross-examinations of Brady and other arbitration witnesses; share them with NFL officials during the arbitral proceedings; and, at the same time, withhold them from Brady.",0.6104897765371754

"If Donald Trump followed this really basic advice, he&#8217;d be a lot richer",http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/09/03/if-donald-trump-followed-this-really-basic-advice-hed-be-a-lot-richer/,washpo,"Real estate tycoon Donald Trump arrives on stage for the start of the Republican presidential debate on August 6 in Cleveland, Ohio. (MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images) Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner in next year's presidential primary, has been pitching voters on his experience in business. ""I'm running for office in a country that's essentially bankrupt, and it needs a successful businessman,"" he told Rolling Stone. Yet Trump has not done nearly as well as other American business magnates, or even a typical middle-class retiree following sound financial advice, as a review of the numbers over the past four decades shows. He is a billionaire today despite this poor performance because when he started his career, his father had already built a colossal real-estate empire. And the wealth Donald Trump has accumulated since then has at times come at the expense of taxpayers or the banks and investors who have lent him money. [Read more: A secret to Donald Trump’s success that you simply can’t replicate] Citing data from Forbes, The Associated Press estimates that Trump's net worth quadrupled from $1 billion to $4 billion between 1988 and today. That's an impressive gain, but it's nothing compared to the wealth produced by investors such as Warren Buffett and Bill Gates. Gates's wealth increased from about $1 billion to $80 billion over the same period. Buffett had about $2.5 billion in 1988, and has $68 billion today. Yet perhaps the most telling comparison is between Trump and his golf buddy, Richard LeFrak. The LeFraks and the Trumps have been rivals in New York's real estate business for generations. LeFrak's father, Samuel LeFrak, took a no-nonsense approach to the business. He focused on minimizing risk and making money, according to a 1992 profile in Business Week, before the magazine became Bloomberg Businessweek. ""He might be strutting around like a peacock today, but he's gonna be a feather duster tomorrow,"" the elder LeFrak told Business Week when asked about Trump. Over time, the LeFraks came out ahead of their competitors. LeFrak is worth $7 billion today, and he's 181st on Bloomberg's list of the world's richest people. Bloomberg puts Trump's wealth at just $2.9 billion -- far less than Forbes's estimate. He doesn't even make the list. The LeFraks are a family with long experience in a very competitive industry, but Trump's returns are less even than those of an ordinary investor saving for retirement. Experts on personal finance generally recommend that people saving for retirement or to pay for a child's college education buy and hold in index funds -- mutual funds that are invested in a wide range of stocks or bonds. The price of the funds will go up and down with the market, but over time, these investments will generate a reliable return as long as the investor avoids the temptation to sell in a financial panic. [Read more: It’s time to take a look at the index card with all the financial advice you’ll ever need] Citing an independent evaluation, Business Week put Trump's net worth at $100 million in 1978. Had Trump gotten out of real estate entirely, put his money in an index fund based on the S&P 500 and reinvested the dividends, he'd be worth twice as much -- $6 billion -- today, according to the calculator maintained by the blog Don't Quit Your Day Job. (In this scenario, Trump doesn't quit his day job. The calculation above does not include any allowance for living expenses, so if he had put all his money in index funds, he would have had to live off the dividends or find some other source of income.) Trump disputes the independent appraisals of his wealth by Forbes, Business Week (now Bloomberg) and others. He says he is worth about $10 billion today. Using Trump's preferred estimates of his wealth, he has still performed worse than our hypothetical Main Street retiree. He told The New York Times he was worth $200 million in 1976, an amount that would be worth $12 billion today. ""That a purely un­man­aged in­dex fund’s re­turn could out­per­form Trump’s hands-on wheel­ing and deal­ing calls in­to ques­tion one of Trump’s chief selling points on the cam­paign trail: his busi­ness acu­men,"" writes S.V. Dáte in National Journal. In a way, though, all of these comparisons are misleading. Donald Trump's father, Fred Trump, built his real-estate business on federal subsidies, as The Washington Post's Emily Badger has reported. Financing from Uncle Sam isn't available to the typical investor (although homeowners do benefit indirectly from federal subsidies and can deduct interest they pay on their mortgage from their tax bill). The younger Trump has continued that strategy, boasting about his ability to secure taxpayer dollars from local officials, as the Los Angeles Times has explained. [Read more: How Donald Trump abandoned his father's middle-class empire for luxury building] At other times, Trump has relied not on taxpayers but on banks and private concerns. Firms under his control have gone bankrupt on four occasions, but those catastrophes aren't fully reflected in Trump's net worth today, since his lenders absorbed the losses. The LeFraks, by contrast, have avoided imposing losses on their creditors, while still finding a way to turn a profit.

"Officer who shot two unarmed black men won&#8217;t face criminal charges, prosecutor says",http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/09/03/officer-who-shot-two-unarmed-black-men-wont-face-criminal-charges-prosecutor-says/,washpo,"A protester holds a sign that reads “Justice 4 Andre and Bryson!” as a police car drives past Olympia City Hall on Wednesday. (Ted S. Warren/AP file) A white police officer who shot and wounded two unarmed black men in Olympia, Wash., earlier this year will not face criminal charges, according to a prosecutor who has said that the officer’s actions were justified. Ryan Donald, of the Olympia Police Department, shot stepbrothers Bryson Chaplin and Andre Thompson while responding to an early-morning call on May 21 that the pair had tried to shoplift beer and then threw beer bottles at a grocery store employee. Donald, 35, said he struggled with the stepbrothers and opened fire in self-defense. Chaplin, 21, was paralyzed from the waist down after the shooting, according to the Seattle Times. “Officer Donald indicated that his primary fear was that his handgun could be taken away from him and used against him, and I find that that was reasonable under the circumstances,” Thurston County Prosecutor Jon Tunheim told reporters at a Wednesday news conference, according to Seattle NBC affiliate KING. Olympia Police Chief Ronnie Roberts acknowledged that the May shooting  — and the decision not to criminally charge Donald — came amid an ongoing national debate over police brutality and race. Roberts said Wednesday in a statement that the “issues of bias, power, privilege and race are challenging communities across this nation.” [Analysis: Fatal shootings by on-duty police officers] But earlier this year, the chief said there was “no indication to me that race was a factor in this case at all.” Roberts said Wednesday that his department will conduct its own internal review over the next couple weeks. Chaplin, 21, and Thompson, 23, have been charged with assault; the stepbrothers are scheduled to appear in court Sept. 22. Donald’s attorney told the Olympian that the office “reacted as one might expect” to the news that he won’t face criminal charges. “He’s really happy, and he’s looking forward to this all being over,” Saxon Rogers said. Rodgers added to the newspaper that he and Donald haven’t ruled out the possibility of a civil suit filed by Chaplin and Thompson. “It they do, they’ll lose,” Rodgers told the newspaper. “Just look at the evidence.” [Police shooting of two unarmed black men accused of stealing beer prompts protests] An employee at Westside Safeway called 911 at about 1 a.m. on the morning of the shooting to report an attempted theft and assault. Surveillance footage from the store showed the men walking out with a case of Corona and, when confronted, hurling the bottles at the employee’s feet on their way out the door. Donald responded to the call and later told investigators that he spotted Chaplin and Thompson, who matched the description from the store employee. When he confronted them near the store, one of the stepbrothers grabbed Donald’s shirt sleeve to pull him to the ground, he said, and the other tried to hit him with a skateboard. Donald said he then pulled his gun and opened fire, striking one of them before the two men fled into some nearby woods. Donald said he reloaded his weapon and waited for backup. The officer said the men then reappeared and moved toward him in a hostile manner. He said he ordered them to get down on the ground — and, when they continued, he opened fire again, striking both men. Donald called dispatchers, saying the men were “aggressive” and had “assaulted me with a skateboard.” Both men to rushed to nearby hospitals. Later that morning, hundreds of protesters flooded Olympia’s city hall, marching with “Black Lives Matter” signs and chanting: “No justice, no peace.” Olympia Mayor Stephen Buxbaum pleaded with community members to remain patient — and peaceful — during the formal investigation. “It deeply saddens me that we have two young people in the hospital as a result of an altercation with an officer of the law,” Buxbaum said at the time. “Let’s come together to support their needs, the officer’s needs, the needs of the families and our community’s needs. Let’s not be reactive.” [Ex-S.C. police chief charged with killing black man pleads guilty, will serve no time] The uproar resumed Wednesday, after Tunheim said that Donald had not broken the law because he was “acting without malice” and had a “good faith fear” when he opened fire earlier this year. Noting the skateboard attack, Tunheim said: “I believe [Donald] was at risk of being seriously injured.” David Beninger, an attorney for the stepbrothers, has said previously that “there wasn’t an assault with the skateboard.” Beninger did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Near the end of the police chief’s conference at City Hall, demonstrators broke into chants of “Fire Officer Donald!” “This has been a difficult few months for the community and the Olympia Police Department,” Roberts said, according to the Olympian. He added: “We recognize there are members of the public that feel vulnerable and distrust the police. We are committed to improving those relationships.” Caro Gonazles, center, and Rafael Ruiz, right, shout “Fire Officer Donald!” at the end of a police press conference Wednesday. (Ted S.

Titans DB McCourty: Dorial Green-Bechkam is 'a beast',http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/sports/~3/-rYtr4FaDZo/,fox,"By Jesse Reed

Tennessee Titans rookie receiver Dorial Green-Beckham has impressed his teammates this summer.

Green-Beckham wowed NFL scouts this past winter during the draft process with his combination of size, crazy athleticism and soft hands. After spending the past few months watching the rookie work during practice, his own teammates are now in awe of Green-Beckham's abilities on the field.

""He is a beast,"" cornerback Jason McCourty said of Green-Beckham, via the team's official website. ""There's certain things you can't teach, and you can't teach a guy to be that big, and to be physical. With Dorial, it's just a matter of how fast can he learn it, and know it, so he can just go out there and play football. If he can get to the point where he can run free and be comfortable, he'll really start to develop more.""

The rookie has struggled to stay on the practice field for the Titans with a slew of minor injuries. If he can stay healthy, then he and fellow rookie Marcus Mariota will develop into one of the most exciting young quarterback/receiver duos in the NFL.

During his tenure at Missouri, Green-Beckham put up big-time numbers before off-field troubles got him kicked out of the program. He caught 59 passes for 883 yards (15 yards per reception) and 12 touchdowns in his sophomore season, showing off incredible athleticism to go along with his prototypical size.

At 6-foot-5 and 237 pounds, Green-Beckham towers over defensive backs -- no matter how big they are. College football has yet to begin manufacturing 6-foot-5 cornerbacks, and it's not likely we'll see any secondary defenders who fit this description any time soon.

As a rookie, Green-Beckham should find immediate success as a red-zone threat, given his size and given the fact that Mariota is one of the most accurate passers to come out of college in a long, long time. Once the talented receiver masters the subtle art of route-running (assuming it does happen), it's going to be awfully fun to watch him dominate all over the field -- not just in the red zone.

New England's fall colors expected to be 'patchy',http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/nZXZImRCtas/,fox,"Money really will grow on trees in New England this fall, as millions of “leaf peepers” flock to the region to view its colorful foliage and inject billions of tourism dollars into local and state economies.

Vermont’s 3.5 million foliage tourists spend about $460,000 — a quarter of the overall annual visitor spending — during the six-week foliage season, according to the Vermont Department of Tourism and Marketing. The haul is even bigger in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, where state officials estimate that combined visitor-spending totals more than $4.6 billion during foliage season.

“You can’t get great foliage without a good setup in spring or summer. This year the setup is not terrible, but it’s also not ideal.”

- Jim Salge, foliage expert, Yankee magazine

But just having exceptional foliage is not enough. All the New England states — Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island — invest in foliage marketing, and some create special apps and websites.

This year Vermont is spending $280,000 to advertise its “World’s Best Foliage” campaign, and the state’s tourism website, VermontVacation.com, will provide weekly foliage reports, best bets for driving tours and a foliage tracker.

Leaf peeping is akin to a sport in New England, and no two seasons are alike.

“To get really vibrant colors, we need a great setup,” said Jim Salge, foliage expert at Yankee magazine. “We need a nice, reasonably mild, reasonably rainy spring. We need a summer that has ample rainfall. And the biggest factor is a fall season that has a lot of sunshine, warm days and cool nights.

 “The nice thing about New England is that’s what is normal. So in an average year in New England, we get pretty spectacular foliage.”

Still, nobody knows for sure where and when the colors will peak. “Predicting fall’s color changes is part science and part luck,” said Michael Snyder, commissioner of Vermont’s Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation. “We know the science of color change and the factors that influence it, but we don’t know exactly how it will unfold in any given year. The good news is, our foliage is like a day on the slopes — when it’s good, it’s great. And even when it’s a bit off, it’s still really good.”

So what’s the forecast this year? “I’m expecting that it’s going to be patchy,” said Salge. “You can’t get great foliage without a good setup in spring or summer. This year the setup is not terrible, but it’s also not ideal.”

“Much of New England had a really dry spring, and then we had variable rainfall this summer,” he said. “Some areas have gotten rainfall that’s well above normal, and we have some areas where rainfall has been below normal. Some places are still running a huge deficit for rainfall, while 10 miles away they are right on target or ahead. So it’s going to be a patchy year.”

Want to maximize your chances of finding the best fall colors? Follow these tips:

• Time it right. Hitting the colors at their peak is a crapshoot, but you can up your chances. “If people give themselves a nice window in early October in the northern part of New England or mid- to late October in the southern part of New England, they’ll be perfectly fine — this year or any year,” Salge said.

• Be flexible. “It’s only a half a day’s drive from the earliest peak to the latest peak in New England,” Salge said. “So if you have the ability to get in a car, and some flexibility in your plans, you can find the peak.”

• Follow the crowd. Classic foliage routes include Route 7 in Vermont, coast road U.S. Hwy. 1 in Maine, Kancamagus Highway in New Hampshire and Route 2 through the Pioneer Valley in Massachusetts.

• Get off the beaten path. “Really, there’s great foliage everywhere, as well as fine country stores and great New England farms,” said Salge. “That’s why people come here; there’s something for everybody and it’s really easy to do.”

• Download Yankee Magazine’s free LeafPeepr app, which uses crowdsourced foliage reports to tell you where color is about to peak, at peak or past peak.Suzanne Rowan Kelleher is the family vacations expert at About.com.",0.32177496462944832
Trump to sign Republican loyalty pledge,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/09/03/trump-to-sign-republican-loyalty-pledge/,washpo,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at the National Federation of Republican Assemblies on Saturday, Aug. 29, 2015, in Nashville, Tenn. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey) Donald Trump will pledge to support the Republican presidential nominee in the general election on Thursday afternoon, effectively ruling out a third-party bid, the Post’s Robert  Costa reports. The move will calm some nerves within the GOP about Trump’s unusual approach to campaigning for the White House, if only temporarily. As the party’s current 2016 frontrunner, Trump has defied expectations and continues to experience a healthy polling lead over his rivals despite a series of controversial remarks that might sink a more traditional candidate. Whether Trump will abide by the pledge is another question, and his trustworthiness on the matter was greeted by skepticism Thursday. Here’s how Costa described his decision: The promise, which Trump has long avoided making, brings him closer to a party whose rank-and-file activists he has thrilled this summer but whose leadership has at times viewed his rapid ascent with alarm, especially the prospect of an outside bid that could siphon away votes from the eventual standard-bearer. The Republicans familiar with Trump’s decision requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. They also said that Trump may have caveats or conditions upon signing that have not yet been shared beyond the businessman’s tight-knit inner circle. These Republicans said that even as Trump wants to be a team player and plans to abide by the pledge, his priority is to be treated with he often refers to as “respect” by the national GOP.

Donald Trump has responded to a newspaper column accusing him of bullying and insulting the media -- by personally insulting the writer.

That's the charge from none other than basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who penned a column for the Washington Post on Wednesday that caught the attention of the GOP candidate.

In his column, Abdul-Jabbar criticized what he portrayed as Trump's disregard for the media's First Amendment rights, and cited a series of incidents involving Fox News' Megyn Kelly, Univision anchor Jorge Ramos and the Des Moines Register newspaper.

Later Wednesday, Abdul-Jabbar, who in the years since his retirement as the NBA's all-time leading scorer and six-time MVP has become a bestselling author and frequent columnist on social and political issues, published a note he said he got from Trump.

It reads: ""Now I know why the press always treated you so badly -- they couldn't stand you. The fact is that you don't have a clue about life and what has to be done to make America great again! Best wishes, Donald Trump.""

The Republican National Committee is pressing to convince Donald Trump to sign a pledge not to run as an independent in 2016, after having already secured such commitments from several other GOP candidates. 

Trump, the GOP presidential frontrunner, was the only one who did not raise his hand when the 10 top-polling candidates were asked at last month's Fox News debate whether they'd commit not to mount an outside White House bid. 

Fox News has learned that the RNC on Wednesday began reaching out to several GOP campaigns asking their candidates to sign the new pledge. 

But RNC Chairman Reince Priebus plans to personally visit Trump in New York City on Thursday afternoon -- with the pledge at the heart of the meeting, a GOP source told Fox News. 

Trump was scheduled to hold a press availability Thursday afternoon, after the meeting. 

The pledge states in part that if the GOP contender does not become the nominee: ""I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is,"" and ""I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of another party.""

Six Democratic Party debates are enough,http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/opinions/fowler-democratic-debates/index.html,cnn,"Donald L. Fowler, who served as the Democratic National Committee Chair from 1995 to 1997, is a political science professor at the University of South Carolina and founder of Fowler Communications. He is a current Democratic National Committee member and a member of the Rules and Bylaws Committee. The opinion expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN)Five months before the Iowa Caucus, and nearly 15 months before Election Day, excitement for the 2016 election is building among Democratic activists.

I'm not sure we could have imagined better motivation than seeing Donald Trump sitting atop the Republican polls, trailed by the prospect of yet another President Bush. It seems to have been the kick in the pants Democrats needed to get off the couch and get to work defending the considerable achievements of President Obama's time in office, especially considering the party's lackluster performance during the 2014 midterms.

At the moment, that excitement has manifested as concern over the rules governing how the Democratic Party will choose our next presidential nominee. We need to ensure that we nominate a candidate who is prepared for the rigors of a campaign, not to mention holding the highest office in the land. Thankfully, I see five such qualified candidates on the Democratic side, and potentially a few more, while I've yet to see one among the 15 or 20 Republicans vying for their nomination.

So while I understand the concerns that some Democrats have expressed concerning the debate schedule, I wholeheartedly agree with the schedule as currently structured. This schedule is best for our candidates, our supporters, and for voters. Most importantly, I believe that it puts Democrats in the best possible position to win in November 2016 with a tested nominee, operating from a position of strength.

As a former DNC chair, I'm familiar with the guiding principles that are taken into consideration when creating a debate schedule.

The goal is to set a reasonable number of debates that maximizes voters' opportunity to see the candidates side by side, while remaining manageable for all of the participants. To be clear, I haven't always seen the Democratic Party do this. Since my time as chair, several cycles have turned into unruly and out-of-control situations more hurtful than beneficial to our party.

Six debates provide multiple opportunities for voters to hear our candidates share their visions for our country's future. They also provide multiple opportunities for our candidates to engage in a rigorous discussion. But this discussion occurs not only with each other, but also with the American people. A pace of one debate per month gives candidates plenty of opportunities to engage voters at rallies, town halls, house meetings, forums, and other campaign events.

Voters need opportunities to hear the policy positions of our candidates without the constraints of a clock or the artificial limitations of a debate stage. Nobody wants our candidates focused solely on debates and debate prep at the exclusion of chances to interact directly with voters.

Another consideration is the importance of holding debates when voters are actually paying attention. Did you know that the first Republican primary debate of the 2012 election was in May 2011? Unless you're Tim Pawlenty or Gary Johnson (who participated in the debate, unlike Mitt Romney), you probably don't remember it.

Fall of 2015 was always the ideal window to begin the debate schedule, and October 13 fits squarely into this principle. And with each of the six sanctioned debates sponsored by a combination of state Democratic Parties, national media, digital platforms, local media, and civic organizations, these debates will be appealing and accessible to voters. These debates will reflect our party's -- and our country's -- diversity. They will include the first ever party-sanctioned Univision debate, especially important to our Hispanic citizens.

Debate negotiations rarely lead to all sides getting exactly what they want -- that's why they're called negotiations. But this is a schedule that meets the fundamental principles that guided the process and will benefit the Democratic Party.

Six DNC-sanctioned debates are in line with the precedent set during the 2004 and 2008 election cycles.

You probably recall a seemingly endless series of debates, including many non-DNC sanctioned ones, in those years, which I think has contributed to the confusion surrounding this year's schedule.

In fact, the reason the DNC is enforcing an ""exclusivity requirement,"" where candidates are barred from participating in non-DNC sanctioned debates under penalty of losing their access to the sanctioned and nationally televised debates, this cycle is so that we can avoid a repeat of what happened in cycles past. In both 2004 and 2008, a lack of enforcement led to more than 20 debates. This confused voters and overwhelmed our candidates, and was an experience no one had any interest in repeating.

As much as I love politics, even I don't really want to watch 20 Democratic and 20 Republican primary debates between now and March. Limiting the number should make it likely that more viewers will watch, and help our message break through.

It's worth noting that in recent election cycles, the general election has featured three debates between the parties' presidential nominees and one contest between the potential vice presidents. No one contends that three or four debates are insufficient for voters to distinguish the differences between the candidates. It is understood that the majority of campaigning will be conducted outside the debate arena, among the other events and opportunities for candidates to interact with and engage voters. This schedule enhances our candidates' ability to do that.

During the DNC's Summer Meeting, one of our outstanding candidates, Gov. Martin O'Malley reminded us that we as Democrats cannot remain silent in the face of Republican lies, Republican misogyny, Republican distortions about our President, and Republican disdain for our neighbors.

He was absolutely right.

But I hope that Democrats aren't waiting for a debate stage or a convention or a presidential nominee to speak up. Because all of us have a responsibility, each and every day, through our words and our actions, to show the American people that it is the Democratic Party that is on their side, championing their well-being.

I'm proud that our presidential candidates have spoken up to call out hateful rhetoric from Donald Trump and Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, and to hold Republicans accountable for their outdated and out-of-touch policies. And I'm proud that our party leaders, elected officials, activists, supporters, and volunteers have done the same. I expect that each of them will continue to remind people what it means to be a Democrat, using every platform they have to keep fighting for middle-class families.

That's why I'm encouraged by the debate over the debates. It's an indication that Democrats are engaged in the political process, moving past the complacency that plagued us in 2010 and 2014.

The current schedule was structured to put the Democratic nominee, whoever it eventually is, in the best position to win next November. I expect that our candidates will participate in the DNC-sanctioned debates, and capitalize on the numerous other opportunities that exist to interact with voters on the campaign trail.

And Democratic activists will channel their energy into what we do best: knocking on doors, making phone calls, registering and educating new voters, and relying on the strength of our grassroots supporters to win in 2016.

Global economic losses from drought to top $8 billion: report,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/environment/~3/b1PtAHoE-jw/story01.htm,reuters,"LONDON Global economic losses from drought are likely to reach more than $8 billion in the next few months as the El Nino weather pattern intensifies, reinsurance broker Aon Benfield said on Thursday.

Total economic losses from drought in the United States are likely to reach at least $3 billion, mainly due to agricultural damage in California, Aon Benfield said in its monthly catastrophe report.

“As we continue to see the prospect of El Nino becoming one of the strongest in decades, more and more impacts will be apparent around the world,"" Steve Bowen, associate director of Aon Benfield's catastrophe modeling team and meteorologist, said in a statement.

Experts work to save pair of melon-headed whales found struggling in waters near Gulfport,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/national/~3/jB-4AqShEss/,fox,"GULFPORT, Miss. –  Marine experts in Mississippi are working around the clock as two whales, their species unseen in South Mississippi for 40 years, fight for survival.

Moby Solangi of the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Gulfport says a fisherman Tuesday reported what he thought were two dead dolphins on the beach. Solangi tells The Sun Herald (http://bit.ly/1iiIIM1 ) when rescue teams arrived, they discovered not only were they not dead, they were not dolphins.

Solangi says the mammals are two melon-headed whales, a species native to deep waters near Hawaii. He says the whales are in critical condition — severely dehydrated, disoriented and unable to swim on their own. One also is suffering from a shark bite.

The team won't know what is ailing the whales until blood tests are completed.

State Department tries to corral e-mail FOIA cases,http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/crime/article33701748.html,mcclatchy,"Facing more than 30 Freedom of Information Act lawsuits over State Department e-mails, the Obama administration this week formally asked federal judges to consolidate all the cases in one court.

In filings dated Sept. 2, Justice Department attorneys said one judge could better coordinate the myriad FOIA cases.

“Different judges are being asked to impose a variety of search regimes, resulting in a hodgepodge of orders directing how State manages the search and production of the emails,” the Justice Department stated. “The result is confusion, inefficiencies, and advantages given to some requesters at the expense of others.”

FOIA lawsuits over the State Department’s e-mails are currently spread among 17 different federal judges. The multiple lawsuits, the Justice Department noted, tap into the trove of Hillary Clinton e-mails that are supposed to be fully disclosed by the end of January 2016.

A similar consolidation put more than 100 Guantanamo Bay detainee lawsuits under the management of one judge.

(MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images) Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner in next year's presidential primary, has been pitching voters on his experience in business. ""I'm running for office in a country that's essentially bankrupt, and it needs a successful businessman,"" he told Rolling Stone. Yet Trump has not done nearly as well as other American business magnates, or even a typical middle-class retiree following sound financial advice, as a review of the numbers over the past four decades shows. He is a billionaire today despite this poor performance because when he started his career, his father had already built a colossal real-estate empire. And the wealth Donald Trump has accumulated since then has at times come at the expense of taxpayers or the banks and investors who have lent him money. [Read more: A secret to Donald Trump’s success that you simply can’t replicate] Citing data from Forbes, The Associated Press estimates that Trump's net worth quadrupled from $1 billion to $4 billion between 1988 and today. That's an impressive gain, but it's nothing compared to the wealth produced by investors such as Warren Buffett and Bill Gates. Gates's wealth increased from about $1 billion to $80 billion over the same period. Buffett had about $2.5 billion in 1988, and has $68 billion today. Yet perhaps the most telling comparison is between Trump and his golf buddy, Richard LeFrak. The LeFraks and the Trumps have been rivals in New York's real estate business for generations. LeFrak's father, Samuel LeFrak, took a no-nonsense approach to the business. He focused on minimizing risk and making money, according to a 1992 profile in Business Week, before the magazine became Bloomberg Businessweek. ""He might be strutting around like a peacock today, but he's gonna be a feather duster tomorrow,"" the elder LeFrak told Business Week when asked about Trump. Over time, the LeFraks came out ahead of their competitors. LeFrak is worth $7 billion today, and he's 181st on Bloomberg's list of the world's richest people. Bloomberg puts Trump's wealth at just $2.9 billion -- far less than Forbes's estimate. He doesn't even make the list. The LeFraks are a family with long experience in a very competitive industry, but Trump's returns are less even than those of an ordinary investor saving for retirement. Experts on personal finance generally recommend that people saving for retirement or to pay for a child's college education buy and hold in index funds -- mutual funds that are invested in a wide range of stocks or bonds. The price of the funds will go up and down with the market, but over time, these investments will generate a reliable return as long as the investor avoids the temptation to sell in a financial panic. [Read more: It’s time to take a look at the index card with all the financial advice you’ll ever need] Citing an independent evaluation, Business Week put Trump's net worth at $100 million in 1978. Had Trump gotten out of real estate entirely, put his money in an index fund based on the S&P 500 and reinvested the dividends, he'd be worth twice as much -- $6 billion -- today, according to the calculator maintained by the blog Don't Quit Your Day Job. (In this scenario, Trump doesn't quit his day job. The calculation above does not include any allowance for living expenses, so if he had put all his money in index funds, he would have had to live off the dividends or find some other source of income.) Trump disputes the independent appraisals of his wealth by Forbes, Business Week (now Bloomberg) and others. He says he is worth about $10 billion today. Using Trump's preferred estimates of his wealth, he has still performed worse than our hypothetical Main Street retiree. He told The New York Times he was worth $200 million in 1976, an amount that would be worth $12 billion today. ""That a purely un­man­aged in­dex fund’s re­turn could out­per­form Trump’s hands-on wheel­ing and deal­ing calls in­to ques­tion one of Trump’s chief selling points on the cam­paign trail: his busi­ness acu­men,"" writes S.V. Dáte in National Journal. In a way, though, all of these comparisons are misleading. Donald Trump's father, Fred Trump, built his real-estate business on federal subsidies, as The Washington Post's Emily Badger has reported. Financing from Uncle Sam isn't available to the typical investor (although homeowners do benefit indirectly from federal subsidies and can deduct interest they pay on their mortgage from their tax bill). The younger Trump has continued that strategy, boasting about his ability to secure taxpayer dollars from local officials, as the Los Angeles Times has explained. [Read more: How Donald Trump abandoned his father's middle-class empire for luxury building] At other times, Trump has relied not on taxpayers but on banks and private concerns. Firms under his control have gone bankrupt on four occasions, but those catastrophes aren't fully reflected in Trump's net worth today, since his lenders absorbed the losses. The LeFraks, by contrast, have avoided imposing losses on their creditors, while still finding a way to turn a profit.

Boston brothers in Trump-inspired attack on Mexican to remain in custody,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/domesticNews/~3/1CfDeRXIVNg/story01.htm,reuters,"BOSTON Two Boston brothers charged with urinating on and beating a homeless Mexican man in an attack allegedly inspired by Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump's views on immigrants agreed on Thursday to remain in custody until their trial in October.

The brothers, 38-year-old Scott Leader and 30-year-old Steve Leader, were arrested last month and charged with assault and battery for the purpose of intimidation because of national origin.

Through their attorneys, Gary McGillivray and John Flanagan, the pair agreed to waive a hearing that could have determined whether they would be released on bail ahead of trial.

The judge set an Oct. 1 trial date.

The men told police they targeted their 58-year-old victim, whose name has not been released, because they believed he was an illegal immigrant. According to a police report, they told officers, ""Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported.""

Trump, the New York property developer and former reality TV personality, has jumped to the front of the pack of candidates seeking the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, driven in part by promises to deport all illegal immigrants and order the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border.

Trump, who initially described the attack as an outcome of passionate views on immigration, called it ""terrible"" on Twitter on Friday.

One of the brothers went on to threaten police officers, saying from his cell that he would attack them if he were not locked up.

Are Marketers Overhyping Millennials' Role in the Future Economy?,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/national/~3/LJSF6Y0egn4/,fox,"Millennials are the hottest topic of the moment, especially when it comes to marketers, who never seem to tire of millennial talk. They are slicing and dicing everything related to this generation -- from what they like and what they don’t, to their growth in the workplace and their future impact on the economy. In short, everything that will help them attract this lucrative group. But being obsessed with capturing the millennial mind share, are today’s marketers turning a blind eye to more obvious truths of generational marketing? Let’s take a closer look at where marketers may be going wrong while targeting Gen Y.

Ignore other age groups at your own risk

It makes no sense for any brand to focus on only one generation, unless it sells products meant solely for that particular age group. For instance, a brand selling walking sticks will probably do ok if they choose to target only the elderly -- although, it’s safe to assume that many of their purchases are made by their boomer offspring! But, let’s say, you sell eco-friendly products. The millennials’ much-known proclivity towards sustainability issues and positive brand images may have you believing they are your prospective buyers. And, while a recent study found that 63 percent of millennials prefer eco-friendly product packaging, more than half of both Gen-Xers and baby boomers have the same preference. You can imagine the cost of targeting only millennials and ignoring the rest.

Related: Everything You Know About Millennials Is Wrong

The biggest problem in targeting only millennials is you risk alienating buyers who don’t fall within that age bracket. And let’s not forget, as your millennial clientele age, they will be more attracted to brands that serve older generations, which you have missed the boat on because you failed to catch their eye as they were growing up.

Smart targeting or sweeping generalization?

While millennials are a huge generation, much like the boomers, there may be a bit too much emphasis on them as a whole and not enough sub-context around the vast difference between older millennials and younger millennials. The same holds true when discussing gender roles. Most of the brand messages and ads targeting millennial consumers are male-centric, overlooking the Gen-Y women—an emerging financial force.

Therefore, if a brand targets millennials, a marketer’s best chance for success will be through smart segmentation.

Is there too much hype around the M-word?

With so much more data and information about millennials at our fingertips, are we turning too much attention to them? My answer is: yes and no. Here’s why.

Related: The Truth About Facebook and Millennials

Many brands are smitten by statistics gushing about millennials’ big buying power. However, to conclude that they possess the most spending dollars is a near-sighted approach. I’d like to put it this way. Young adults may be buying more now because most of them have just stepped into new jobs or are still at an early stage of financial stability. With marriage and children will come expenses, such as daycare costs, school fees, mortgages or rent and other necessities. This will cause their spending power to decline over time. So, it’s safe to assume millennial-centric marketing might set you up for failure in the long run.

At the same time, we can’t ignore the fact that millennials are a challenging market. They take to technology like a fish to water. It sometimes feels like their first words have a hashtag attached and smartphones are an extra appendage. When marketing to millennials, what has worked for past generations doesn’t work for them. This is why brands need to adapt and adopt a different set of strategies to attract them.

Rather than targeting any specific age group, I think it’s more important to understand the next generation of business leaders and investors. So while there is too much hype around millennials and brands need to cut through it, it’s also very important for marketers to understand the behaviors, shopping patterns and work habits of this generation, as well as where they will be in a decade or two. The key lies in using that information to segment and power the proper type of marketing to each millennial category, rather than lumping them all of them into one big group, or, even worse, ignoring them altogether.

"Trump to sign GOP pledge, commit to back party nominee",http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-to-sign-gop-pledge-commit-to-back-party-nominee/2015/09/03/c5d9ea7c-5242-11e5-9812-92d5948a40f8_story.html,washpo,"GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump will sign a pledge Thursday to support the Republican nominee in next year’s general election, effectively ruling out a third-party or independent run, according to two Republicans familiar with the move. The promise, which Trump has long avoided making, brings him closer to a party whose rank-and-file activists he has thrilled this summer but whose leadership has at times viewed his rapid ascent with alarm, especially the prospect of an outside bid that could siphon away votes from the eventual standard-bearer. The Republicans familiar with Trump’s decision requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. They also said that Trump may have caveats or conditions upon signing that have not yet been shared beyond the businessman’s tight-knit inner circle. These Republicans said that even as Trump wants to be a team player and plans to abide by the pledge, his priority is to be treated with he often refers to as “respect” by the national GOP. If that relationship should ever sour, he could consider changing his mind. But for now, Trump’s embrace of the Republican Party is a victory for the officials who have been unsure about his political intentions. Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s campaign manager, declined to comment about whether Trump would put pen to paper later today, and cautioned that the billionaire contender can be unpredictable. “Only DJT speaks for DJT,” Lewandowski wrote in a text message to The Washington Post, referencing the candidate. Trump will make the announcement at an afternoon news conference at Trump Tower, his campaign headquarters in New York, where he will sign the loyalty statement alongside its author, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus. That appearance will follow a meeting with Priebus. One of the Republicans who has been briefed said Trump believes that pledge provides him with two political assets: increased pressure on his many rivals to give assurance that they will back him should he be the nominee, and possible new support from Republicans who so far have been wary of his reluctance to commit to supporting the GOP through the end of the 2016 race. For months, Republican leaders have been trying to prevent Trump, the real-estate mogul who has rocketed to the top of GOP polls, from running as an independent candidate if he does not win the Republican nomination. In the Aug. 6 debate in Cleveland, Trump memorably refused to rule out a third-party run, though he has since signaled a possible change of heart as some state parties are requiring loyalty oaths as a condition of appearing on their state’s primary ballots. RNC staffers reached out this week to campaigns requesting that their candidates sign a sheet pledging loyalty to the party’s eventual nominee, according to campaign officials. The one-page pledge is not a legal contract or binding. Rather, it is a political document and a symbol of Republican fealty. “I [name] affirm that if I do not win the 2016 Republican nomination for president of the United States I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is,” reads the document. “I further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party.” Former RNC chairman Jim Gilmore, who is one of 17 GOP presidential candidates, said he supports the national party’s push for candidates to pledge loyalty. “If someone is going to go to the party and ask for their support, if they’re going to ask the rank and file for their vote, that comes with an obligation for loyalty, in my mind,” said Gilmore, a former Virginia governor. “Generally speaking, if you want the party’s support, that loyalty should be there.” Michael Steele, another former RNC chairman, said Priebus had wanted to get Trump’s flirtation with a third-party run “cleared up” before the next debate, scheduled for Sept. 16 on CNN. “I appreciate what he is trying to do, trying to bring some level of order to this situation,” Steele said. “The expectation should be if you’re running to be nominee of the party, you should support the nominee of the party.” Steele added that Trump may have calculated that “there is no real upside to poking the party in the eye. He doesn’t want people to peel off from him because they don’t see him as being a team player. I think that’s the way he sees it.” Philip Rucker contributed reporting.",0.99999997045202194

Mortgage rates rise heading into holiday weekend,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/where-we-live/wp/2015/09/03/mortgage-rates-rise-heading-into-holiday-weekend/?wprss=rss_business,washpo,"(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press) Mortgage rates moved higher ahead of the holiday weekend, according to the latest data released Thursday by Freddie Mac. This week’s rise follows last week’s decline, and it seems unlikely that the market’s skittishness will abate soon. Besides the turmoil in the world economy, many observers are trying to figure out what the Federal Reserve will do later this month at its meeting. All this uncertainty is causing volatility in the mortgage market. The 30-year fixed-rate average climbed to 3.89 percent with an average 0.6 point. (Points are fees paid to a lender equal to 1 percent of the loan amount.) It was 3.84 percent a week ago and 4.1 percent a year ago. This was the sixth week in a row the 30-year fixed rate has stayed below 4 percent. The 15-year fixed-rate average rose to 3.09 percent with an average 0.6 point. It was 3.06 percent a week ago and 3.24 percent a year ago. [How borrowers can help make the mortgage application process go smoother] Hybrid adjustable rate mortgages were mixed. The five-year ARM average increased to 2.93 percent with an average 0.4 point. It was 2.9 percent a week ago and 2.97 percent a year ago. The one-year ARM average held steady at 2.62 percent with an average 0.3 point, same as it was a week ago. “ ‘Fasten your seat belts. It’s going to be a bumpy night,’ said Bette Davis in ‘All About Eve,’ ” Sean Becketti, Freddie Mac chief economist, said in a statement. He continued: “That could just as well have been Janet Yellen, or a specialist at the New York Stock Exchange, or the head of the People’s Bank of China on yet another week with lots of volatility on essentially no new information.” “The 30-year mortgage rate increased [five] basis points, but don’t read too much into that. The Fed took great pains at the Jackson Hole conference to keep all their options open and to avoid making too much — or too little — of the situation in China and the volatility in global equity markets. This Friday’s employment report is the last piece of significant, solid evidence the [Federal Open Market Committee] will have to consider before their September decision. [Wall Street] appears to be calling it a coin flip.

"For His Unconventional Campaign, Donald Trump Looks to an Unorthodox Manager",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/us/politics/donald-trump-corey-lewandowski-campaign-manager.html,nyt,"He was a lobbyist who represented one client who sought funds from the federal stimulus program and then another, a group backed by the Koch brothers, who opposed it. He was a political operative who once debated a cardboard cutout of the Democratic governor of New Hampshire to protest tax rates.

And he was a congressional aide who was arrested after he brought a gun to work, then sued when he did not get it back.

Perhaps not surprisingly, the campaign manager for Donald J. Trump’s unorthodox bid for president, Corey Lewandowski, a 40-year-old New Hampshire resident, does not have a conventional résumé.

In searching for someone to steer his effort, Mr. Trump went not to someone with a depth of experience in national elections, but to someone he appears to see as a kindred spirit: a deeply ambitious, sometimes-mercurial master of self-reinvention (he has also been a New Hampshire state public safety officer and a real estate agent). And, like Mr. Trump, exactly what his political leanings are beyond a belief in small government is uncertain.

Mr. Lewandowski’s unconventional background is matched by his unconventional approach to managing a campaign.

While some candidates look for a manager who will rein in their impulses, Mr. Lewandowski channels them. He is not interested in telling Mr. Trump what to do or in being a master strategist. His greatest attribute, Mr. Trump said in an interview, is that “he knows when to speak up.”

“He leaves me alone, but he knows when to make his presence felt,” Mr. Trump said.

Mr. Lewandowski spends his days traveling with the candidate or working out of his boss’s Trump Tower headquarters in Manhattan, putting together the schedules, speaking with organizers in early-voting states and handling a staff that is mostly based elsewhere.

At one point, Mr. Lewandowski was part of the fabric of establishment Washington, working for former Representative Bob Ney of Ohio, and, later, with the Republican National Committee.

But, said David N. Bossie, president of the conservative group Citizens United, who helped connect the candidate with his campaign manager, Mr. Lewandowski “is as antiestablishment as Mr. Trump.”

He is also relatively parochial, having spent most of his life in New England.

Even now, he tries to get home as much as he can to New Hampshire, where he lives with his family, and where the many Republicans who know him or know of him decline to speak ill of him for the record, even as a few privately question whether he is playing at a level that is over his head.

Mr. Trump, who rarely brings new people into his small circle of advisers, has been content to let Mr. Lewandowski consolidate power after the departure of Roger J. Stone Jr., a long-serving adviser. Mr. Stone has said that he has taken issue with the tone that the campaign had begun to take, but that he still supports Mr. Trump.

Mr. Trump told one friend that he liked Mr. Lewandowski “because he doesn’t get emotional.”

But that is not a view that is universally shared about Mr. Lewandowski, who is known to have a temper and who had a mixed reputation at Americans for Prosperity, the group sponsored by Charles G. and David H. Koch he first represented as a lobbyist and for which he later went to work.

He held various jobs in the Kochs’ political world, including as a state director in New Hampshire and, last year, as the head of a national voter registration drive. He promoted the Kochs’ views of small government, which led to his stunt debating a cardboard cutout of Gov. John Lynch of New Hampshire on national tax day in 2010.

After seven years with Americans for Prosperity, Mr. Lewandowski moved on, leaving behind some fans who found him to be efficient and effective, but also some detractors, who found his abrasiveness off-putting.

Mr. Lewandowski is hardly media-shy — he has been a frequent CNN guest promoting Mr. Trump’s candidacy — but he is not eager to discuss himself. He declined requests for an interview.

Two of his former bosses described him as less of an innovator than an executor.

“I would have positions, and he would carry them out,” recalled Mr. Ney, the former congressman, who was ensnared in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal, and whose 1998 race was managed by Mr. Lewandowski.

A tall, reedy man with the features of a young Robert Duvall in “To Kill a Mockingbird,” with close-cropped hair, pale skin and dark circles under his eyes, Mr. Lewandowski began his political career in his hometown, Lowell, Mass., when he ran unsuccessfully for a state legislative seat in 1994.

A few years later, he ended up working for Mr. Ney.

“I remember he was doing the interview, and he had a frayed cuff” on his shirt, Mr. Ney recalled. “And I thought, ‘That’s just a regular working guy.’ ”

After the election, Mr. Lewandowski went to work in Washington as Mr. Ney’s chief of staff, and made headlines when he brought an unloaded gun into a House office building in the bottom of his laundry bag. He was charged with a misdemeanor. He said it was an accident, and his lawsuit, charging that he had been denied due process when his gun was taken away, was thrown out by a judge.

After Mr. Ney was convicted of corruption charges in the Abramoff scandal and forced to resign in 2006, Mr. Lewandowski wrote a letter to the court defending him.

“I know the true Bob Ney,” Mr. Lewandowski wrote. Years later, Mr. Ney said, his parents still ask about Mr. Lewandowski, who was seen as a member of their family.

In 2002, Mr. Lewandowski managed the re-election effort of Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who had a complicated history with the Republican Party and who had switched his affiliation to independent when he ran for president for a short while in 2000.

By the time Mr. Lewandowski joined the re-election effort, establishment Republicans were trying replace Mr. Smith with Representative John E. Sununu, the son of a former governor.

“To the best of my knowledge, he had never managed anything at the level of the Senate prior to me,” Mr. Smith said, recalling Mr. Lewandowski. “We lost, but I don’t blame him for that.”

During that race, the Smith camp raised questions about Mr. Sununu’s credibility as a supporter of Israel (he has a Lebanese background), criticisms that the congressman’s allies saw as having anti-Arab undertones.

After Mr. Smith had lost, and with Mr. Lewandowski’s relationship to the party establishment deeply frayed, he held different jobs, including working with the New Hampshire Department of Public Safety.

He then became a lobbyist with the government affairs firm Schwartz Communications in Massachusetts, taking on some clients interested in the stimulus spending program proposed by President Obama and enacted by congressional Democrats to help the economy recover from the financial meltdown of 2008.

Another client was Americans for Prosperity, which has criticized the stimulus spending.

Mr. Lewandowski worked closely with the group as it tried to establish a foothold in New Hampshire, and eventually went to work for it full time.

Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, said in a statement that Mr. Lewandowski was “valued” and that “he left on good terms.”

But he also had his enemies, who recall some controversies around his tenure, including over his efforts to oversee the group’s national voter registration drive for the 2014 midterm election, according to people who spoke on the condition of anonyity to discuss internal business.

Despite Mr. Lewandowski’s connections to the Koch brothers’ world, Mr. Trump, like several other candidates, has not been invited to the group’s recent donor network gatherings.

Mr. Trump has told friends he was surprised by the snub, describing the Kochs as “good friends.”

As for his campaign manager, Mr. Trump insisted that he had to woo Mr. Lewandowski away from Americans for Prosperity. But even then, he suggested, he made clear that he was going to decide for himself how he was going to run.

“This is going to be a different kind of campaign,” he told his new hire.",0.99998900194164553
Patriots rookie DE Trey Flowers won't let injuries slow him down,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/sports/~3/4Af_GZ7IJYE/,fox,"New England Patriots rookie defensive end Trey Flowers got off to a great start in his first NFL preseason. He recorded a sack on arguably the best quarterback in the league, Aaron Rodgers, in his first NFL action.

More impressively, it came against the team's starting left tackle, David Bakhtiari. Shortly thereafter, though, Flowers left the game with a shoulder injury.

""It was a pretty good start [to the preseason],"" Flowers said, via Jeff Howe of the Boston Herald. ""I came out there, tried to do the best I can, just worked hard, made sure I prepared for the first preseason game. I went down with a minor injury, but I did everything, the protocol the doctors and everyone wanted me to do, and got back out there as soon as possible.""

Flowers did miss time due to the shoulder injury, but he was able to make his way back onto the field for the game against the Carolina Panthers. Although he didn't record a sack as he did in the first preseason game, he still showed the ability to pressure the quarterback.

""I'm just trying to take it one day at a time, getting myself ready, working on myself, diving into the playbook, working on my technique and things like that,"" Flowers said. ""I'm not worried about the depth chart. I'm just trying to get better myself.""

He figures to play a fairly big role for the Patriots this season, even as a fourth-round rookie. He'll be in the pass rush rotation and should see opportunities in passing situations. For now, he's just working on refining his game and preparing for the regular season.

Buzz Cut: • First in Fox News First: Walker PAC rolls out first ad • Pleading insanity: Hillary’s campaign woes mount • Baier Tracks: Hey, Joe… • High stakes poker at Trump Tower • Because what could go wrong with a pet cobra?  

FIRST IN FOX NEWS FIRST: WALKER PAC ROLLS OUT FIRST AD The super PAC backing the candidacy of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker debuts today its first ad for its multi-million-dollar Iowa ad barrage. The spot from Unintimidated PAC touts the governor’s “decisive action” in Wisconsin taking on big labor in 2011 as an example of Walker’s ability to “fight and win.” “Our big bold reforms here in Wisconsin,” Walker says in the ad, “Took the power out of the hands of the big government special interests and put them firmly into the hands of the hard-working taxpayers. Now more than ever America needs a president who will fight and win for America” The ad is part of a $7 million Iowa buy and will begin airing Tuesday. Betting big on South Carolina - Unintimidated PAC plans to spend a total of more than $9 million boosting Walker in South Carolina, New Hampshire and Nevada before nominating contests in each state, WSJ reports. “The super PAC is devoting the bulk of the new spending, more than $8 million, to advertising in South Carolina.” PLEADING INSANITY: HILLARY’S CAMPAIGN WOES MOUNT Imagine that it’s the day of Hillary Clinton’s defiant March press conference at the United Nations in which she dismissed any claims of mishandling sensitive material or taking any undue risks. If we had told you then that the biggest story six months later would be her IT guy invoking his right to not incriminate himself in an ongoing FBI probe into her sketchy server, what would you have said? How about “Yikes!” You would have figured that her candidacy had sustained tremendous, perhaps irreparable damage. And you would have been right. The substance here matters. People here say the Clintons always survive because of her husband’s multiple near-death political experiences. But those things were about the pleasures of the flesh and his own weaknesses. What got him out of trouble as a candidate and in his impeachment was that Democrats could say that Republicans are sex-obsessed weirdos, and do so with a wink and a nudge. The Clinton mojo only worked because of the underlying subject. A senior aide invoking his constitutional right against self-incrimination is a big deal no matter what – just imagine if this were Jeb Bush’s or Scott Walker’s IT guy. But it’s consequence grows exponentially when the underlying substance involves potential for criminal charges for the mishandling of state secrets and exposing them to our enemies abroad because of Hillary Clinton’s desire to keep her own communications secret from her political enemies here at home. That’s not something that a campaign can wave away as prurient or misplaced. We add to that the allegations of payola, reinforced today by the discovery of emails from Clinton pushing to help a company that would hire her husband months later and pay him more than $16 million. Clinton’s campaign has been saying for months that the damage from these ongoing scandals will abate once Republicans are judged to be overplaying their hands. On national security and corruption, the table limits are pretty high. Clinton with her brazen response in March that she destroyed evidence she claims would clear her name certainly looks like the one who has done the overplaying here. Emails show Hillary helping firm that paid Bubba big bucks - Inside Higher Ed: “On the campaign trail Hillary Clinton has been critical of for-profit colleges and has called for tougher regulation of the sector. During her first year as secretary of state, however, Clinton pushed for the inclusion of a large for-profit education company at a higher education policy dinner hosted at the U.S. Department of State. Clinton wrote in an email to a top aide that she wanted to add Laureate Education to the guest list for the event. Describing Laureate as ‘the fastest growing college network in the world,’ Clinton said the company was ‘started by Doug Becker who Bill likes a lot.’ ""It's a for-profit model that should be represented,"" she added in the August 2009 email. A senior vice president at Laureate was added to the guest list, a separate email shows. Former President Bill Clinton several months later became an honorary chancellor for Laureate International Universities, a role for which he was paid $16.5 million between 2010 and 2014. Clinton stepped down from the position earlier this year.” BAIER TRACKS: HEY, JOE… “When one of your aides decides to plead the Fifth to avoid answering questions about setting up your personal computer server that is now in FBI custody, it’s not the best news for your political campaign. When your main ally on the Benghazi committee that is investigating you offers this explanation to the Washington Post – ‘ranking Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), said about the Clinton aide’s decision, ‘Although multiple legal experts agree there is no evidence of criminal activity, it is certainly understandable that this witness’s attorneys advised him to assert his Fifth Amendment rights, especially given the onslaught of wild and unsubstantiated accusations by Republican presidential candidates, members of Congress and others based on false leaks about the investigation’ – you know there is an issue. And when every day seems to bring another nugget from the mining of information in the released emails, you can probably expect another challenger in the form of the current Vice President very soon.” – Bret Baier Biden fired up in stump speech - WashEx: “Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday was scheduled for a Miami speech on the importance of community colleges, but ended up delivering a rousing address on how to strengthen the middle class and renew the American dream, one that’s likely to fuel more speculation that Biden will soon enter the 2016 race for the White House. The swirl of speculation about his entrance into the presidential race, especially at a speech in the critical swing state of Florida, wasn’t lost on the vice president.” Early Hillary backer Cuomo now says Biden run good for Dems - The Hill: “New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), who endorsed Hillary Clinton months ago, said Wednesday that a Joe Biden run could be good for Democrats. ‘If he did run, I think all Democrats would be in a bind, because they’d have a choice of a number of good candidates,’ Cuomo said in Manhattan, according to multiple reports. ‘But that’s a good situation to be in, right?’ he added. Cuomo’s comments came following an event at New York University when he was asked if he would be ‘in a bind’ over whom to support in the race, The New York Times noted.” Redford: Dem race is bland, boring and empty - “I’m glad [Donald Trump is] in there because him being the way he is, and saying what he says the way he says it, I think shakes things up and I think that’s very needed. Because on the other side it’s so bland, it’s so boring, it’s so empty.” – Actor Robert Redford in an interview with Larry King. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… History: “[On this day in 1935] A new land-speed record is set by Britain’s famed speed demon, Sir Malcolm Campbell. On the Bonneville Salt Flats of Utah, Campbell and his 2,500-hp motor car Bluebird made two runs over a one-mile course at speeds averaging 301.129 mph. In breaking the 300-mph barrier, he surpassed the world record of 276.82 mph that he had set earlier in the year…Sir Malcolm went on to set three more consecutive land-speed records at Daytona Beach: 253.968 mph in 1932, 272.465 mph in 1933, and 276.710 mph in early 1935. Seeking a surface fast enough to propel him over the 300-mph mark, Campbell took Bluebird to the searing Bonneville Salt Flats of Utah, where the very level, smooth flats are as solid as concrete by summer’s end. On September 3, 1935, he set a new record of 301.129 mph. The attempt almost ended in disaster when Bluebird suffered a burst tire near the end of the first run, but Campbell managed to maintain control and then make the requisite second run within the hour.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT? Email FoxNewsFirst@FOXNEWS.COM POLL CHECK Real Clear Politics Averages Obama Job Approval: Approve – 44.7 percent//Disapprove – 51.4 percent Directions of Country: Right Direction – 28.7 percent//Wrong Track – 63.3 percent HIGH STAKES POKER AT TRUMP TOWER It’s not unreasonable for a party to avoid devoting energy to the campaign of a person who might sabotage its chances. After all, parties are designed to win elections, not be ideological vessels or to advance individuals. But the pledge being circulated to the GOP campaigns from the Republican National Committee is definitely a dagger pointed at Donald Trump’s heart. Other candidates are stampeding to sign up today to show they’re committed to breaking the party’s presidential drought next year. Trump has called a press conference for this afternoon at his Manhattan fortress and RNC Chairman Reince Priebus is headed to Trump’s tower to make the case for party unity. Unlike most politicians, with Trump we can hardly guess what he’ll ever do. As Fox News colleague Serafin Gomez reported, the plan for a loyalty oath had been in the works for weeks. It’s tricky stuff. If he signs it, as Politico reports he will, Trump loses, as he called it, his leverage and some of his appeal as a dangerous man. Plus, his scoring standard changes and his various apostate views -- tax increases, Planned Parenthood funding, his support for impeaching George W. Bush for the Iraq war -- become bigger deals. Trump wants to be judged as an independent running as a Republican, not a Republican, per se. If he is being scored for loyalty and consistency, things get dicier. But, depending on what his response is and what the enforcement mechanisms are, not signing would almost certainly keep him from the nomination and the presidency, but if he chose to burn down the GOP starting tomorrow he could certainly help deliver the White House back to the Clintons. Club for Growth might go for Trump blitz - The Hill: “Fresh from Club for Growth’s Twitter fight with Trump on Tuesday night, the group’s president David McIntosh wants to warn every conservative voter he can about the economic policies of the GOP front-runner…Asked how far he would go to destroy Trump’s candidacy; McIntosh would not rule out using Club for Growth’s super-PAC to blitz the billionaire during the lead up to the primaries.” [Trump could’ve been even richer, says National Journal. How so? By doing nothing but watching his inheritance grow.] The Judge’s Ruling: Immigration debate gets ugly - Citing the Constitution’s protection of travel as a natural right, Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano says: “Hispanics here without documentation are being demonized because of the politics of nativism. Nativism -- we are exceptional; we are better people than they are; we were here first -- is very dangerous and leads to ugly results.” Read more here. Carson’s $9 million summer - USA Today: “Dr. Ben Carson, who is surging in Republican presidential polls, also is raking in campaign dollars. Officials with the retired neurosurgeon’s campaign say they have collected $9 million in July and August, a time when political fundraising typically slows. The summer haul means Carson’s total fundraising has hit nearly $20 million.” Cruz woos Jews in Florida ahead of Iran vote - Miami Herald: “Texas Sen. Ted Cruz came to South Florida to woo Jewish donors as Congress prepares to vote on President Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran. And while he didn't hold any public events -- and doesn’t plan to anytime soon -- Cruz said in a phone interview with the Miami Herald…‘We have tremendous support in Florida, and I have been very, very encouraged. We’ve been down to Florida quite a number of times,’ he said.” Kasich backs off on minimum wage hike - WaPo: “At his first two events of a two-day New Hampshire swing, Gov. John Kasich (R-Ohio) drew a mix of Republican voters, independents and curious Democrats. At the home of Republican donors, and at a historic general store in this town, he talked at length about how he worked with both parties, and how reforming government programs didn't mean shredding them. He did the same earlier in Michigan, even telling a reporter that he favored a ""reasonable"" federal minimum wage, and that Ohio's $8.10 -- higher than the federal wage -- made sense locally. But after a town hall here, Kasich rebuffed the idea of raising the federal minimum wage. He told reporters that any increase in the minimum wage should be done state by state, but that it should obviously increase.” POWER PLAY: ROGINSKY TAKES FIVE Democratic strategist and all-around smart person Julie Roginsky says her party is in good shape to retake the Senate next year despite the bruising defeats of 2014.

Wesh: “A king cobra has reportedly escaped from its owner in the Orlando area, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The escaped king cobra was reported Wednesday by its owner, who is a licensed and bonded to care for exotic animals, but the snake actually went missing Tuesday, officials said. The privately owned, non-native, venomous snake was reported to have escaped from its cage at a home in the 4800 block of North Apopka Vineland Road in Orlando. ‘It wasn’t deliberately let out from what we can see. Looks like it escaped its cage it was in,’ said Capt. Chris Roszkowiak of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The snake is approximately 8 feet and is green and yellow. A permit is required to possess a king cobra and owners are required to report escaped animals immediately. The owner, Mike Kennedy, is an exotic animal dealer and star of the Discovery Channel reality show ‘Airplane Repo.’ Officials said he could face criminal penalties for not telling authorities about the escape immediately.” AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “…It used to be if you were a police officer in a confrontation your instant one thought would be how do I escape alive? How do I protect the people?  Now he has to think, how is this going to look on video.  How will I be treated tonight in the evening news and how will I be ultimately treated by the legal system. And once you have to add that factor, the policeman is defenseless.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

Almost a million miles into his time in office, Vice President Joe Biden ticked through his foreign policy bona fides on Thursday in Florida as he argued for the White House's position on the Iranian nuclear deal amid speculation that he might launch a presidential bid of his own.

""I’ve traveled, as of today, 992,894 miles for the president. I’ve met with virtually every major leader in the world. I know these guys, I know them better than anybody in the administration because I’ve been hanging around so long,"" Biden said in an open-press meeting with Jewish business leaders in the Miami suburb of Davie, Florida.

And there's one question he said he always gets, whether it's from Israel or China or any other country.

""You know the one question I get asked all the time, no matter whether I’m trying to work out something with Poroshenko in Kyiv, whether I’m sitting with Bibi in his home in Tel Aviv, whether I’m down in with Dilma in Brazil, whether I’m with Xi for five hours in Beijing. As I make my case about what U.S. policy should be and why they should agree with it, you know the one question I get, every single person, friend and foe?"" Biden said. ""Can you do it?

If the United States reneges on the Iran deal because of a ""dysfunctional"" Congress, Biden suggested, it would send the wrong message to the rest of the world.

""Your government is dysfunctional,"" Biden said leaders tell him. ""Can you deliver?""

Biden, who recounted his work on nuclear non-proliferation with the Soviet Union as a senator, remarked that in his 42 years in public life, he could not think of a ""single time ... where our ability to conduct foreign policy has been so strained because of the dysfunction of Washington and the Congress.”

Playing up his previous skepticism on the Iran deal, Biden reiterated that he takes a ""backseat to no one"" on his support of Israel.

""I don’t blame you if you don’t agree with my view, but that’s the only of thing I don’t have a lot of time for, is the idea we can’t do business with bad guys,"" he said.

Renowned Stanford professor launches new education think tank,http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/renowned-stanford-professor-launches-new-education-think-tank/2015/09/03/114424be-522f-11e5-933e-7d06c647a395_story.html,washpo,"Renowned Stanford education professor Linda Darling-Hammond is launching a new think tank aimed at shaping education policies nationwide. With offices in Palo Alto, Calif., and Washington, the new Learning Policy Institute will seek to link research and policy, two worlds that are too often disconnected, Darling-Hammond said. “It is time to get serious about how to support and enable our education system to respond to the massive changes in learning that some other nation’s systems have been addressing more systemically, with much better results, over the last two decades,” Darling-Hammond wrote in the Huffington Post on Thursday. A former teacher, Darling-Hammond has testified often before Congress and was an adviser to Barack Obama during his 2008 campaign and transition to the presidency. But she has since been critical of the administration’s education policies, particularly the push to judge schools and teachers based on standardized tests that she argues fail to adequately measure students’ critical thinking and deeper learning. She is seen as an ally of the teachers’ unions, but in announcing her new think tank, Darling-Hammond emphasized that it will be an independent advocate for policies shown by research to improve learning for children. “We will follow the evidence wherever it leads, and will work with those of any political affiliation or point of view who share that commitment,” she wrote. Darling-Hammond will serve as the Institute’s president and chief executive. Now an emeritus professor at Stanford, she will continue to teach part-time at its graduate school of education. The executive director is Patrick M. Shields, who previously led education work at SRI International, a nonprofit independent research outfit headquartered in Silicon Valley. The Learning Policy Institute will conduct its own research and will synthesize and communicate the work of others. It has an initial budget of $5 million and expects to hire between 30 and 50 staff members, according to EdSource, a Web site for California education news. Funders include the San Francisco-based Sandler Foundation, as well as the Atlantic Philanthropies and the Ford Foundation, the S.D. Bechtel Jr. Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the Stuart Foundation. The organization will focus on research to inform “pressing policy questions” at the local, state and federal levels, according to Darling-Hammond. She wrote Thursday that the nation’s public schools must be transformed into a system that asks children to think deeply and critically, and that assesses them “authentically” — i.e., not with multiple-choice tests. Darling-Hammond — who once spoke of the nation’s “aggressive neglect” of its children — has also long urged policymakers to pay more attention to equity in public schools and to the deepening problem of child poverty in America. She said those will continue to be important themes for the Learning Policy Institute. “Today, the U.S. system provides the most unequal educational inputs and outcomes in the industrialized world,” she wrote in the Huffington Post. “Inequality is the single most fundamental reason for our country’s lackluster performance.”",0.32383500608384663
Former Clinton aide will not testify in House probe: lawmaker,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/MostRead/~3/VGlWop5KbTw/story01.htm,reuters,"WASHINGTON A former U.S. State Department staff member who worked for Hillary Clinton will not testify before U.S. lawmakers probing the former top diplomat and the 2012 attacks on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, according to a congressional memo.

Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, was secretary of state at the time of the attacks, in which four Americans were killed. The Republican-led House Select Committee is investigating the incident as well as Clinton's use of a private email during her tenure.

In a memo released on Thursday, the ranking Democrat on the committee said lawyers for the information technology aide, Bryan Pagliano, earlier this week told lawmakers he was invoking his constitutional right not to testify.

""The letter from Mr. Pagliano's attorneys expresses concern about 'the current political environment,'"" U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings said in the memo to fellow Democrats on the committee. It was dated Wednesday and released publicly on Thursday.

Clinton's campaign said in a statement that she had encouraged current and former aides to answer questions and ""be as helpful as possible,"" according to the Washington Post.

Her use of a private email server based at her house in the New York area while secretary of state has become a controversial issue as she seeks the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in the November 2016 election.

MSNBC reported Pagliano set up the email server in 2009.

According to the Washington Post, he previously worked on Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. Two other committees in the U.S. Senate have also contacted him in the past week, the newspaper reported, citing a copy of the lawyers' letter.

Republican Representative Trey Gowdy, head of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, last month issued the subpoena for Pagliano to appear to give a deposition to the committee.

Representatives for Gowdy as well as Pagliano's lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment.

Clinton is scheduled to appear before the committee on Sept. 22. Two of her other aides are scheduled to testify this week, the Post said, citing her campaign.

Alcoa plans new R&D center for advanced 3D printing processes,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/cyclicalconsumergoodsNews/~3/tuor5AjpCp4/metals-alcoa-idUSL1N1181N620150903,reuters,"CHICAGO, Sept 3 Metals company Alcoa Inc

said on Thursday it will invest $60 million to expand its

research and development center in Pennsylvania to explore ways

to make 3D printing viable on an industrial scale to produce

parts for the aerospace, automotive and construction sectors.

The move is part of New York-based Alcoa's strategy of

investing in more advanced aerospace and automotive products

while selling off some of its more traditional yet costly

smelting facilities.

Also known as additive printing, 3D printers build

three-dimensional metal parts by layering and heating metal

alloy powder, which are then treated in a forge to make them

stronger.

The 3D process has been used to build prototypes for 25

years, but only now is making its way into regular production.

Alcoa's chief technology officer, Ray Kilmer, said the

current available alloys are expensive, and part of the focus of

the expanded R&D center will be to explore new aluminum,

titanium, nickel and other metal alloys.

""The (alloy) powders need to be improved upon, they need to

be cost effective, and they need to work better in the additive

printing process,"" Kilmer said. ""What's new now is the machines

are getting better, faster and cheaper. Alcoa is stepping into

the process so we can get the performance and the cost to where

they need to be.""

Kilmer said additive printing could be used to manufacture

anything from fasteners to wheels and jet engine turbine blades.

The R&D center would also look at different additive printing

technologies and ways to reduce the waste of costly metal alloys

that occurs in traditional manufacturing processes.

Construction on the new facility is due to be completed in

the first quarter of 2016.

Proponents of 3D printing say it can help aircraft

manufacturers cut the cost of parts made from titanium, which

costs seven times more than aluminum.

Norwegian titanium component manufacturer Norsk Titanium AS

recently announced plans to establish the world's first

industrial-scale 3D printing facility in the United States.

U.S. conglomerate General Electric Co has said it

will introduce its first 3D-printed parts in an aircraft engine

platform in 2016, saying that the lighter and simpler parts will

improve engine performance.

Benghazi panel interviews former Clinton chief of staff,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/k-LOhEz6eKk/,fox,"mboxCreate('FoxNews-Politics-Autoplay-Videos-In-Articles');

A former top aide to Hillary Clinton was brought in by the House committee probing the deadly Benghazi attacks to answer questions Thursday in a closed-door deposition, as her role in the former secretary of state's inner circle comes into focus with the latest release of Clinton emails. 

Meeting behind closed doors, members of the panel were questioning Cheryl Mills, Clinton's former chief of staff. Jake Sullivan, another former top aide who now works on Clinton's presidential campaign, was set to be interviewed on Friday. Both sessions are off limits to the public. 

Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, chairman of the Benghazi committee, said that Mills ""is no different from any other witnesses"" who also have been interviewed in private. 

The panel was likely to ask Mills about her role in preparing ""talking points"" for Obama administration officials following the 2012 attack on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi, Libya that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya. 

Questions also were likely to focus on Clinton's use of a private email account and server while she was secretary of state. 

Recently released emails make clear that Mills, as chief of staff, was an active member of Clinton's inner circle -- her name appears more than 2,200 times in emails released so far. 

The interview with Mills comes as a former State Department employee who helped Clinton set up the private email server said he will assert his Fifth Amendment right not to testify before the Benghazi panel and other congressional panels. 

Attorneys for Bryan Pagliano sent the committee a letter Monday saying their client would not testify at a hearing planned for next week. The panel subpoenaed Pagliano last month. 

The congressional committee was launched last year to investigate the Obama administration's response to the Benghazi attacks, but the probe has widened in recent months to focus on Clinton's use of a private email account and server. 

Clinton has dismissed both controversies as ""partisan games."" Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Clinton's campaign, said in a statement Thursday that Clinton and her team ""have been confident from the beginning that Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email was allowed and that she did not send or receive anything marked classified, facts confirmed by the State Department and the inspector general"" for the State Department. 

Clinton ""has made every effort to answer questions and be as helpful as possible, and has encouraged her aides, current and former, to do the same, including Bryan Pagliano,"" Merrill said. 

Clinton is set to testify before the Benghazi panel next month.

(Photo by Ross Kinnaird/Getty Images) RICHMOND -- Donald Trump said Thursday morning that signing a loyalty pledge designed to block him from running for president as an independent would give him the best shot at winning the Republican primary. Asked by conservative radio show host John Fredericks if he would sign a statement that the Republican National Committee circulated to presidential candidates Wednesday, Trump said he would make a final decision after a meeting Thursday with RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. “It is possible. We’re going to have a meeting,” Trump said. Already leading in the polls, Trump said he believes his popularity would increase should he rule out a third-party bid. He even appeared to slip at one point and say point-blank that he would sign the pledge. “There are those that say you go up if you do, and I’m not doing it for that. I’m doing it for – I mean, we’re going to see what happens, we have a meeting – but certainly it would be advantageous to do it that way, and I think our best chance for victory is to do it that way. But I’m going to have to hear the chairman out,” he said. The RNC pledge is similar to statements some state parties routinely ask candidates at all levels of elected office to sign. The Virginia GOP has had a version of the pledge and plans to discuss a proposal for presidential hopefuls at a meeting later this month. The move is widely seen as an attempt to box in Trump, but Virginia GOP Chairman John Whitbeck said it is intended to motivate Republican activists. Trump said he’ll probably announce his decision Thursday at a 2 p.m. news conference. “Look, my number one thing is to win, and the best way to win is as a Republican,” he said. “The third party thing is a tough thing, it’s a tough route. And I believe that it can be done, but it’s a tougher route, it’s a riskier route. And certainly it would give Hillary, or whoever’s going to be running on the other side, a better shot, let’s face it.

PAI is stepping up preparations to sell Swedish chemicals firm

Perstorp to take advantage of still-buoyant corporate valuations

and has completed its line-up of advisers, several people

familiar with the transaction said.

The buyout group has picked Morgan Stanley, Nordea

and Carnegie to lead a potential stock market listing

hired HSBC to sound out potential industrial and

private equity buyers.

Reuters reported in July that PAI was mulling a listing of

more than 1.5 billion euros ($1.69 billion) including debt.

Perstorp makes feed additives, biodiesel and chemical

products for plastics and for coatings, including films for

shatterproof car windshields and scratch-resistant coatings for

cellphones.

One of the sources said China's Sinochem and some private

equity firms had made tentative bids. Another source said the

sales process had been put on hold since PAI had concluded a

listing would mean a higher valuation than a straight sale.

PAI and Perstorp declined to comment. The banks either

declined to comment or did not immediately respond to a request

Lions RB Ameer Abdullah: 'It's great having Joique back',http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/sports/~3/gqmkdrwSUP0/,fox,"There's plenty of talent in the Detroit Lions' offensive backfield, but that doesn't mean the running backs are unwilling to share the spotlight. In a blog on the team's official website, second-round rookie Ameer Abdullah celebrated Joique Bell's return from the physically unable to perform (PUP) list earlier this week.

""It's great having Joique back,"" Abdullah wrote on DetroitLions.com. ""He's like the spirit lifter in the group. He's always joking around, goofy. To have someone on the field who can calm your nerves sometimes when things may be going crazy, it's good. It's always good to have a veteran there to help you out when you need that experience. Theo [Riddick] and George [Winn] have been great, but Joique definitely has a lot of experience in this league. Getting him back has really helped us with our spirits and we have been more confident.""

The Lions have an interesting blend of ability at running back, starting with the veteran starter. Bell (5-11, 231 lbs.) is the biggest of the backs and has the most experience with over 3,000 yards from scrimmage through five NFL seasons. Abdullah looks like the team's featured back of the future, though, and Riddick will get his reps as a third-down back.

Abdullah writes that the Lions' running backs can be ""one of the best units in the league"" in his blog. The key will be to make strategic use of the diverse personnel. It'll be interesting to see how Detroit mixes up the touches between Bell, Abdullah and Riddick in 2015.

Detroit Lions defensive tackle Haloti Ngata is getting used to his new home, but he hasn't forgotten the team that dealt him away this offseason. The Baltimore Ravens traded Ngata away in the spring, leaving a little bit of a chip on the big lineman's shoulder.

""Yeah, a little bit,"" Ngata said, per Carlos Monarrez of the Detroit Free Press. ""You want to kind of show your old team they're missing out.

""But it is a business and so they had to do what they had to do and I got traded. So you've just got to look forward to the new opportunity and do the most with it that you can.""

Ngata, 31, was a force for nine years with the Ravens. He anchored one of the league's fiercest defenses at 6-foot-4 and 345 pounds, making five consecutive Pro Bowls from 2009-2013. A former first-round draft pick (2006, 12th overall), Ngata has started 133 of a possible 144 games and collected 25.5 sacks along the way.

This week, Ngata returned to the practice field after spending most of the summer on the non-football injury (NFI) list with a hamstring injury. Although he is entering the twilight of his career, there may be just enough fuel in the tank to make Baltimore regret the decision to trade him.

Bush says he'd back Trump as Republican presidential candidate,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/4oCnw98Ff_Y/story01.htm,reuters,"WASHINGTON Jeb Bush said on Thursday he would back fellow Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump if the businessman-turned-politician wins the party's nomination for the 2016 presidential election and Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee.

Asked if he would support Trump as Republican nominee over Clinton in the November 2016 contest, Bush said, ""I would, of course.""

""We need to be unified. We need to win,"" Bush, the former Florida governor, said in an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" television program, one day after Trump told the same show he would back Bush over Clinton.

Bush and Trump have been engaged in public attacks on each another as they vie for the party's nomination.

Trump has spent weeks taunting Bush, one of his closest rivals in public opinion polls in the large Republican field. The real estate mogul and television personality has mocked Bush as ""low-energy,"" and this week criticized him for answering a question in Spanish.

The Bush campaign initially had avoided engaging in a war of words with Trump. But on Wednesday, Bush's advisers signaled a new effort to fight back with campaign ads and social media efforts.

On Thursday, Bush took issue with Trump's tactics and called on his rival to tone down his attacks. Trump has made controversial remarks about immigration and Latinos. Bush, whose wife was born in Mexico, told ABC that diversity adds vitality to the country.

""I think Donald Trump trying to insult his way to the presidency is not going to work. People want an uplifting, hopeful message,"" he said.

Bush added that Trump should ""figure out a way to lessen the divisive language, the hurtful language and talk about the aspirations of the American people, rather than trying to prey on their fears.""

Reuters/Ipsos polling shows Trump with support among nearly 31 percent of self-identified Republicans as of Sept. 1, with Bush garnering support among nearly 12 percent, behind former neurosurgeon Ben Carson.

Trump expected to sign Republican loyalty pledge Thursday: report,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/ojHLn_Yu25E/story01.htm,reuters,"WASHINGTON U.S. presidential hopeful Donald Trump is expected on Thursday to pledge that he will not run as an independent candidate if he loses the Republican Party's nomination, ABC News reported, citing a source familiar with Trump's conversations with the party.

Trump, a real estate mogul, has suggested he would consider an independent run if Republicans did not nominate him as their candidate. The Republican National Committee has asked its pool of 17 candidates to sign a loyalty pledge to ensure future party unity.

ABC News reported that Trump has not told Republican leaders directly how he planned to handle the pledge, but a Trump spokeswoman said he would make a decision Thursday.

One of Trump's key rivals, Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Thursday he would back Trump if the businessman-turned-politician won the party's nomination for the 2016 presidential election and Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee.

Trump, on the same program, also said he would back Bush over Clinton.

Trump made the stunning decision to avoid complications in getting listed on primary ballots.

By

Mike Allen

09/03/15, 09:47 AM EDT

A close associate tells POLITICO that Donald Trump plans to sign a loyalty pledge Thursday that would bind him to endorse the Republican nominee, and would preclude a third-party run. Trump made the stunning decision, which he has long resisted, to avoid complications in getting listed on primary ballots, and to take away an attack line in the next debate, the associate said.

Trump, who has led the GOP field in poll after poll, has long viewed the threat of a third-party candidacy as priceless leverage – and even used that word when he refused to take such a pledge in the first debate, on Aug. 6.

So his decision to give it up is a sign that he increasingly wants to show his campaign is real and not a stunt. The colorful magnate is also trying to make that point by adding staff in key states, issuing position papers, and pursuing access to primary ballots throughout the country.

Trump is certainly unpredictable, and campaign manager Corey Lewandowski would not confirm the plan. “I don’t think you can ‘expect’ ANYTHING from Mr. Trump,” Lewandowski said in a phone interview.

But the close associate said Trump has decided to give the completed pledge to Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus during a meeting at Trump Tower shortly after 1 p.m. today. Trump is scheduled to hold a news conference on an unspecified topic at 2 p.m.

“The rationale is that they have treated him fairly,” the associate said, echoing the criterion Trump has long given for taking a party pledge. “He’s willing to sign it to avert any problems with is state filings – South Carolina asked for a pledge to support the nominee if you’re on the ballot.

“He’s been treated fairly, like any candidate. ... And it takes away a line of attack for debates.”

Priebus will be accompanied by RNC chief strategist Sean Spicer, who has been closely involved in the negotiations.

The meeting has been delicately choreographed. The RNC waited to circulate the pledge until it looked like Trump was on board, and Priebus would not go to Trump’s turf if he thought there was a chance he could be embarrassed.

A top Republican source further explained Trump’s logic: He thinks he could very well be the nominee. And with the pledge in place, the other candidates would have to support him.

The RNC’s draft pledge was first reported Wednesday by POLITICO’s Alex Isenstadt.

The text of the pledge: “I [name] affirm that if I do not win the 2016 Republican nomination for president of the United States I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is. I further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party.”

One of the most memorable moments of the first Republican debate came on the first question, when Fox moderator Bret Baier asked: “Is there anyone on stage -- and can I see hands? -- who is unwilling tonight to pledge your support to the eventual nominee of the Republican Party and pledge to not run an independent campaign against that person?”

Trump drew some boos when he raised his right hand. He explained: “I am discussing it with everybody. But I’m, you know, talking about a lot of leverage. We want to win, and we will win. But I want to win as the Republican. I want to run as the Republican nominee. ... I will not make the pledge at this time.”

The next debate is Sept. 16, at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in southern California. The associate said Trump knew the third-party issue would again be a distraction, so he decided to close that door.Follow @politico

Former Obama adviser Axelrod joining CNN,http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/david-axelrod-joins-cnn/index.html,cnn,"Washington (CNN)David Axelrod, who was instrumental in electing President Barack Obama to the White House twice, will be joining CNN as a senior political commentator starting Friday.

""An all-around respected, well-connected commentator on the American political scene, we are delighted to have David join us and look forward to him sharing his political analysis with our global audience,"" CNN Washington Bureau Chief Sam Feist said in a statement Thursday morning.

Axelrod, a University of Chicago alum, currently runs the university's Institute of Politics.

He has long been one of Obama's most trusted campaign gurus. He was a senior adviser during Obama's first term, ran both his White House bids and Obama's 2004 U.S. Senate race. Prior to that, Axelrod played a role in other major campaigns, including the Senate and presidential races of Paul Simon, the mayoral campaign of Harold Washington, the gubernatorial campaign of Deval Patrick, Hillary Clinton's campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2000, and the presidential campaigns of Bill Clinton and John Edwards.

Axelrod got his start as a reporter with the Chicago Tribune, covering state, local and national politics, before beginning his own political consulting firm. He recounted his life in politics recently in the memoir ""Believer: My Forty Years in Politics.""",0.52229721464458212
Christie knocks Paul dismissal of heroin crisis,http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/chris-christie-rand-paul-heroin-crisis/index.html,cnn,"Washington (CNN)New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie knocked opponent Rand Paul Thursday for appearing to dismiss the growing heroin crisis in the U.S. at a recent campaign event New Hampshire.

Paul, speaking in Manchester, said people who work don't do heroin.

""People always come up to me and say, 'We got heroin problems and all these other problems.' You know what? If you work all day long, you don't have time to do heroin,"" Paul had said Wednesday night.

Played the clip on CNN's ""New Day,"" Christie said that drug addiction needs to be taken seriously.

""Drug addiction is a disease. And it's a failing to try drugs in the first place,"" Christie told CNN. ""But, there but for the grace of God, go I. And everyone makes mistakes that they look back on and would like to do differently. And we should treat it as a disease.""

RELATED: Paul says people who work don't do heroin

Christie touted his use of drug courts in New Jersey and treatment programs to help fight the growing epidemic.

The White House announced last month that it would spend $2.5 million to fight heroin trafficking along the East Coast. Overdose deaths from heroin have nearly quadrupled since 2002.

The issue has risen to the center of the presidential debate in New Hampshire, where heroin use has spiked.

Mandatory Credit: Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports

We're just one week away from the start of the NFL regular season as teams and fans prepare for Week 1.

The Miami Dolphins kick off their season against the Washington Redskins on Sunday, Sept. 13, where Ndamukong Suh will make his team debut. Before he gets the chance to wreak havoc on the Redskins' offensive line, he'll be terrifying readers with his front page photo for the Miami Herald's football preview section.

Whether Suh is actually standing in the Atlantic Ocean or not is unclear, but it's terrifying, nonetheless. That's what Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins will see in his face early and often next Sunday as he'll be doing his best to elude Suh all game long.

For now, Cousins should probably shy away from looking at the Miami Herald.

The trade deficit with other nations shrank 7.4% from June to a seasonally adjusted $41.86 billion in July, the Commerce Department said Thursday. That was slightly lower than the $42 billion gap projected by a Wall Street Journal survey of economists.

Exports increased 0.4% to $188.5 billion, despite a strong dollar and economic weakness in major trade partners like China and Europe.

Imports fell 1.1% to $230.36 billion, reflecting slowing American demand for consumer goods like pharmaceuticals and mobile phones.

Trade figures can be volatile from month to month. Broader trends suggest international trade has slowed thanks to weak global growth. The U.S. trade deficit grew 3.6% in the first seven months of this year compared to the same period a year earlier. Exports fell 3.5% over that period while imports declined 2.2%.

Exports contributed to the post-recession comeback but have been uneven in the past 18 months. Europe’s ongoing economic woes and slowing growth in Asian trading partners like China have dampened demand for U.S. goods.

The U.S. trade deficit with China grew 8.5% in the first seven months of 2015 compared to the same period last year, Thursday’s report showed. The deficit with Japan grew 2.5%.

"Cheryl Mills, Hillary Clinton Lawyer, Appears Before House Panel",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/us/hillary-clinton-email-benghazi.html,nyt,"WASHINGTON — Cheryl Mills, a longtime lawyer and aide for Hillary Rodham Clinton, walked into a Capitol Hill conference room shortly before 8 a.m. on Thursday for an interview under oath about Mrs. Clinton’s email account and the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. As Ms. Mills entered the room, she declined to talk to reporters who asked her whether she would answer questions about Mrs. Clinton’s server and whether there was classified information on it.

The interview before the House Benghazi committee is expected to last several hours.

The committee’s chairman, Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, did address reporters for a few minutes before the hearing, saying he had rejected Ms. Mills’ request to hold the interview in public because the committee has conducted its other interviews in private.

“If you’re serious about getting the most amount of information, you are going to get it in a transcribed interview session, not in a public session where members are limited to five or 10 minutes,” Mr. Gowdy said. “So we have not had a public fact finding interview with a single witness, and I’m not going to treat her any differently.”

On Wednesday it was revealed that Byran Pagliano, a former information technology official at the State Department who helped set up the server that housed Mrs. Clinton’s private email account, plans to invoke his Fifth Amendment right in response to questions from the committee. Mr. Pagliano’s lawyer declined to comment.

A Clinton campaign aide said that Mr. Pagliano’s decision was “both understandable and disappointing to us, because we believe he has every reason to be transparent about his I.T. assistance.”

“We had hoped Bryan would also agree to answer any questions from the committee and had recently encouraged him to grant the committee’s request for an interview,” the aide said.

The aide added, “Bryan is an utter professional and a wonderful young man who does not live in the public eye and understandably may not wish to be drawn into a political spectacle.”

Mr. Gowdy addressed the issue briefly before stepping into the interview. “You’re free to claim whatever inference you want from the fact that” he does not want to testify, Mr. Gowdy said.",0.66381759508220328
WRAPUP 1-Shrinking U.S. trade gap shows economy's underlying strength,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/news/usmarkets/~3/vurkbNhMpGo/story01.htm,reuters,"* Trade deficit narrows to $41.9 billion in July

* Exports rise 0.4 percent, imports drop 1.1 percent

* Weekly jobless claims rise 12,000; above expectations

By Lucia Mutikani

WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit fell

in July to its lowest level in five months as exports rose

broadly, signaling underlying strength in the economy amid

concerns about a global growth slowdown.

While other data on Thursday showed an increase in the

number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits,

the trend in jobless claims remained consistent with a

strengthening labor market.

The Commerce Department said the trade gap narrowed 7.4

percent to $41.9 billion, the smallest since February. June's

trade deficit was revised to $45.2 billion from the previously

reported $43.8 billion.

When adjusted for inflation, the deficit fell to $56.2

billion in July from $59.0 billion in the prior month.

The smaller deficit implied a modest contribution to gross

domestic product from trade early in the third quarter. Trade

contributed 0.3 percentage point to the economy's 3.7 percent

annualized growth rate in the second quarter.

Data ranging from consumer spending to employment and

housing have suggested the economy retained much of its momentum

from the second quarter and was on solid footing when global

financial markets were rocked by turbulence triggered by worries

over China's economy.

U.S. stock index futures extended gains slightly after the

data, while the dollar fell further against a basket of

currencies. Prices of U.S. government debt rose.

In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial

claims for state unemployment benefits increased 12,000 to a

seasonally adjusted 282,000 for the week ended Aug. 29.

The claims data has no bearing on Friday's closely watched

employment report for August as it fell outside the survey

period. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm

payrolls likely increased by 220,000 last month after rising

215,000 in July.

But job gains could come in below expectations as the first

reading of August payrolls has tended to be weaker in the last

several years before being revised higher.

The August employment report will be released less than two

weeks before the Federal Reserve's Sept. 16-17 policy-setting

meeting. There is speculation the U.S. central bank could raise

interest rates at that meeting.

The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better

measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week

volatility, rose 3,250 to 275,500 last week.

It was the 23rd straight week that the four-week average

remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is usually

associated with a strengthening labor market.

DOLLAR DRAG

In July, exports increased 0.4 percent to $188.5 billion.

While that was the first increase since April, exports remain

constrained by a strong dollar. The dollar has gained 16.8

percent against the currencies of the United States' main

trading partners since June 2014.

There were increases in exports of food, industrial supplies

and materials, and capital goods in July. Automobile exports

also rose. Imports fell 1.1 percent to $230.4 billion. However,

automobile imports were the highest on record. Imports of

consumer goods fell in July.

Exports to China fell 1.9 percent and imports from that

country dipped 0.2 percent. That left the politically sensitive

U.S.-China trade deficit at $31.6 billion, up 0.4 percent from

June. The trade deficit with China will be closely watched in

the coming months after that country devalued its currency in

August.

Exports to Canada fell 8.3 percent in July and could come

under more pressure after the Canadian economy slipped into

recession in the second quarter. Exports to recession-hit Brazil

were the lowest since February 2010.

Exports to the European Union fell 5.3 percent.

"In Miami, Joe Biden gets feel for presidential campaign",http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article33685284.html,mcclatchy,"Joe Biden came to Miami on Wednesday and sounded — at times — like a politician with another campaign in him.

Speaking at Miami Dade College’s North Campus about making higher education more affordable, the vice president touched on the sort of themes — immigration reform, the economy and the middle class — that presidential candidates like to deploy from the stump.

Biden isn’t running right now. But he’s thinking about it. And his two-day trip to Miami-Dade and Broward, the most Democratic counties in the country’s largest swing state, only stoked the fire among reporters and political observers that a Biden 2016 campaign could be for real.

“It’s amazing how good the school is. Look at all the press you’ve attracted,” Biden joked to about 150 people gathered at MDC’s Science Complex. “Their interest in community colleges impresses me. I hope that’s what they’re going to write about!”

He also made a reference to people unafraid to fail — a line that referred to the courage of older students returning to college that nevertheless could apply to potential candidates weighing a run for office.

“People who aren’t willing to risk failure never succeed,” Biden said. At the end of the event, when a couple of reporters yelled questions about his plans, Biden didn’t respond. An unidentified man in the audience, though, let his own feelings known: “Run, Joe!”

There was no getting around the fact that Biden, especially when he started to speak, looked like a man grieving the death of his son Beau three months ago to cancer.

Yet Biden warmed up as he went along. He spoke more than half an hour about the importance of community colleges in educating young people for good-paying careers and touted the Obama administration's proposal to pay for students’ first two years of community college.

“I doubt there were many of you who could sit down and write a check for $6,000 in tuition without worrying about it,” Biden told students. He stopped to remove his jacket — the packed room was stuffy — and appeared unfazed by a moth fluttering around. (“What’s that butterfly doing here?” he remarked.)

Biden thanked the two local members of Congress in attendance — Frederica Wilson, D-Miami Gardens, and Carlos Curbelo, R-Miami — and mentioned that MDC President Eduardo Padrón was traveling to Australia.

“I just want the faculty and staff here to let him know, I know if my wife were back here he would be here,” he added. “I am known at every community college in America and other places as Dr. Jill Biden’s husband.”

Wilson and Curbelo spoke to Biden privately, but not about his political plans, the congresswoman said.

“He has to feel it in his gut,” said Wilson, who acknowledged a Biden run would make it difficult for Florida Democrats to pick between the vice president and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

“Whether it is Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton, Democrats are just repackaging President Obama’s same old partisan rhetoric and stale ideas,” Republican National Committee spokeswoman Ali Pardo said in a statement. “Americans want new ideas, new leadership, and a new direction from their next president.”

Despite Biden’s longstanding Florida support, most donors and party leaders don’t see a path for him to win the nomination. Biden was scheduled to attend a Wednesday evening fundraiser for Senate Democrats in Coconut Grove — planned months ago — and will drop by Davie on Thursday to promote President Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran.

Before his speech Wednesday, Biden toured an MDC biotech lab. Nine students clad in white lab coasts and blue gloves held vials with green solution and sediment. One of them, Lilliam Hernandez Guerrero, asked Biden, a natural retail campaigner, if he wanted to help.

“No, I'm going to watch,” Biden said. “I can see the press headline: ‘Biden screws up experiment.’”",0.7959960158327527

(REUTERS/Craig Lassig) A former State Department staffer is facing a subpoena to testify before Congress about Hillary Rodham Clinton’s private e-mail server. Bryan Magliano said he would “assert his constitutional right not to answer questions to avoid incriminating himself,” a move that came in a letter Monday “from his lawyer to the House panel investigating the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya,” the Post reports. “The letter cited the ongoing FBI inquiry into the security of Clinton’s e-mail system, and it quoted a Supreme Court ruling in which justices described the Fifth Amendment as protecting ‘innocent men … “who otherwise might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.”’” SONY REACHES SETTLEMENT: Sony Pictures reached a settlement with nine former employees over the theft of their personal data in the 2014 hacking of the studio. “In June, a U.S. judge had rejected a bid by Sony Pictures, the entertainment arm of Sony Corp, to dismiss the lawsuit,” Reuters reports. “The former workers, who had sought class-action status on the suit, had said Sony’s negligence caused them economic harm by forcing them to beef up credit monitoring to address their greater risk of identity theft.” 6S AND 6S PLUS: Here’s what we expect from the next iPhone, via the Post’s tech team. UBER TO CONTINUE EXPANSION: Uber will move forward with plans to expand in Brussels, the company announced at a news conference whose location was kept secret until the last minute because of sometimes violent protests from taxi drivers. “Uber said it would launch at least one more up-scale service, using drivers licensed by the Brussels regional government, while still keeping Uberpop in operation,” the Wall Street Journal reports. “The first new service, launching Thursday, is Uber X, which is more expensive than its Uberpop service, but still cheaper than standard taxi fares. In  coming months, executives said they could also launch Uber Black, which costs even more. Both services already exist in other markets.”",0.3385027910377652

At that point, she wasn’t even playing competitively; her focus was on soccer and basketball. But in seventh grade, she decided that neither of those sports could provide her with long-term opportunities. That’s when she turned to volleyball. Four years and two Washington Catholic Athletic Conference titles later, the Holy Cross junior hasn’t looked back. A 6-foot-4 middle blocker, Ryan has developed into one of the area’s elite players while leading one of its top teams, and that has helped her land a spot with the UCLA Bruins. “I realized, hey, this is my sport. I’m tall enough, I have a lot of agility and I can move quickly around the court,” said Ryan, who verbally committed to UCLA on July 30. “I didn’t really push for any sports besides volleyball. I’ll go all day playing it.” Ryan was about 5-foot-10 when she started playing, and though she lacked experience, she had the size and athleticism to keep up with her competition. Before ninth grade, Ryan joined the Metro American Volleyball Club where she got to play alongside older, more experienced teammates. Ryan said this was a turning point. She watched her teammates closely, asking them questions and getting their advice. When she wasn’t refining her own technique, she was taking notes on the professional volleyball players, tuning into the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. “It took a while for me to understand the sport and how it’s played,” Ryan said. But the more Ryan played, the more comfortable she became. Her game rose as quickly as her 6-4 frame, and that led several Division I schools to take notice. In July, Ryan heard from UCLA — which she described as her “dream school” — and soon thereafter planned a trip to the west coast, where she committed to play for the No. 15 Bruins and Coach Michael Sealy. Ryan has two more seasons with Holy Cross, and she’s hoping to finish them strong. The Tartans, who lost to Good Counsel in Tuesday’s season opener, are bidding for a fourth consecutive title in the competitive WCAC. It’s a tall task, but not one that Ryan is shying away from. “As a team we just started playing together. We have a bunch of new girls and it’s great to have them,” Ryan said. “We’re just starting to work together and understand what we need and what we need to push for.” NUMBER CRUNCH: 83 Combined carries for Damascus and Quince Orchard in their 2014 meeting, a 19-11 Swarmin’ Hornets victory.

UPDATE 1-Healthy export growth helps cut Canada's trade deficit in July,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/news/usmarkets/~3/yr56uKjMIto/story01.htm,reuters,"(Adds details of release, background)

OTTAWA, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Canada's export sector posted

healthy growth for the second month in a row in July, helping

cut the country's trade deficit to an eight-month low of C$593

million ($446 million), Statistics Canada said on Thursday.

The trade shortfall for the month was much less than the

C$1.30 billion forecast by market operators and was the smallest

since the C$381 million deficit recorded in November 2014.

Exports grew by 2.3 percent from June to C$45.46 billion,

the second highest figure on record, on shipments of motor

vehicles, consumer goods and aircraft. Exports of energy

products dropped by 5.7 percent, largely due to lower prices.

The data will be closely studied by the Bank of Canada,

which cited disappointing non-energy exports as one reason it

cut interest rates in July, for a second time this year.

Imports increased by 1.7 percent to a record C$46.05 billion

on higher shipments of energy products, aircraft and other

transportation equipment as well as electronic and electrical

equipment.

Exports to the United States, which accounted for 76.4

percent of Canada's global total in July, rose by 2.1 percent,

while imports grew 4.3 percent. As a result, Canada's trade

surplus with the United States dropped to C$3.79 billion from

C$4.36 billion in June.

First Draft: Calls Intensify for More Debates on the Democratic Side,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/09/03/calls-intensify-for-more-debates-on-the-democratic-side/,nyt,"Martin O’Malley’s call for more Democratic presidential debates at the party’s summer meeting last week may have been the loudest, but it was neither the first nor the last.

A growing number of party activists, from New Hampshire to Iowa, are voicing concern about the Democratic National Committee’s plan to hold six debates over all, with only four coming before the first four states finish voting. The party fears a lower number will of debates will diminish its ability to drive the discussion as the Republican contest, led by Donald J. Trump, dominates the news, and that a flabby process will leave the ultimate nominee unprepared for the general election.

The timing of the New Hampshire debate, sandwiched between the Hanukkah and Christmas holidays, has particularly rankled activists in the state, who have openly protested the decision.

Martha Fuller Clark, a state senator in New Hampshire who is not yet backing a candidate, said that she approached the party chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, at the meeting in Minnesota last week and expressed her disappointment.

“She seemed unwilling to consider a revision of the schedule,” Ms. Fuller Clark said. “She just said that whatever schedule she put out, people would be unhappy with.”

“If there isn’t an opportunity for lots of debates and consideration, it’s just really, I think, making it much more difficult” for the candidates to reach voters before the voting begins, she said.

Many activists have argued that the decision to abbreviate the debate schedule was done to benefit Hillary Rodham Clinton, the front-runner in most polls for the nomination.

Former State Senator Burt Cohen, who is supporting Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, accused Ms. Wasserman Schultz of “putting her finger on the scale” to help Mrs. Clinton.

“Debbie Wasserman Schultz has to schedule more debates and do it with more sensitivity to the primary schedule,” he said, adding that if she did not, she should consider leaving her post, a comment he later tried to play down, saying it was premature to suggest such a thing.

A spokeswoman for the national party declined to comment. But party officials have insisted they were trying to bring as much voter interaction through forums and other means as possible, and suggested they began looking toward the Republican Party’s efforts to control its own debate process as far back as January. Ms. Wasserman Schultz has strenuously objected in private conversations to claims she tried to help Mrs. Clinton.

Still, in past cycles, there were many more debates, including unsanctioned debates, and they began earlier. But in 2004 and 2008, there were no penalties for taking part in the unsanctioned debates, which made up the majority of them in those years. This cycle, David Mercer, a former party official, noted, candidates who take part in unsanctioned debates risk being barred from the official forums.

During the spring of negotiations between the party committee and the campaigns, the Clinton campaign had pushed for a lower number on the debate spectrum, while Mr. O’Malley’s campaign had called for many more.

When Mr. O’Malley, the former Maryland governor who has been struggling to gain traction in the polls, but trying to position himself as the best alternative to Mrs. Clinton, used his speech at the summer meeting to condemn the party, he was met with cheers. Many high-ranking party activists have privately shared their concerns over the debate schedule, complaining that the criticisms risk getting amplified on places like MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program.

A spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton declined to comment. But even some of her supporters are encouraging a change in the schedule.

“I’m very supportive of the more the merrier in terms of debate,” said State Senator Lou D’Allesandro of New Hampshire, a Clinton supporter. “It’s a stage that’s ready-made for her. Why limit anything in this business? That’s not the American way.”

Sandy Opstvedt, an uncommitted party committee member from Iowa, said she also wants to make her voice heard to Ms. Wasserman Schultz.

“I think the debates actually help the candidates, and they just become more adept at debating,” said Mrs. Opstvedt, who, like Mr. O’Malley, described it as an opportunity to showcase the party’s ideas.

Donna Brazile, a national party vice chairwoman, said that she could understand the perspective from both sides.

But she also noted that there’s the possibility of another candidate joining the race: Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

His presence “might turn all of this upside-down,” she said. “Starting out with six is productive, but it could grow.”",0.99993730085607724
U.S. trade deficit smallest in five months,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/businessNews/~3/87aQgkd3WQM/story01.htm,reuters,"WASHINGTON, Sept 3 The U.S. trade deficit fell in July to its lowest level in five months as exports rose, signaling underlying strength in the economy amid concerns about a global growth slowdown.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday the trade gap narrowed 7.4 percent to $41.9 billion, the smallest since February. June's trade deficit was revised to $45.2 billion from the previously reported $43.8 billion.

Economists had forecast the trade gap shrinking to $42.4 billion. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit fell to $56.2 billion in July from $59.0 billion in the prior month.

The smaller deficit implied a modest contribution to gross domestic product from trade early in the third quarter. Trade contributed 0.3 percentage point to the economy's 3.7 percent annualized growth rate in the second quarter.

Data ranging from consumer spending to employment and housing have suggested the economy retained much of its momentum from the second quarter and was on solid footing when global financial markets were rocked by turbulence triggered by worries over China's economy.

In July, exports increased 0.4 percent to $188.5 billion.

While that was the first increase since April, exports remain constrained by a strong dollar. The dollar has gained 16.8 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014.

There were increases in exports of food, industrial supplies and materials, and capital goods in July. Automobile exports also rose.

Imports fell 1.1 percent to $230.4 billion. However, automobile imports were the highest on record. Imports of consumer goods fell in July.

Exports to China fell 1.9 percent and imports from that country dipped 0.2 percent. That left the politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit at $31.6 billion, up 0.4 percent from June. The trade deficit with China will be closely watched in the coming months after that country devalued its currency in August.

Exports to Canada fell 8.3 percent in July and could come under more pressure after the Canadian economy slipped into recession in the second quarter. Exports to recession-hit Brazil were the lowest since February 2010.

Exports to the European Union fell 5.3 percent.

Applications for US unemployment benefits rose last week but remain historically low at 282k,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/national/~3/_TU4YSqBnEw/,fox,"WASHINGTON –  More Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, but applications remain at historically near low levels in a positive sign for the U.S. economy amid a broader global slowdown.

The Labor Department says weekly applications for unemployment aid rose 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 282,000. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, increased 3,250 to 275,500. That average has fallen 9.2 percent over the past 12 months.

The relatively meager number of layoffs generally corresponds with strong hiring levels in the monthly jobs report being released Friday.

Economists expect that employers added 207,500 jobs in August as the unemployment rate dips to 5.2 percent from 5.3 percent. Hiring at that pace suggests the U.S. economy has been insulated from uncertainty about China's financial health that sparked a recent stock sell-off.",0.34253155724324602

WASHINGTON –  The U.S. trade deficit fell in July to the lowest level in five months as exports posted a small gain while imports declined, reflecting a big drop in shipments of consumer goods such as cell phones.

The Commerce Department says the deficit narrowed to $41.9 billion in July, a 7.4 percent decline from a June imbalance of $45.2 billion. Exports were up a small 0.4 percent to $188.5 billion, helped by stronger sales of U.S.-made autos and machinery, while imports declined 1.1 percent to $230.4 billion.

So far this year, the deficit is running 3.6 percent above last year's level, reflecting weaker export sales. The concern is that U.S. growth will be hurt by further declines in exports, reflecting a stronger dollar and overseas weakness in nations such as China.",0.321895896748429
