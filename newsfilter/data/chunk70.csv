Sorta: Four of the 84 triangles in Dr. Lakra's Mutant Laboratory. (Pat Myers/The Washington Post) This week we reprise, for the first time, one of the oddest Style Invitational contests ever. Back in 2000, the Empress’s predecessor, the Czar, presented a contest called “When We’re LXIV,” which was sort of like 64 contests in one: a choice of four formats times a choice of four subjects times a choice of four limitations. Loser Bruce Carlson reminded the E that about four weeks hence will be the Czar’s 64th birthday, and so how about if we ran this contest again in his “honor,” with a new set of choices? Okay, Bruce. Plus, the E doesn’t have to go out and get the Czar a silly tie or whatever. This week: Fashion an entry by selecting one element from each menu group above. Make sure you indicate the combination you chose (e.g., 2-C-iii). The categories above were submitted by various Losers and Style Invitational Devotees when I asked for suggestions in the Aug. 6 Style Conversational column: Thanks to Doug Frank, Tim Livengood, Mike Gips, Marni Penning Coleman, Neal Starkman and Bruce Carlson. Nan Reiner suggested today’s headline. Winner gets the Inkin’ Memorial, the Lincoln statue bobblehead that is the official Style Invitational trophy. Second place, incredibly apropos of this combo-contest, wins Dr. Lakra’s Mutant Laboratory, a collection of 84 cardboard triangles each containing one quadrant of a mutant face. Mix and match 190,000 ways (well, not really, unless you don’t mind, say, a neck where the ear would go). Donated by Dave Prevar, who doesn’t quite look like ANY of those combinations. Other runners-up win their choice of a yearned-for Loser Mug or the ardently desired “Whole Fools” Grossery Bag. Honorable mentions get a lusted-after Loser magnet designed by Bob Staake: either “The Wit Hit the Fan” or “Hardly Har-Har.” First Offenders receive a smelly tree-shaped air “freshener” (FirStink for their first ink).

"Flashback: Manny Ramirez gets first MLB hit, thinks it's a home run",http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/sports/~3/_q1wVXs6ecQ/,fox,"Manny Ramirez is truly one of a kind. Not only was he one of the best right-handed hitters of his time, but his goofy, lovable personality made him even more intriguing to watch.

In a career filled with many unforgettable ""Manny being Manny"" moments, it's only fitting that his first major-league hit was one of those highly entertaining Manny bloopers.

It was on this day, 22 years ago, ManRam brought in his big league career with a bang -- on a base-running blunder.

We take you back to Sept. 3, 1993, when the Indians were facing the Yankees at the old Yankee Stadium. Ramirez was playing in his second-ever major-league game and swung for the fences. And he reached them, but it was on a ground-rule double and not a home run, like he had thought.

Manny proudly circled the bases, taking in what he assumed was his first big league dinger, but the ball had bounced over the wall. As he rounded third, Ramirez noticed his teammates cackling in the dugout and headed back to second.

Ramirez quickly made up for the gaffe, as he went on to hit not one, but two homers later in the game.

And that, everyone, was the birth of ""Manny being Manny.""

Why Judge Berman Threw Out Tom Brady’s ‘Deflategate’ Suspension,http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/09/03/why-judge-berman-threw-out-tom-bradys-deflategate-suspension/,wsj,"A federal judge in New York on Thursday threw out the NFL's four-game “Deflategate” suspension of Tom Brady, giving the New England Patriots star quarterback a hard-fought victory and dealing an embarrassing legal setback to league management.

It’s not clear if the NFL will appeal U.S. District Judge Richard Berman’s decision. And Mr. Brady didn’t immediately comment.

He was accused by the NFL of scheming to deflate footballs during last year's AFC Championship game. A report by Paul Weiss lawyer Ted Wells said Brady was generally aware of the alleged tampering. After Commissioner Roger Goodell upheld the suspension, Mr. Brady took the case to federal court with a lawsuit.

Judge Berman gave several reasons for vacating the punishment. Here are key excerpts from his 40-page opinion:

â¢ Inadequate notice of punishment:

The Court finds that Brady had no notice that he could receive a four-game suspension for general awareness of ball deflation by others or participation in any scheme to deflate footballs, and non-cooperation with the ensuing Investigation. Brady also had no notice that his discipline would be the equivalent of the discipline imposed upon a player who used performance enhancing drugs.

It is the “law of the shop” to provide professional football players with (advance) notice of prohibited conduct and of potential discipline … Because there was no notice of a four-game suspension in the circumstances presented here, Commissioner Goodell may be said to have “dispense[d] his own brand of industrial justice.”…

The Court concludes that, as a matter of law, no NFL policy or precedent notifies players that they may be disciplined (much less suspended) for general awareness of misconduct by others. And, it does not appear that the NFL has ever, prior to this case, sought to punish players for such an alleged violation.

â¢ Misplaced reliance on NFL’s ‘conduct detrimental’ policy:

Commissioner Goodell contends that Brady’s discipline stems from the general [Collective Bargaining Agreement] policy precluding players from engaging in any conduct that is “detrimental to the integrity of, or public confidence in, the game of professional football.”

Goodell’s reliance on notice of broad CBA “conduct detrimental” policy — as opposed to specific Player Policies regarding equipment violations — to impose discipline upon Brady is legally misplaced. In both the Ray Rice case and the Adrian Peterson case, the players could, perhaps, be said to appreciate that acts of domestic violence might be deemed “conduct detrimental.” And yet, in both of these cases, the players were disciplined only after findings were made under the specific domestic violence policy

â¢ Brady was denied the opportunity to examine a lead investigator:

Denied the opportunity to examine [Jeff] Pash at the arbitral hearing, Brady was prejudiced. He was foreclosed from exploring, among other things, whether the Pash Wells Investigation was truly “independent,” and how and why the NFL’ s General Counsel came to edit a supposedly independent investigation report…Brady was also prejudiced because there was no other witness, apart from Pash, who was as “competent to address the substantive core of the claim.”…As co-lead investigator and senior executive with the NFL, Pash was in the best position to testify about the NFL ‘s degree of involvement in, and potential shaping of, a heralded “independent” Investigation.

â¢ Brady was denied equal access to investigative files from the Paul Weiss report:

The Court finds that Commissioner Goodell’s denial of the Players Association’s motion to produce the Paul, Weiss investigative files, including notes of witness interviews, for Brady’s use at the arbitral hearing was fundamentally unfair and in violation of 9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(3) and that Brady was prejudiced as a result. The interview notes were, at the very least, the basis for the Wells Report, and Brady was prejudiced by his lack of access to them. Brady was denied the opportunity to examine and challenge materials that may have led to his suspension and which likely facilitated Paul, Weiss attorneys’ cross-examination of him.

Compounding Brady’s prejudice is the fact that, as noted, Paul, Weiss acted as both alleged “independent” counsel during the Investigation and also (perhaps inconsistently) as retained counsel to the NFL during the arbitration. Paul, Weiss uniquely was able to retain access to investigative files and interview notes which it had developed; was able to use them in direct and cross-examinations of Brady and other arbitration witnesses; share them with NFL officials during the arbitral proceedings; and, at the same time, withhold them from Brady.",0.6104897765371754

"If Donald Trump followed this really basic advice, he'd be a lot richer",http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/09/03/if-donald-trump-followed-this-really-basic-advice-hed-be-a-lot-richer/,washpo,"Real estate tycoon Donald Trump arrives on stage for the start of the Republican presidential debate on August 6 in Cleveland, Ohio. (MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images) Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner in next year's presidential primary, has been pitching voters on his experience in business. ""I'm running for office in a country that's essentially bankrupt, and it needs a successful businessman,"" he told Rolling Stone. Yet Trump has not done nearly as well as other American business magnates, or even a typical middle-class retiree following sound financial advice, as a review of the numbers over the past four decades shows. He is a billionaire today despite this poor performance because when he started his career, his father had already built a colossal real-estate empire. And the wealth Donald Trump has accumulated since then has at times come at the expense of taxpayers or the banks and investors who have lent him money. [Read more: A secret to Donald Trump’s success that you simply can’t replicate] Citing data from Forbes, The Associated Press estimates that Trump's net worth quadrupled from $1 billion to $4 billion between 1988 and today. That's an impressive gain, but it's nothing compared to the wealth produced by investors such as Warren Buffett and Bill Gates. Gates's wealth increased from about $1 billion to $80 billion over the same period. Buffett had about $2.5 billion in 1988, and has $68 billion today. Yet perhaps the most telling comparison is between Trump and his golf buddy, Richard LeFrak. The LeFraks and the Trumps have been rivals in New York's real estate business for generations. LeFrak's father, Samuel LeFrak, took a no-nonsense approach to the business. He focused on minimizing risk and making money, according to a 1992 profile in Business Week, before the magazine became Bloomberg Businessweek. ""He might be strutting around like a peacock today, but he's gonna be a feather duster tomorrow,"" the elder LeFrak told Business Week when asked about Trump. Over time, the LeFraks came out ahead of their competitors. LeFrak is worth $7 billion today, and he's 181st on Bloomberg's list of the world's richest people. Bloomberg puts Trump's wealth at just $2.9 billion -- far less than Forbes's estimate. He doesn't even make the list. The LeFraks are a family with long experience in a very competitive industry, but Trump's returns are less even than those of an ordinary investor saving for retirement. Experts on personal finance generally recommend that people saving for retirement or to pay for a child's college education buy and hold in index funds -- mutual funds that are invested in a wide range of stocks or bonds. The price of the funds will go up and down with the market, but over time, these investments will generate a reliable return as long as the investor avoids the temptation to sell in a financial panic. [Read more: It’s time to take a look at the index card with all the financial advice you’ll ever need] Citing an independent evaluation, Business Week put Trump's net worth at $100 million in 1978. Had Trump gotten out of real estate entirely, put his money in an index fund based on the S&P 500 and reinvested the dividends, he'd be worth twice as much -- $6 billion -- today, according to the calculator maintained by the blog Don't Quit Your Day Job. (In this scenario, Trump doesn't quit his day job. The calculation above does not include any allowance for living expenses, so if he had put all his money in index funds, he would have had to live off the dividends or find some other source of income.) Trump disputes the independent appraisals of his wealth by Forbes, Business Week (now Bloomberg) and others. He says he is worth about $10 billion today. Using Trump's preferred estimates of his wealth, he has still performed worse than our hypothetical Main Street retiree. He told The New York Times he was worth $200 million in 1976, an amount that would be worth $12 billion today. ""That a purely un­man­aged in­dex fund’s re­turn could out­per­form Trump’s hands-on wheel­ing and deal­ing calls in­to ques­tion one of Trump’s chief selling points on the cam­paign trail: his busi­ness acu­men,"" writes S.V. Dáte in National Journal. In a way, though, all of these comparisons are misleading. Donald Trump's father, Fred Trump, built his real-estate business on federal subsidies, as The Washington Post's Emily Badger has reported. Financing from Uncle Sam isn't available to the typical investor (although homeowners do benefit indirectly from federal subsidies and can deduct interest they pay on their mortgage from their tax bill). The younger Trump has continued that strategy, boasting about his ability to secure taxpayer dollars from local officials, as the Los Angeles Times has explained. [Read more: How Donald Trump abandoned his father's middle-class empire for luxury building] At other times, Trump has relied not on taxpayers but on banks and private concerns. Firms under his control have gone bankrupt on four occasions, but those catastrophes aren't fully reflected in Trump's net worth today, since his lenders absorbed the losses. The LeFraks, by contrast, have avoided imposing losses on their creditors, while still finding a way to turn a profit.
