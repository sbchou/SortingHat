"Cheryl Mills, Hillary Clinton Lawyer, Appears Before House Panel",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/us/hillary-clinton-email-benghazi.html,nyt,"WASHINGTON — Cheryl Mills, a longtime lawyer and aide for Hillary Rodham Clinton, walked into a Capitol Hill conference room shortly before 8 a.m. on Thursday for an interview under oath about Mrs. Clinton’s email account and the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. As Ms. Mills entered the room, she declined to talk to reporters who asked her whether she would answer questions about Mrs. Clinton’s server and whether there was classified information on it.

The interview before the House Benghazi committee is expected to last several hours.

The committee’s chairman, Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, did address reporters for a few minutes before the hearing, saying he had rejected Ms. Mills’ request to hold the interview in public because the committee has conducted its other interviews in private.

“If you’re serious about getting the most amount of information, you are going to get it in a transcribed interview session, not in a public session where members are limited to five or 10 minutes,” Mr. Gowdy said. “So we have not had a public fact finding interview with a single witness, and I’m not going to treat her any differently.”

On Wednesday it was revealed that Byran Pagliano, a former information technology official at the State Department who helped set up the server that housed Mrs. Clinton’s private email account, plans to invoke his Fifth Amendment right in response to questions from the committee. Mr. Pagliano’s lawyer declined to comment.

A Clinton campaign aide said that Mr. Pagliano’s decision was “both understandable and disappointing to us, because we believe he has every reason to be transparent about his I.T. assistance.”

“We had hoped Bryan would also agree to answer any questions from the committee and had recently encouraged him to grant the committee’s request for an interview,” the aide said.

The aide added, “Bryan is an utter professional and a wonderful young man who does not live in the public eye and understandably may not wish to be drawn into a political spectacle.”

Mr. Gowdy addressed the issue briefly before stepping into the interview. “You’re free to claim whatever inference you want from the fact that” he does not want to testify, Mr. Gowdy said.",0.66381759508220328
WRAPUP 1-Shrinking U.S. trade gap shows economy's underlying strength,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/news/usmarkets/~3/vurkbNhMpGo/story01.htm,reuters,"* Trade deficit narrows to $41.9 billion in July

* Exports rise 0.4 percent, imports drop 1.1 percent

* Weekly jobless claims rise 12,000; above expectations

By Lucia Mutikani

WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit fell

in July to its lowest level in five months as exports rose

broadly, signaling underlying strength in the economy amid

concerns about a global growth slowdown.

While other data on Thursday showed an increase in the

number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits,

the trend in jobless claims remained consistent with a

strengthening labor market.

The Commerce Department said the trade gap narrowed 7.4

percent to $41.9 billion, the smallest since February. June's

trade deficit was revised to $45.2 billion from the previously

reported $43.8 billion.

When adjusted for inflation, the deficit fell to $56.2

billion in July from $59.0 billion in the prior month.

The smaller deficit implied a modest contribution to gross

domestic product from trade early in the third quarter. Trade

contributed 0.3 percentage point to the economy's 3.7 percent

annualized growth rate in the second quarter.

Data ranging from consumer spending to employment and

housing have suggested the economy retained much of its momentum

from the second quarter and was on solid footing when global

financial markets were rocked by turbulence triggered by worries

over China's economy.

U.S. stock index futures extended gains slightly after the

data, while the dollar fell further against a basket of

currencies. Prices of U.S. government debt rose.

In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial

claims for state unemployment benefits increased 12,000 to a

seasonally adjusted 282,000 for the week ended Aug. 29.

The claims data has no bearing on Friday's closely watched

employment report for August as it fell outside the survey

period. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm

payrolls likely increased by 220,000 last month after rising

215,000 in July.

But job gains could come in below expectations as the first

reading of August payrolls has tended to be weaker in the last

several years before being revised higher.

The August employment report will be released less than two

weeks before the Federal Reserve's Sept. 16-17 policy-setting

meeting. There is speculation the U.S. central bank could raise

interest rates at that meeting.

The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better

measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week

volatility, rose 3,250 to 275,500 last week.

It was the 23rd straight week that the four-week average

remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is usually

associated with a strengthening labor market.

DOLLAR DRAG

In July, exports increased 0.4 percent to $188.5 billion.

While that was the first increase since April, exports remain

constrained by a strong dollar. The dollar has gained 16.8

percent against the currencies of the United States' main

trading partners since June 2014.

There were increases in exports of food, industrial supplies

and materials, and capital goods in July. Automobile exports

also rose. Imports fell 1.1 percent to $230.4 billion. However,

automobile imports were the highest on record. Imports of

consumer goods fell in July.

Exports to China fell 1.9 percent and imports from that

country dipped 0.2 percent. That left the politically sensitive

U.S.-China trade deficit at $31.6 billion, up 0.4 percent from

June. The trade deficit with China will be closely watched in

the coming months after that country devalued its currency in

August.

Exports to Canada fell 8.3 percent in July and could come

under more pressure after the Canadian economy slipped into

recession in the second quarter. Exports to recession-hit Brazil

were the lowest since February 2010.

Exports to the European Union fell 5.3 percent.

The Portuguese Weather and Sea Institute said in a monthly report published Thursday that at the end of August, 74 percent of Portugal was in the grip of severe or extreme drought conditions.

It said rainfall has been below the average for the past nine months. Precipitation in August was 6.8 millimeters (0.27 inches), compared with the August average of 13.7 millimeters (0.54 inches).

The month's average temperature of 29.27 degrees Celsius (84.69 Fahrenheit) was almost half a degree higher than normal.

"In Miami, Joe Biden gets feel for presidential campaign",http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article33685284.html,mcclatchy,"Joe Biden came to Miami on Wednesday and sounded — at times — like a politician with another campaign in him.

Speaking at Miami Dade College’s North Campus about making higher education more affordable, the vice president touched on the sort of themes — immigration reform, the economy and the middle class — that presidential candidates like to deploy from the stump.

Biden isn’t running right now. But he’s thinking about it. And his two-day trip to Miami-Dade and Broward, the most Democratic counties in the country’s largest swing state, only stoked the fire among reporters and political observers that a Biden 2016 campaign could be for real.

“It’s amazing how good the school is. Look at all the press you’ve attracted,” Biden joked to about 150 people gathered at MDC’s Science Complex. “Their interest in community colleges impresses me. I hope that’s what they’re going to write about!”

He also made a reference to people unafraid to fail — a line that referred to the courage of older students returning to college that nevertheless could apply to potential candidates weighing a run for office.

“People who aren’t willing to risk failure never succeed,” Biden said. At the end of the event, when a couple of reporters yelled questions about his plans, Biden didn’t respond. An unidentified man in the audience, though, let his own feelings known: “Run, Joe!”

There was no getting around the fact that Biden, especially when he started to speak, looked like a man grieving the death of his son Beau three months ago to cancer.

Yet Biden warmed up as he went along. He spoke more than half an hour about the importance of community colleges in educating young people for good-paying careers and touted the Obama administration's proposal to pay for students’ first two years of community college.

“I doubt there were many of you who could sit down and write a check for $6,000 in tuition without worrying about it,” Biden told students. He stopped to remove his jacket — the packed room was stuffy — and appeared unfazed by a moth fluttering around. (“What’s that butterfly doing here?” he remarked.)

Biden thanked the two local members of Congress in attendance — Frederica Wilson, D-Miami Gardens, and Carlos Curbelo, R-Miami — and mentioned that MDC President Eduardo Padrón was traveling to Australia.

“I just want the faculty and staff here to let him know, I know if my wife were back here he would be here,” he added. “I am known at every community college in America and other places as Dr. Jill Biden’s husband.”

Wilson and Curbelo spoke to Biden privately, but not about his political plans, the congresswoman said.

“He has to feel it in his gut,” said Wilson, who acknowledged a Biden run would make it difficult for Florida Democrats to pick between the vice president and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

“Whether it is Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton, Democrats are just repackaging President Obama’s same old partisan rhetoric and stale ideas,” Republican National Committee spokeswoman Ali Pardo said in a statement. “Americans want new ideas, new leadership, and a new direction from their next president.”

Despite Biden’s longstanding Florida support, most donors and party leaders don’t see a path for him to win the nomination. Biden was scheduled to attend a Wednesday evening fundraiser for Senate Democrats in Coconut Grove — planned months ago — and will drop by Davie on Thursday to promote President Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran.

Before his speech Wednesday, Biden toured an MDC biotech lab. Nine students clad in white lab coasts and blue gloves held vials with green solution and sediment. One of them, Lilliam Hernandez Guerrero, asked Biden, a natural retail campaigner, if he wanted to help.

“No, I'm going to watch,” Biden said. “I can see the press headline: ‘Biden screws up experiment.’”",0.7959960158327527
Former Clinton staffer faces subpoena; Sony reaches hacking settlement; Uber to expand in Brussels,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/09/03/former-clinton-staffer-faces-subpoena-sony-reaches-hacking-settlement-uber-to-expand-in-brussels/,washpo,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton takes reporters’ questions during a news conference on Aug. 28. (REUTERS/Craig Lassig) A former State Department staffer is facing a subpoena to testify before Congress about Hillary Rodham Clinton’s private e-mail server. Bryan Magliano said he would “assert his constitutional right not to answer questions to avoid incriminating himself,” a move that came in a letter Monday “from his lawyer to the House panel investigating the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya,” the Post reports. “The letter cited the ongoing FBI inquiry into the security of Clinton’s e-mail system, and it quoted a Supreme Court ruling in which justices described the Fifth Amendment as protecting ‘innocent men … “who otherwise might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.”’” SONY REACHES SETTLEMENT: Sony Pictures reached a settlement with nine former employees over the theft of their personal data in the 2014 hacking of the studio. “In June, a U.S. judge had rejected a bid by Sony Pictures, the entertainment arm of Sony Corp, to dismiss the lawsuit,” Reuters reports. “The former workers, who had sought class-action status on the suit, had said Sony’s negligence caused them economic harm by forcing them to beef up credit monitoring to address their greater risk of identity theft.” 6S AND 6S PLUS: Here’s what we expect from the next iPhone, via the Post’s tech team. UBER TO CONTINUE EXPANSION: Uber will move forward with plans to expand in Brussels, the company announced at a news conference whose location was kept secret until the last minute because of sometimes violent protests from taxi drivers. “Uber said it would launch at least one more up-scale service, using drivers licensed by the Brussels regional government, while still keeping Uberpop in operation,” the Wall Street Journal reports. “The first new service, launching Thursday, is Uber X, which is more expensive than its Uberpop service, but still cheaper than standard taxi fares. In  coming months, executives said they could also launch Uber Black, which costs even more. Both services already exist in other markets.”",0.3385027910377652

"Holy Cross volleyball standout Emily Ryan reaches new heights, commits to UCLA",http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/recruiting-insider/wp/2015/09/03/holy-cross-volleyball-standout-emily-ryan-reaches-new-heights-commits-to-ucla/?wprss=rss_sports,washpo,"Holy Cross junior Emily Ryan jumps for a ball during a match Tuesday against Good Counsel (Minh Dao/Courtesy of Terence Ryan) In middle school, Emily Ryan wasn’t on the Division I volleyball track. At that point, she wasn’t even playing competitively; her focus was on soccer and basketball. But in seventh grade, she decided that neither of those sports could provide her with long-term opportunities. That’s when she turned to volleyball. Four years and two Washington Catholic Athletic Conference titles later, the Holy Cross junior hasn’t looked back. A 6-foot-4 middle blocker, Ryan has developed into one of the area’s elite players while leading one of its top teams, and that has helped her land a spot with the UCLA Bruins. “I realized, hey, this is my sport. I’m tall enough, I have a lot of agility and I can move quickly around the court,” said Ryan, who verbally committed to UCLA on July 30. “I didn’t really push for any sports besides volleyball. I’ll go all day playing it.” Ryan was about 5-foot-10 when she started playing, and though she lacked experience, she had the size and athleticism to keep up with her competition. Before ninth grade, Ryan joined the Metro American Volleyball Club where she got to play alongside older, more experienced teammates. Ryan said this was a turning point. She watched her teammates closely, asking them questions and getting their advice. When she wasn’t refining her own technique, she was taking notes on the professional volleyball players, tuning into the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. “It took a while for me to understand the sport and how it’s played,” Ryan said. But the more Ryan played, the more comfortable she became. Her game rose as quickly as her 6-4 frame, and that led several Division I schools to take notice. In July, Ryan heard from UCLA — which she described as her “dream school” — and soon thereafter planned a trip to the west coast, where she committed to play for the No. 15 Bruins and Coach Michael Sealy. Ryan has two more seasons with Holy Cross, and she’s hoping to finish them strong. The Tartans, who lost to Good Counsel in Tuesday’s season opener, are bidding for a fourth consecutive title in the competitive WCAC. It’s a tall task, but not one that Ryan is shying away from. “As a team we just started playing together. We have a bunch of new girls and it’s great to have them,” Ryan said. “We’re just starting to work together and understand what we need and what we need to push for.” NUMBER CRUNCH: 83 Combined carries for Damascus and Quince Orchard in their 2014 meeting, a 19-11 Swarmin’ Hornets victory.

UPDATE 1-Healthy export growth helps cut Canada's trade deficit in July,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/news/usmarkets/~3/yr56uKjMIto/story01.htm,reuters,"(Adds details of release, background)

OTTAWA, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Canada's export sector posted

healthy growth for the second month in a row in July, helping

cut the country's trade deficit to an eight-month low of C$593

million ($446 million), Statistics Canada said on Thursday.

The trade shortfall for the month was much less than the

C$1.30 billion forecast by market operators and was the smallest

since the C$381 million deficit recorded in November 2014.

Exports grew by 2.3 percent from June to C$45.46 billion,

the second highest figure on record, on shipments of motor

vehicles, consumer goods and aircraft. Exports of energy

products dropped by 5.7 percent, largely due to lower prices.

The data will be closely studied by the Bank of Canada,

which cited disappointing non-energy exports as one reason it

cut interest rates in July, for a second time this year.

Imports increased by 1.7 percent to a record C$46.05 billion

on higher shipments of energy products, aircraft and other

transportation equipment as well as electronic and electrical

equipment.

Exports to the United States, which accounted for 76.4

percent of Canada's global total in July, rose by 2.1 percent,

while imports grew 4.3 percent. As a result, Canada's trade

surplus with the United States dropped to C$3.79 billion from

C$4.36 billion in June.

First Draft: Calls Intensify for More Debates on the Democratic Side,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/09/03/calls-intensify-for-more-debates-on-the-democratic-side/,nyt,"Martin O’Malley’s call for more Democratic presidential debates at the party’s summer meeting last week may have been the loudest, but it was neither the first nor the last.

A growing number of party activists, from New Hampshire to Iowa, are voicing concern about the Democratic National Committee’s plan to hold six debates over all, with only four coming before the first four states finish voting. The party fears a lower number will of debates will diminish its ability to drive the discussion as the Republican contest, led by Donald J. Trump, dominates the news, and that a flabby process will leave the ultimate nominee unprepared for the general election.

The timing of the New Hampshire debate, sandwiched between the Hanukkah and Christmas holidays, has particularly rankled activists in the state, who have openly protested the decision.

Martha Fuller Clark, a state senator in New Hampshire who is not yet backing a candidate, said that she approached the party chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, at the meeting in Minnesota last week and expressed her disappointment.

“She seemed unwilling to consider a revision of the schedule,” Ms. Fuller Clark said. “She just said that whatever schedule she put out, people would be unhappy with.”

“If there isn’t an opportunity for lots of debates and consideration, it’s just really, I think, making it much more difficult” for the candidates to reach voters before the voting begins, she said.

Many activists have argued that the decision to abbreviate the debate schedule was done to benefit Hillary Rodham Clinton, the front-runner in most polls for the nomination.

Former State Senator Burt Cohen, who is supporting Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, accused Ms. Wasserman Schultz of “putting her finger on the scale” to help Mrs. Clinton.

“Debbie Wasserman Schultz has to schedule more debates and do it with more sensitivity to the primary schedule,” he said, adding that if she did not, she should consider leaving her post, a comment he later tried to play down, saying it was premature to suggest such a thing.

A spokeswoman for the national party declined to comment. But party officials have insisted they were trying to bring as much voter interaction through forums and other means as possible, and suggested they began looking toward the Republican Party’s efforts to control its own debate process as far back as January. Ms. Wasserman Schultz has strenuously objected in private conversations to claims she tried to help Mrs. Clinton.

Still, in past cycles, there were many more debates, including unsanctioned debates, and they began earlier. But in 2004 and 2008, there were no penalties for taking part in the unsanctioned debates, which made up the majority of them in those years. This cycle, David Mercer, a former party official, noted, candidates who take part in unsanctioned debates risk being barred from the official forums.

During the spring of negotiations between the party committee and the campaigns, the Clinton campaign had pushed for a lower number on the debate spectrum, while Mr. O’Malley’s campaign had called for many more.

When Mr. O’Malley, the former Maryland governor who has been struggling to gain traction in the polls, but trying to position himself as the best alternative to Mrs. Clinton, used his speech at the summer meeting to condemn the party, he was met with cheers. Many high-ranking party activists have privately shared their concerns over the debate schedule, complaining that the criticisms risk getting amplified on places like MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program.

A spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton declined to comment. But even some of her supporters are encouraging a change in the schedule.

“I’m very supportive of the more the merrier in terms of debate,” said State Senator Lou D’Allesandro of New Hampshire, a Clinton supporter. “It’s a stage that’s ready-made for her. Why limit anything in this business? That’s not the American way.”

Sandy Opstvedt, an uncommitted party committee member from Iowa, said she also wants to make her voice heard to Ms. Wasserman Schultz.

“I think the debates actually help the candidates, and they just become more adept at debating,” said Mrs. Opstvedt, who, like Mr. O’Malley, described it as an opportunity to showcase the party’s ideas.

Donna Brazile, a national party vice chairwoman, said that she could understand the perspective from both sides.

But she also noted that there’s the possibility of another candidate joining the race: Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

His presence “might turn all of this upside-down,” she said. “Starting out with six is productive, but it could grow.”",0.99993730085607724
U.S. trade deficit smallest in five months,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/businessNews/~3/87aQgkd3WQM/story01.htm,reuters,"WASHINGTON, Sept 3 The U.S. trade deficit fell in July to its lowest level in five months as exports rose, signaling underlying strength in the economy amid concerns about a global growth slowdown.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday the trade gap narrowed 7.4 percent to $41.9 billion, the smallest since February. June's trade deficit was revised to $45.2 billion from the previously reported $43.8 billion.

Economists had forecast the trade gap shrinking to $42.4 billion. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit fell to $56.2 billion in July from $59.0 billion in the prior month.

The smaller deficit implied a modest contribution to gross domestic product from trade early in the third quarter. Trade contributed 0.3 percentage point to the economy's 3.7 percent annualized growth rate in the second quarter.

Data ranging from consumer spending to employment and housing have suggested the economy retained much of its momentum from the second quarter and was on solid footing when global financial markets were rocked by turbulence triggered by worries over China's economy.

In July, exports increased 0.4 percent to $188.5 billion.

While that was the first increase since April, exports remain constrained by a strong dollar. The dollar has gained 16.8 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014.

There were increases in exports of food, industrial supplies and materials, and capital goods in July. Automobile exports also rose.

Imports fell 1.1 percent to $230.4 billion. However, automobile imports were the highest on record. Imports of consumer goods fell in July.

Exports to China fell 1.9 percent and imports from that country dipped 0.2 percent. That left the politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit at $31.6 billion, up 0.4 percent from June. The trade deficit with China will be closely watched in the coming months after that country devalued its currency in August.

Exports to Canada fell 8.3 percent in July and could come under more pressure after the Canadian economy slipped into recession in the second quarter. Exports to recession-hit Brazil were the lowest since February 2010.

Exports to the European Union fell 5.3 percent.

Applications for US unemployment benefits rose last week but remain historically low at 282k,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/national/~3/_TU4YSqBnEw/,fox,"WASHINGTON –  More Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, but applications remain at historically near low levels in a positive sign for the U.S. economy amid a broader global slowdown.

The Labor Department says weekly applications for unemployment aid rose 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 282,000. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, increased 3,250 to 275,500. That average has fallen 9.2 percent over the past 12 months.

The relatively meager number of layoffs generally corresponds with strong hiring levels in the monthly jobs report being released Friday.

Economists expect that employers added 207,500 jobs in August as the unemployment rate dips to 5.2 percent from 5.3 percent. Hiring at that pace suggests the U.S. economy has been insulated from uncertainty about China's financial health that sparked a recent stock sell-off.",0.34253155724324602

WASHINGTON –  The U.S. trade deficit fell in July to the lowest level in five months as exports posted a small gain while imports declined, reflecting a big drop in shipments of consumer goods such as cell phones.

The Commerce Department says the deficit narrowed to $41.9 billion in July, a 7.4 percent decline from a June imbalance of $45.2 billion. Exports were up a small 0.4 percent to $188.5 billion, helped by stronger sales of U.S.-made autos and machinery, while imports declined 1.1 percent to $230.4 billion.

So far this year, the deficit is running 3.6 percent above last year's level, reflecting weaker export sales. The concern is that U.S. growth will be hurt by further declines in exports, reflecting a stronger dollar and overseas weakness in nations such as China.",0.321895896748429
"Cheryl Mills, Hillary Clinton Lawyer, Appears Before House Panel",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/us/hillary-clinton-email-benghazi.html,nyt,"WASHINGTON — Cheryl Mills, a longtime lawyer and aide for Hillary Rodham Clinton, walked into a Capitol Hill conference room shortly before 8 a.m. on Thursday for an interview under oath about Mrs. Clinton’s email account and the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. As Ms. Mills entered the room, she declined to talk to reporters who asked her whether she would answer questions about Mrs. Clinton’s server and whether there was classified information on it.

The interview before the House Benghazi committee is expected to last several hours.

The committee’s chairman, Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, did address reporters for a few minutes before the hearing, saying he had rejected Ms. Mills’ request to hold the interview in public because the committee has conducted its other interviews in private.

“If you’re serious about getting the most amount of information, you are going to get it in a transcribed interview session, not in a public session where members are limited to five or 10 minutes,” Mr. Gowdy said. “So we have not had a public fact finding interview with a single witness, and I’m not going to treat her any differently.”

On Wednesday it was revealed that Byran Pagliano, a former information technology official at the State Department who helped set up the server that housed Mrs. Clinton’s private email account, plans to invoke his Fifth Amendment right in response to questions from the committee. Mr. Pagliano’s lawyer declined to comment.

A Clinton campaign aide said that Mr. Pagliano’s decision was “both understandable and disappointing to us, because we believe he has every reason to be transparent about his I.T. assistance.”

“We had hoped Bryan would also agree to answer any questions from the committee and had recently encouraged him to grant the committee’s request for an interview,” the aide said.

The aide added, “Bryan is an utter professional and a wonderful young man who does not live in the public eye and understandably may not wish to be drawn into a political spectacle.”

Mr. Gowdy addressed the issue briefly before stepping into the interview. “You’re free to claim whatever inference you want from the fact that” he does not want to testify, Mr. Gowdy said.",0.66381759508220328
