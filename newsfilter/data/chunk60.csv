NORTON, Mass. –  Two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson skipped the Deutsche Bank Championship pro-am Thursday because of a mild back injury.

Watson suffered a mild strain of his back during the weekend of The Barclays, where he finished third. His agent, Jens (pronounced YENTZ) Beck, says Watson received therapy the last few days. His trainer recommended one more day of rest as a precaution.

Watson is No. 3 in the FedEx Cup standings going into the second playoff event.

This is the second week in a row that a top player has missed the pro-am with a sore back. Jason Day felt a twinge during the week at The Barclays. He went on to a six-shot victory.",0.33573100109535337

Will Donald Trump Really Back Down From A Third Party Threat?,http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/09/03/437198983/will-donald-trump-really-back-down-from-a-third-party-threat,npr,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump waves to the crowd after speaking at the National Federation of Republican Assemblies on Saturday, Aug. 29, 2015, in Nashville, Tenn.

Mark Humphrey/AP

Donald Trump may be backing down — sort of. The billionaire businessman was the only GOP presidential candidate not to raise his hand at last month's debate to pledge he wouldn't run as a third-party candidate. Now, however, it seems he's poised to promise not to undertake an independent bid if he loses the Republican nomination. Trump's announcement is expected at a 2 p.m. EST press conference at Trump Tower in New York City. That's after a 1 p.m. meeting with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, where he's expected to sign the pledge. But a GOP source stresses, ""With Trump, nothing is certain until it's final."" Even if Trump inks the pledge, it's not a given that he won't mount a third-party run — or that he'll even stand by this one. The RNC pledge isn't legally binding, and there's nothing holding him to it if he decides the party at a later date isn't treating him fairly. The move appears to be aimed at making sure he qualifies for early primary ballots. South Carolina, which holds the first primary in the South, has a similar pledge affixed to its ballot qualifications, which must be submitted by the end of September. Speaking in the Palmetto State last week, Trump demurred on whether he would sign it, insisting there was plenty of time.

But Trump seemed to be leaning toward signing it at an event last weekend in Nashville. ""We're going to make a decision very soon,"" he told reporters. ""And I think a lot of people are going to be very happy."" With the clock ticking and pressure mounting, Trump appears to be bending to the party — at least for now. Bottom line — Trump has to sign these pledges if he wants to be considered a serious candidate in the short run. He wouldn't even be able to get on the GOP ballot in some important states like South Carolina and possibly Virginia and North Carolina, which are also considering loyalty pledges. Whether those are enforceable is another matter. There's a history of loyalty pledges in parties Parties can determine who gets on their ballot. And when candidates have refused to sign a loyalty oath, they haven't been permitted to run in the primary. In 2008, then-Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich sued to try to get on the Texas Democratic ballot after he wouldn't sign the party's pledge, but courts upheld the decision. Richard Winger, editor of Ballot Access News, said while the primary ballot is enforceable, the general election is a different story. Trump is stating, in good faith, that he won't run as any other party's candidate or an independent if he doesn't win the nomination, but there's still no legal muster behind such a pledge. ""They only have moral force. They can't enforce it,"" Winger said. ""But it's embarrassing for people to give their word that they would not do something and then do it."" Some states do have sore-loser laws. If a candidate loses a primary, that candidate can't run as an independent in the general election. While that's mostly been in congressional races, some may also try to get it to apply to presidential elections, if it came to that. But Winger said that could be a difficult argument, too. In his most recent issue of Ballot Access News, he notes that 34 states who do have sore-loser laws have precedents where they have allowed a candidate to run again, even if they lost the primary. In some cases, that may apply only to an independent run. In 2012, former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson sought and lost the GOP nomination for president. Instead, he ran as the Libertarian Party's nominee, and wasn't allowed on the Michigan ballot. However, that was because he was running under another party's banner — had he simply been running as an independent, he would have been allowed. And in states that hold caucuses instead of primaries, enforcement of a pledge could also prove difficult. So, while there is plenty of legal wiggle room for Trump, this is the surest sign yet that he is trying to play within GOP rules. His actions could engender goodwill from some in the establishment, even though many remain skeptical of his intentions. With where he stands in the polls and with the size of crowds he's drawing, party leaders have to recognize his staying power and that there is feasibly a chance he could be the Republican nominee. For Trump, there is a bright side in signing the pledge, too. If he does win the GOP nomination, now his other rivals, who have badmouthed and beat up on him, will be the ones eating crow — and backing his candidacy.",0.99999999593496436
"Poll: Trump leads GOP nationally, but Carson gains",http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/monmouth-poll-donald-trump-ben-carson-jeb-bush/index.html,cnn,"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump is expanding his strong lead over the other GOP presidential candidates nationally, according to a new poll, but Ben Carson is also posting a big jump in support.

In the first national Monmouth University poll out since the first Republican presidential debate, released Thursday, the real estate mogul is showing a commanding lead at 30% support. That's up 4 points from a poll taken just before the debate last month, but within the poll's margin of error.

It's also a new high for Trump, narrowly topping the 28% support he registered in a Quinnipiac poll late last month.

But Carson, a neurosurgeon, posted the biggest gain in support since August, jumping 13 points to second place. He is holding down 18% support now among Republicans. That continues a trend of recent polls that show him moving up the list.

It's also Carson's highest recorded number in a national poll, topping a 13% mark in a Fox news poll this spring.

Trump's lead also evaporates when the field is narrowed to just him and Carson. Asked about a head-to-head match-up between those two, Republican voters picked Carson over Trump, 55% to 36%.

Carson was the only candidate to beat Trump in a head-to-head, the poll found.

The poll confirms recent trends of Trump's lasting lead and Carson's surge -- as well as steep drops in support for some more establishment candidates.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush fell out of second place, dropping from 12% support in August to 8% now, though that fall is within the margin of error. That tied him for third place with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker also fell. He was in third place at 11% in August, and dropped 8 points to just 3% on Thursday.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio was in fourth place at 5% and businesswoman Carly Fiorina and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee tied in the fifth spot at 4%.

Monmouth surveyed 366 Republican voters between Aug. 31 and Sept. 2 by telephone interview for the poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 5.1 percentage points.

"Why is Ben Carson surging? Once again, it&#8217;s the media.",http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/03/why-is-ben-carson-surging-once-again-its-the-media/,washpo,"Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson attends an antiabortion rally opposing federal funding for Planned Parenthood on July 28, 2015 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Olivier Douliery/Getty Images) The surge of support for Ben Carson is making some people curious. Howard Kurtz suggests Carson’s surge is “under the media radar.” That’s exactly backwards. Carson’s surge is arguably because he got back on the media’s radar. Even though Carson is not receiving a lot of news coverage, the trends in Carson’s polling numbers are easily understood as responses to trends in how much he’s covered in news — much as is true of Donald Trump. [Why is Trump surging? Blame the media.] Here is a graph showing the percentage of news stories that mention Carson and his national polling numbers. As in my previous posts, I draw on social analytic tools provided by Crimson Hexagon. These tools are devised to gather and reveal the volume and tone of media coverage on major news sites. UCLA political scientist Lynn Vavreck and I are analyzing the news coverage of presidential candidates as part of our joint work on the 2016 election. Carson declared his candidacy on May 3. Our data starts on May 16, at which point we are still picking up the bump Carson received from his announcement. In addition, Carson got spikes of attention for speeches at Sen. Joni Ernst’s “Roast and Ride” event in Iowa and the Freedom and Faith Coalition Conference. His coverage then began to wane, as did his poll numbers. The spike in his poll numbers came only after he began to get more attention around the Aug. 6 debate and thereafter. [Why does Trump remain atop the polls? You can still blame the media.] To see this more clearly, let’s take an average of Carson’s poll numbers and graph that against his news coverage. This graph puts news coverage on the left-hand axis and the poll average on the right-hand axis. It shows the correlation more clearly. (And despite all the bumps and wiggles in news coverage, there is a statistically significant correlation here.) An underappreciated fact is that Carson was also polling reasonably well in May and June — when he was getting, on average, some degree of news coverage after announcing his candidacy and giving these speeches. Then, after the Faith and Freedom speech, he got much less attention. His poll average followed suit. Finally, after he began to get more attention at the beginning of August, his poll average increased. Again, it is possible that news coverage responds to poll numbers. Increasing polling numbers always make for horse-race coverage. But, as I’ve argued in the past, we should expect the news coverage to come first. People’s views about a candidate are likely to change only when the information they’re getting about that candidate changes. News coverage isn’t the sole source of information, but it’s an important one. Certainly being on the media’s radar has been crucial for Carson.",0.99943370105834206
Carly Fiorina has now officially qualified for the main stage at CNN&#8217;s debate,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/03/carly-fiorina-has-now-officially-qualified-for-the-main-stage-at-cnns-debate/,washpo,"With the release of a new Monmouth University national poll on Thursday, former HP executive Carly Fiorina is now virtually guaranteed a spot on the main debate stage for CNN's Sept. 16 Republican presidential debate. Fiorina takes four percent in the poll, well behind the leaders -- Donald Trump stands at 30 percent and Ben Carson places second with 18 percent. But, that show of support puts her in the top 10 of all the polls conducted after Fox News' debate last month. And with CNN’s rule change earlier this week, that means she gets to appear on-stage even though she’s still only 11th in all of the polls they’re considering. One other note: Ted Cruz has now passed Marco Rubio in overall poll standing and so will be slightly closer to the center of the stage than he was at the Fox debate.",0.908083331072291

"Flashback: Manny Ramirez gets first MLB hit, thinks it's a home run",http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/sports/~3/_q1wVXs6ecQ/,fox,"Manny Ramirez is truly one of a kind. Not only was he one of the best right-handed hitters of his time, but his goofy, lovable personality made him even more intriguing to watch.

In a career filled with many unforgettable ""Manny being Manny"" moments, it's only fitting that his first major-league hit was one of those highly entertaining Manny bloopers.

It was on this day, 22 years ago, ManRam brought in his big league career with a bang -- on a base-running blunder.

We take you back to Sept. 3, 1993, when the Indians were facing the Yankees at the old Yankee Stadium. Ramirez was playing in his second-ever major-league game and swung for the fences. And he reached them, but it was on a ground-rule double and not a home run, like he had thought.

Manny proudly circled the bases, taking in what he assumed was his first big league dinger, but the ball had bounced over the wall. As he rounded third, Ramirez noticed his teammates cackling in the dugout and headed back to second.

Ramirez quickly made up for the gaffe, as he went on to hit not one, but two homers later in the game.

And that, everyone, was the birth of ""Manny being Manny.""

Why Judge Berman Threw Out Tom Brady’s ‘Deflategate’ Suspension,http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/09/03/why-judge-berman-threw-out-tom-bradys-deflategate-suspension/,wsj,"A federal judge in New York on Thursday threw out the NFL's four-game “Deflategate” suspension of Tom Brady, giving the New England Patriots star quarterback a hard-fought victory and dealing an embarrassing legal setback to league management.

It’s not clear if the NFL will appeal U.S. District Judge Richard Berman’s decision. And Mr. Brady didn’t immediately comment.

He was accused by the NFL of scheming to deflate footballs during last year's AFC Championship game. A report by Paul Weiss lawyer Ted Wells said Brady was generally aware of the alleged tampering. After Commissioner Roger Goodell upheld the suspension, Mr. Brady took the case to federal court with a lawsuit.

Judge Berman gave several reasons for vacating the punishment. Here are key excerpts from his 40-page opinion:

â¢ Inadequate notice of punishment:

The Court finds that Brady had no notice that he could receive a four-game suspension for general awareness of ball deflation by others or participation in any scheme to deflate footballs, and non-cooperation with the ensuing Investigation. Brady also had no notice that his discipline would be the equivalent of the discipline imposed upon a player who used performance enhancing drugs.

It is the “law of the shop” to provide professional football players with (advance) notice of prohibited conduct and of potential discipline … Because there was no notice of a four-game suspension in the circumstances presented here, Commissioner Goodell may be said to have “dispense[d] his own brand of industrial justice.”…

The Court concludes that, as a matter of law, no NFL policy or precedent notifies players that they may be disciplined (much less suspended) for general awareness of misconduct by others. And, it does not appear that the NFL has ever, prior to this case, sought to punish players for such an alleged violation.

â¢ Misplaced reliance on NFL’s ‘conduct detrimental’ policy:

Commissioner Goodell contends that Brady’s discipline stems from the general [Collective Bargaining Agreement] policy precluding players from engaging in any conduct that is “detrimental to the integrity of, or public confidence in, the game of professional football.”

Goodell’s reliance on notice of broad CBA “conduct detrimental” policy — as opposed to specific Player Policies regarding equipment violations — to impose discipline upon Brady is legally misplaced. In both the Ray Rice case and the Adrian Peterson case, the players could, perhaps, be said to appreciate that acts of domestic violence might be deemed “conduct detrimental.” And yet, in both of these cases, the players were disciplined only after findings were made under the specific domestic violence policy

â¢ Brady was denied the opportunity to examine a lead investigator:

Denied the opportunity to examine [Jeff] Pash at the arbitral hearing, Brady was prejudiced. He was foreclosed from exploring, among other things, whether the Pash Wells Investigation was truly “independent,” and how and why the NFL’ s General Counsel came to edit a supposedly independent investigation report…Brady was also prejudiced because there was no other witness, apart from Pash, who was as “competent to address the substantive core of the claim.”…As co-lead investigator and senior executive with the NFL, Pash was in the best position to testify about the NFL ‘s degree of involvement in, and potential shaping of, a heralded “independent” Investigation.

â¢ Brady was denied equal access to investigative files from the Paul Weiss report:

The Court finds that Commissioner Goodell’s denial of the Players Association’s motion to produce the Paul, Weiss investigative files, including notes of witness interviews, for Brady’s use at the arbitral hearing was fundamentally unfair and in violation of 9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(3) and that Brady was prejudiced as a result. The interview notes were, at the very least, the basis for the Wells Report, and Brady was prejudiced by his lack of access to them. Brady was denied the opportunity to examine and challenge materials that may have led to his suspension and which likely facilitated Paul, Weiss attorneys’ cross-examination of him.

Compounding Brady’s prejudice is the fact that, as noted, Paul, Weiss acted as both alleged “independent” counsel during the Investigation and also (perhaps inconsistently) as retained counsel to the NFL during the arbitration. Paul, Weiss uniquely was able to retain access to investigative files and interview notes which it had developed; was able to use them in direct and cross-examinations of Brady and other arbitration witnesses; share them with NFL officials during the arbitral proceedings; and, at the same time, withhold them from Brady.",0.6104897765371754

"If Donald Trump followed this really basic advice, he&#8217;d be a lot richer",http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/09/03/if-donald-trump-followed-this-really-basic-advice-hed-be-a-lot-richer/,washpo,"Real estate tycoon Donald Trump arrives on stage for the start of the Republican presidential debate on August 6 in Cleveland, Ohio. (MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images) Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner in next year's presidential primary, has been pitching voters on his experience in business. ""I'm running for office in a country that's essentially bankrupt, and it needs a successful businessman,"" he told Rolling Stone. Yet Trump has not done nearly as well as other American business magnates, or even a typical middle-class retiree following sound financial advice, as a review of the numbers over the past four decades shows. He is a billionaire today despite this poor performance because when he started his career, his father had already built a colossal real-estate empire. And the wealth Donald Trump has accumulated since then has at times come at the expense of taxpayers or the banks and investors who have lent him money. [Read more: A secret to Donald Trump’s success that you simply can’t replicate] Citing data from Forbes, The Associated Press estimates that Trump's net worth quadrupled from $1 billion to $4 billion between 1988 and today. That's an impressive gain, but it's nothing compared to the wealth produced by investors such as Warren Buffett and Bill Gates. Gates's wealth increased from about $1 billion to $80 billion over the same period. Buffett had about $2.5 billion in 1988, and has $68 billion today. Yet perhaps the most telling comparison is between Trump and his golf buddy, Richard LeFrak. The LeFraks and the Trumps have been rivals in New York's real estate business for generations. LeFrak's father, Samuel LeFrak, took a no-nonsense approach to the business. He focused on minimizing risk and making money, according to a 1992 profile in Business Week, before the magazine became Bloomberg Businessweek. ""He might be strutting around like a peacock today, but he's gonna be a feather duster tomorrow,"" the elder LeFrak told Business Week when asked about Trump. Over time, the LeFraks came out ahead of their competitors. LeFrak is worth $7 billion today, and he's 181st on Bloomberg's list of the world's richest people. Bloomberg puts Trump's wealth at just $2.9 billion -- far less than Forbes's estimate. He doesn't even make the list. The LeFraks are a family with long experience in a very competitive industry, but Trump's returns are less even than those of an ordinary investor saving for retirement. Experts on personal finance generally recommend that people saving for retirement or to pay for a child's college education buy and hold in index funds -- mutual funds that are invested in a wide range of stocks or bonds. The price of the funds will go up and down with the market, but over time, these investments will generate a reliable return as long as the investor avoids the temptation to sell in a financial panic. [Read more: It’s time to take a look at the index card with all the financial advice you’ll ever need] Citing an independent evaluation, Business Week put Trump's net worth at $100 million in 1978. Had Trump gotten out of real estate entirely, put his money in an index fund based on the S&P 500 and reinvested the dividends, he'd be worth twice as much -- $6 billion -- today, according to the calculator maintained by the blog Don't Quit Your Day Job. (In this scenario, Trump doesn't quit his day job. The calculation above does not include any allowance for living expenses, so if he had put all his money in index funds, he would have had to live off the dividends or find some other source of income.) Trump disputes the independent appraisals of his wealth by Forbes, Business Week (now Bloomberg) and others. He says he is worth about $10 billion today. Using Trump's preferred estimates of his wealth, he has still performed worse than our hypothetical Main Street retiree. He told The New York Times he was worth $200 million in 1976, an amount that would be worth $12 billion today. ""That a purely un­man­aged in­dex fund’s re­turn could out­per­form Trump’s hands-on wheel­ing and deal­ing calls in­to ques­tion one of Trump’s chief selling points on the cam­paign trail: his busi­ness acu­men,"" writes S.V. Dáte in National Journal. In a way, though, all of these comparisons are misleading. Donald Trump's father, Fred Trump, built his real-estate business on federal subsidies, as The Washington Post's Emily Badger has reported. Financing from Uncle Sam isn't available to the typical investor (although homeowners do benefit indirectly from federal subsidies and can deduct interest they pay on their mortgage from their tax bill). The younger Trump has continued that strategy, boasting about his ability to secure taxpayer dollars from local officials, as the Los Angeles Times has explained. [Read more: How Donald Trump abandoned his father's middle-class empire for luxury building] At other times, Trump has relied not on taxpayers but on banks and private concerns. Firms under his control have gone bankrupt on four occasions, but those catastrophes aren't fully reflected in Trump's net worth today, since his lenders absorbed the losses. The LeFraks, by contrast, have avoided imposing losses on their creditors, while still finding a way to turn a profit.
