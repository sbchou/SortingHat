NORTON, Mass. –  Two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson skipped the Deutsche Bank Championship pro-am Thursday because of a mild back injury.

Watson suffered a mild strain of his back during the weekend of The Barclays, where he finished third. His agent, Jens (pronounced YENTZ) Beck, says Watson received therapy the last few days. His trainer recommended one more day of rest as a precaution.

Watson is No. 3 in the FedEx Cup standings going into the second playoff event.

This is the second week in a row that a top player has missed the pro-am with a sore back. Jason Day felt a twinge during the week at The Barclays. He went on to a six-shot victory.",0.33573100109535337

Will Donald Trump Really Back Down From A Third Party Threat?,http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/09/03/437198983/will-donald-trump-really-back-down-from-a-third-party-threat,npr,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump waves to the crowd after speaking at the National Federation of Republican Assemblies on Saturday, Aug. 29, 2015, in Nashville, Tenn.

Donald Trump may be backing down — sort of. The billionaire businessman was the only GOP presidential candidate not to raise his hand at last month's debate to pledge he wouldn't run as a third-party candidate. Now, however, it seems he's poised to promise not to undertake an independent bid if he loses the Republican nomination. Trump's announcement is expected at a 2 p.m. EST press conference at Trump Tower in New York City. That's after a 1 p.m. meeting with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, where he's expected to sign the pledge. But a GOP source stresses, ""With Trump, nothing is certain until it's final."" Even if Trump inks the pledge, it's not a given that he won't mount a third-party run — or that he'll even stand by this one. The RNC pledge isn't legally binding, and there's nothing holding him to it if he decides the party at a later date isn't treating him fairly. The move appears to be aimed at making sure he qualifies for early primary ballots. South Carolina, which holds the first primary in the South, has a similar pledge affixed to its ballot qualifications, which must be submitted by the end of September. Speaking in the Palmetto State last week, Trump demurred on whether he would sign it, insisting there was plenty of time.

But Trump seemed to be leaning toward signing it at an event last weekend in Nashville. ""We're going to make a decision very soon,"" he told reporters. ""And I think a lot of people are going to be very happy."" With the clock ticking and pressure mounting, Trump appears to be bending to the party — at least for now. Bottom line — Trump has to sign these pledges if he wants to be considered a serious candidate in the short run. He wouldn't even be able to get on the GOP ballot in some important states like South Carolina and possibly Virginia and North Carolina, which are also considering loyalty pledges. Whether those are enforceable is another matter. There's a history of loyalty pledges in parties Parties can determine who gets on their ballot. And when candidates have refused to sign a loyalty oath, they haven't been permitted to run in the primary. In 2008, then-Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich sued to try to get on the Texas Democratic ballot after he wouldn't sign the party's pledge, but courts upheld the decision. Richard Winger, editor of Ballot Access News, said while the primary ballot is enforceable, the general election is a different story. Trump is stating, in good faith, that he won't run as any other party's candidate or an independent if he doesn't win the nomination, but there's still no legal muster behind such a pledge. ""They only have moral force. They can't enforce it,"" Winger said. ""But it's embarrassing for people to give their word that they would not do something and then do it."" Some states do have sore-loser laws. If a candidate loses a primary, that candidate can't run as an independent in the general election. While that's mostly been in congressional races, some may also try to get it to apply to presidential elections, if it came to that. But Winger said that could be a difficult argument, too. In his most recent issue of Ballot Access News, he notes that 34 states who do have sore-loser laws have precedents where they have allowed a candidate to run again, even if they lost the primary. In some cases, that may apply only to an independent run. In 2012, former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson sought and lost the GOP nomination for president. Instead, he ran as the Libertarian Party's nominee, and wasn't allowed on the Michigan ballot. However, that was because he was running under another party's banner — had he simply been running as an independent, he would have been allowed. And in states that hold caucuses instead of primaries, enforcement of a pledge could also prove difficult. So, while there is plenty of legal wiggle room for Trump, this is the surest sign yet that he is trying to play within GOP rules. His actions could engender goodwill from some in the establishment, even though many remain skeptical of his intentions. With where he stands in the polls and with the size of crowds he's drawing, party leaders have to recognize his staying power and that there is feasibly a chance he could be the Republican nominee. For Trump, there is a bright side in signing the pledge, too. If he does win the GOP nomination, now his other rivals, who have badmouthed and beat up on him, will be the ones eating crow — and backing his candidacy.",0.99999999593496436
"Poll: Trump leads GOP nationally, but Carson gains",http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/monmouth-poll-donald-trump-ben-carson-jeb-bush/index.html,cnn,"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump is expanding his strong lead over the other GOP presidential candidates nationally, according to a new poll, but Ben Carson is also posting a big jump in support.

In the first national Monmouth University poll out since the first Republican presidential debate, released Thursday, the real estate mogul is showing a commanding lead at 30% support. That's up 4 points from a poll taken just before the debate last month, but within the poll's margin of error.

It's also a new high for Trump, narrowly topping the 28% support he registered in a Quinnipiac poll late last month.

But Carson, a neurosurgeon, posted the biggest gain in support since August, jumping 13 points to second place. He is holding down 18% support now among Republicans. That continues a trend of recent polls that show him moving up the list.

It's also Carson's highest recorded number in a national poll, topping a 13% mark in a Fox news poll this spring.

Trump's lead also evaporates when the field is narrowed to just him and Carson. Asked about a head-to-head match-up between those two, Republican voters picked Carson over Trump, 55% to 36%.

Carson was the only candidate to beat Trump in a head-to-head, the poll found.

The poll confirms recent trends of Trump's lasting lead and Carson's surge -- as well as steep drops in support for some more establishment candidates.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush fell out of second place, dropping from 12% support in August to 8% now, though that fall is within the margin of error. That tied him for third place with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker also fell. He was in third place at 11% in August, and dropped 8 points to just 3% on Thursday.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio was in fourth place at 5% and businesswoman Carly Fiorina and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee tied in the fifth spot at 4%.

Monmouth surveyed 366 Republican voters between Aug. 31 and Sept. 2 by telephone interview for the poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 5.1 percentage points.

"ACLU, inmates sue over Miami-Dade jail's refusal to provide Muslim religious-based meals",http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/national/~3/KvZeew4VsLY/,fox,"MIAMI –  The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida and four inmates have filed a federal lawsuit challenging Miami-Dade County's refusal to provide religious-based meals to Muslims.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday, says that the policy in place since October 2014 violates the rights of Muslim inmates to exercise their religion and asks a judge to strike it down. The county provides kosher meals for Jewish inmates but not the halal meals requested by Muslims.

Instead, the lawsuit says, Muslims are required to eat a general population diet that does not meet religious standards that prohibit certain animals, requires animals to be slaughtered in a particular way, and mandates that halal foods not come into contact with other foods.

"Why is Ben Carson surging? Once again, it's the media.",http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/03/why-is-ben-carson-surging-once-again-its-the-media/,washpo,"Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson attends an antiabortion rally opposing federal funding for Planned Parenthood on July 28, 2015 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Olivier Douliery/Getty Images) The surge of support for Ben Carson is making some people curious. Howard Kurtz suggests Carson’s surge is “under the media radar.” That’s exactly backwards. Carson’s surge is arguably because he got back on the media’s radar. Even though Carson is not receiving a lot of news coverage, the trends in Carson’s polling numbers are easily understood as responses to trends in how much he’s covered in news — much as is true of Donald Trump. [Why is Trump surging? Blame the media.] Here is a graph showing the percentage of news stories that mention Carson and his national polling numbers. As in my previous posts, I draw on social analytic tools provided by Crimson Hexagon. These tools are devised to gather and reveal the volume and tone of media coverage on major news sites. UCLA political scientist Lynn Vavreck and I are analyzing the news coverage of presidential candidates as part of our joint work on the 2016 election. Carson declared his candidacy on May 3. Our data starts on May 16, at which point we are still picking up the bump Carson received from his announcement. In addition, Carson got spikes of attention for speeches at Sen. Joni Ernst’s “Roast and Ride” event in Iowa and the Freedom and Faith Coalition Conference. His coverage then began to wane, as did his poll numbers. The spike in his poll numbers came only after he began to get more attention around the Aug. 6 debate and thereafter. [Why does Trump remain atop the polls? You can still blame the media.] To see this more clearly, let’s take an average of Carson’s poll numbers and graph that against his news coverage. This graph puts news coverage on the left-hand axis and the poll average on the right-hand axis. It shows the correlation more clearly. (And despite all the bumps and wiggles in news coverage, there is a statistically significant correlation here.) An underappreciated fact is that Carson was also polling reasonably well in May and June — when he was getting, on average, some degree of news coverage after announcing his candidacy and giving these speeches. Then, after the Faith and Freedom speech, he got much less attention. His poll average followed suit. Finally, after he began to get more attention at the beginning of August, his poll average increased. Again, it is possible that news coverage responds to poll numbers. Increasing polling numbers always make for horse-race coverage. But, as I’ve argued in the past, we should expect the news coverage to come first. People’s views about a candidate are likely to change only when the information they’re getting about that candidate changes. News coverage isn’t the sole source of information, but it’s an important one. Certainly being on the media’s radar has been crucial for Carson.",0.99943370105834206
Carly Fiorina has now officially qualified for the main stage at CNN's debate,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/03/carly-fiorina-has-now-officially-qualified-for-the-main-stage-at-cnns-debate/,washpo,"With the release of a new Monmouth University national poll on Thursday, former HP executive Carly Fiorina is now virtually guaranteed a spot on the main debate stage for CNN's Sept. 16 Republican presidential debate. Fiorina takes four percent in the poll, well behind the leaders -- Donald Trump stands at 30 percent and Ben Carson places second with 18 percent. But, that show of support puts her in the top 10 of all the polls conducted after Fox News' debate last month. And with CNN’s rule change earlier this week, that means she gets to appear on-stage even though she’s still only 11th in all of the polls they’re considering. One other note: Ted Cruz has now passed Marco Rubio in overall poll standing and so will be slightly closer to the center of the stage than he was at the Fox debate.",0.908083331072291
