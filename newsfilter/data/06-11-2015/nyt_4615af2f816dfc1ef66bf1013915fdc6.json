{"body": "In the fourth quarter of 1991 and of 2011, Democratic and Republican officials broke toward candidates who would ultimately become their party\u2019s nominee: Bill Clinton and Mitt Romney.\n\nEach was imperfect, and each faced protracted resistance from dissenting factions in his party. But by late fall, the choice was clear for many party leaders. In 1991, Mario Cuomo decided not to run; in 2011, Rick Perry proved to be a disaster. And in both election cycles, no one else seemed to have the wide appeal necessary to unify the party or win the general election.\n\nIt\u2019s still too early to say whether the Republican primary has reached a similar moment, but when analysts look back on the 2016 election, they may conclude that the G.O.P. reached a similar inflection point this week. Last week\u2019s debate might have been a clarifying moment for party officials and donors, moving many toward deciding in favor of Marco Rubio and ultimately sending him on a path to the nomination.\n\nTo be clear, there\u2019s no guarantee this will happen. Mr. Rubio\u2019s rivals are stronger than the ones who faced Mr. Clinton or Mr. Romney at this point in 1991 or 2011. And Mr. Rubio is behind where just about every winning candidate since 1980 has stood at this stage. There is plenty of time for him to stumble, or for his opposition to make the choice for Republican elites a lot more complicated.\n\nBut over the last week, he has won the endorsements of three Republican senators \u2014 Cory Gardner, Jim Risch and Steve Daines. He has also picked up the pace of fund-raising in recent weeks, including winning over a coveted billionaire bundler, Paul Singer. The endorsements and healthy fund-raising follow a strong performance in last week\u2019s Republican debate, when Mr. Rubio not only shined but also did so at the expense of his principal mainstream rival, Jeb Bush.\n\nThe debate didn\u2019t knock out Mr. Bush, but it was only the latest misstep for a campaign that has struggled to attract support from voters and party officials. With Mr. Bush looking so weak \u2014 and with other mainstream rivals lagging even further behind \u2014 Mr. Rubio increasingly looks like the natural choice for the party. He is electable, conservative and broadly acceptable across the party\u2019s various factions \u2014 including to its establishment. It\u2019s still not nearly as clear as it was in 1991 or 2011, but it makes sense that Republican officials have begun to move in Mr. Rubio\u2019s direction.\n\nMr. Rubio will need to keep this going. By every measure of primary strength, he has not matched the progress of recent winning candidates; the only clear exception since 1980 is Mr. Clinton, who was not in the race until October 1991 and might not be an especially informative comparison.\n\nAt the moment, it may seem easy to imagine that Mr. Rubio is hurtling toward the nomination. The prediction markets appear to believe as much, giving him a 43 percent chance to win the nomination. (Donald Trump is second at 19 percent.) But until he actually amasses the support he needs from voters or party elites, there will be many opportunities for him to slide off track.\n\nHe could falter under the increased scrutiny he will soon face, particularly for his participation with seven other senators in writing the  2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill. After the bill failed in the House, he essentially disavowed it. He has largely dodged the issue so far, but opponents could raise many questions: about his substantive views on a controversial issue; whether conservatives can trust him to focus on their priorities versus those of business elites and liberals; and his willingness to fight for what he believes in. He must also deal with new questions over his use of a party credit card in 2006-7.\n\nEven if he fares well, factional rivals stand in his way. The Republican Party is deeply divided, and candidates with special appeal to particular blocs of voters and donors could prevent him from winning the invisible primary or the early state contests.\n\nImagine a fairly moderate Republican, for instance, who is still considering Mr. Bush or John Kasich or Chris Christie, or a more conservative Republican who is still considering Ted Cruz. If too many of these candidates are strong, they could block Mr. Rubio in Iowa, in New Hampshire or in fund-raising. Any of them could still surge \u2014 even Mr. Bush \u2014 and make the choice for party officials a lot more difficult than it seems today.\n\nAnd ultimately, Mr. Rubio\u2019s support among party elites will need to translate into support among voters. To date, he has not been the voters\u2019 first choice, far off the pace of Mr. Trump and Ben Carson. The easiest way to earn a base of support in a big field is to be a clear favorite of a party faction, and he has not reached that point yet.\n\nBut strength in the invisible primary grants credibility and resources. It also attracts news attention and bolsters his prominence and stature for future coverage. If he continues his fund-raising success, it will give him the resources to compete on the air and build a strong organization in early states.\n\nJust about everything so far has gone right for Mr. Rubio. When he announced his candidacy, I outlined a hypothetical situation in which he could become the favorite, but I really didn\u2019t think it likely:\n\nFew would have guessed this would all happen, let alone to the extent it has \u2014 with Mr. Walker out of the race and Mr. Bush struggling so much. I certainly didn\u2019t. But it has, and it has given Mr. Rubio the opening he needs.", "byline": "NATE COHN", "description": "There is plenty of time to stumble, but last week\u2019s debate might have been a clarifying moment for party officials and donors to get behind him.", "title": "The Road to 2016: Marco Rubio and Republican Party Seem Near a Turning Point", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/06/upshot/marco-rubio-and-republican-party-seem-near-a-turning-point.html", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Mitt Romney", "Paul Singer", "Bill Clinton", "Jim Risch", "Jeb Bush", "Cory Gardner", "Rick Perry", "John Kasich", "Donald Trump", "Chris Christie", "Marco Rubio", "Steve Daines", "Mario Cuomo", "Scott Walker", "Ben Carson", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": ["Republican Party"], "election_confidence": 0.9996503408904561, "authors": [{"author_id": 312, "fullname": "nate cohn", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-11-05 15:01:31", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "4615af2f816dfc1ef66bf1013915fdc6", "date_access": "2015-11-05 15:36:20.322110"}
