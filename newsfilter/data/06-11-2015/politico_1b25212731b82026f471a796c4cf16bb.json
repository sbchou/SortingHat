(Getty) | Getty\n\n            By \nHeather Caygle\n             and \nLauren Gardner\n\n11/05/15 11:14 AM EST\nSpeaker Paul Ryan just pulled off what no House leader has been able to do in a decade \u2014corralling an unruly chamber into passing a massive, multiyear highway and transit bill. \nThe measure would also revive the Export-Import Bank, a trade-promoting agency that expired last summer amid attacks from conservative lawmakers.\nStory Continued Below\nThe bill is an important first victory for Ryan, giving him something tangible to underpin his promises of a more open and collaborative legislative process. His office boasted of their new, open era by pointing to the more than 100 amendment votes on the House floor allowed on this bill alone.\nOf course, Ryan's role as leader in pushing the bill through was partly serendipitous. A massive budget and debt ceiling deal was hammered out before Ryan took the gavel which cleared the decks, allowing the House to move on to other legislative issues. And the highway bill, with a mid-November deadline to take action, was understood to be next in the queue, even under his predecessor, former Speaker John Boehner.\nStill, House leaders knew that while transportation bills are typically bipartisan, something can always go awry in the unpredictable chamber \u2014 witness the last bill from 2012, which was so contentious that Boehner had to yank it from the floor. \nBut for all the leadership pomp, the bill itself does little more than punt on a viable solution for a long-worn problem \u2014 how to get federal transportation programs on a sustainable path to solvency. Still, the bill provides a much needed lifeline to the construction industry, which for years has operated under stop and go federal funding while highways and bridges fell further into disrepair. \nThe House's base bill, which passed in a 363-64 vote, authorizes nearly $340 billion for highway and transit program over six years. The original bill would have paid for just three years of funding, but an amendment adopted at the last minute Thursday could add an additional $40 billion, shoring up funding for the life of the bill.\nThe lower chamber's bill must still be reconciled with a similar Senate bill that also allows for six years of highway and transit policy, albeit at slightly higher funding levels. \nNegotiators hope to hammer out a final bill acceptable to lawmakers in both chambers in just a couple of weeks, by the time current Highway Trust Fund policy expires Nov. 20.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Ryan notches a transportation win", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/house-passes-6-year-highway-bill-215555", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "trade"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Lauren Gardner", "Erin Mershon", "Doug Palmer", "Hadas Gold", "Natasha Korecki", "Ronald Reagan", "Janet Yellen", "Jenny Hopkinson", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Theodoric Meyer", "Darius Tahir", "Pope Francis", "Caitlin Emma", "Kalina Oroschakoff", "Nick Gass", "Bernie Becker", "Lauren French", "Jeb Bush", "Seung Min Kim", "Issac J.
