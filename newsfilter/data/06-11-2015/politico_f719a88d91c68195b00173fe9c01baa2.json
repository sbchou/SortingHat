Chris Christie shrugged off the prospect of being pushed out of the next mainstage Republican presidential primary debate, saying Thursday that the only thing that matters is that he's on a debate stage. \nA Fox News poll released Wednesday found Christie polling at just 2 percent, pushing his average in POLITICO's list of national polls down to just 2.25 percent, which would put him below the 2.5 percent threshold for the upcoming primetime GOP debate.\nStory Continued Below\nFox Business Network, which is co-hosting Tuesday's debate with The Wall Street Journal, plans to announce its lineup for the top- and lower-tier debates at 7 p.m. Thursday evening.\n\"We won't know till tonight,\" Christie said on Fox News' America's Newsroom. \"But listen, the bottom line is you need to be on a stage and debating. And so I will be on a stage and debating one way or the other wherever they put me. You put one in the middle of the square in Manchester, I'll do it there,\" he said. \"I'm looking forward to being the debate in Milwaukee on Tuesday.\"\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\nThe New Jersey governor then took a jab at former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. \n\"I'm looking forward to being able to get it again on the issues that are really important, and remind everybody that our real adversary \u2014 her \u2014 our real problem lives in Chappaqua, New York. It's Hillary Clinton.
