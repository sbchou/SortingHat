I want the House to work its will. I think that's the way the founders envisioned it to work. And so some things will pass, and some things won't, and we're going to let that happen.\"\nStory Continued Below\nRyan did allow a wide range of amendments on the Senate's highway bill this week, which was received as a hopeful sign by lawmakers yearning for more power. Traditionally, it's an embarrassment for leadership if a bill fails on the House floor.\n\"The way I am trying to do this job is the way I always thought it should have been done and that is to make this a more open process,\" Ryan said. \"So that every citizen of this country through their elected representatives has the opportunity to make a difference. That is the people's House. This is the branch of government closest to the people.\n\"So I wanted to have a process that is more open, more inclusive, more deliberative, more participatory and that's what we're trying to do.\"\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "'We're not going to bottle up the process so much and predetermine the outcome of everything around here,' the new speaker says.", "title": "Ryan: I&apos;m OK with bills failing", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/paul-ryan-bills-fail-215563", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Lauren Gardner", "Erin Mershon", "Doug Palmer", "Hadas Gold", "Natasha Korecki", "Ronald Reagan", "Janet Yellen", "Jenny Hopkinson", "Brian Mahoney", "Theodoric Meyer", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Bernie Sanders", "Nick Gass", "Bernie Becker", "Barney Frank", "Jeb Bush", "Seung Min Kim", "Issac J.
