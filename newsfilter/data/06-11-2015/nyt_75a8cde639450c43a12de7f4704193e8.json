{"body": "When the Republican presidential hopefuls take the stage in Milwaukee on Tuesday night for their fourth debate, familiar faces will be missing from the prime time lineup \u2014 Mike Huckabee and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.\n\nOn Thursday, Fox Business Network, the host of the debate, announced on \u201cLou Dobbs Tonight\u201d the qualifiers for the main stage, and Mr. Christie and Mr. Huckabee \u2014 who had been slipping in recent polls \u2014 did not quite make the cut.\n\nTo qualify for the prime-time debate based on the network\u2019s criteria, candidates needed to score at least 2.5 percent or higher in an average of the four most recent national polls through Nov. 4. Those below the 2.5 percent average in the polls could qualify for the so-called \u201cundercard\u201d debate, as long as they hit at least 1 percent in at least one of the four most recent national polls.\n\nDropping off the main stage is a huge blow to Mr. Christie, who has struggled to gain the traction for which he\u2019d hoped ever since announcing his bid, and who saw his \u201ctell it like it is\u201d message inadvertently usurped by Donald J. Trump\u2019s freewheeling, tell-it-like-it-is campaign.\n\nMr. Christie seemed prepared for the news, tweeting within seconds of the announcement that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter the stage, give me a podium and I\u2019ll be there to talk about real issues like this,\u201d with a link to his now-viral video speaking about drug addiction. \n\nFor Mr. Huckabee, it\u2019s another example of his inability to gain the same traction among evangelicals that helped fuel his rise in 2008. \n\nThe debates, which so far have shattered ratings records, have been critical in helping candidates gain national attention and boost themselves in the eyes of donors and voters \u2014 and falling from the main stage to the undercard is likely to hurt Mr. Christie with donors and national exposure. \n\nCarly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, used her strong performance on the undercard stage in the first debate, hosted by Fox News, to launch herself into the upper-tier of candidates, and she subsequently rose in polls after her strong performance at her prime-time debate debut on Sept. 16.\n\nThe candidates who have been relegated to the \u201cjunior varsity\u201d debate have struggled to capture voter and media attention. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana are both pushing the networks to hold two 90-minute prime-time debates with seven candidates \u2014 chosen randomly \u2014 on each stage.\n\nThe next debate will be Fox Business Network\u2019s first debate. The network has already been promising a more substantive, policy-focused face-off than that of CNBC, who came under criticism for a debate that many Republicans said focused too much on \u201cgotcha\u201d questions.
