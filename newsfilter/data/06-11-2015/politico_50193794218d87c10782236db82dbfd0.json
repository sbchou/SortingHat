That could anger some U.S. companies who feel wronged by Mexican policies.\n\u201cThe text that I\u2019ve read so far includes annexes and exclusions up the gazoo,\u201d said Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.), a House Ways and Means member. \u201cYou think you\u2019ve seen it all? You have not. Exclusions to rules by each country. Bilateral deals with Japan, and more than 50 two-way side letters.\u201d\n\n\n\n            By \nHeather Caygle\n             and \nLauren Gardner\n\nBut what might seem like a quirky or inexplicable loophole from one partner's perspective turns out to be a make-or-break provision for another, based on that nation's history and economic traditions. And building a trade deal with 12 partners \u2014 especially one that will cover 40 percent of the world's gross domestic product \u2014 involves a delicate balancing act, juggling among numerous sensitivities on the path to a deal. \nU.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman says the deal will lower trade barriers and advance America's values, as well as its interests in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region. \n\"Other countries, such as China, are already moving forward with deals that don\u2019t reflect our interests and our values,\" he said Thursday. \"Failure to pass TPP would come at a high price here at home: jobs lost, wages cut and opportunity squandered.\"\nFroman asserted that a foreign government's ability to win exceptions in the deal was often weighed against the commercial impact on U.S. businesses. \nMalaysia, for instance, sought to retain programs that give native Malays, known as Bumiputera, preference for contracts for government projects. The final deal laid out a sliding scale, allowing Malay businesses to get greater preference for smaller projects, while larger procurement bids, which are more interesting to U.S. firms, would provide fewer advantages. \n\u201cIt\u2019s an absolutely central policy there, absolutely central to their politics,\u201d Froman said of Malaysia. \u201cThey would not be able to participate in TPP if they were not accommodated in one form or the other for what is a defining feature of their political system.\u201d\nBy the same token, the U.S. was able to maintain the advantages given to small or minority-owned businesses when bidding on government contracts.\nVietnam made new openings in its public procurement market, which has largely been off limits to outside firms. But Hanoi can require foreign firms that win government contracts to use local labor and materials to benefit Vietnamese businesses.\n\u201cIn terms of opening markets, it\u2019s going to take them time,\u201d said Jean Heilman Grier, a trade consultant who served as chief procurement negotiator for the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office.\n\n\n\n            By \nJake Sherman\n\nFor the first time, the U.S. was also able to include rules that establish fair competition between private companies and state-owned enterprises, which some regard as a signal to China that membership in TPP would require drastic economic reforms.\nBut even as those rules seek to level the playing field in Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore \u2014 countries with extensive state ownership throughout the economy \u2014 the deal allows those governments to shield such entities from certain requirements \u2014 potentially raising concerns among pro-business Republicans who want to see companies from their districts thrive in foreign markets.\nSingapore\u2019s massive sovereign wealth fund, Temasek, was exempted from the agreement's rules on competition, for instance, despite its involvement in what are considered state-owned companies. But many of the companies it owns will be covered by the pact's rules if Temasek appoints the CEO, or a majority of the senior management or board of directors, or if it actively directs the business.\nMalaysia was able to preserve the ability of state-owned companies to offer preference to ethnic-Malay-owned businesses when purchasing goods and services, but only for commercial activities taking place within the country.\nVietnam was permitted to bypass a rule restricting government subsidies to state companies \u2014 as long as the funding is used for restructuring and does not give the company an unfair market share or enable it to undercut prices.\nDespite the number of those exclusions for state-owned enterprises, U.S. businesses seemed heartened that few were granted a blanket exemption.\n\u201cI think the objective was every SOE [state-owned enterprise] had to eat something on the menu,\u201d said a business source closely following the talks. \u201cI\u2019m expecting to give a \u2018B\u2019 to USTR.\u201d\nLawmakers may also raise concerns over the definition of a state-owned enterprise, which the deal requires to be more than 50 percent owned by the government.\n\u201cIf a government owns 49 percent of the shares in a particular company and let\u2019s say no other shareholder owns more than 1 percent ... you would pretty likely expect that there would be a great deal of government influence and control over that enterprise,\u201d said a House Ways and Means Committee staffer. \u201cSo I think that is a very real concern of ours.\u201d\nVictoria Guida contributed to this report.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The exceptions range from limits on foreign circuses in Peru to continued preferences for small and minority-owned businesses in the U.S.", "title": "TPP deal has &apos;exclusions up the gazoo&apos;", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/trade-tpp-exceptions-215582", "topics": ["trade"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Lauren Gardner", "Erin Mershon", "Bill Pascrell", "Henry C.
