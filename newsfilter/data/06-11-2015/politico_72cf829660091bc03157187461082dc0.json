Give me another one,\" Carson asked a scrum of media on CNN in Miami during a book signing tour. \u201cTrying to hit my mom in the head with a hammer? That was around the same time as the stabbing incident.\u201d\nThe reporter pressed, saying the victims could not be located among nine friends, classmates and neighbors interviewed in the article. \n\u201cWell, why would you be able to find them? What makes you think you would be able to find them? Unless I tell you who they are. And if they come forward on their own, because of your story, that\u2019s fine, but I\u2019m not going to expose them,\" Carson responded.\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\nAsked by another reporter whether he had the chance to take a look at the so-called wet foot, dry foot policy or related issues for which he appeared unprepared during a Miami Herald interview on Wednesday, Carson said that he had but that he wants to do \"an in-depth deep dive.\"\n\"Because, see, it doesn\u2019t make sense to me, quite frankly, the whole wet foot, dry foot thing doesn\u2019t make sense to me. Because like I said, you catch them a mile off, you treat them differently than if they\u2019re on the shore. And I also recognize that many people have taken advantage of that, and you know, gotten all kinds of benefits that perhaps they don\u2019t deserve,\" the retired neurosurgeon explained. \"There are other people who perhaps get denied things that they should have. You know, you need to dive into those things deeply, and I\u2019m not sure that wet foot, dry foot is where the emphasis should be. The emphasis should be on people who are trying to escape an oppressive regime, how do we make sure people not appropriately doing it don\u2019t take advantage of our generosity?\"\nOn Wednesday, BuzzFeed unearthed a 1998 commencement speech the Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon gave at Andrews College in which he remarked that his \"own personal theory is that Joseph built the pyramids to store grain.\"\n\"Now all the archaeologists think that they were made for the pharaohs\u2019 graves. But, you know, it would have to be something awfully big if you stop and think about it. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019d just disappear over the course of time to store that much grain,\" Carson said in the video.\nOn Thursday, Carson defended his belief.\n\u201cSome people believe in the Bible, like I do, and don\u2019t find that to be silly at all and believe that God created the Earth and don\u2019t find that to be silly at all,\" Carson said. \"The secular progressives try to ridicule it anytime it comes up, and they\u2019re welcome to do that.\u201d\nInformed about Carson's pyramid theory on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" rival Donald Trump said, \"I think I'll have to put that into my repertoire when I talk about Ben.\" \n\"That was a strange -- that was a strange deal,\" he remarked. \"I learn a lot by watching your show, folks.\"\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Carson on the defensive over claims of past violence, pyramids", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/ben-carson-violence-pyramids-215562", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Lauren Gardner", "Erin Mershon", "Hadas Gold", "Natasha Korecki", "Ronald Reagan", "Janet Yellen", "Jon Allen", "Jenny Hopkinson", "Brian Mahoney", "Theodoric Meyer", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Bernie Sanders", "Nick Gass", "Bernie Becker", "Barney Frank", "Jeb Bush", "Seung Min Kim", "Issac J.
