debate. He failed to qualify for the upcoming GOP undercard debate. | Getty\n\n            By \nHadas Gold\n\n11/05/15 09:19 PM EST\nRepublican candidates blasted the media, Fox Business Network and The Wall Street Journal after news broke that several of them would not make the main stage, and some were cut out of the event entirely. \nSen. Lindsey Graham and former Gov. George Pataki failed to qualify for the undercard debate or the main event next Tuesday because they did not reach 1 percent in one of the four recent polls Fox News chose to recognize.\n\"Regardless of this decision tonight, Senator Graham continues to be the foremost expert on foreign policy and national security in this field of candidates, on either stage. We are sincerely disappointed in Fox Business and Wall Street Journal's decision to use the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll that only listed ten candidates as options rather than the full field,\" Graham campaign manager Christian Ferry said in a statement. \"It is ironic that the only veteran in the race is going to be denied a voice the day before Veterans Day. In the end, the biggest loser tonight is the American people and the Republican Presidential primary process that has been hijacked by news outlets.\" \nThe Fox Business debate has shrunk the size of the main debate stage, from the 11-candidate high at the CNN-hosted GOP debate in September, down to eight candidates for next week's debate. Gov. Chris Christie and former Gov. Mike Huckabee will now appear for the first time this cycle on the undercard debate stage, alongside former Sen. Rick Santorum and Gov. Bobby Jindal. Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Sen. Marco Rubio, Sen. Ted Cruz, former Gov. Jeb Bush, Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Rand Paul will appear on the prime-time debate stage. \nIn a statement, Bill Shine, Fox Business and Fox News' senior executive vice president for programming, said the network was proud to present the line up.\n\n\n\n            By \n                    POLITICO Staff\n\n\u201cFOX Business Network is proud to announce the lineup for the fourth Republican Presidential Debates and we look forward to discussing the important business and economic issues facing the country. We would like to thank the candidates, the city of Milwaukee and the Republican National Committee, and our partner The Wall Street Journal, for helping to organize and host these very important debates,\" Shine said.\nPataki also blasted the media for turning the debates into a reality show for ratings gain.\n\u201cVery disappointed tonight that early national polls are shaping the election choices for the American people. This new trend is a danger to our primary system, a disservice to voters everywhere, especially those in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina and a clear boost for the worship of celebrity over accomplishment and ideas,\" Pataki said in a statement. \"Running for the most important leadership position in the world shouldn't be reduced to the level of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d or \u201cSurvivor.\u201d The voters should decide our next president \u2014 not networks driven by ratings or national polls that are statistically irrelevant.\"\nHadas Gold is a reporter at\u00a0Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Some were cut out of the Fox Business Network debate entirely.", "title": "Candidates blast media over winnowing debate stage", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2015/11/candidates-blast-media-over-winnowing-debate-215584", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "economy"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Lauren Gardner", "Henry C.
