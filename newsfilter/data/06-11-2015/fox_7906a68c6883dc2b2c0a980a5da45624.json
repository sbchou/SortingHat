Donald Trump\u00a0is unlike anything in modern political history, but he\u2019s trying to get a little more mainstream.  His personal invective and brash rhetoric would have long ago sunk any other presidential hopeful. But with universal name recognition, endless media attention, devoted support from immigration foes and the backing of blue collar voters outside of the GOP\u2019s conservative base, Trump has endured and prospered.  The latest Fox News\u00a0poll\u00a0has him at the top of the field yet again, and though rival\u00a0Ben Carson\u00a0has moved into a statistical tie, establishment notions that Trump would fade with the fall have been shredded.  Now Trump is promising to complete another unprecedented pivot. He went from punchline to frontrunner this summer and now he says he can go from media dependency to a solid, traditional campaign organization that can last through downswings in news coverage.  His first\u00a0official ads\u00a0hit radio airwaves in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina for a relatively paltry $300,000. But it\u2019s a start. And Trump was already serious enough this summer to\u00a0reach out\u00a0to mega-donor\u00a0Sheldon Adleson\u00a0and others whom Trump tried to convince to stay out of this cycle rather seek to block his path to the GOP nomination.  But will Trump really buckle down? He should have long ago been spending on a larger campaign organization and running ads in early states. Trump needs to reinforce his support and try to reach new voters skeptical of his presidential qualities because of his over-the-top rhetoric and reality TV background.  Maybe. But Trump\u2019s gonna Trump. In his ad for his upcoming \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d appearance, Trump\u00a0slams rival\u00a0Carson saying, \u201cBen Carson is a complete and total loser!\u201d Not how you convince Evangelicals to get on the Trump train.  There may be a disciplined candidate in there somewhere and one who will, as promised, dig into his own pockets to fund a campaign and cut back on the attacks. But if that guy doesn\u2019t show up in the next few weeks, Carson, who is aggressively building his campaign and tenaciously sticking to his message, will ultimately surpass him.  Why moderates matter so much in the conservative party\u2019s primary -\u00a0FiveThirtyEight: \u201cIn reality, the GOP nominating contest will be decided by an intricate, state-by-state slog for the 2,472 delegates at stake between February and June. And thanks to the Republican National Committee\u2019s allocation rules, the votes of \u201cBlue Zone\u201d Republicans \u2014 the more moderate GOP primary voters who live in Democratic-leaning states and congressional districts \u2014 could weigh more than those of more conservative voters who live in deeply red zones. Put another way: The Republican voters who will have little to no sway in the general election could have some of the most sway in the primary.\u201d  Rubio says he\u2019d end Obama amnesty -\u00a0Tampa Bay Times:\u00a0\u201cMarco Rubio\u00a0[Wednesday] in New Hampshire said he would end the Obama administration\u2019s program that has protected hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation. He told reporters he hopes there can be legislation \u2014 something he attempted - but if Congress can\u2019t act, \u2018it will end. It cannot be the permanent policy of the United States.\u2019\u201d  [Snags third Senate endorsement -\u00a0The Hill:\u00a0\u201cSen.\u00a0James Risch\u00a0(R-Idaho) announced Wednesday that he is backing Sen.\u00a0Marco Rubio\u00a0for president, giving the Florida Republican his third Senate endorsement this week.\u201d]  Cruz\u2019s path -\u00a0NYT\u2019s\u00a0Nate Cohn\u00a0says that despite initial nay-saying at\u00a0Ted Cruz\u2019s run for the presidency the Texas senator now has a\u00a0path forward\u00a0through Iowa: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t lead [in Iowa] now, but the caucus is still three months off, and he has a large and untapped war chest. Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson might fade, which could help if a disproportionate share of their anti-establishment support goes his way. If Mr. Cruz finishes well in Iowa, it won\u2019t be hard to envision a serious run for the nomination\u2026Soon after come the predominantly Southern states on Super Tuesday, where very conservative voters represent a larger share of the primary electorate than any other region of the country.\u201d  Jeb calls anxious donors \u2018nervous nellies\u2019 -\u00a0Bloomberg:\u00a0\u201cRepublican presidential candidate Jeb Bush\u00a0is urging\u00a0\u2018nervous nellies\u2019 among his top donors to stop reading the political press, saying the campaign is on the right track and that he will\u00a0win the first primary contest in New Hampshire.\u201d  WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026 Florida Today:\u00a0\u201cIf you stand between 62 and 75 inches tall, have a military, science or technical background and dream of going to Mars,\u00a0you might have the\u00a0right stuff to be a NASA astronaut.

[Bernie] Sanders\u00a0of Vermont, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, also said the federal investigation of the security surrounding Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private email account is appropriate.

Mr. Sanders rejected that assessment on Wednesday.
