{"body": "If you\u2019ve been following Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign over the past few months, you already know what\u2019s in his book.\n\nRepeated assurances that Mr. Trump is extremely wealthy and successful? Check. Trumpian infelicities of language? Check \u2014 \u201cif you have laws that you don\u2019t enforce,\u201d Mr. Trump writes, \u201cthen you don\u2019t have laws. This leads to lawlessness.\u201d Complex issues of international relations and domestic policy discussed in terms of \u201cwinning\u201d and \u201closing\u201d? Check, ad nauseam.\n\nIn fact, what\u2019s most surprising about Mr. Trump\u2019s book, called \u201cCrippled America: How to Make America Great Again\u201d and released on Tuesday, is how few surprises it contains.\n\nMr. Trump is clearly pleased with his reputation for making shocking statements. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he writes, \u201cI make outrageous comments and give them what they want \u2014 viewers and readers \u2014 in order to make a point. I\u2019m a businessman with a brand to sell.\u201d And on the campaign trail, he has repeatedly cast his opponents as \u201clow-energy.\u201d The message: Other candidates are dull, but Donald Trump shakes it up with his unfiltered, take-no-prisoners style. Who knows what he\u2019ll say next?\n\nActually, pretty much everyone knows. At this point, Mr. Trump is just as predictable as Jeb Bush, or any of the other candidates he\u2019s criticized as not energetic enough to lead the country. He has one idea, and it\u2019s a terrible one: Build a wall between the United States and Mexico and somehow force Mexico to pay for it. Beyond that, his book and his campaign consist mainly of boasts about his deal-making prowess, promises to solve complicated problems by asking some smart people about them (to develop a healthcare plan to replace Obamacare, he writes, \u201cwe should hire the most knowledgeable people in the world on this subject and lock them in a room \u2014 and not unlock the door until they\u2019ve agreed on the steps we need to take\u201d) and a few insults thrown in for good measure.\n\nThe pot shots and grandstanding that defined Mr. Trump at the beginning of his campaign weren\u2019t evidence of an outside-the-box intellect at work, as some of his supporters claimed. They\u2019re all Mr. Trump has, and like any other routine, they get tired over time. Can you think of something Mr. Trump could say that would actually shock you now? I can\u2019t, except, \u201cI am totally unqualified for the presidency.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has certainly been more openly xenophobic than some of his opponents (though a few have gamely risen to his level). But ultimately, he\u2019s no more exciting than any of them \u2014 he\u2019s just louder.", "byline": "ANNA NORTH", "description": "Mr. Trump is just as predictable as Jeb Bush, or any of the other candidates he\u2019s criticized as not energetic enough to lead the country.", "title": "Taking Note: Donald Trump Is Boring", "url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/donald-trump-is-boring/", "topics": ["immigration", "personality", "foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Jeb Bush"], "orgs": [], "election_confidence": 0.9776386606027179, "authors": [{"author_id": 740, "fullname": "anna north", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-11-05 19:35:53", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "b5c77796afa6eca2602ad05973082191", "date_access": "2015-11-05 20:07:46.728323"}
