Democrats had filibustered spending bills all year in order to pressure Republicans into a broader budget deal that would increase both domestic and military spending.\n\u201cIf senators cooperate in moving things along and scheduling votes on amendments to the bill, we can vote on passage on Tuesday night so that senators can commemorate Veterans Day back home with their constituents,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Thursday as he teed up the vote. \u201cObviously this is going to require some cooperation from all members.\u201d\nIf the Milcon-VA bill advances as expected on Thursday afternoon, it could also be used as the vehicle for the broader omnibus spending bill that covers funding for all government agencies. Congress needs to approve a new spending law before Dec. 11 to avoid a government shutdown. But with a broader budget deal already in place, which raised spending limits overall, both parties hope to resolve their differences over lower-tier policy issues and avoid a shutdown in a few weeks. \n\u201cI\u2019m pleased the Republican leader appears to have come around and decided now to move forward on one of our nondefense priorities: the funding of veterans programs,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that the Milcon-VA appropriations bill will help us move towards a bipartisan omnibus funding bill both parties can accept.\u201d\nEarlier Thursday, Senate Democrats blocked the appropriations measure funding for the Defense Department on a 51-44 vote. \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Dems ease spending bill blockade", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/democrats-spending-bills-215561", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Harry Reid", "Lauren Gardner", "Erin Mershon", "Doug Palmer", "Hadas Gold", "Natasha Korecki", "Ronald Reagan", "Janet Yellen", "Jenny Hopkinson", "Brian Mahoney", "Theodoric Meyer", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Bernie Sanders", "Nick Gass", "Bernie Becker", "Barney Frank", "Jeb Bush", "Seung Min Kim", "Issac J.
