(\"I'm not going to solve your septic problem tonight, I'm afraid,\" Bush told one woman.)\nBush has taken the ribbing in good humor, as an email exchange released by National Review reporter Katherine Timpf shows.\nFirst, Timpf tweeted at Bush to ask if voting for him would help empower her to clean her room:\n\nHey my room is a mess can u fix it @JebBush\nHe replied with his email address:\n@KatTimpf email jeb@jeb.org with the details\nShe then shared her email:\nPlease confirm when read @JebBush pic.twitter.com/qeY2aMhgN2\nBush tweeted back:\n@KatTimpf sent you some guidance\n\u201cI will empower you to clean up your own room. It will be liberating! You will feel good about yourself. You will then live a life of purpose and meaning. You will be inspired to help other to help them clean their own rooms. This is the path to lessen our dependency on Mt Washington. You can do it and I fixed. Jeb,\u201d he wrote.\nThe book is part of a broader campaign by Bush, who reportedly spent 25-30 hours a week on email when he was in office, to showcase his commitment to transparency and draw a contrast with the investigation into Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server.\nBush has been giving out his address for years. But he's deluged with emails since he started more proactively telling voters to send him a note:\n\nJeb says he has gotten some 800 emails over the last 24 hours. Including one from a man asking if he could fix his toilet.\nAsked by POLITICO why he started giving out his personal email address, Bush responded in under two hours.\n\"I\u2019ve been doing this for years. I love hearing from people,\" he wrote.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Jeb emails National Review reporter about her messy room", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/jeb-bush-emails-national-review-reporter-215569", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Lauren Gardner", "Erin Mershon", "Henry C.
