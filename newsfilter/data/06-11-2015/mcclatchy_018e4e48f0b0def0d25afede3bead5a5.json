{"body": " Latino activists are angrily demanding that Donald Trump not host \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d this week. Republican presidential candidates have been bickering over how debates should be conducted. And younger voters are showing little enthusiasm for either political party.\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way for Republicans. After the 2012 election, a high-level party study said the GOP needed to be more tolerant and welcoming and \u201cneeds to stop talking to itself.\u201d\nBut thanks to a wave of unsavory publicity triggered by the views and insults offered by some of the party\u2019s 2016 presidential hopefuls, Republicans have to engage in some image-polishing.\n\u201cRepublicans have a serious issue with minorities and young people. They keep ending up on the wrong side of public opinion with those groups,\u201d said Darrell West, vice president and director of governance studies at Washington\u2019s Brookings Institution.\nRepublican Party officials said their party is making important gains, and the goals of the 2013 study are being met. Some, though, conceded that it\u2019s not an easy task.\n\u201cWhen any of our candidates says something that\u2019s stupid or unwelcoming, it hurts,\u201d said Henry Barbour, an author of the post-2012 report and a Republican National Committee member from Mississippi.\nHe said, though, that on many issues Trump \u201chas connected with people who feel they don\u2019t have a voice anymore. There\u2019s all kinds of things the party can learn from Donald Trump; things we can do and things we shouldn\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nIf Hispanics think we do not want them here, they will close their ears to our policies. Republican Growth and Opportunity Project Report, 2013\nAmong the successes Republicans cite: Republicans this week maintained control of the Virginia Senate, despite a massive Democratic effort to swing the majority its way. Republicans won governorships by big margins in Mississippi and, somewhat surprisingly, in Kentucky. \nParty activists dismissed the debate flap. It\u2019s \u201cignored by normal American citizens,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, former press secretary for President George W. Bush and a co-author of the post-2012 election report.\nBut other images tell another story, one that the party has been trying for years to overcome.\n\u201cIf Hispanic Americans perceive that a GOP nominee or candidate does not want them in the United States (i.e., self-deportation),\u201d the report said, \u201cthey will not pay attention to the next sentence.\u201d \nThey paid attention to Trump in June, when he said in his candidacy announcement speech: \u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re bringing drugs, they\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists and some, I assume, are good people, but I speak to border guards and they\u2019re telling us what we\u2019re getting.\u201d\nAfter his remarks, NBC cut ties with Trump, who had hosted \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d and partly owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants.\nMany Latino and immigration advocacy groups, most of whom are considered sympathetic to the Democratic Party, haven\u2019t forgotten his comments.\n\u201cMr. Trump\u2019s racist remarks and his continued rhetoric demonizing Latinos and immigrants has created fear within these communities around the country,\u201d the 26-member Congressional Hispanic Caucus said this week in a statement.\nLatino activists delivered petitions with thousands of signatures to NBC Wednesday urging the network to dump Trump from \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\n\nIt is shameful for SNL and NBC to think that racism can be repackaged as comedy. Juan Escalante, America\u2019s Voice digital campaigns manager\nHope Hicks, the Trump campaign\u2019s spokeswoman, had no comment. Neither did NBC.\nRepublicans need the Latino vote, which accounted for 8.4 percent of the 2012 total. Not only is that percentage expected to rise next year, but it\u2019s a crucial bloc in some swing states, notably Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, Florida and New Mexico. Mitt Romney, the party\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee, won 27 percent of the Hispanic vote.\nLatino views of Republicans have been steady for years.\n\u201cThe Republican Party already had a low image among Latinos,\u201d said Mark Hugo Lopez, director of Hispanic research at the Pew Research Center. Pew found 10 percent of Hispanics said the party shared the concerns of Hispanic voters in 2014. Half rated Democrats that way.\nRepublicans counter by noting that two of its top presidential contenders, Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, are Cuban-American. Cuban-Americans, though, have traditionally leaned Republican.\nThey also cite stronger grass-roots efforts in recent years in minority communities. In 2014, some candidates drew significant Hispanic support; Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas won 44 percent of the Latino vote.\nAnother constituency also poses a challenge for Republicans: younger voters. They are \u201cincreasingly put off by the GOP,\u201d the report found. It warned of a generational difference within the conservative movement \u201cabout issues involving the treatment and the rights of gays.\u201d\nFor many younger voters, the report said, \u201cthese issues are a gateway into whether the party is a place they want to be.\u201d\nEDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE\n\nTwo of the GOP\u2019s top presidential contenders, Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, were born in the 1970s. Two of the Democrats\u2019 top candidates, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, were born in the 1940s.\nMost Republican presidential candidates, while saying they believe marriage should be between a man and woman, have urged respect for others\u2019 views.\nBut Cruz and Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas and 2016 presidential candidate, in September traveled to Kentucky to support Kim Davis, the court clerk jailed when she refused to issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple. Kentucky Gov.-elect Matt Bevin was also a big Davis supporter.\nYounger voters \u201chave a dislike of institutional politics,\u201d and so far, \u201cwe haven\u2019t seen much from leading candidates that really attempts to engage them,\u201d said Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, director of CIRCLE, a nonpartisan research group based at Tufts University that studies youth voter issues.\nShe found an exception: Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., whose libertarian views have had some appeal. Before the Republican debate last week, Paul had lunch with a group of University of Colorado students and got a warm reception. He has said same-sex marriage should be a local issue.\nRepublican officials point to the party\u2019s leadership initiative, which aims to train organizers and volunteers for campaigns well into the future.\nThe debate furor may not be helping ease young voters\u2019 disdain for institutional politics. Candidates disliked how CNBC moderators handled the Oct. 28 debate, and soon afterward, Republican Chairman Reince Priebus suspended the party\u2019s partnership with NBC in the Feb. 26 debate.\nCampaign officials met to discuss ways to change the format. They were unable to agree, but their talks, and their disagreements, dominated political coverage for days.\nIt all helps create an image Republicans would rather not have. \n\u201cVoters will remember,\u201d said West, \u201cwhen they see ads run by the Democratic nominee next year reminding them.\u201d\nDavid Lightman: 202-383-6101, @lightmandavid", "byline": "", "description": "Latino groups protest Trump as \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 host\nHas party been hurt among Hispanic voters?\nGOP officials cite progress\n\u2026\nClick to Continue \u00bb", "title": "Republicans\u2019 prescription for political tolerance tested", "url": "http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article43233696.html", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Ari Fleischer", "Mitt Romney", "Kim Davis", "Bernie Sanders", "Marco Rubio", "Darrell West", "Donald Trump", "George W.
