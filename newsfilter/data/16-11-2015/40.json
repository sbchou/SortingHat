[{"body": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The tragedy in Paris is roiling American politics, bolstering the Republican right\u2019s anti-immigration demands in the short run and perhaps ultimately enhancing Hillary Rodham Clinton and her credentials as the candidate with experience.\n\nPoliticians from President Obama on down have expressed outrage at the attacks, for which the Islamic State claimed responsibility.\n\nSeveral leading Republicans immediately politicized the issue. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas blamed Mr. Obama and what he called a weak \u201cphoto-op\u201d foreign policy, and one of the party\u2019s presidential front-runners, Donald J. Trump, said the tragedy reinforced the need for \u201ctougher\u201d American leadership.\n\n\u201cThis will be exceptionally important\u201d in shaping the presidential race, said Peter D. Hart, a prominent Democratic poll-taker, suggesting it was likely to help Mrs. Clinton, the only top-tier candidate in either party who has a background in national security.\n\nIn a debate among Democratic candidates on Saturday, she opened by stating that the United States would be electing a new commander in chief.\n\nThe attacks seem certain to heighten the importance of foreign policy in an election where it has not been prominent. In a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, only 8 percent of the public cited terrorism as the most important issue.\n\nThe attacks were immediately seized upon as a reason for cracking down on immigration. \u201cThis will help the anti-immigration cause and hurt efforts to bring in Syrian refugees,\u201d predicted Vin Weber, a leading Republican strategist and immigration advocate.\n\nAmong Republicans, the speculation was about the consequences of the Paris attacks for Mr. Trump. In Iowa on Thursday, he let loose a particularly vicious tirade against some of his rivals.\n\nThere was a growing sense within the Republican establishment that the \u201cTrump rant\u201d might be the incident that really derails his candidacy, even though he has not been affected by supposedly lethal political acts in the past. The terrorist episode could reverse any political slippage. Mr. Trump has largely set the agenda and dominated the dialogue on immigration; other candidates have followed.\n\nBoth prominent Republicans and Democrats suggested that a renewed attention to terrorism could harden his core support, though an overall emphasis on foreign policy would not play to Mr. Trump\u2019s strengths.\n\nAmong the other leading contenders, the boyish-looking Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, 44, has most emphasized a hard line on national security.\n\nYet, Mr. Hart predicts voters \u201cwon\u2019t want the kid\u201d in the White House. Mr. Cruz, though the same age, was seen as projecting more forcefulness than his rivals in his response to the attacks, though he may have overreached.\n\nMr. Weber, one of the Republican wise men, said that with time, voters may look \u201cfor someone with more gravitas.\u201d He said he hoped this would play to the strength of his candidate, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida.\n\nMr. Bush, considered one of the more mature candidates in either party, has only derivative national security credentials because of his family, particularly his brother, former President George W. Bush. That may prove a mixed blessing for a candidate struggling to regain his footing.\n\nThe reason Mr. Hart sees an advantage for Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, is that a greater focus on terrorism will cause voters to look even more for a \u201cheavy and strong hand at the tiller.\u201d This might minimize the problems she has among staunchly noninterventionist Democratic primary voters because she is more hawkish on foreign policy than the president she served. And it could help her in a general election, though Republicans constantly criticize the \u201cObama/Clinton\u201d weakness on foreign policy.\n\nIn the Democratic debate, Mrs. Clinton took the hardest line on national security: She insisted that the Islamic State \u201cmust be defeated,\u201d not just contained, and stressed that she had advised Mr. Obama to approve the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.\n\nHowever this evolves, both Republicans and Democrats agree that Nov. 13 is likely to be an important marker in the selection of the 45th American president.", "byline": "ALBERT R.

The deadly assault, which \nIslamic State\n extremists took responsibility for, set a somber tone; the debate opened with a moment of silence, the candidates standing on stage with their heads bowed, to mark the tragedy.\nThe contest is about \u201cchoosing our next commander in chief,\u201d Clinton pointedly stated in her opening remarks. \u201cAll of the other issues we want to deal with depend on our being secure and strong.\u201d\nThe candidates echoed one another in calling for a war against Islamic extremists, agreeing there was a need for better intelligence, a better use of the country's vast military resources and the need for a closer partnership with U.S. allies, especially in the Middle East.\nSanders, the independent U.S. senator from Vermont, used the discussion to once more bring up Clinton's 2002 vote in favor of the Iraq war when she was a senator, which she has since called a mistake. Noting his opposition at the time when he was a member of the House, Sanders said the invasion \u201cled to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now. I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the modern history of the United States.\u201d\nHillary Rodham Clinton waves as Bernie Sanders, left, and Martin O'Malley prepare before a Democratic presidential primary debate, Saturday, Nov. 14, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa.\nHillary Rodham Clinton waves as Bernie Sanders, left, and Martin O'Malley prepare before a Democratic presidential primary debate, Saturday, Nov. 14, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa.\nClinton said the issue of terrorism was far more complicated, pointing out that the United States had been a target long before the invasion, including the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. \u201cWe've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing, and no place more so than in the Middle East,\u201d she said.\nIn light of the horror in Paris, Sanders was asked whether he still believed, as he had earlier stated, that global warming was the greatest threat to national security.\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Sanders replied, suggesting that \u201cclimate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism\u201d \u2014 with the fight over natural resources like water possibly leading to even greater international conflict.\nAsked by moderator John Dickerson of CBS News whether they would use the words \u201cradical Islam\u201d to describe the United States' enemy \u2014 as many Republicans do \u2014 all three Democrats balked.\n\u201cLet's not fall into the trap of thinking all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here,\u201d said former Maryland Gov. O'Malley, suggesting the vast majority of law-abiding Muslims are the \u201cfirst line of defense\u201d against radical elements.\nStrikingly, some of the testiest exchanges of the evening came on issues where the differences among the candidates were largely a matter of degree.\nSanders and O'Malley insisted, for instance, on setting a $15 national minimum wage rather than the $12 that Clinton favors, and suggested her history of taking generous contributions from Wall Street undercut her promises to impose stiffer regulations. \u201cWeak tea,\u201d O'Malley said dismissively.\nClinton repeatedly brushed aside the challenges, saying she shared the same broad goals but would pursue policies that were more pragmatic and more apt to achieve results.\n\u201cI have nothing against the passion my two friends have here for reinstating Glass-Steagall,\u201d she said, when the debate turned to a discussion of the Depression-era bank regulation. \u201cI just don't think it gets the job done.\u201d\nClinton entered the evening in the strongest political position since announcing her candidacy in April, benefiting from an impressive performance at the Democrats' first debate last month and her marathon testimony before lawmakers investigating the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.\nNothing she said or did seemed likely to diminish her commanding status.\nBy contrast, Sanders has lost steam after drawing gargantuan crowds over the summer. He has stalled far behind Clinton in national polls, and has also lost ground in some early-voting states, including Iowa, which casts the first votes of the 2016 contest.\nStepping onto the debate stage, the Vermonter found himself in something of a quandary of his own design. He has long disparaged negative campaigning, boasting he has never run an attack ad in his decades-long political career.\nHe also seemed to conspicuously foreclose one line of attack on Clinton, her controversial use of a private server while secretary of State, declaring in last month's debate that the \u201cAmerican people were sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.\u201d Aides have been pressing Sanders to assume a more combative stance, but asked Saturday night whether he was reconsidering his comment, Sanders emphatically said he was not. \u201cI was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email,\u201d he said. \u201cI am still sick and tired.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, or we have more people in jail than any other country, or we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe've gotten off of Hillary Clinton's emails, good. Let's go to major issues facing America.\u201d\n\u201cI agree completely,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI couldn't have said it better myself.\u201d\nBut she bridled when Sanders attacked her over her fundraising on Wall Street, suggesting that bankers would not contribute so much money if they did not think they would get something in response. \u201cMaybe they're dumb,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't think so.\u201d\nClinton responded that Sanders was trying to \u201cimpugn [her] integrity\u201d and noted that two hedge-fund billionaires were already running advertisements against her in Iowa.\nThe exchange led to a seeming Clinton stumble, when she referred to her work helping Wall Street recover from the Sept. 11 attacks. \u201cI did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York; that was good for the economy,\u201d Clinton said.\nThe negative reaction on social media was swift, including a Tweet from one critic who was incredulous that Clinton invoked the terrorist attacks in defending her relationship with Wall Street. When the comment was read to her onstage, Clinton said she was sorry if her remark \u2014 quickly seized upon by Republican opponents \u2014 was misconstrued.\nIn another response that may echo later in the campaign, Clinton inadvertently raised the generational issue during a discussion of the protests sweeping college campuses. Republicans have repeatedly portrayed her as a has-been compared with some of their more youthful candidates.\n\u201cI come from the '60s, a long time ago,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a lot of activism on campus. Civil rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism. And I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out. Obviously, I believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other.\u201d\nO'Malley has struggled to be anything more than an afterthought in the Clinton-Sanders contest and he repeatedly took after both rivals.\nHe cited his record as Maryland's chief executive, saying, for instance, that while all three support a higher minimum wage, in his state \u201cit was not just a theory \u2026 we did it.\u201d\nThe stage was less crowded than at the Democrats' first debate last month in Las Vegas. Former Sens. \nJim Webb\n of Virginia and \nLincoln Chafee\n of Rhode Island both quit the contest after their poor showings.\nThat opened up the two-hour program for a longer, deeper series of exchanges. But that didn't mean they broke a lot of new substantive ground. Much of the conversation touched on issues they had covered before.\nClinton again attacked Sanders on guns, one of the few areas where she is to the left of the Vermont senator.\n\u201cThere are different records,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI know that Sen. Sanders had a different vote than I did when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers. That was a terrible mistake. It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate legislators, not just in Washington but across the country.\u201d\nSanders cited his votes for certain gun controls and said he would reconsider the liability issue.\nO'Malley said Clinton had her own consistency problems, arguing she had repeatedly changed her position for political reasons. \u201cThere's a big difference between leading by polls and leading by principle,\u201d he said.\nTo the delight of the partisan crowd, all three candidates positioned themselves as aggressively pro-immigrant.\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is \u2014 and let's say it in our debate because you will never hear it from that immigrant-bashing carnival barker Donald Trump \u2014 the truth of the matter is net immigration from Mexico last year was zero,\u201d O'Malley said in response to weighing immigration reform against the need for border security.\n\u201cWe've been focusing on border security to exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform,\u201d he said. \u201cOur symbol is the Statue of Liberty; it is not a barbed wire fence.\u201d\nSanders, a self-described democratic socialist, drew one of the biggest laughs of the night from the university audience, during a discussion of taxes. All three candidates said they favored higher rates for well-off Americans to pay for such things as cheaper college tuition for students.\n\u201cWe haven't come up with an exact number yet,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90%.... I'm not a socialist compared to Eisenhower.\u201d\nBarabak reported from San Francisco and Halper from Des Moines.

That was good for New York,\u201d she said, after finding herself again on the defensive over her perceived close ties to Wall Street. \u201cIt was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.\u201d\nThe unusual defense emerged during a feisty exchange over financial-industry regulation in\u00a0Saturday\u2019s\u00a0Democratic presidential debate hosted by CBS News. Mrs. Clinton also noted that 60% of her donors are women\u2014another effort to turn back the Wall Street fundraising attack from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who has emerged as a formidable opponent in the Democratic primary.\nJust as in last month\u2019s Democratic debate, the discussion Saturday of financial regulation turned largely on whether Congress should reinstate the New Deal-era banking law, the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated investment banking from commercial banking. President Bill Clinton played a major role ushering in legislation, signed into law in 1999, that repealed Glass-Steagall.\nSome critics say Glass-Steagall facilitated the financial crisis in 2008 by allowing large banks to grow, in effect, \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d forcing the unpopular emergency bailouts. They have pushed legislation to carve up the banks by instating aspects of Glass-Steagall, which the banking industry strongly opposes. Mr. Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley both endorsed that effort again\u00a0on Saturday.\nMrs. Clinton was more restrained. \u201cReinstating Glass-Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough,\u201d she said, adding that her regulatory-overhaul proposal is \u201ctougher, more effective, and more comprehensive,\u201d because it would target nonbank institutions as well as Wall Street banks and large depository institutions.\nMrs. Clinton implied that Glass-Steagall would have done little to forestall the bank bailouts in 2008 because many of the companies that either failed or required bailouts\u2014including American International Group and Lehman Brothers\u2014weren\u2019t big deposit-taking banks. AIG is an insurance company and Lehman Brothers was a standalone investment bank.\nCritics of the Glass-Steagall repeal don\u2019t agree with this view. They say it too easily overlooks the ways in which banks, particularly Citigroup, took on greater risks that fed increased risk-taking across Wall Street. AIG, for example, got into trouble because it had insured billions of financial products issued by more than a dozen firms\u2014some that had grown thanks to Glass-Steagall and some that, like Lehman and Bear Stearns, had remained standalone investment banks.\nStepping back from the bank-regulation arcana, there\u2019s a broader disagreement here. At the heart of Mr. Sanders\u2019s argument over the size of banks is the idea that they have too much political power, an idea that\u00a0evokes the \u201ctrust busting\u201d of President Teddy Roosevelt who sought to break up big industrial monopolies for some of the same reasons.\nWhy do big industries make \u201cmillions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something. Everybody knows that,\u201d said Mr. Sanders.\nWhen Mrs. Clinton said that she would break up banks if they didn\u2019t play by the rules, Mr. Sanders responded with disbelief that this might be in doubt. \u201cThe business model of Wall Street is fraud,\u201d he said.\nMr. Sanders pledged not to have any Wall Street representatives in his cabinet. \u201cOne of the problems we\u2019ve had\u2026whether it\u2019s Republican administrations or Democratic administrations, we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations,\u201d he said.\nMr. O\u2019Malley joined in when he said that Richard Rubin and Larry Summers, both former treasury secretaries for President Bill Clinton, wouldn\u2019t be allowed near his administration. Mr. Rubin has been a very influential figure within Democratic policymaking for the last two decades, and many policymakers that he has mentored have served in top positions for President Barack Obama.\n\u201cThey are the architects,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Malley.\nMr. O\u2019Malley was pressed to name who, exactly, would provide him with advise on financial regulation. He didn\u2019t provide any names. \u201cWe\u2019ll have an inclusive group,\u201d he said.\nFinancial regulation also emerged as a hot topic in\u00a0Tuesday\u2019s\u00a0Republican debate, and it showed how both parties have vastly different interpretations of what caused the financial crisis and, consequently, what should be done to prevent it from happening again.\nRepublicans generally have blamed government policies, from housing to the Federal Reserve, for provoking risk-taking, an idea that draws mixed readings from economists. They say that there is now too much government regulation, singling out for criticism the Dodd-Frank financial-regulatory overhaul, even though they have also tried to sound critical of Wall Street.\nThe clear winner in both the GOP debate earlier this week and in\u00a0Saturday\u2019s\u00a0Democratic debate: community banks.\n\u201cImagine America without its community banks. Well, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening because of Dodd-Frank,\u201d said former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in\u00a0Tuesday\u2019s\u00a0debate.\nAnd Mr. Sanders\u00a0on Saturday:\u00a0\u201cSupport community banks and credit unions. That\u2019s the future of banking in America.\u201d\n\n______________________________________________________\n2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll Standings\n\n\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops. \r\n\nCapital Journal Daybreak Newsletter: Sign up to get the latest on politics, policy and defense delivered to your inbox every morning.\r\nFor the latest Washington news, follow @wsjpolitics\r\nFor outside analysis, follow @wsjthinktank", "byline": "", "description": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton defended herself against criticism that she raised money from the financial industry by invoking her job as a U.S. senator representing New York after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.", "title": "Hillary Clinton Invokes 9/11 in Defending Wall Street Ties", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-invokes-911-in-defending-wall-street-ties/", "topics": ["financial regulation"], "people": ["Martin O'Malley", "Bill Clinton", "Richard Rubin", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Barack Obama", "Lehman Brothers", "Bernie Sanders", "Teddy Roosevelt", "Larry Summers"], "org": "wsj", "election_confidence": 0.8325589707651082, "authors": [{"author_id": 1142, "fullname": "nick timiraos", "primary_org": "wsj"}], "date_written": "2015-11-15 05:16:37", "orgs": ["WSJ", "Federal Reserve", "Congress", "Dodd", "American International Group", "Goldman Sachs", "Capital Journal", "AIG", "Citigroup", "GOP"], "article_id": "abb2681d02c742e0d300a81300445aed", "date_access": "2015-11-15 05:51:17.389493"}, {"body": "After Bernie Sanders challenged Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s independence from the influence of her corporate donors, she offered a defense during Saturday night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and included her work as a New York senator after September 11th.\nSANDERS: Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the story: I mean, you know, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not be naive about it.

You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.\nHere is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street. It ain't complicated. You have six financial institutions today that have assets of 56%, equivalent to 56% of the GDP In America. They issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages.\nIf Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, were alive today, you know what he'd say? \"Break them up.\" Reestablish Glass-Steagall. And Teddy Roosevelt is right. That is the issue. Now I am the only candidate up here that doesn't have a super PAC. I am not asking Wall Street or the billionaires for money.

In a nearby workspace, the veteran anchor Kevin Cooney made final preparations for the questions he would pose later about national security as one of debate\u2019s four moderators.\n\nJust after 6:15 p.m., cameras flashed on the KCCI anchors Stacey Horst and Steve Karlin, who stood on the stage and welcomed viewers to an area for the news media known as the spin room; they noted how the carnage in Paris would change the focus of the debate.\n\n\u201cOur viewers are interested in that,\u201d Mr. Busiek said. \u201cThat flows into what will be a very serious discussion with who could be the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nBroadcasting from Iowa\u2019s capital city to 434,500 TV households in the country\u2019s 72nd largest television market, KCCI takes on outsize importance among the nation\u2019s local television stations every four years. Iowans are the first in the nation to vote in presidential caucuses, setting the tone for the rest of the campaign season.\n\nAs a result, presidential candidates devote significant face time to KCCI, the perennial market leader and one of 30 stations owned by Hearst, and its rival WHO-HD, the local NBC affiliate. And the stations respond in kind, adding more political coverage to the menu of news offerings.\n\nKCCI started its own Sunday morning half-hour interview program this fall called \u201cClose Up,\u201d which has featured interviews with presidential candidates from both parties. And WHO boasts that it televises 25 percent more news each week than other stations in the market, thanks in large part to a 4 p.m. newscast that presents a more in-depth look at news and politics. WHO also is hosting three special one-hour forums this week featuring the Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Bobby Jindal. The stations also count on campaigns and interest groups to open their checkbooks in the months leading up to the caucuses and the general election. KCCI and its market rivals are likely to reap a disproportionate share of the $3.3 billion in political advertising dollars that analysts project will go to local television stations for 2016 races, particularly for pre-caucus spending.\n\n\u201cTechnically, the presidential election is a national election,\u201d said Elizabeth Wilner, a senior vice president at Kantar Media/CMAG, a company that monitors political advertising. \u201cBut in reality it is a race that occurs in about 10 states. In 2012, seven states saw 84 percent of all local TV ad spend, and we expect that same dynamic again.\u201d\n\nThat swing in political ad spending is of huge importance to the big media conglomerates that own local television stations, particularly as other categories of advertisers shift a larger share of spending to digital outlets. \u201cIn political, TV is still king,\u201d said Kip Cassino, executive vice president for research at Borrell Associates.\n\nOver the last several years, a wave of consolidation has swept across the industry with station owners trying to put themselves in the path of more of political advertising dollars. In 2013, for instance, Tribune Company closed a $2.7 billion acquisition of Local TV Holdings that made it one of the country\u2019s largest station owners; it added stations in 16 markets in the transaction, including WHO in Des Moines.\n\nTribune is now expecting to gross about $200 million in political advertising sales in 2016, up 25 percent from adjusted revenues in 2012. \u201cAt this point, we\u2019re calling for it to be strong, all signs are pointing to that,\u201d Peter Liguori, chief executive of Tribune Media, said during a recent conference call, noting the company\u2019s strength in swing states. In Des Moines, station executives said that the sales strategy boiled down to waiting for the phones to ring and the orders to come in. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to actively go out,\u201d said Dale R. Woods, general manager of WHO. \u201cThey are the ones who want to obtain our real estate.\u201d\n\nAnd while ad orders have started trickling in, executives said that the deluge largely has yet to arrive, partly because of the large number of Republican candidates this year, which has prompted campaigns to hold back on paying for advertising as they wait for the field to narrow. The surprising success of Donald J. Trump, who for the most part does not use advertising, has also affected how the candidates spend.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a decent position,\u201d said Brian Sather, president and general manager of KCCI. \u201cWe\u2019re open for business.\u201d\n\nThe stations also benefit from the rise of outside political action groups. While the stations are required by law to provide equal access to candidates and to charge them the lowest unit rates, there are no laws limiting what they can charge outside groups for commercial time. Analysts project a sharp increase in spending by these groups for 2016.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing stopping stations from charging groups five to six times as much \u2014 or even 10 times as much\u201d as they charge candidates, Ms. Wilner of Kantar said. \u201cNobody weeps for the poor billionaire that has to pay 10 times as much as the candidate.\u201d\n\nBut the influx of campaign dollars creates a delicate situation for the stations, which have to juggle their limited supply of commercial time. High demand for political ads in the Des Moines market, particularly in the weeks leading up to the caucus, can put a squeeze on inventory and push out local businesses, such as car dealerships, that are the bread-and-butter advertisers year round.\n\n\u201cIt is a balancing act,\u201d Mr. Sather said. \u201cWe try to do our best.\u201d\n\nMike Schreurs, chief executive of Strategic America, an advertising agency in West Des Moines, said that it is common for businesses to see as many as one out of four commercial spots bumped from local TV during the peak political season. They also might have to pay at least a 30 percent increase in the rates. \u201cIt takes the inventory away from smaller retailers and advertisers, not including the fact that it creates something of a toxic environment,\u201d he said.Already, more than 35,000 commercials adding up to more than $22.5 million in spending have aired or are scheduled to air on Iowa television stations through Feb. 2, the day after the Iowa caucuses, according to an analysis of Federal Communications Commission records by The Des Moines Register. On KCCI alone, viewers will see more than 62 ads a day in the eight days leading up to the Iowa caucuses. And at WHO, Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s campaign has booked a single spot for $5,800 to air during prime time Monday night. A spot airing during another time the same week cost $60.\n\nBack in the spin room after the debate on Saturday night, KCCI anchors wrapped up more than four hours of related coverage. During the coming 78 days leading to the Iowa caucus, the journalists plan to return to the air to cover the twists and turns of the campaign. But, for the moment, Mr. Karlin, one of the anchors, reflected on the Des Moines station\u2019s moment in the national spotlight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a privilege for a television station like us to be part of a debate like this,\u201d he said.", "byline": "EMILY STEEL", "description": "Over the last several years, a wave of consolidation has swept across the industry with station owners trying to put themselves in the path of more of political advertising dollars.", "title": "Iowa TV Gets Its Close-Up, Enjoying Outsize Influence", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/business/media/iowa-tv-gets-its-close-up-enjoying-outsize-influence.html", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Elizabeth Wilner", "Donald Trump", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Donald J.

Most of the political experts predicted he would be one of the media-fueled candidates who have emerged in last few primary seasons, propped up by intense coverage and then deflated when reporters turned their attention to another candidate. \nThe Donald has proven to be a much more durable candidate than they expected, maintaining a strong position in national polls as well as in local polling in key primary states such as New Hampshire. He has demonstrated tremendous savvy in keeping the media's attention for a sustained period of time, which is not a total surprise given his deep experience on \"The Apprentice\" as well as the dynamics of what I have called the click-bait primary, where incendiary statements are more likely to win attention than to receive widespread rebuke. \nBut the Republican campaign is starting to enter a new phase where there are a number of questions about how Trump will fare. Now that the early phase of the competition will soon wind down -- a free-for-all primarily revolving around televised debates -- Trump will have to prove his chops if he is to win in Iowa, New Hampshire and the primaries that follow. \nThe most pertinent question has to do with grass-roots organization. In less than three months, the voting will actually begin. When it comes to the caucuses and primaries, old-fashioned retail politics still matters. As Barack Obama proved in 2008, the winner of these contests needs to put together a formidable grass-roots organization to mobilize and bring out the vote.\nIn a few states like Iowa, Trump's campaign has given indications that it understand this. It has brought on some talented figures and started to put together a campaign. In Iowa, Trump scored a success by hiring Chuck Laudner, the grass-roots campaign operative who put together Rick Santorum's surprise victory there in 2012, to handle his operations. \nBut it is not yet clear whether Trump is willing to devote the money or can devote the kind of day-to-day appearances that the campaign will require, and how well-organized his strategic voter mobilization plan will be. Tim Fernholz reported, for instance, that Trump had not even purchased some of the basic voter information databases that are prerequisites for victory. \nTrump has made a point of saying he is self-funding his campaign, trying to draw a contrast with his rivals. While it is true he used some of his money, donations are still funding a lot of his campaign, and it's not clear how much of his fortune he is willing to commit to this effort, particularly if his odds of winning start to diminish.  \nSoon Trump will also have to contend with an actual establishment candidate. The leaders of the Republican Party are starting to coalesce around a main candidate, very likely Sen. Marco Rubio. Trump has thrived in part because the GOP did not yet have a central candidate upon whom to shower its resources and energy. The divisions and uncertainty that have resulted from Jeb Bush's poor run have opened up room in the campaign for some of the \"outsiders\" who have gained support. \nIf party leaders settle on Rubio, or Bush somehow engineers a miraculous comeback, the pressure against outsiders such as Trump will intensify. The party leaders will do much more, through their candidate, to unload blistering political and personal attacks on opponents within the party. Most recently, The Wall Street Journal, a scion of the Republican establishment, published a scathing editorial about how little Trump seemed to know about what was in the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal.  When Trump responded by calling the editors \"dummies\" through a tweet, the paper stood by its comments. \nIf Trump is able to transition to the next phase with his standing in the polls intact, the media still have a lot of exposing to do. Everyone who has followed him since he made a splash on the national scene in 1980s New York as a \"greed is good\" real estate mogul knows there is a long record to explore.\nDespite all the attention he has received thus far, the scrutiny has been relatively contained. Ironically, the fame with which he entered into the contest has diminished the incentive of some reporters to dig more deeply into his life. It is a contrast with candidates such as Ben Carson about whom the media didn't really know much. That made reporters more curious to figure it out. With Trump, and the assumption we know everything there is about him, there has not been as much investigation as we might expect. But if he remains a serious candidate, more scrutiny will focus on his failed business ventures and his rocky marriages. \nThere are a number of important issues that have barely made it onto the radar. For example, a handful of reports have surfaced on how little Trump has given to charity over the years, a measure for the values of a wealthy person who has not been in public service, and the ways in which he has greatly exaggerated and misconstrued the money that he has donated.\nThe Associated Press produced a scathing report in August showing how he has overstated his contributions, how they are small compared with others of his income status, and that they advance his personal interests. This record would not sit well with some voters, who are seeking a populist voice, especially from a billionaire candidate who is now insisting that the wages of workers are too high. \nHis recent attacks on Carson, such as comparing what he called the neurosurgeon's \"pathological temper\" to the sickness of a \"child molester\" have offered a reminder as to just how nasty the thin-skinned businessman can become against his opponents.\nThere are also questions about Trump himself. Thus far he has clearly enjoyed the ride. Yet it is not evident how he will feel as the campaign slog really gets going, with the brutal hours that it requires, and if he starts to fall from his plateau. It is not clear how passionate Trump is about the job and the kind of commitment winning a presidential race requires. \nHe has already made some comments about his willingness to quit if he is not doing well. In October, he told \"Meet the Press\": \"I'm not a masochist. And if I was dropping in the polls, where I saw that I wasn't going to win, why would I continue?\" \nHe gives off a different sentiment than some of the other candidates, such as Rubio, who are clearly willing to invest everything they have for as long as they are still viable. \nFor those who have always doubted whether this is about promoting his brand name as opposed to promoting a vision for the White House, there are doubts about whether he might just be willing to fire himself if this process turned unpleasant. \nThe brutal terrorist attacks in Paris this weekend are also a stark reminder of the immense security challenges that the United States and the world faces.

Vermont Sen. Sanders ripped her support for \u201cregime change.\u201d \u00a0\nBut while the Paris terror attacks the night before shifted the early presidential debate focus to national security, the candidates sparred aggressively in the latter half over domestic issues \u2013 especially financial industry reform and Clinton\u2019s Wall Street support.\nFormer Maryland Gov. O\u2019Malley called her the \u201ccandidate of Wall Street.\u201d\nAsked about her hefty Wall Street-backed speaking fees and donations, Clinton defended her independence in being able to pursue financial industry reform.\n\nBut Sanders shot back, \u201cNot good enough.\u201d\n\u201cLet's not be naive about it. Why \u2026has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.\u201d\nHe and O\u2019Malley, unlike Clinton, both want to re-instate a Depression-era banking law known as Glass-Steagall \u2013 and they both criticized Clinton\u2019s Wall Street plans as not going far enough.\u00a0\nO\u2019Malley called it \u201cweak tea.\u201d\nIn an eyebrow-raising moment, Clinton countered Sanders\u2019 criticism of her Wall Street donations by saying that as New York senator, she helped \u201crebuild\u201d Wall Street and downtown Manhattan after 9/11.\nClinton was later asked about social media reaction claiming she had invoked 9/11 to justify financial industry donations; Clinton said she\u2019s sorry that anyone had that \u201cimpression.\u201d\nMeanwhile, she said she doesn\u2019t think her rivals\u2019 financial industry plans \u2013 particularly to reinstate the Depression-era law that separated investment and commercial banking \u2013 would get the job done.\n\u201cI'm all about making sure we actually get results,\u201d Clinton said.\nThe debate in Des Moines, Iowa, came in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which thrust the issues of national security and foreign policy back to the center of the 2016 campaign. The format of the debate \u2013 hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register -- was changed to focus anew on those issues in the beginning.\nClinton tried to highlight her deep experience in foreign policy issues from the outset.\n\u201cThis election is not only about electing a president. It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief,\u201d she said.\nBut, citing the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa, Clinton\u2019s rivals soon turned to her record as U.S. senator and later as secretary of state to question her judgment in foreign policy matters.\nO\u2019Malley appeared to criticize her support for toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.\nHe said America\u2019s role is not to roam the world \u201clooking for new dictators to topple.\u201d He said it is also important to understand \u201csecondary and third consequences\u201d that come after removing a \u201csingle dictator.\u201d O\u2019Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a \u201cmess.\u201d\nClinton defended her support for ousting Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a \u201cgenocide\u201d and America\u2019s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support. And to O\u2019Malley\u2019s critique, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think you can paint with a broad brush\u201d in an \u201cincredibly complicated region of the world.\u201d\nSanders, meanwhile, referenced Clinton\u2019s Senate vote for the use of force in Iraq and said the \u201cdisastrous invasion\u201d led \u201cto the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.\u201d The senator also claimed that \u201cclimate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.\u201d\nClinton again called her Iraq war vote a \u201cmistake,\u201d but disputed that the war is the only driver of modern terrorism.\nShe and O\u2019Malley briefly sparred over America\u2019s role in fighting ISIS. After Clinton said it \u201ccannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential,\u201d O\u2019Malley said, \u201cThis actually is America\u2019s fight,\u201d though not \u201csolely\u201d America\u2019s fight.\nSanders staked out a different position in saying it is the nations in the region that \u201chave to get their hands dirty.\u201d\n\u201cThose Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort,\u201d he said.\nThe candidates declined to categorize the threat itself as \u201cradical Islam.\u201d Asked about that categorization, Clinton said only, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with Islam.\u201d\nAll the candidates on stage condemned the Paris terror attacks and vowed to take on the threat of terror.\n\u201cIt cannot be contained. It must be defeated,\u201d Clinton said of ISIS, appearing to distance herself from President Obama, who hours before the Paris attacks claimed ISIS was \u201ccontained.\u201d\nThe attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said. It brought the issue of terrorism to the forefront of both party\u2019s presidential primary races. Ostensibly, it is an area where Clinton enters with the thickest resume \u2013 but also one that could, as the debate showed, prove problematic given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable nations like Libya and Syria.\nWhile the tragedy hung over the debate, the candidates were able to tackle of range of domestic issues including wages and immigration.\nO\u2019Malley landed virtually the only shot of the night against Republican candidate Donald Trump, a favorite target of the Democrats, by calling him an \u201cimmigrant-bashing carnival barker.\u201d The Democratic candidates generally agree on the call for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the country.\nSanders, meanwhile, continued to advocate for a $15 minimum wage.\nBut the candidates were divided on gun control. While Clinton has tried in the past to cast Sanders as soft on the issue, O\u2019Malley accused Clinton of being \u201con three sides of this.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you ran in 2000, you said we needed federal robust regulations, then in 2008 you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying we don't need those regulations ... and now you\u2019re coming back around here,\u201d he said.\nThe debate was notable in that it saw Sanders and O\u2019Malley taking a more aggressive tone against the front-runner, who seemed to have strengthened her hand since their initial debate.\nSince that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O\u2019Malley. She also made it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and saw one of her biggest potential political threats \u2013 a late bid by Vice President Biden \u2013 disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.\nSanders remains Clinton\u2019s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.\nStill, the FBI investigation over Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding.

Martin O'Malley. The campaign\u2019s objections were first reported by Yahoo News.\nSanders aides noted on the call that in 90-second opening statements all three candidates could choose to spend their time on terror or other topics, and in the end they prevailed on organizers to keep the longer opening statements.\nIn the end, the candidates agreed to hold their opening statements to 60 seconds\n\nHowever, the Sanders camp was still not pleased that CBS planned to spend significant time early in the debate on national security after the lead moderator, John Dickerson of CBS, in recent days privately told the campaigns and publicly said in media interviews that the primary focus would be on income inequality and other economic topics.\nIn the wake of the terror attacks, the Clinton and O'Malley camps expressed support for the topic shift on the conference call, according to the Democratic sources.\nThe objections by the Sanders camp fueled talk among Democrats in Iowa that the senator is worried he cannot match the former secretary of state's stature on national security.\nSanders aides reject this by saying he will focus on how judgment on national security is more important than experience.

A star-crossed movie opening about a terrorist attack in France was canceled.\n\nBut small crowds congregated at the Place de la R\u00e9publique \u2014 as they did after the Charlie Hebdo massacre in January \u2014 to show solidarity on Saturday, ignoring government advice to stay home. And French flags are appearing in Parisian apartment windows.\n\nThe archbishop of Paris officiates at a Mass at the Cathedral of Notre-Dame today. And schools are to reopen on Monday.\n\n\u2022 What about elsewhere?\n\nFrom Vatican City to Seoul, law enforcement authorities are on heightened alert.\n\nForeign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari of Iraq said his country\u2019s intelligence services obtained information indicating that, besides France, the United States and Iran were among countries being targeted for attack.\n\n\u2022 What\u2019s next for policy makers?\n\nAs France deals with the aftermath in Paris, global attention turns to policy and politics. President Obama and other world leaders are in Turkey for a Group of 20 summit meeting today, where the terrorist attacks are already a focus.\n\nMigration is, too, because one of the assailants entered the European Union through Greece with other refugees last month and then passed through Serbia, where he sought asylum.\n\nThat is sure to complicate the vexing problem of how to handle the unceasing flow of people from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere in Europe. Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, said today that Europe should not react by rejecting refugees.\n\nEuropean Union justice and interior ministers will hold a special meeting on the Paris attacks Friday.\n\n\u2022 How is Paris playing in the U.S. presidential campaign?\n\nCandidates for the Democratic nomination, in their debate Saturday night in Des Moines, agreed that America is determined to fight terrorism, dedicated to responsibilities to refugees and devoted to diplomacy.\n\nBut Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont sought to tie the rise of the Islamic State to Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s vote as a senator to authorize the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n\nBy contrast, leading Republicans like Donald J. Trump, Ben Carson and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas called on the Obama administration to halt plans to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees next year.\n\nAlthough they broadly agreed that the Paris attacks should be the catalyst for a new military strategy against the Islamic State, most of the Republicans were still tentative about committing more American ground troops to that effort.\n\n\u2022 Who were the victims?\n\nLittle seemed to tie the dead at the six attack sites, except that they were out having fun. And that was the point for the Islamic State militant group, which said that it struck France\u2019s symbols of \u201cperversity.\u201d\n\n\u201cBars, a concert, a great game,\u201d Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy, a French author and philosopher, wrote on Twitter. \u201cThis is the French art of living together that has been targeted.\u201d\n\nSeveral foreigners, including people from Belgium, Britain, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United States, were killed in the attacks.\n\nAn American student from California State University in Long Beach, Nohemi Gonzalez, 23, also died in the Paris attacks. She was spending a semester at the Strate School of Design in Paris.\n\nValentin Ribet, a 26-year-old lawyer, was killed at the Bataclan concert hall during a sold-out show by the American rock band Eagles of Death Metal.\n\nGuillaume B. Decherf, 43, a critic at a French cultural magazine and a father of two, was killed as well. Three employees from Universal Music France also died, as did Nick Alexander, a British citizen who sold merchandise for the band, and Aur\u00e9lie De Peretti, 33.\n\n\u201cYesterday, the victims weren\u2019t journalists or famous. They were civilians,\u201d Maxim Ferron, manager of a Paris tea shop, said on Saturday.\n\nYou can sign up here to get the regular weekday Morning Briefing delivered to your inbox. \n\nFor feedback, contact us at briefing@nytimes.com.", "byline": "VICTORIA SHANNON", "description": "A briefing with the latest information.", "title": "Paris Attacks: What We Know and Don\u2019t Know", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/world/europe/paris-attacks-what-we-know-and-dont-know.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Bernie Sanders", "Donald J.
