" For Bernie Sanders, it was a missed opportunity. The second Democratic debate was a high stakes chance for him to blunt Hillary Clinton’s resurgence at one of the more crucial times in the Democratic contest for president.But while Clinton did find herself on the defensive over foreign policy and terrorism, the challenges came largely from the moderators. Sanders failed to deliver in small and large ways at the Democratic presidential debate Saturday that would have either cast positive attention on him or negative attention on her.It’s a dynamic that explains why she’s pulling comfortably ahead of him in the Democratic race and likely to remain there in the critical weeks to come. After the terrorist attack in Paris hours before, Americans expected to hear about foreign policy and more specifically how the candidates planned to fight the Islamic State which took responsibility for killing more than 100 people. But when Sanders in his opening statement was asked to share his thoughts on the attacks, he uttered a mere two sentences on terrorism – totaling about 20 seconds – before quickly switching back to his standard stump speech.“I’m running for president because as I go around this nation I talk to a lotta people,” he said. “And what I hear is people concerned that the economy we have is a rigged economy.”The abrupt switch from terrorism as well as his claim that climate change is the greatest threat to national security seemed out of place as the Paris attacks dominated the world’s attention.Climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism. And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say yo're gonna see countries all over the world...yo're gonna see all kinds of international conflict, Bernie SandersSanders’ problems with the debate began even before the candidates walked on stage. His campaign spent hours refuting published reports that aides were angry about changes in the format to reflect the Paris attacks. Clinton supporters flooded social media saying anyone who couldn’t change topics based on world events couldn’t handle being president.The independent senator from Vermont has surprised political observers, even himself, with his popularity in the contest that has translated to large crowds and millions of dollars in contributions. But he needs to do something more if he expects to compete with Clinton for the nomination.With the candidates not debating again for five more weeks, the debate was perhaps his best hope to blunt her rise in the polls. He did provide several strong answers, particularly on reining in Wall Street and ridding politics of unaccountable money. But to get ahead he needed to criticize her, something he and his aides repeatedly say he’s not comfortable with. EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIMWhen asked if he had any criticism in the way Clinton performed as secretary of state, Sanders spoke vaguely about “regime change,” saying forcing leadership changes in some countries are not always beneficial while he barely mentioned her or explained that she has supported such moves. EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIMSanders instead found himself agreeing with her more than once.“I agree with much of what the secretary said,” he said about terrorism.“The secretary’s obviously right,” he said on her assessment of the Middle East. Sanders did manage to criticize her more than he did in their first debate in October.He forcefully went after her for voting to authorize the invasion of Iraq in 2003 as a senator, saying it created instability that led to the rise of the Islamic State.“I don’t think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the level of instability that we have now,” he said. “That is one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the history of the United States.”Clinton acknowledged once again that she made a mistake on the Iraq war. But she then called on him to acknowledge his mistake on a vote he cast to grant immunity to gun manufacturers and dealers from liability if their firearms are used criminally. That was a terrible mistake. It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate, legislators not just in Washington but across the country, Hillary Clinton.He didn’t and instead delivered a muddled answer. “We will talk of that bill which I agree with parts, I disagree – I am certainly absolutely willing to look at that bill and make sure – and not a form of the bill,” he said.EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIMHe also failed to focus on what political observers consider one of his best lines of attacks – accusing Clinton of flipping on policy positions. EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIMIf all else failed, Sanders could have used the emails. Clinton has been under fire using a personal email system while secretary of state.Sanders gave her pass on the issue in the first debate – saying Americans are “sick and tired” about hearing about her emails. But he said later he wasn’t dismissing concerns and that there are “valid questions.”Then on Saturday, he said he really hadn’t changed his mind and that the way his remarks were misinterpreted was “just media stuff.”“I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email,” he said. “I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email.” EDITORS: STORY CAN END HEREClinton was pleased with that statement. “I agree completely.”Anita Kumar: 202-383-6017, @anitakumar01",,"Senator agrees with former secretary of state, declines to criticize her at times in debateSanders again decides not to attack Clinton for her use of personal email for government workTiming is crucial as Democrats will not debate again for five weeks…Click to Continue »",Sanders’ failure to score in debates helping Clinton pull away,http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article44984622.html,['foreign policy/national security'],"['Bernie Sanders', 'Anita Kumar', 'Hillary Clinton']",mcclatchy,0.5350968740541836,"[{'author_id': 33912, 'fullname': 'anita kumar', 'primary_org': 'mcclatchy'}]",2015-11-15 14:42:00,[],36ede6409cbd19b605ca188c967d2a81,2015-11-15 15:00:06.457603

(REUTERS/Jim Young)PreviousNextHillary Clinton faced tough criticism Saturday night from her Democratic rivals over everything from her Middle East policies to her swaying stance on gun control to her Wall Street ties, at a debate that saw both Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley step up their attacks on the party’s front-runner.The former secretary of state was put on the defensive almost immediately, as she was challenged by her rivals -- and the moderator -- over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability. Vermont Sen. Sanders ripped her support for “regime change.”  But while the Paris terror attacks the night before shifted the early presidential debate focus to national security, the candidates sparred aggressively in the latter half over domestic issues – especially financial industry reform and Clinton’s Wall Street support.Former Maryland Gov. O’Malley called her the “candidate of Wall Street.”Asked about her hefty Wall Street-backed speaking fees and donations, Clinton defended her independence in being able to pursue financial industry reform.But Sanders shot back, “Not good enough.”“Let's not be naive about it. Why …has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?” he said. “You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.”He and O’Malley, unlike Clinton, both want to re-instate a Depression-era banking law known as Glass-Steagall – and they both criticized Clinton’s Wall Street plans as not going far enough. O’Malley called it “weak tea.”In an eyebrow-raising moment, Clinton countered Sanders’ criticism of her Wall Street donations by saying that as New York senator, she helped “rebuild” Wall Street and downtown Manhattan after 9/11.Clinton was later asked about social media reaction claiming she had invoked 9/11 to justify financial industry donations; Clinton said she’s sorry that anyone had that “impression.”Meanwhile, she said she doesn’t think her rivals’ financial industry plans – particularly to reinstate the Depression-era law that separated investment and commercial banking – would get the job done.“I'm all about making sure we actually get results,” Clinton said.The debate in Des Moines, Iowa, came in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which thrust the issues of national security and foreign policy back to the center of the 2016 campaign. The format of the debate – hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register -- was changed to focus anew on those issues in the beginning.Clinton tried to highlight her deep experience in foreign policy issues from the outset.“This election is not only about electing a president. It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief,” she said.But, citing the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa, Clinton’s rivals soon turned to her record as U.S. senator and later as secretary of state to question her judgment in foreign policy matters.O’Malley appeared to criticize her support for toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.He said America’s role is not to roam the world “looking for new dictators to topple.” He said it is also important to understand “secondary and third consequences” that come after removing a “single dictator.” O’Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a “mess.”Clinton defended her support for ousting Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a “genocide” and America’s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support. And to O’Malley’s critique, she said, “I don’t think you can paint with a broad brush” in an “incredibly complicated region of the world.”Sanders, meanwhile, referenced Clinton’s Senate vote for the use of force in Iraq and said the “disastrous invasion” led “to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.” The senator also claimed that “climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.”Clinton again called her Iraq war vote a “mistake,” but disputed that the war is the only driver of modern terrorism.She and O’Malley briefly sparred over America’s role in fighting ISIS. After Clinton said it “cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential,” O’Malley said, “This actually is America’s fight,” though not “solely” America’s fight.Sanders staked out a different position in saying it is the nations in the region that “have to get their hands dirty.”“Those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort,” he said.The candidates declined to categorize the threat itself as “radical Islam.” Asked about that categorization, Clinton said only, “I don’t think we’re at war with Islam.”All the candidates on stage condemned the Paris terror attacks and vowed to take on the threat of terror.“It cannot be contained. It must be defeated,” Clinton said of ISIS, appearing to distance herself from President Obama, who hours before the Paris attacks claimed ISIS was “contained.”The attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said. It brought the issue of terrorism to the forefront of both party’s presidential primary races. Ostensibly, it is an area where Clinton enters with the thickest resume – but also one that could, as the debate showed, prove problematic given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable nations like Libya and Syria.While the tragedy hung over the debate, the candidates were able to tackle of range of domestic issues including wages and immigration.O’Malley landed virtually the only shot of the night against Republican candidate Donald Trump, a favorite target of the Democrats, by calling him an “immigrant-bashing carnival barker.” The Democratic candidates generally agree on the call for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the country.Sanders, meanwhile, continued to advocate for a $15 minimum wage.But the candidates were divided on gun control. While Clinton has tried in the past to cast Sanders as soft on the issue, O’Malley accused Clinton of being “on three sides of this.”“When you ran in 2000, you said we needed federal robust regulations, then in 2008 you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying we don't need those regulations ... and now you’re coming back around here,” he said.The debate was notable in that it saw Sanders and O’Malley taking a more aggressive tone against the front-runner, who seemed to have strengthened her hand since their initial debate.Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O’Malley. She also made it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and saw one of her biggest potential political threats – a late bid by Vice President Biden – disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.Sanders remains Clinton’s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.Still, the FBI investigation over Clinton’s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding. Sanders appeared to give her a pass on the email issue at the first debate by saying he was tired of hearing about the controversy.Sanders, though, stood by his comments at the second debate Saturday night: “I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email, I’m still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email. … Let’s go to the major issues facing America.” ",,,"DEMOCRATIC DEBATE  Clinton hit by rivals over Mideast, Wall Street ties",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/15/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate/,"['foreign policy/national security', 'immigration']","[u""Martin O'Malley"", 'Jim Young', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Donald Trump', 'Muammar Qaddafi', 'Bernie Sanders']",fox,0.9973633621405877,[],2015-11-15 06:03:37,"['Senate', 'Al Qaeda', 'FBI']",e310bbfc28aa65b4735b170dc3b6246a,2015-11-15 07:00:04.156895
" (AP) â A day after deadly terrorist attacks in Paris, Hillary Rodham Clinton cast herself as the country's strongest commander in chief in a scary world, even as she defended her own role in the rise of Islamic militants.""This election is not only about electing a president, it's also about choosing our next commander in chief,"" Clinton declared Saturday night in the Democrats' second debate of the presidential campaign. ""All of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.""Amid the backdrop of global anxiety, Clinton found herself fending off questions about not only her foreign policy record but her economic ties, with both Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley painting the former senator from New York as a lackey for Wall Street and corporate interests.""Let's not be naive about it,"" said Sanders, noting that Clinton collected millions in campaign donations from Wall Street bankers. ""They expect to get something. Everybody knows that.""The barbs marked a far more aggressive shift in a primary race that has been notable in part for its civility compared to the Republican contest.Since the Democrats' first debate a month ago, Clinton has built a lead in the early voting states, gains that have come amid other signs the party is coalescing behind her. But the nomination fight is far from over.On Saturday night, Clinton faced criticism of her national security record, when Sanders traced the current instability in the Middle East to the U.S. Senate's vote â including Clinton's â to authorize military action in Iraq in 2002. He said that U.S. invasion ""unraveled the region.""The former secretary of state fought back, saying terrorism has been erupting for decades. She rejected the idea that she and the rest of the Obama administration underestimated the growing threat of the Islamic State group.The back-and-forth revealed a foreign policy split within the Democratic Party, with Sanders playing to the anti-war activists who boosted then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama to the presidential nomination in 2008.Sanders argued for a far more hands-off approach, advocating for Muslim countries to lead the fight and declaring that the war against Islamic State militants is about the ""soul of Islam.""Clinton has a history of advocating for more robust involvement across the globe â both as a presidential candidate eight years ago and as Obama's secretary of state. In recent weeks, she has called for a more aggressive U.S. role in the Syrian conflict, including a no-fly zone over the area, a move the Obama administration opposes.The debate began with a moment of silence followed by the previously unplanned foreign policy questions. All the candidates denounced the attacks, but they gave some fodder to their Republican rivals who coupled condemnation of the Paris attacks with sharp criticism for Obama and Clinton.All three Democrats criticized the term ""radical Islam"" used by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and other Republican candidates as unnecessarily offensive to American Muslims.""We are at war with violent extremism, we are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression,"" said Clinton. ""I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.""GOP candidates immediately seized on the remarks. ""Yes, we are at war with radical Islamic terrorism,"" tweeted former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.The debate pivoted to economic issues, in a conversation that revealed how Sanders' liberal message has helped shift the party to the left on some economic issues.All three agreed that wealthy citizens and corporations should pay more in taxes to benefit the middle class. They tangled over how high to increase the minimum wage, with Clinton backing a $12-per-hour federal floor while Sanders and O'Malley said $15 an hour. And they fought over the degree to which they would curtail large financial institutions, with Sanders describing Wall Street's business model as ""greed and fraud"" â a startling judgment for a major presidential candidate.""I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,"" joked Sanders, saying the 1950s-era president backed a 90 percent marginal tax rate.Clinton defended her relationship with Wall Street, citing her work in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but her statement met with blowback from Republicans who accused her of politicizing the terrorist assaults.While Clinton is wary of alienating Sanders backers whose support she'll need should she win the nomination, she did take a few shots. She attempted to cast some of Sanders' major proposals, including a single-payer health care system and free college, as politically unrealistic.""The revolution never came,"" she said, in a knock on his call for a ""political revolution.""Sanders may have inadvertently helped her in the first debate, when he seemed to dismiss the controversy over her use of a private email account and server by saying Americans are tired of hearing about her ""damn emails.""Saturday night, Sanders declined once again to attack: ""I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email,"" he said.""I agree completely,"" said Clinton, with a laugh.___Lisa Lerer reported from Washington.

"Here are the week’s top stories.1. Military troops patrolled Paris as France and its allies around the world mourned 129 people killed in coordinated assaults on Friday that unfolded over three hours. More than 350 people were wounded, many seriously. The French president blamed the Islamic State, calling the attacks “an act of war that was prepared, organized and planned from abroad, with complicity from the inside.”_______2. France said three teams carried out the attacks, and ended them by detonating suicide belts. One attacker was identified as a man who used a Syrian passport to enter Europe along with the flow of migrants, another as a French national with a criminal record. Confirmation of the Islamic State’s involvement would mean the group has grown from a regional player in the Syrian conflict into a force waging a global terrorist war in less than two years._______3. World leaders condemned the attacks and many tightened security. President Obama is at the G-20 meeting in Turkey for talks certain to be dominated by the fight against the Islamic State and terrorism in general. The U.S.-led campaign against the group had intensified in recent days in Iraq and Syria, and a bigger push is now likely._______4. A new urgency pulsed through talks on a political solution to Syria’s war. Diplomats from the U.S., France, Russia, Iran and other nations met in Vienna on Saturday, facing knotty divisions on a way forward. Secretary of State John Kerry said the Paris attacks were born of “a kind of medieval and modern fascism at the same time, which has no regard for life, which seeks to destroy and create chaos and disorder and fear.”_______5. The second Democratic debate opened with a long discussion of the Paris attacks. Hillary Clinton deftly spun questions that invited her to blame the Obama administration for allowing the rise of the Islamic State, and defended herself from Bernie Sanders’s onslaughts on her relationship with Wall Street. Martin O’Malley may have had the most discussed single line, calling Donald Trump an “immigrant-bashing carnival barker.”_______6. The Republican candidates paused their criticisms of one another, particularly against Marco Rubio’s switch to a hard line on immigration. They broadly agreed that the U.S. should strengthen its military strategy against the Islamic State, and some proposed sending ground troops._______7. Other developments this week were independent of international terrorism. Turmoil over racial discrimination spread to campuses across the country after protests forced top officials at the University of Missouri system to step down. Some students acknowledged they had felt only subtle signs of discrimination. “What matters,” one protester said, “is that we all need to have empathy for the experiences that people of color have even if we don’t have those experiences for ourselves.”_______8. A Times special report found a thriving U.S. black market that moves guns from states with lax gun laws into those with tougher measures. In New York and New Jersey, which have some of the strictest laws in the country, weapons involved in crimes often arrived via the so-called Iron Pipeline — Interstate 95 and its tributaries — from Virginia, Georgia and Florida._______9. The Swiss foundation that holds the copyright to “The Diary of Anne Frank” has listed her father as a co-author. The diary, by all accounts, remains the words of a young girl hiding from the Nazis with her family. Emphasizing Otto Frank’s contributions of edits and a prologue allows the foundation to extend its copyright from 70 years after her death in 1945 at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp to 70 years after his death in 1980._______10. International sports officials banned Russia from track and field competitions after a report accused Russia of running a state-sponsored doping program. And should the country fail to rapidly demonstrate compliance with anti-doping regulations, the ban could be extended to include the 2016 Olympics in Brazil._______11. President Obama is scheduled to head from the G20 meeting in Turkey to Asia, for a lengthy trip to Malaysia and the Philippines. His agenda will include promoting the Trans-Pacific Partnership and attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Manila on Wednesday._______Your Weekend Briefing is published Sundays at 6 a.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Evening Briefing, weeknights at 6 p.m. Eastern.Want to look back?

"The fight against global terrorism will take center stage Saturday night when Democrats gather in Iowa to debate after the gruesome attacks in Paris that laid bare the kinds of threats the next American president will face.A month after the Democratic presidential candidates clashed on gun control and financial regulations in their first debate, which focused largely on domestic and economic issues, they are expected to face more questions on foreign policy and national security. Hours after the deadly attacks, CBS News, a co-host of the event, said it would refocus the debate to give candidates an opportunity to discuss how they would respond to such an international crisis.Despite the tragic nature of the events, the new backdrop represents an opportunity for Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former secretary of state, to shine at a moment when her two remaining rivals, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Martin O’Malley — neither of whom has much foreign policy experience — will be under pressure to blunt her momentum.Since Mrs. Clinton’s crisp debate performance in October, her poll numbers have surged, she weathered hours of congressional questioning about her handling of the Benghazi attacks, and three of her rivals for the nomination have dropped out.“It will be interesting to see if Secretary Clinton can keep doing what she’s been doing,” said Brad Anderson, who was President Obama’s 2012 state director in Iowa. “Her steadiness is why you’re seeing her poll numbers continue to increase, especially when you look at what’s happening on the other side of the aisle.”A New York Times/CBS News survey released this week showed Mrs. Clinton continuing to dominate the race, with more than half of Democratic primary voters backing her and 62 percent thinking she is the candidate who can bring about change in Washington. The shift in the debate’s emphasis to foreign affairs should allow Mrs. Clinton to highlight her deep experience on the international stage, providing an opportunity to extend her advantage.For Mrs. Clinton’s opponents, the debate presents a chance to tell voters otherwise, and her Senate votes and handling of international crises as a senator and a diplomat could come under scrutiny.Still, the event is not expected to resemble the free-for-all atmosphere that has marked Republican debates, which have featured sharp exchanges and personal attacks. While the Republican primary contest is a crowded affair, the Democrats will have considerably more time to make their cases and delve into more detailed policy arguments on Saturday with just three candidates on the stage. Since the last debate, Lincoln Chafee, the former governor of Rhode Island, and former Senator Jim Webb of Virginia have dropped out of the race. Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard professor who was running as a Democrat but was not included in the last debate, also stopped his campaign.Mr. Sanders will get another opportunity to take a harder line against Mrs. Clinton, after he dismissed the controversy surrounding her use of a private email server as secretary of state and largely avoided attacking her directly in their first face-off. He has been preparing sharper lines against Mrs. Clinton on issues like trade, gun control and her emails, and his advisers say he has been studying her record more closely since their October meeting.Democratic strategists say the debate will also be a significant moment for Mr. O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, whose poll numbers lag in the low single digits. Facing Mrs. Clinton’s star power and the grass-roots support behind Mr. Sanders, Mr. O’Malley needs to find a way to capture some of the spotlight.“It’s the play that he has left in his playbook right now, to come out swinging and let people know he’s not just this nice guy and that he can be tough,” said Kevin Geiken, a Democratic political consultant for Bluprint Strategies.Still, it will be a challenge to rattle Mrs. Clinton, who has lurched to the left on issues like trade and the environment while showing a deft ability to repel criticism of her 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq war and her warm relationship with Wall Street.One area on the domestic front that is likely to come up is the issue of criminal justice reform, which the three candidates have been struggling to address after continuing tension between the police and African-Americans.DeRay Mckesson, a leader of the Black Lives Matter movement, said he had a good sense of the plans from Mr. Sanders and Mr. O’Malley, but had not heard a comprehensive proposal on the issue of criminal justice from Mrs. Clinton, despite her meetings with the group.“She’s been eking it out literally one speech at a time,” Mr. McKesson said. “With Hillary, I only have a surface-level understanding. The debate is a chance to learn what she really thinks about the core issues.”But voters will only learn if they tune in. Some political enthusiasts have complained that because of its Saturday night time slot, the two-hour debate, which will be hosted by CBS News and The Des Moines Register and begin at 9 p.m. Eastern time, may not have the audience of previous events that have drawn millions of viewers.Mr. Anderson, the Iowa strategist, noted that the candidates would convene at the same time that the undefeated Iowa Hawkeyes take on the Minnesota Golden Gophers in college football.“The majority of Iowans will be planning their day around that football game,” he said.",ALAN RAPPEPORT,The fight against global terrorism will take center stage after attacks in Paris that laid bare the kinds of threats the next American president will face.,Democratic Debate Has an Unplanned Theme: Terrorism,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/us/politics/democratic-debate-cbs.html,['racial issues'],"['Timothy Anderson', 'Lawrence Lessig', u""Martin O'Malley"", 'Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Jim Webb', 'Brad Anderson', 'Bernie Sanders', 'Lincoln Chafee']",nyt,0.9148687153485446,"[{'author_id': 8381, 'fullname': 'alan rappeport', 'primary_org': 'nyt'}]",2015-11-15 00:33:01,['Senate'],b770967da0ca9ceede7aa3742385563f,2015-11-15 01:00:52.953328
" With the terrible tragedy in Paris Friday, the focus of the second Democratic debate on CBS changed correctly from the economy and domestic issues, to national security and immigration. However, the bickering back and forth between the two candidates going nowhere and the probable nominee -- Mrs. Clinton, really got off the subject very quickly.Hillary said she would be tougher than President Obama. I don't doubt that she will be but that's a pretty low bar.Bernie Sanders, in spite of Friday's terror attacks in Paris, still thinks climate warming is the world’s greatest problem and the root of all evil.Martin O’Malley is prepared to become president because he led Baltimore for 8 years as mayor and the greatest state in the country, Maryland for another four as governor. He must have forgotten that we all got to watch Baltimore explode on national TV a few months back.Sanders thinks Hillary is owned by Wall Street and the Super-PACS and can't be trusted. After hearing O’Malley brag about everything he did in Maryland, I don't know why everyone wouldn't want to live there.The overall message of the night was the Democrats agree on most things. Including, if they would be honest, that Hillary's going to be the nominee. His great strength is that he looks like he could play a president in a TV show like “House of Cards.”  But in reality, he's lucky the Democrats don't have a junior varsity table or he'd be sitting there by himself.The overall message of the night was the Democrats agree on most things. Including, if they would be honest, that Hillary's going to be the nominee.On policy there is little disagreement. First they still believe in redistribution of wealth (the Robin Hood Theory). The rich are too rich and need to pay more in taxes. The upper limit was not quite the 90%  rate in the Eisenhower administration but close (thank you, Bernie Sanders) to certainly a much higher rate for the upper income earners.The middle class is not what it used to be so therefore the government must do something to change all this.The banks and the drug companies and the insurance companies are too big and they are all bad guys so we must regulate them and watch out for them cheating or getting rich.We need more free programs paid for by tax payers. Free public college education for all.To Hillary's credit she didn't buy into this because she doesn't want taxpayers to pay to educate Donald Trump’s kids.Still, there was lots of talk about free health care for all and cheap drugs, too.Who is going to pay for all this? The rich guys, of course.On immigration, we should just let the 11 million immigrants who are here illegally stay because they've been here a long time.Sanders , the avowed Socialist, who represents Vermont, the second smallest state in the Union, kept talking about how great Canada is. Maybe that's because Canada just elected a socialist prime minister.He did waffle on guns a little from the Democratic  position but I am sure that's because nearly every voter in Vermont owns a couple of them.The hardest working guy in the room was John Dickerson, who was the CBS moderator. His biggest task was making sure CBS got its commercial breaks every 10 minutes. About half way through, I confess, I realized that I can't wait for the next “Trump Invitational” as the Republican debates are sometimes called. At least they are not dull! This one was so dull, the network ended it 7 minutes early!   Edward J. Rollins is a Fox News contributor. He is a former assistant to President Reagan and he managed his reelection campaign.

" With the deadly terrorist attacks in Paris as a somber backdrop, three Democratic presidential candidates squared off in Des Moines, Ia., Saturday night in the party’s second 2016 debate.Sometimes the statements made by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley on foreign policy and domestic issues rang true; sometimes their remarks didn’t coincide with the facts. For instance:Sanders criticized Clinton for her support for the Iraq war, saying the was has led to the current instability in the region. Hillary Clinton voted for authorizing the war in Iraq in 2002, which she has since said she regrets. It became an obstacle for her 2008 presidential campaign. In 2006, she said, ""Obviously, if we knew then what we know now, there wouldn't have been a vote, and I certainly wouldn't have voted for it."" Clinton said that Americans spend more than anyone else in the world on prescription drugs. A PBS report last year found that “the United States spends almost $1,000 per person per year on pharmaceuticals. That’s around 40 percent more than the next highest spender, Canada, and more than twice as much as than countries like France and Germany spend.” Sanders aid that Americans spend more on health care than anyone else in the world. This appears to be true, according to a Commonwealth Fund report last year. “The United States health care system is the most expensive in the world, but this report and prior editions consistently show the U.S. under-performs relative to other countries on most dimensions of performance,"" it found. Sanders said climate change contributed to global terrorism and attributed the claim to the CIA. ""Climate change is directly related to the rise of global terrorism,"" the senator said. ""This is what the CIA says.""In a Department of Defense release last year, then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said climate change is a ""trend that will affect national security. Rising global temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, climbing sea levels and more extreme weather events will intensify the challenges of global instability, hunger, poverty and conflict."" O'Malley made a similar connection between climate change and terrorism last September. Politifact rated the claim as ""Mostly True."" It said the drought in Syria – which limited resources – was not the ""sole culprit,"" but rather ""one of many factors that led to the Syrian conflict."" The article stated that Syrian President Bashar Assad's ""recruitment of al Qaida members"" and Sunni Arab genocide are more ""direct"" and ""crystal clear"" causes.Vera Bergengruen, Tori Whitley Iana Kozelsky and David Goldstein contributed.",,"With the deadly terrorist attacks in Paris as a somber backdrop, three Democratic presidential candidates squared off in Des Moines, Ia., Saturday night in the party’s second 2016 debate.

"!--StartFragment-->Jeb Bush has bought his struggling presidential campaign more time, even as Marco Rubio threatens to siphon off the financing that is the lifeblood of his 2016 aspirations.The former Florida governor delivered a solid, issues-oriented performance Tuesday in the latest Republican debate, which calmed top Bush donors and bundlers who had become disenchanted with the direction of his campaign.

" (AP) â The Democratic presidential candidates are debating for the second time in the 2016 nomination contest, this time in Des Moines.The latest developments (all times local):___8:32 p.m.The Republican candidates for president are jumping on the refusal of the Democratic candidates to say the words ""radical Islam"" at their debate.Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tweets, ""Yes, we are at war with radical Islamic terrorism.""Rick Santorum adds on Twitter, ""@HillaryClinton how can we defeat our enemy if we cannot identify who they are and what motivates them?""___8:30 p.m.All three Democratic presidential candidates are declining to use the term ""radical Islam"" at the party's second debate, a description used by many of their Republican rivals.Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton says, ""I don't think we are at war with Islam. ... I think we're at war with jihadists.""She adds that ""it's not particularly helpful"" to use language that alienates many Muslims, and she notes that Republican President George W. Bush made a similar point after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says, ""I don't think the term is important."" He says the more important issue is the ""entire world coming together"" to defeat militants.Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley says using the term ""radical Islam"" is unnecessarily offensive to Muslims in America. He says he prefers ""radical jihadists"" and describes them as a group that is ""perverting the name of a major world religion.""___8:25 p.m.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says countries in the Middle East must get more involved in the fight against the Islamic State.During a foreign policy discussion during the second Democratic debate, Sanders calls the current conflict a ""war for the soul of Islam.""He says that other Muslim countries in the region will need to get ""deeply involved"" and lead the effort. He mentions Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey and Jordan by name.Hillary Rodham Clinton calls the comment ""unfair"" to some counties, in particular Jordan. She says Jordan has ""put a lot on the line"" for the United States.But Clinton says she agrees that Turkey and the Gulf nations should decide if they will stand with the United States against ""this kind of jihadi radicalism.""___8:20 p.m.Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley says simply toppling dictators is not a suitable foreign policy for the 21st century, referring to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.O'Malley is attempting to draw a contrast with former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on foreign policy during the second Democratic debate.He says Syria, Libya and Afghanistan are ""a mess"" and that the United States isn't doing enough to build stable democracies after toppling dictators.He says the United States needs better ""human intelligence"" on the ground to understand what actors will step up to fill the void after dictators fall.___8:17 p.m.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is criticizing former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's vote as a New York senator for the resolution to allow the 2003 invasion of Iraq.Sanders says, ""I don't think any sensible person"" would have supported the use-of-force resolution.He calls the invasion ""the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of the United States.""Clinton has said the 2002 vote was a mistake, but says there were acts leading up to the invasion that suggested Islamic extremists had struck at U.S. installations.___8:15 p.m.Hillary Rodham Clinton is defending the Obama administration's initial approach to the rise of Islamic State, including her actions as secretary of state.Clinton rejects the notion that she underestimated the militants, and she blames their rise on leaders in the Middle East and names former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.Clinton says al-Maliki did not do enough to maintain stability in Iraq once the U.S. turned over control of the nation.She adds that she did advocate that the U.S. do more to ""train and equip moderates"" in Syria, which has since fallen into civil war.___8:10 p.m.A look at the opening statements from the second presidential Democratic debate.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders begins with sharp language for the Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for the attack in Paris.He says, ""Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization.""But Sanders also pivots from the attacks to the economic issues that are the focus of his campaign.Front-runner and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton keeps to the attacks in her statement, saying ""our prayers are with the people of France tonight.""She adds: ""But that is not enough. We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical, Jihadist ideology that motivates organizations ISIS.""Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley touts his executive experience in his opening remarks, and says the U.S. needs ""new thinking"" and ""new leadership"" to respond to threats like those posed by the Islamic State.___8 p.m.The second debate of the Democratic campaign for president is underway, and it's starting with a moment of silence for the victims of the attacks in Paris.A coordinated gun-and-suicide bombing attack tore across Paris on Friday, leaving at least 129 people dead and 352 injured. It marked the deadliest violence on French soil since World War II.French President Francois Hollande has vowed that his country will wage ""merciless"" war on the Islamic State group, which claimed responsibility for the carnage.The candidates will each make an opening statement before the debate's first section focuses on the attacks and foreign policy.___7:45 p.m.The Democratic candidates for president are gathering for the party's second debate of the 2016 campaign, a meeting that will take place in the shadow of the attacks in Paris.The campaigns have tangled with debate host CBS over the format of the debate in the hours before the debate.When CBS said on a conference call with the campaigns that it wanted to focus the opening statement and the first section of the debate on the Paris attacks, the campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders vigorously disagreed.That's according to a participant on the call, who spoke on condition of anonymity and was not authorized to speak publicly.Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver says the key issue is a proposal to shorten the opening statements from 90 seconds to 30 seconds in order to move quickly to questions in a debate unfolding a day after the Paris attacks.The Vermont senator's campaign says it successfully argued on behalf of the longer opening statements, which all three candidates will deliver.The debate will begin with a moment of silence in memory of the victims of the attacks.â By Ken Thomas.",,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — The Democratic presidential candidates are debating for the second time in the 2016 nomination contest, this time in Des Moines.",The Latest: Democratic 2016 candidates meet for 2nd debate,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-11-14-US-DEM-2016-Debate-The-Latest/id-d9be7b6490fd46ddb01521463c80ddce,['foreign policy/national security'],"['Rick Santorum', 'Jeff Weaver', u""Martin O'Malley"", 'Francois Hollande', 'Jeb Bush', 'Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'George W.

" (AP) â With the country still reeling from deadly terrorist attacks in Paris, Hillary Rodham Clinton cast herself as America's strongest leader in a scary world, even as she found herself forced to defend her own role during the rise of the Islamic State militants.""This election is not only about electing a president, it's also about choosing our next commander in chief,"" Clinton said Saturday night in the Democrats' second debate of the presidential campaign. ""All of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.""Amid the backdrop of global anxiety, Clinton found herself fending off questions about not only her foreign policy record but her economic ties, with both Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley painting the former senator from New York as a lackey for Wall Street and corporate interests.""Let's not be naive about it,"" said Sanders, noting that Clinton collected millions in campaign donations from Wall Street bankers. ""They expect to get something. Everybody knows that.""The barbs marked a far more aggressive shift in a primary race that has so far been notable for its civility. Democrats have spent months boasting about the substantive tone of their contest, attempting to set up a favorable early contrast with the ""carnival barker"" insults of the crowded Republican primary.Clinton faced criticism of her national security record, when Sanders traced the current instability in the Middle East to the U.S. Senate's vote â including Clinton's â to authorize military action in Iraq in 2002. He said that U.S. invasion ""unraveled the region.""The former secretary of state fought back, saying terrorism has been erupting for decades, specifically mentioning the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. She said the recent unrest in Libya and other parts of the Middle East is symptomatic of an ""arc of instability from North Africa to Afghanistan.""She rejected the idea that she and the rest of the Obama administration underestimated the growing threat of the Islamic State.The back-and-forth revealed a foreign policy split within the Democratic Party, with Sanders playing to the anti-war activists who boosted then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama to victory in 2008.Sanders argued for a far more hands-off approach, advocating for Muslim countries to lead the fight and declaring that the war against Islamic State militants is about the ""soul of Islam.""Clinton has a history of advocating for more robust involvement across the globe â both as a presidential candidate eight years ago and as Obama's secretary of state. In recent weeks, she has called for a more aggressive U.S. role in the Syrian conflict, including a no-fly zone over the area, a move the Obama administration opposes. But she stood by her opposition to seeking a formal declaration of war against the Islamic State.Foreign relations is an area where Clinton, as a former secretary of state, is in the strongest position to talk about the attacks and the U.S. effort to dismantle the Islamic State group. But she is vulnerable, too, her tenure tied to that of Obama, who's struggled to contain the threat from Islamic militants in Syria and associated terror attacks across the globe.The candidates were meeting in the shadow of the Paris attacks that killed at least 129 and wounded at least 352 people. The debate began with a solemn tone, with a moment of silence followed by previously unplanned foreign policy questions.All the candidates denounced the attacks, the first time the Democratic field spoke about the incidents.They gave some fodder to their Republican critics, who coupled condemnation of the Paris attacks during the day with sharp criticism for Obama and his former secretary of state, Clinton.""We are at war with violent extremism, we are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression,"" said Clinton, arguing the U.S. is not at war with Islam or all Muslims. ""I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.""Sanders and O'Malley agreed with her sentiments, saying the term ""radical Islam"" used by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and other Republican presidential candidates, is unnecessarily offensive to American Muslims.Republicans immediately seized on the remarks. ""Yes, we are at war with radical Islamic terrorism,"" tweeted former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.The conversation later pivoted to economic issues, with the candidates tangling over how to pay for their plans to expand college affordability, family leave and prescription drug coverage. All three agreed that wealthy citizens and corporations should pay more in taxes to benefit the middle class.""I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,"" joked Sanders, saying the former president backed a 90 percent marginal tax rate.The three tangled over how high to increase the minimum wage, with Clinton backing a $12-per-hour federal floor while Sanders and O'Malley said $15 an hour â the rate being pushed by a campaign of fast-food workers and labor unions.While Clinton is wary of alienating Sanders backers whose support she'll need should she win the nomination, she drew a contrast with him on gun control. Highlighting a vote he took giving the gun industry immunity from lawsuits, she charged him with failing to push hard enough to regulate ownership.Since the party's first debate a month ago, Clinton has built a lead in the early voting states, an uptick that has come amid other signs the party is coalescing behind her. An Associated Press survey of superdelegates published Friday found that half of the Democratic insiders are publicly backing Clinton.Sanders may have inadvertently facilitated some of her progress in the first debate, when he seemed to dismiss the controversy over her use of a private email account and server by saying Americans are tired of hearing about her ""damn emails.""Saturday night, Sanders declined once again to attack:  ""I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email. I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email,"" he said.""I agree completely,"" said Clinton, with a laugh.___Follow Lisa Lerer on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/llerer",,"WASHINGTON (AP) — With the country still reeling from deadly terrorist attacks in Paris, Hillary Rodham Clinton cast herself as America's strongest leader in a scary world, even as she found herself forced to defend her own role during the rise of the Islamic State militants.","Clinton, Sanders debate foreign policy after Paris attacks",http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-11-14-US--DEM%202016-Debate/id-838ac0452db545a59dfdb9f7a2186c7a,['foreign policy/national security'],"[u""Martin O'Malley"", 'Jeb Bush', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Lisa Lerer', 'Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Marco Rubio', 'Barack Obama', 'Bernie Sanders']",ap,0.9415475997294712,"[{'author_id': 39735, 'fullname': 'lisa lerer', 'primary_org': 'ap'}]",2015-11-14 22:43:00,['Democratic Party'],2546a16b3e748218a88f38f68865cf82,2015-11-15 04:00:04.745793
"Hillary Clinton should have seen that Wall Street shot coming. Instead, she compounded the damage.The former secretary of state was off to a sound outing in Saturday night’s debate against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland. Friday’s terrorist attacks in Paris dominated at first, allowing her to highlight her superior experience in world affairs. But it was those attacks that made her badly muffed response to questions about her fealty to Wall Street all the more jarring. Here’s the exchange:Mr. Sanders: “I have never heard a candidate, never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military-industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me. I’m going to be independent. Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something. Everybody knows that. Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate. We are relying on small campaign donors, 750,000 of them, 30 bucks apiece. That’s who I’m indebted to.”Mrs. Clinton: “Well John, wait a minute. Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impugn my integrity. Let’s be frank here.”Mr. Sanders: “No, I have not.”Mrs. Clinton: “Oh, wait a minute, senator. You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small. And I’m very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent. So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked. Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.”Predictably, Twitter exploded with demands to know what campaign donations from big banks had to do with New York’s recovery from 9/11.Answer: little to nothing. Since 2001, she and Bill Clinton have earned more than $125 million for speeches, many of the most lucrative made before financial groups.That does not begin to account for the millions of dollars given directly to her campaign, and to political action committees backing her. Nearly 15 years after the 2001 attacks, Mrs. Clinton was earning more than $200,000 for a 20-minute speech. Most of those took place behind guarded doors. But one can guess that she and the financial executives were not still talking about 9/11.Middle-class Americans associate Wall Street with the 2008 meltdown of the economy that cost so many their homes and savings. In the debate Mrs. Clinton repeatedly referred to her plan for reining in banks, but offered precious few specifics. This is what happens when Hillary Clinton the candidate gets complacent. The debate moderator, John Dickerson, had even tipped her off before a commercial break that the next topic was Wall Street.Her effort to tug on Americans’ heartstrings instead of explaining her Wall Street ties — on a day that the scars of 9/11 were exposed anew — was at best botched rhetoric. At worst it was the type of cynical move that Mrs. Clinton would have condemned in Republicans. She should make a fast, thorough effort to explain herself by providing a detailed plan for how she would promote measures protecting middle-class Americans from another financial crisis.",THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"After a good start on national security and terrorism, Hillary Clinton flubbed legitimate questions about her ties to Wall Street on Saturday.",Hillary Clinton Botches Wall Street Questions,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/opinion/hillary-clinton-botches-wall-street-questions.html,['economy'],"['Bill Clinton', 'Bernie Sanders', 'John Dickerson', 'Hillary Clinton', 'MaRtin oMAlLey']",nyt,0.8708710278871227,"[{'author_id': 697, 'fullname': 'the editorial board', 'primary_org': 'nyt'}]",2015-11-15 21:26:52,[],ac1a1d01775534781b522dfa3ead3ef1,2015-11-15 21:45:54.898058
"Bernie Sanders’ campaign refuted reports that campaign officials were angry about changes in the format of tonight’s Democratic debate to reflect the terrorist attacks in Paris.A top aide to the Vermont senator engaged in a “lengthy dispute with executives from CBS, the network hosting the debate, during a conference call on Saturday morning,” Yahoo News reported. The site reported a staffer for one of the other campaigns who was also on the call describing the exchange as “heated” and even “bizarre.” A second source on the call confirmed the nature of the exchange, the site said.Sanders’ campaign, however, said the candidate was fine with the changes: “The news out of Paris was terrible and important and clearly something that was going to be the focus of the debate,” spokesman Michael Briggs said in a telephone interview.He said changes to the format of the debate were discussed and twice changed, and “in the end the senator was totally satisfied with the changes and looking forward to a good debate.”He added, “if some other campaign wants to make a mountain out of molehill, it’s still a molehill.”He said there was a disagreement of “minor points” over the opening. CBS said it wanted to cut the opening statements by the candidates from 90 seconds to 30 seconds to open up with the Paris attacks -- which the Sanders’ campaign opposed, Jeff Weaver, the Vermont senator's campaign manager told CNN.""They wanted to make some last-minute changes to the debate.

"AMES, Iowa (AP) â Fresh from the second Democratic presidential debate, Hillary Rodham Clinton suggested Sunday that Bernie Sanders would raise middle-class taxes and ""scrap"" President Barack Obama's health care law, in an escalating critique of the Vermont senator.Joined by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, at a fall barbecue, the front-runner said middle-class families ""need a raise, not a tax increase"" and she was the lone Democrat in the debate to commit to raising wages ""and not your taxes.""Without mentioning her main rival by name, Clinton said Democrats should work to build on Obama's health law and not suggest ""we scrap it and start all over again."" During the debate, Clinton questioned Sanders' 2013 health care legislation, saying it would dismantle the law and empower Republican governors like Terry Branstad of Iowa to administer the health care system in each state. Sanders envisions a ""single-payer"" system that would be run by the states under federal rules.Even as the field responded somberly to the deadly attacks in Paris, the debate Saturday night marked a feistier phase in the Democratic campaign. Helped by a strong autumn, Clinton has built a small lead in Iowa and is trying to stave off Sanders in the Feb. 1 presidential caucuses.Sanders put Clinton on the defensive in the debate when he said Wall Street had been the major contributor to her campaigns in order to get support in return.Clinton responded that Sanders was trying to ""impugn my integrity"" and said that as a New York senator, she helped New York City's financial hub rebuild after the Sept. 11 attacks. Her invoking of 9/11 received an incredulous response on social media and Republicans accused her of shamefully hiding behind the attacks to deflect attention from her ties to her wealthiest donors.Taking the stage in Ames, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley said Clinton brought up 9/11 to try to ""mask her proximity to Wall Street and the huge amount of contributions and the dollars she has received personally from the major banks of Wall Street.""""She doesn't have to mask it. It is what it is,"" O'Malley said. ""That is the sort of company, that is the sort economic advice that she would follow.""Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said following the debate that the senator's proposals would be paid for with higher taxes on the wealthy and large corporations. ""He's raising taxes to pay for relief for middle-income and working people,"" he said.He also said Sanders would build upon the health care law to provide universal coverage. ""It's not a question of ripping up Obamacare, it's really expanding on the promise of Obamacare,"" Weaver said.The barbecue inside a massive agriculture center featured another appearance by Bill Clinton, who briefly introduced his wife and joked that after watching the debates, ""I think I'm going to vote for Hillary.""___On Twitter, follow Ken Thomas: https://twitter.com/KThomasDC",,"AMES, Iowa (AP) — Fresh from the second Democratic presidential debate, Hillary Rodham Clinton suggested Sunday that Bernie Sanders would raise middle-class taxes and ""scrap"" President Barack Obama's health care law, in an escalating critique of the Vermont senator.","Clinton goes after Sanders on taxes, health care",http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-11-15-US--DEM%202016-Clinton/id-e642156bd9b549fb8161c27ced2fad72,['health'],"['Jeff Weaver', u""Martin O'Malley"", 'Bill Clinton', 'Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Barack Obama', 'Ken Thomas', 'Bernie Sanders', 'Terry Branstad']",ap,0.535904016805291,"[{'author_id': 39392, 'fullname': 'ken thomas', 'primary_org': 'ap'}]",2015-11-15 16:27:00,['AMES'],339e5cfe47434f9efe0d01fa28b3f86f,2015-11-15 22:00:05.671043
" (AP) â The bloody attacks in Paris are putting the Syrian refugee crisis at center stage in U.S. politics as migrants from that war-torn country surge toward the West and security concerns rise.GOP presidential contender Marco Rubio on Sunday said the United States should no longer accept Syrian refugees because it's impossible to know whether they have links to Islamic militants â an apparent shift from earlier statements in which he left open the prospects of migrants being admitted with proper vetting.""It's not that we don't want to, it's that we can't,"" Rubio said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week.""  ""Because there's no way to background check someone that's coming from Syria.  Who do you call and do a background check on them?""The question of admitting Syrian refugees has for months been part of the national security discussion among 2016 candidates that cuts to the heart of the American identity as a refuge. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush on Sunday told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that the U.S. should admit Syrian Christians, after proper vetting. Other Republican candidates have called for a ban on allowing Syrians into the U.S. All three Democratic presidential candidates have said they would admit Syrians but only after thorough background checks.But Friday night's mass killings in Paris, which left at least 129 people dead, offered evidence that may have backed up what many, including Rubio, had been warning: People with secret ties to Islamic militants could flow across borders as part of waves of refugees.Authorities said a Syrian passport found near one of the Paris attackers that had been registered last month and traveled through three countries along a busy migrant corridor known for lax controls. It was not clear whether the document was real or forged. Officials on Sunday were still trying to identify people involved in the conspiracy. They said as many as three of the seven suicide bombers who died in the attacks were French citizens.A spokesman for President Barack Obama said Sunday that the administration is moving forward with its plan to thoroughly vet and admit as many as 10,000 Syrian refugees.""What we need to be able to do frankly is sort out that foreign fighter flow, those who have gone into Syria and come out and want to launch attacks or those people who have connections with ISIL in Syria,""  Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said on Fox News Sunday. ""At the same time, we have to recognize there's tragic victims of this conflict, there are women, and children, orphans of this war and I think we need to do our part, along with our allies, to provide them a safe haven.""The Paris attacks have elevated national security in the presidential contest. In Saturday night's Democratic presidential debate, which began with a moment of silence for the Paris victims, all three candidates â former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley â said the U.S. should admit far more than the 10,000 Syrians to which Obama has committed, but only with proper screening.Rubio on Sunday said that was impossible.""You can't pick up the phone and call Syria, and that's one of the reasons why I said we won't be able to take more refugees,"" Rubio said on ABC.That is a switch from Rubio's other statements this fall, in which he voiced skepticism about proper vetting but still left the door open to admitting refugees.  In September, he told Boston Herald radio: ""We've always been a country that's been willing to accept people who have been displaced. And I would be open to that if it can do it in a way that allows us to ensure that among them are not infiltrated, people who are part of a terrorist organization.""Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, meanwhile, said Sunday that the U.S. has a responsibility to ""help with refugees after proper screening.""""And I think or focus out to be on the Christians who have no place in Syria anymore,"" he added in NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ''They're being beheaded, they're being executed by both sides.  And I think we have a responsibility to help.""___Follow Laurie Kellman on Twitter at: ",,WASHINGTON (AP) — The bloody attacks in Paris are putting the Syrian refugee crisis at center stage in U.S. politics as migrants from that war-torn country surge toward the West and security concerns rise.,Syrian refugee policy takes focus in US 2016 politics,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-11-15-US--Campaign%202016-Syrian%20Refugees/id-6577eaaceeab47519d098645fc98804f,['foreign policy/national security'],"[u""Martin O'Malley"", 'Jeb Bush', 'Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Marco Rubio', 'Barack Obama', 'Bernie Sanders', 'Laurie Kellman']",ap,0.5993125329466457,"[{'author_id': 40901, 'fullname': 'laurie kellman', 'primary_org': 'ap'}]",2015-11-15 16:01:00,['Deputy National Security Adviser'],c7fb4108635fc77c265d05049df0b1d3,2015-11-15 22:00:05.561503
"Hillary Clinton defended herself against criticism over the money she has raised from the financial industry by invoking her job as a U.S. senator representing New York after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.“I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York,” she said, after finding herself again on the defensive over her perceived close ties to Wall Street. “It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.”The unusual defense emerged during a feisty exchange over financial-industry regulation in Saturday’s Democratic presidential debate hosted by CBS News. Mrs. Clinton also noted that 60% of her donors are women—another effort to turn back the Wall Street fundraising attack from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who has emerged as a formidable opponent in the Democratic primary.Just as in last month’s Democratic debate, the discussion Saturday of financial regulation turned largely on whether Congress should reinstate the New Deal-era banking law, the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated investment banking from commercial banking. President Bill Clinton played a major role ushering in legislation, signed into law in 1999, that repealed Glass-Steagall.Some critics say Glass-Steagall facilitated the financial crisis in 2008 by allowing large banks to grow, in effect, “too big to fail,” forcing the unpopular emergency bailouts. They have pushed legislation to carve up the banks by instating aspects of Glass-Steagall, which the banking industry strongly opposes. Mr. Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley both endorsed that effort again on Saturday.Mrs. Clinton was more restrained. “Reinstating Glass-Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough,” she said, adding that her regulatory-overhaul proposal is “tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive,” because it would target nonbank institutions as well as Wall Street banks and large depository institutions.Mrs. Clinton implied that Glass-Steagall would have done little to forestall the bank bailouts in 2008 because many of the companies that either failed or required bailouts—including American International Group and Lehman Brothers—weren’t big deposit-taking banks. AIG is an insurance company and Lehman Brothers was a standalone investment bank.Critics of the Glass-Steagall repeal don’t agree with this view. They say it too easily overlooks the ways in which banks, particularly Citigroup, took on greater risks that fed increased risk-taking across Wall Street. AIG, for example, got into trouble because it had insured billions of financial products issued by more than a dozen firms—some that had grown thanks to Glass-Steagall and some that, like Lehman and Bear Stearns, had remained standalone investment banks.Stepping back from the bank-regulation arcana, there’s a broader disagreement here. At the heart of Mr. Sanders’s argument over the size of banks is the idea that they have too much political power, an idea that evokes the “trust busting” of President Teddy Roosevelt who sought to break up big industrial monopolies for some of the same reasons.Why do big industries make “millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something. Everybody knows that,” said Mr. Sanders.When Mrs. Clinton said that she would break up banks if they didn’t play by the rules, Mr. Sanders responded with disbelief that this might be in doubt. “The business model of Wall Street is fraud,” he said.Mr. Sanders pledged not to have any Wall Street representatives in his cabinet. “One of the problems we’ve had…whether it’s Republican administrations or Democratic administrations, we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations,” he said.Mr. O’Malley joined in when he said that Richard Rubin and Larry Summers, both former treasury secretaries for President Bill Clinton, wouldn’t be allowed near his administration. Mr. Rubin has been a very influential figure within Democratic policymaking for the last two decades, and many policymakers that he has mentored have served in top positions for President Barack Obama.“They are the architects,” said Mr. O’Malley.Mr. O’Malley was pressed to name who, exactly, would provide him with advise on financial regulation. He didn’t provide any names. “We’ll have an inclusive group,” he said.Financial regulation also emerged as a hot topic in Tuesday’s Republican debate, and it showed how both parties have vastly different interpretations of what caused the financial crisis and, consequently, what should be done to prevent it from happening again.Republicans generally have blamed government policies, from housing to the Federal Reserve, for provoking risk-taking, an idea that draws mixed readings from economists. They say that there is now too much government regulation, singling out for criticism the Dodd-Frank financial-regulatory overhaul, even though they have also tried to sound critical of Wall Street.The clear winner in both the GOP debate earlier this week and in Saturday’s Democratic debate: community banks.“Imagine America without its community banks. Well, that’s what’s happening because of Dodd-Frank,” said former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in Tuesday’s debate.And Mr. Sanders on Saturday: “Support community banks and credit unions. That’s the future of banking in America.”______________________________________________________2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll StandingsPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.

"DES MOINES, Iowa U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton came under heavy criticism in a debate on Saturday for her 2003 vote backing the U.S. invasion of Iraq, with rival Bernie Sanders linking it to regional chaos that aided the rise of Islamic State militants.Sanders and rival Martin O'Malley took a more aggressive tone with Clinton than in their first debate last month, also accusing her of being too cozy with Wall Street and unwilling to stand up to corporate interests.The day after a series of bomb and gun attacks that killed at least 129 people in Paris, Sanders criticized Clinton's vote authorizing the Iraq invasion and said it was ""one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the modern history of the United States.”""I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, unraveled the region immensely, and led to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS,"" said Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont.""I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now,"" he said.Clinton, who has frequently called the vote a mistake, said it should be placed in the historical context of years of terrorism before the invasion.“If we’re ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extremists, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq,” she said.""This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.  It's become more complicated. And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in,"" she said.  The Iraq exchange came early in the second debate for Democrats seeking their party's nomination for the November 2016 presidential election, which focused on foreign policy and ways to combat terrorism after the Paris attacks.The candidates and audience at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, observed a moment of silence at the beginning of the debate to honor those killed in France.Clinton, the former secretary of state, has far more foreign policy experience than either Sanders or O'Malley. But she was forced on the defensive early in the debate about her years of leading President Barack Obama's foreign policy team.Clinton struck a sharp contrast to Obama's comments in an interview aired on Friday that ISIS had been contained. ""We have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network. It cannot be contained, it must be defeated,"" she said.Republican presidential contenders have criticized Obama for what they say was an inadequate response to the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In the aftermath of the attacks, businessman Donald Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz called on the administration to reconsider plans to allow thousands of Syrian refugees to be resettled in the United States.The White House aims to increase to 10,000 the number of Syrian refugees accepted in the United States during fiscal year 2016, from less than 2,000 accepted in the previous year.Clinton has always been from the more hawkish wing of the Democratic Party. Her support for the 2003 Iraq invasion played a major role in her primary loss to Obama in the 2008 White House race.The foreign policy focus was a dramatic shift in emphasis in a Democratic presidential race that so far has been dominated by domestic economic issues such as income inequality, college affordability and family leave.The Democrats returned to that theme later in the debate, and Sanders criticized Clinton for her opposition to reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act, the 1933 law that established a firewall between investment and commercial banking. Its removal has been blamed by some for helping lead to the 2008 financial crisis.""Over her political career, Wall Street has been a major, the major donor to Hillary Clinton. Now maybe they’re dumb, but I don’t think so,"" said Sanders, who favors reinstatement of the act.Clinton accused Sanders of impugning her integrity and said reinstating the law was not enough to rein in corporate influence and reform Wall Street.""Reinstating Glass-Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough,"" she said. ""I just don’t think it would get the job done, I’m all about making sure it actually gets results for whatever we do.” With the political clock ticking to the first nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 1, Clinton has opened a commanding lead over Sanders, her prime challenger, in national and Iowa polls. O'Malley trails well behind, in single digits in most polls.

"A women takes a photo while standing on the stage for Saturday night's Democratic presidential debate between Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt,, Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, Friday, Nov. 13, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders needs to slow frontrunner Hillary Clinton’s run toward the party nomination, and Saturday night’s debate might be such an opportunity.The format of the CBS debate, the second of the 2016 cycle for Democratic White House candidates, was reworked after the Paris terror attacks Friday night to focus more on terrorism, national security and foreign policy.Clinton, as a former secretary of state, has more experience with such matters, compared to both Sanders, a Vermont independent, and fellow challenger Martin O’Malley, a former Maryland governor.However, her record as the State Department leader from 2009 to 2013 could also invite moderator questions and candidate attacks Saturday about her handling of the deadly Sept. 11, 2012, terror attacks on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya.Among the concerns, as frequently highlighted by Republicans, are whether Clinton paid enough attention to security concerns raised by Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who was killed in the attacks, and whether she attempted to cover up that the attacks were terror related.Stevens and three other Americans died in the attacks.Clinton will also likely face questions at the debate in Des Moines, Iowa, about her role in the Obama administration’s efforts to eradicate the Islamic State, the increasingly dangerous terror group that has claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks that killed at least 129 people.Clinton leads Sanders 54.7 percent to 33 percent, with O’Malley at a distant 2.7 percent, according to an averaging of polls by the nonpartisan website RealClearPolitics.com.And an Associated Press survey of superdelegates published Friday found that half of the Democratic insiders are publicly backing Clinton, which further secures her nomination efforts.Clinton’s campaign got off to a rough start following revelations about eight months ago that as secretary of state she used a private server and email accounts for official business, which raised questions about whether classified information was compromised.However, the former first lady and New York senator has been on a recent roll, which started with a good first debate in mid-October and was followed about a week later by her well-prepared testimony before a GOP-led special House committee on the Benghazi matter.Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist whose outsider campaign has drawn large crowds and good polling numbers in early-voting states Iowa and New Hampshire, will indeed be free to attack Clinton on foreign policy.However, his focus on such domestic issues as income inequality, affordable college tuition and social justice reform could present problems Saturday if Clinton or the moderators go deep and hard into the foreign policy issues.Sanders may have inadvertently facilitated some of Clinton’s turnaround when in the first debate he seemed to dismiss the controversy over her use of a private email account and server by saying Americans are tired of hearing about her ""damn emails.""But he has since given her no more passes.Though careful never to mention Clinton by name, Sanders has drawn a series of contrasts with the former secretary of State on issues that include her backing of the war in Iraq, trade and the minimum wage.Sanders advisers say he plans to discuss the email issue only if the moderators raise it.  ""He's definitely going to cut a harder contrast on core issues,"" said Larry Cohen, a senior adviser to Sanders, ""But it's not going to be over personal style.""The problem for Sanders is that Clinton agrees with him on some of the core domestic issues of his campaign, having shifted to the left in recent weeks to oppose construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.""His current arguments aren't enough to get beyond his core voter,"" said Gina Glantz, manager of Bill Bradley's 2000 presidential campaign.While Sanders aides bragged about their candidate's lax preparation for the last debate, they shuttled him to his campaign headquarters in Burlington, Vermont, for mock sessions before this match-up. Clinton, too, has kept her schedule relatively clear over the last several days, leaving plenty of time for rehearsals.""They are absolutely prepared for the fact that Bernie's going to come out swinging,"" said Maria Cardona, a Democratic strategist who worked for Clinton's failed 2008 White House campaign, ""The question is how it's going to happen.""Clinton supporters say their candidate will remain focused on laying out her vision for the future rather than striking back at Sanders. Her campaign has about $15.2 million in television advertising planned through mid-February, compared with a $3.2 million Sanders ad buy that ends next week, according to Kantar Media's CMAG advertising tracker.The Service Employees International Union, an influential force in Democratic politics, is expected to issue their endorsement on Tuesday, according to people knowledgeable about the union's process. Clinton has been backed by more than 72 percent of members in all their internal polling, including the most recent survey conducted a few weeks ago.In addition to her success in the first debate and on Capitol Hill, Clinton has benefited from Vice President Joe Biden's decision to forgo a presidential run.O'Malley has questioned Sanders' commitment to the Democratic Party and President Obama, still a popular figure among Democrats.A more aggressive tone would mark a shift for a race that has so far been notable for its civility. Democrats have spent months boasting about the substantive tone of their contest, attempting to set-up a favorable early contrast with the often carnival-like insults of the crowded Republican primary.The Associated Press contributed to this report.         ",,"Democrat presidential challenger Sen.

Martin O'Malley. The campaign’s objections were first reported by Yahoo News.Sanders aides noted on the call that in 90-second opening statements all three candidates could choose to spend their time on terror or other topics, and in the end they prevailed on organizers to keep the longer opening statements.In the end, the candidates agreed to hold their opening statements to 60 secondsHowever, the Sanders camp was still not pleased that CBS planned to spend significant time early in the debate on national security after the lead moderator, John Dickerson of CBS, in recent days privately told the campaigns and publicly said in media interviews that the primary focus would be on income inequality and other economic topics.In the wake of the terror attacks, the Clinton and O'Malley camps expressed support for the topic shift on the conference call, according to the Democratic sources.The objections by the Sanders camp fueled talk among Democrats in Iowa that the senator is worried he cannot match the former secretary of state's stature on national security.Sanders aides reject this by saying he will focus on how judgment on national security is more important than experience.
