"Nov. 14, 2015: Hillary Rodham Clinton shakes hands with Martin O'Malley after a Democratic presidential primary debate in Des Moines, Iowa. (AP)Hillary Clinton invoked the 9/11 terror attacks as she defended herself against complaints about her Wall Street donations during Saturday night’s debate, a response that drew bipartisan criticism.The former New York senator made the reference after Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders repeatedly criticized her for taking money from the financial sector and questioned whether she had the independence to overhaul the industry.“I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked,” Clinton pointed out. “Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York.”Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus slammed Clinton for the comments after the debate in Des Moines ended.“[I]n a new low, Hillary Clinton shamefully hid behind the 9/11 terrorist attacks in a bizarre attempt to deflect attention from her ties to her wealthy donors,” he said in a statement.The backlash also surfaced during the CBS-hosted debate itself. Shortly after Clinton made the remarks, the moderators cited social media reaction, including a tweet saying she had invoked 9/11 to justify Wall Street donations.“Well, I'm sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild,” Clinton said.Sanders acknowledged she was the senator from New York at the time and did help rebuild. But he also said Wall Street has too much power.Earlier, he suggested Clinton would not be able to overhaul the industry given its support for her.“Let's not be naive about it. Why …has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?” he said. “You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.”Even Clinton’s former campaign manager, Patti Solis Doyle, questioned the 9/11 reference following the debate.“I do think that the 9/11 reference was probably better used when she was talking about terrorism. She was the senator when the 9/11 attacks happened. She was the senator when we needed to rebuild that city. And it would have been more powerful talking about terrorism,” she said on CNN.          ",,"Hillary Clinton invoked the 9/11 terror attacks as she defended herself against complaints about her Wall Street donations during Saturday night’s debate, a response that drew bipartisan criticism.","Clinton invokes 9/11 in countering criticism of Wall St. donations, takes heat",http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/vdZmq3POxBM/,"['campaign_finance', 'foreign policy/national security']","[u""Martin O'Malley"", 'Patti Solis Doyle', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Reince Priebus', 'Bernie Sanders']",fox,0.7299152360001901,[],2015-11-15 05:45:07,['Republican National Committee'],15a5a21203942c704b394e703f0091ce,2015-11-15 07:00:17.338498
"Senator Marco Rubio, arguing that the United States is “at war with radical Islam,” sharply criticized Hillary Rodham Clinton for declining to characterize the perpetrators of the Paris attacks in that way, invoking Nazi Germany to make his point.“That would be like saying we weren’t at war with Nazis, because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but weren’t violent themselves,” Mr. Rubio said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”At the Democratic debate on Saturday night, Mrs. Clinton said she was wary about “painting with too broad a brush” while describing Muslims and terror.“I don’t think we’re at war with all Muslims,” she said. “I think we’re at war with jihadists. We are at war with violent extremism. We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression.”Republican presidential candidates have repeatedly condemned Democrats like Mrs. Clinton for their reluctance to use the term “radical Islam” while describing how they would respond to the violence wrought by ISIS.Mr. Rubio, the Florida senator, also called on Sunday for the invocation of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which declares an attack on one member of NATO as an attack on all.He demurred when asked about the prospect of placing American troops on the ground.“I think it’s premature to say the exact numbers,” he said, though he called for an increase in the number of “special operators on the ground.”",MATT FLEGENHEIMER,"Attacking Mrs. Clinton, the Florida senator drew a parallel between members of the Nazi Party who did not commit acts of violence and Muslims who are not violent extremists.","First Draft: Invoking Nazis, Marco Rubio Hits Hillary Clinton for Not Saying U.S. at War With ‘Radical Islam’",http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/15/invoking-nazis-marco-rubio-hits-hillary-clinton-for-not-saying-u-s-at-war-with-radical-islam/,['foreign policy/national security'],"['Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Marco Rubio', 'Hillary Clinton']",nyt,0.6955656874739587,"[{'author_id': 358, 'fullname': 'matt flegenheimer', 'primary_org': 'nyt'}]",2015-11-15 15:56:02,['NATO'],16ad84a36862fa7f625bcbade71ca7be,2015-11-15 16:31:51.866074
"Republican presidential candidate and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said U.S. allies should invoke the collective defense clause of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in response to terrorist attacks in Paris.“This is clearly an act of war and an attack on one of our NATO allies, and we should invoke Article 5 of the NATO agreement, and bring everyone together to put together a coalition to confront this challenge,” Mr. Rubio said Sunday morning on ABC.French president Francois Hollande called the attacks “an act of war” and cited Islamic State as responsible.Former Florida governor and GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush stopped short calling for an Article 5 declaration, which is the formal recognition that an attack on one NATO member represents an attack on them all, and sets the groundwork for collective military action.“I think the president should convene the North Atlantic Council to discuss that,” Mr. Bush said Sunday morning on CNN. “If that’s what the French want, then, our longest and strongest and most loyal ally over our entire history, we should certainly consider it.”The only time the collective defense provision was invoked came after the Sept. 11 terror attacks in the U.S.Later, on NBC, Mr. Bush said: “This is a threat to western civilization and we should consider it that way.”The U.S. and France already work together in operations in Iraq and Syria, sharing intelligence and coordinating airstrikes.Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser to President Barack Obama, agreed with Mr. Hollande that the attacks in Paris were an act of war. He said the U.S. wants “to continue to intensify that coordination” with France.While France hasn’t invoked Article 5, NATO’s secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said members are ready to assist.______________________________________________________2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll StandingsPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.
