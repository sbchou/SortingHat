"Republican candidates for president called on the Obama administration to tighten border controls amid reports that one of the suicide bombers who carried outÂ Fridayâs attacks in Paris may have entered Europe as a Syrian migrant.Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee said President Barack Obama should âclose our borders.ââIf a left-wing politically-correct country like France will close its borders, it’s time for us to put a moratorium on people coming here from countries where there are ISIS or al Qaeda ties,â he told CNN on Saturday.Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, another GOP presidential candidate, said the difficulty of running background checks on Syrian refugees should preclude further migration from Syria into the U.S.âYou canât pick up the phone and call Syria, and thatâs one of the reasons why I said we wonât be able to take more refugees,â he said on ABC on Sunday.He added: âYou can have 1,000 people come in, and 999 of them are just poor people fleeing oppression and violence, but one of them is an ISIS fighter. If thatâs the case, you have a problem, and there is no way to vet that out.âThe news that one of the bombers may have entered Europe amidst the flood of Middle Eastern refugees has galvanized opponents of Chancellor Angela Merkelâs open-door policy, with critics saying migrants represented a grave security threat.Jeb Bush, whose support for legal status for undocumented immigrants in the U.S. puts him at odds with the mainstream of the Republican Party, said the U.S. had the capacity to screen refugees based on their religion.âWe do that all the time. We do that,â he said on CNN on Sunday. âIt takes almost a year for a refugee to be processed into the United States.”He called for the U.S. to take a âlimited numberâ and to prioritize Christians who are fleeing religiously motivated persecution in Syria.The U.S. is preparing to admit at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next year, a six-fold increase from the number currently in the country, the White House announced in September.Ben Rhodes, deputy national security advisor to President Obama, said the administration had no intention of changing its refugee policy and said it had extensive screening procedures already in place for all Syrian refugees entering the U.S.âThere’s a very careful vetting process that includes our intelligence community, our national Counterterrorism Center, the Department of Homeland Security,â he said on NBC on Sunday.âWe need to sort out how to focus on the terrorists that we need to keep out of the country. But I think we do need to do our part to take those refugees who are in need.â______________________________________________________2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll StandingsPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.

"Here are the week’s top stories.1. Military troops patrolled Paris as France and its allies around the world mourned 129 people killed in coordinated assaults on Friday that unfolded over three hours. More than 350 people were wounded, many seriously. The French president blamed the Islamic State, calling the attacks “an act of war that was prepared, organized and planned from abroad, with complicity from the inside.”_______2. France said three teams carried out the attacks, and ended them by detonating suicide belts. One attacker was identified as a man who used a Syrian passport to enter Europe along with the flow of migrants, another as a French national with a criminal record. Confirmation of the Islamic State’s involvement would mean the group has grown from a regional player in the Syrian conflict into a force waging a global terrorist war in less than two years._______3. World leaders condemned the attacks and many tightened security. President Obama is at the G-20 meeting in Turkey for talks certain to be dominated by the fight against the Islamic State and terrorism in general. The U.S.-led campaign against the group had intensified in recent days in Iraq and Syria, and a bigger push is now likely._______4. A new urgency pulsed through talks on a political solution to Syria’s war. Diplomats from the U.S., France, Russia, Iran and other nations met in Vienna on Saturday, facing knotty divisions on a way forward. Secretary of State John Kerry said the Paris attacks were born of “a kind of medieval and modern fascism at the same time, which has no regard for life, which seeks to destroy and create chaos and disorder and fear.”_______5. The second Democratic debate opened with a long discussion of the Paris attacks. Hillary Clinton deftly spun questions that invited her to blame the Obama administration for allowing the rise of the Islamic State, and defended herself from Bernie Sanders’s onslaughts on her relationship with Wall Street. Martin O’Malley may have had the most discussed single line, calling Donald Trump an “immigrant-bashing carnival barker.”_______6. The Republican candidates paused their criticisms of one another, particularly against Marco Rubio’s switch to a hard line on immigration. They broadly agreed that the U.S. should strengthen its military strategy against the Islamic State, and some proposed sending ground troops._______7. Other developments this week were independent of international terrorism. Turmoil over racial discrimination spread to campuses across the country after protests forced top officials at the University of Missouri system to step down. Some students acknowledged they had felt only subtle signs of discrimination. “What matters,” one protester said, “is that we all need to have empathy for the experiences that people of color have even if we don’t have those experiences for ourselves.”_______8. A Times special report found a thriving U.S. black market that moves guns from states with lax gun laws into those with tougher measures. In New York and New Jersey, which have some of the strictest laws in the country, weapons involved in crimes often arrived via the so-called Iron Pipeline — Interstate 95 and its tributaries — from Virginia, Georgia and Florida._______9. The Swiss foundation that holds the copyright to “The Diary of Anne Frank” has listed her father as a co-author. The diary, by all accounts, remains the words of a young girl hiding from the Nazis with her family. Emphasizing Otto Frank’s contributions of edits and a prologue allows the foundation to extend its copyright from 70 years after her death in 1945 at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp to 70 years after his death in 1980._______10. International sports officials banned Russia from track and field competitions after a report accused Russia of running a state-sponsored doping program. And should the country fail to rapidly demonstrate compliance with anti-doping regulations, the ban could be extended to include the 2016 Olympics in Brazil._______11. President Obama is scheduled to head from the G20 meeting in Turkey to Asia, for a lengthy trip to Malaysia and the Philippines. His agenda will include promoting the Trans-Pacific Partnership and attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Manila on Wednesday._______Your Weekend Briefing is published Sundays at 6 a.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Evening Briefing, weeknights at 6 p.m. Eastern.Want to look back?

"Hillary Clinton should have seen that Wall Street shot coming. Instead, she compounded the damage.The former secretary of state was off to a sound outing in Saturday night’s debate against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland. Friday’s terrorist attacks in Paris dominated at first, allowing her to highlight her superior experience in world affairs. But it was those attacks that made her badly muffed response to questions about her fealty to Wall Street all the more jarring. Here’s the exchange:Mr. Sanders: “I have never heard a candidate, never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military-industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me. I’m going to be independent. Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something. Everybody knows that. Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate. We are relying on small campaign donors, 750,000 of them, 30 bucks apiece. That’s who I’m indebted to.”Mrs. Clinton: “Well John, wait a minute. Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impugn my integrity. Let’s be frank here.”Mr. Sanders: “No, I have not.”Mrs. Clinton: “Oh, wait a minute, senator. You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small. And I’m very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent. So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked. Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.”Predictably, Twitter exploded with demands to know what campaign donations from big banks had to do with New York’s recovery from 9/11.Answer: little to nothing. Since 2001, she and Bill Clinton have earned more than $125 million for speeches, many of the most lucrative made before financial groups.That does not begin to account for the millions of dollars given directly to her campaign, and to political action committees backing her. Nearly 15 years after the 2001 attacks, Mrs. Clinton was earning more than $200,000 for a 20-minute speech. Most of those took place behind guarded doors. But one can guess that she and the financial executives were not still talking about 9/11.Middle-class Americans associate Wall Street with the 2008 meltdown of the economy that cost so many their homes and savings. In the debate Mrs. Clinton repeatedly referred to her plan for reining in banks, but offered precious few specifics. This is what happens when Hillary Clinton the candidate gets complacent. The debate moderator, John Dickerson, had even tipped her off before a commercial break that the next topic was Wall Street.Her effort to tug on Americans’ heartstrings instead of explaining her Wall Street ties — on a day that the scars of 9/11 were exposed anew — was at best botched rhetoric. At worst it was the type of cynical move that Mrs. Clinton would have condemned in Republicans. She should make a fast, thorough effort to explain herself by providing a detailed plan for how she would promote measures protecting middle-class Americans from another financial crisis.",THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"After a good start on national security and terrorism, Hillary Clinton flubbed legitimate questions about her ties to Wall Street on Saturday.",Hillary Clinton Botches Wall Street Questions,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/opinion/hillary-clinton-botches-wall-street-questions.html,['economy'],"['Bill Clinton', 'Bernie Sanders', 'John Dickerson', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Martin O'Malley""""]""",nyt,0.8708710278871227,"[{'author_id': 697, 'fullname': 'the editorial board', 'primary_org': 'nyt'}]",2015-11-15 21:26:52,[],ac1a1d01775534781b522dfa3ead3ef1,2015-11-15 21:45:54.898058
"A women takes a photo while standing on the stage for Saturday night's Democratic presidential debate between Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt,, Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, Friday, Nov. 13, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders needs to slow frontrunner Hillary Clinton’s run toward the party nomination, and Saturday night’s debate might be such an opportunity.The format of the CBS debate, the second of the 2016 cycle for Democratic White House candidates, was reworked after the Paris terror attacks Friday night to focus more on terrorism, national security and foreign policy.Clinton, as a former secretary of state, has more experience with such matters, compared to both Sanders, a Vermont independent, and fellow challenger Martin O’Malley, a former Maryland governor.However, her record as the State Department leader from 2009 to 2013 could also invite moderator questions and candidate attacks Saturday about her handling of the deadly Sept. 11, 2012, terror attacks on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya.Among the concerns, as frequently highlighted by Republicans, are whether Clinton paid enough attention to security concerns raised by Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who was killed in the attacks, and whether she attempted to cover up that the attacks were terror related.Stevens and three other Americans died in the attacks.Clinton will also likely face questions at the debate in Des Moines, Iowa, about her role in the Obama administration’s efforts to eradicate the Islamic State, the increasingly dangerous terror group that has claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks that killed at least 129 people.Clinton leads Sanders 54.7 percent to 33 percent, with O’Malley at a distant 2.7 percent, according to an averaging of polls by the nonpartisan website RealClearPolitics.com.And an Associated Press survey of superdelegates published Friday found that half of the Democratic insiders are publicly backing Clinton, which further secures her nomination efforts.Clinton’s campaign got off to a rough start following revelations about eight months ago that as secretary of state she used a private server and email accounts for official business, which raised questions about whether classified information was compromised.However, the former first lady and New York senator has been on a recent roll, which started with a good first debate in mid-October and was followed about a week later by her well-prepared testimony before a GOP-led special House committee on the Benghazi matter.Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist whose outsider campaign has drawn large crowds and good polling numbers in early-voting states Iowa and New Hampshire, will indeed be free to attack Clinton on foreign policy.However, his focus on such domestic issues as income inequality, affordable college tuition and social justice reform could present problems Saturday if Clinton or the moderators go deep and hard into the foreign policy issues.Sanders may have inadvertently facilitated some of Clinton’s turnaround when in the first debate he seemed to dismiss the controversy over her use of a private email account and server by saying Americans are tired of hearing about her ""damn emails.""But he has since given her no more passes.Though careful never to mention Clinton by name, Sanders has drawn a series of contrasts with the former secretary of State on issues that include her backing of the war in Iraq, trade and the minimum wage.Sanders advisers say he plans to discuss the email issue only if the moderators raise it.  ""He's definitely going to cut a harder contrast on core issues,"" said Larry Cohen, a senior adviser to Sanders, ""But it's not going to be over personal style.""The problem for Sanders is that Clinton agrees with him on some of the core domestic issues of his campaign, having shifted to the left in recent weeks to oppose construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.""His current arguments aren't enough to get beyond his core voter,"" said Gina Glantz, manager of Bill Bradley's 2000 presidential campaign.While Sanders aides bragged about their candidate's lax preparation for the last debate, they shuttled him to his campaign headquarters in Burlington, Vermont, for mock sessions before this match-up. Clinton, too, has kept her schedule relatively clear over the last several days, leaving plenty of time for rehearsals.""They are absolutely prepared for the fact that Bernie's going to come out swinging,"" said Maria Cardona, a Democratic strategist who worked for Clinton's failed 2008 White House campaign, ""The question is how it's going to happen.""Clinton supporters say their candidate will remain focused on laying out her vision for the future rather than striking back at Sanders. Her campaign has about $15.2 million in television advertising planned through mid-February, compared with a $3.2 million Sanders ad buy that ends next week, according to Kantar Media's CMAG advertising tracker.The Service Employees International Union, an influential force in Democratic politics, is expected to issue their endorsement on Tuesday, according to people knowledgeable about the union's process. Clinton has been backed by more than 72 percent of members in all their internal polling, including the most recent survey conducted a few weeks ago.In addition to her success in the first debate and on Capitol Hill, Clinton has benefited from Vice President Joe Biden's decision to forgo a presidential run.O'Malley has questioned Sanders' commitment to the Democratic Party and President Obama, still a popular figure among Democrats.A more aggressive tone would mark a shift for a race that has so far been notable for its civility. Democrats have spent months boasting about the substantive tone of their contest, attempting to set-up a favorable early contrast with the often carnival-like insults of the crowded Republican primary.The Associated Press contributed to this report.         ",,"Democrat presidential challenger Sen.

" (CNN)Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley met for the second Democratic presidential primary debate on Saturday night, an event that finally saw a fight between the front-runner and her chief opponent, but also coming a day after a deadly terror attack that shocked the world. Here are the six key takeaways from the debates:Clinton distanced herself from President Barack Obama's now-controversial comment in an interview Thursday that the U.S. had ""contained ISIS."" During Saturday's debate, Clinton asserted that ISIS ""cannot be contained"" and must simply be ""defeated."" As she has in the past, Clinton also suggested that she had argued ""early on that we needed to find a way to train and equip moderates."" Clinton reportedly argued for a more forceful administration plan to help the Syrian opposition early on in the civil war that has since exploded.RELATED: Hillary Clinton at Democratic debate: ISIS 'cannot be contained'The Vermont senator in the first debate appeared unprepared or unwilling to go after Clinton with any real vigor.But Saturday night, Sanders suggested Clinton is in the pocket of Wall Street and tied her vote to authorize the war in Iraq to the rise of ISIS. Clinton, meanwhile, knocked Sanders on his mixed record on guns and suggested his policy proposals are too simplistic.In the most forceful exchange of the night, Sanders pointed to the millions of dollars in donations Wall Street has funneled to Clinton's campaigns over her political career.""Why over her political career has Wall Street been a major, the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton? Maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so,"" Sanders said. ""I have never heard a candidate, never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street from the military industrial complex, not one candidate -- 'Oh these, these campaign contributions will not influence me.' But why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something, everybody knows that.""RELATED: Democratic debate: CNN's Reality Check team inspects the claimsClinton responded by accusing Sanders of impugning her ""integrity,"" before claiming that Wall Street has supported her because of the work she did to rebuild the Financial District after it was hit in the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center.  As she did in the first debate, Clinton hit Sanders on guns, calling the Vermont senator's vote to shield gun makers from some lawsuits a ""terrible mistake"" and urging Sanders to admit as much, as she has done regarding her Iraq vote.Sanders responded by suggesting there's little daylight between himself and Clinton and O'Malley on guns.Sanders didn't take the gloves off completely during Saturday night's debate in Iowa.Instead, he took a pass on one of the biggest points of contention of the 2016 cycle: Clinton's record as secretary of state.Given a chance to slam Clinton's tenure, Sanders demurred, instead pivoting to his ""disagreement"" with Clinton over her vote in favor of the Iraq War in 2002, more than six years before she became secretary of state.Republicans are already picking apart Clinton's track record as secretary of state, but Sanders' simply wouldn't take the bait.It was reminiscent of Sanders' ""damn emails"" moment in the first Democratic debate, when he said Americans are tired of hearing about the controversy over Clintons' use of personal email during her time as secretary of state.However, Clinton's response to Sanders -- when she beat back the suggestion that she is influenced by Wall Street donors -- could really come back to bite her.Clinton explained her connection to Wall Street by tying her relationship to her role in helping to rebuild New York's financial district after the 9/11 attacks.Twitter was ablaze Saturday night over the response, and the Republican National Committee was quick to blast out a best-of compilation of political observers' reactions.It's not the only moment that could come back to haunt Clinton -- especially if she faces a younger GOP nominee, like Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida.Clinton at one point said she is ""from the '60s"" -- a moment in the debate that could be replayed in political ads down the line suggesting she is part of the past, not the future, of American leadership.The debate Saturday night began with the candidates pausing on stage, taking a moment of silence to remember the victims of the terrorist attacks that ripped Paris apart just a day earlier.  Clinton said while ""our prayers are with the people of France tonight...that is not enough"" and called for better coordinated efforts to root out ISIS, the radical group that claimed responsibility. She said Americans should see the terrorist attack as a reminder that the election ""is not only about electing a president, it's also about choosing our next commander in chief.""Sanders made brief note of the terrorist attacks at the top of his opening statement, but quickly pivoted to the core message of the campaign: ""a rigged economy"" that benefits billionaires.Still, Sanders made a bold claim in his reference to Paris: ""Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarist (sic) organization called ISIS.""And O'Malley, after saying his heart goes out ""to the people of France in this moment of loss,"" quickly called for ""fresh thinking"" and ""new approaches"" -- a definitive nod to his youth and the generational contrast the  52-year-old offers to Clinton's 68 years and Sanders' 74.All three candidates refused to say the fight was with radical Islam, instead focusing on using the word ""jihadist"" to describe the threats spotlighted in the Paris attacks. RELATED: Clinton calls out 'radical jihadist ideology'O'Malley delivered several strong one-liners throughout the night, notably when he slammed Republican front-runner Donald Trump as a ""carnival barker"" for his immigration policies.But O'Malley also missed a couple of key moments where he could have shined. His central contention is that it's time for a new generation of leadership -- meaning no more baby boomers like Clinton. But he lacked a strong, convincing response to one of the debate's final questions: When have you been most tested in your life, and how did it prepare you for the presidency? O'Malley's response conceded that he is untested -- that nothing he's been through as mayor of Baltimore or governor of Maryland comes close to the crises he would face as President.Trump later responded to O'Malley's insult on Twitter by calling him a ""clown.""
