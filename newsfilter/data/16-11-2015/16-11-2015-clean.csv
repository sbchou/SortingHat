" For Bernie Sanders, it was a missed opportunity. The second Democratic debate was a high stakes chance for him to blunt Hillary Clinton’s resurgence at one of the more crucial times in the Democratic contest for president.But while Clinton did find herself on the defensive over foreign policy and terrorism, the challenges came largely from the moderators. Sanders failed to deliver in small and large ways at the Democratic presidential debate Saturday that would have either cast positive attention on him or negative attention on her.It’s a dynamic that explains why she’s pulling comfortably ahead of him in the Democratic race and likely to remain there in the critical weeks to come. After the terrorist attack in Paris hours before, Americans expected to hear about foreign policy and more specifically how the candidates planned to fight the Islamic State which took responsibility for killing more than 100 people. But when Sanders in his opening statement was asked to share his thoughts on the attacks, he uttered a mere two sentences on terrorism – totaling about 20 seconds – before quickly switching back to his standard stump speech.“I’m running for president because as I go around this nation I talk to a lotta people,” he said. “And what I hear is people concerned that the economy we have is a rigged economy.”The abrupt switch from terrorism as well as his claim that climate change is the greatest threat to national security seemed out of place as the Paris attacks dominated the world’s attention.Climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism. And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say yo're gonna see countries all over the world...yo're gonna see all kinds of international conflict, Bernie SandersSanders’ problems with the debate began even before the candidates walked on stage. His campaign spent hours refuting published reports that aides were angry about changes in the format to reflect the Paris attacks. Clinton supporters flooded social media saying anyone who couldn’t change topics based on world events couldn’t handle being president.The independent senator from Vermont has surprised political observers, even himself, with his popularity in the contest that has translated to large crowds and millions of dollars in contributions. But he needs to do something more if he expects to compete with Clinton for the nomination.With the candidates not debating again for five more weeks, the debate was perhaps his best hope to blunt her rise in the polls. He did provide several strong answers, particularly on reining in Wall Street and ridding politics of unaccountable money. But to get ahead he needed to criticize her, something he and his aides repeatedly say he’s not comfortable with. EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIMWhen asked if he had any criticism in the way Clinton performed as secretary of state, Sanders spoke vaguely about “regime change,” saying forcing leadership changes in some countries are not always beneficial while he barely mentioned her or explained that she has supported such moves. EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIMSanders instead found himself agreeing with her more than once.“I agree with much of what the secretary said,” he said about terrorism.“The secretary’s obviously right,” he said on her assessment of the Middle East. Sanders did manage to criticize her more than he did in their first debate in October.He forcefully went after her for voting to authorize the invasion of Iraq in 2003 as a senator, saying it created instability that led to the rise of the Islamic State.“I don’t think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the level of instability that we have now,” he said. “That is one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the history of the United States.”Clinton acknowledged once again that she made a mistake on the Iraq war. But she then called on him to acknowledge his mistake on a vote he cast to grant immunity to gun manufacturers and dealers from liability if their firearms are used criminally. That was a terrible mistake. It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate, legislators not just in Washington but across the country, Hillary Clinton.He didn’t and instead delivered a muddled answer. “We will talk of that bill which I agree with parts, I disagree – I am certainly absolutely willing to look at that bill and make sure – and not a form of the bill,” he said.EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIMHe also failed to focus on what political observers consider one of his best lines of attacks – accusing Clinton of flipping on policy positions. EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIMIf all else failed, Sanders could have used the emails. Clinton has been under fire using a personal email system while secretary of state.Sanders gave her pass on the issue in the first debate – saying Americans are “sick and tired” about hearing about her emails. But he said later he wasn’t dismissing concerns and that there are “valid questions.”Then on Saturday, he said he really hadn’t changed his mind and that the way his remarks were misinterpreted was “just media stuff.”“I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email,” he said. “I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email.” EDITORS: STORY CAN END HEREClinton was pleased with that statement. “I agree completely.”Anita Kumar: 202-383-6017, @anitakumar01",,"Senator agrees with former secretary of state, declines to criticize her at times in debateSanders again decides not to attack Clinton for her use of personal email for government workTiming is crucial as Democrats will not debate again for five weeks…Click to Continue »",Sanders’ failure to score in debates helping Clinton pull away,http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article44984622.html,['foreign policy/national security'],"['Bernie Sanders', 'Anita Kumar', 'Hillary Clinton']",mcclatchy,0.5350968740541836,"[{'author_id': 33912, 'fullname': 'anita kumar', 'primary_org': 'mcclatchy'}]",2015-11-15 14:42:00,[],36ede6409cbd19b605ca188c967d2a81,2015-11-15 15:00:06.457603

(REUTERS/Jim Young)PreviousNextHillary Clinton faced tough criticism Saturday night from her Democratic rivals over everything from her Middle East policies to her swaying stance on gun control to her Wall Street ties, at a debate that saw both Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley step up their attacks on the party’s front-runner.The former secretary of state was put on the defensive almost immediately, as she was challenged by her rivals -- and the moderator -- over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability. Vermont Sen. Sanders ripped her support for “regime change.”  But while the Paris terror attacks the night before shifted the early presidential debate focus to national security, the candidates sparred aggressively in the latter half over domestic issues – especially financial industry reform and Clinton’s Wall Street support.Former Maryland Gov. O’Malley called her the “candidate of Wall Street.”Asked about her hefty Wall Street-backed speaking fees and donations, Clinton defended her independence in being able to pursue financial industry reform.But Sanders shot back, “Not good enough.”“Let's not be naive about it. Why …has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?” he said. “You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.”He and O’Malley, unlike Clinton, both want to re-instate a Depression-era banking law known as Glass-Steagall – and they both criticized Clinton’s Wall Street plans as not going far enough. O’Malley called it “weak tea.”In an eyebrow-raising moment, Clinton countered Sanders’ criticism of her Wall Street donations by saying that as New York senator, she helped “rebuild” Wall Street and downtown Manhattan after 9/11.Clinton was later asked about social media reaction claiming she had invoked 9/11 to justify financial industry donations; Clinton said she’s sorry that anyone had that “impression.”Meanwhile, she said she doesn’t think her rivals’ financial industry plans – particularly to reinstate the Depression-era law that separated investment and commercial banking – would get the job done.“I'm all about making sure we actually get results,” Clinton said.The debate in Des Moines, Iowa, came in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which thrust the issues of national security and foreign policy back to the center of the 2016 campaign. The format of the debate – hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register -- was changed to focus anew on those issues in the beginning.Clinton tried to highlight her deep experience in foreign policy issues from the outset.“This election is not only about electing a president. It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief,” she said.But, citing the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa, Clinton’s rivals soon turned to her record as U.S. senator and later as secretary of state to question her judgment in foreign policy matters.O’Malley appeared to criticize her support for toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.He said America’s role is not to roam the world “looking for new dictators to topple.” He said it is also important to understand “secondary and third consequences” that come after removing a “single dictator.” O’Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a “mess.”Clinton defended her support for ousting Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a “genocide” and America’s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support. And to O’Malley’s critique, she said, “I don’t think you can paint with a broad brush” in an “incredibly complicated region of the world.”Sanders, meanwhile, referenced Clinton’s Senate vote for the use of force in Iraq and said the “disastrous invasion” led “to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.” The senator also claimed that “climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.”Clinton again called her Iraq war vote a “mistake,” but disputed that the war is the only driver of modern terrorism.She and O’Malley briefly sparred over America’s role in fighting ISIS. After Clinton said it “cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential,” O’Malley said, “This actually is America’s fight,” though not “solely” America’s fight.Sanders staked out a different position in saying it is the nations in the region that “have to get their hands dirty.”“Those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort,” he said.The candidates declined to categorize the threat itself as “radical Islam.” Asked about that categorization, Clinton said only, “I don’t think we’re at war with Islam.”All the candidates on stage condemned the Paris terror attacks and vowed to take on the threat of terror.“It cannot be contained. It must be defeated,” Clinton said of ISIS, appearing to distance herself from President Obama, who hours before the Paris attacks claimed ISIS was “contained.”The attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said. It brought the issue of terrorism to the forefront of both party’s presidential primary races. Ostensibly, it is an area where Clinton enters with the thickest resume – but also one that could, as the debate showed, prove problematic given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable nations like Libya and Syria.While the tragedy hung over the debate, the candidates were able to tackle of range of domestic issues including wages and immigration.O’Malley landed virtually the only shot of the night against Republican candidate Donald Trump, a favorite target of the Democrats, by calling him an “immigrant-bashing carnival barker.” The Democratic candidates generally agree on the call for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the country.Sanders, meanwhile, continued to advocate for a $15 minimum wage.But the candidates were divided on gun control. While Clinton has tried in the past to cast Sanders as soft on the issue, O’Malley accused Clinton of being “on three sides of this.”“When you ran in 2000, you said we needed federal robust regulations, then in 2008 you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying we don't need those regulations ... and now you’re coming back around here,” he said.The debate was notable in that it saw Sanders and O’Malley taking a more aggressive tone against the front-runner, who seemed to have strengthened her hand since their initial debate.Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O’Malley. She also made it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and saw one of her biggest potential political threats – a late bid by Vice President Biden – disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.Sanders remains Clinton’s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.Still, the FBI investigation over Clinton’s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding. Sanders appeared to give her a pass on the email issue at the first debate by saying he was tired of hearing about the controversy.Sanders, though, stood by his comments at the second debate Saturday night: “I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email, I’m still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email. … Let’s go to the major issues facing America.” ",,,"DEMOCRATIC DEBATE  Clinton hit by rivals over Mideast, Wall Street ties",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/15/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate/,"['foreign policy/national security', 'immigration']","[u""Martin O'Malley"", 'Jim Young', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Donald Trump', 'Muammar Qaddafi', 'Bernie Sanders']",fox,0.9973633621405877,[],2015-11-15 06:03:37,"['Senate', 'Al Qaeda', 'FBI']",e310bbfc28aa65b4735b170dc3b6246a,2015-11-15 07:00:04.156895
" (AP) â A day after deadly terrorist attacks in Paris, Hillary Rodham Clinton cast herself as the country's strongest commander in chief in a scary world, even as she defended her own role in the rise of Islamic militants.""This election is not only about electing a president, it's also about choosing our next commander in chief,"" Clinton declared Saturday night in the Democrats' second debate of the presidential campaign. ""All of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.""Amid the backdrop of global anxiety, Clinton found herself fending off questions about not only her foreign policy record but her economic ties, with both Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley painting the former senator from New York as a lackey for Wall Street and corporate interests.""Let's not be naive about it,"" said Sanders, noting that Clinton collected millions in campaign donations from Wall Street bankers. ""They expect to get something. Everybody knows that.""The barbs marked a far more aggressive shift in a primary race that has been notable in part for its civility compared to the Republican contest.Since the Democrats' first debate a month ago, Clinton has built a lead in the early voting states, gains that have come amid other signs the party is coalescing behind her. But the nomination fight is far from over.On Saturday night, Clinton faced criticism of her national security record, when Sanders traced the current instability in the Middle East to the U.S. Senate's vote â including Clinton's â to authorize military action in Iraq in 2002. He said that U.S. invasion ""unraveled the region.""The former secretary of state fought back, saying terrorism has been erupting for decades. She rejected the idea that she and the rest of the Obama administration underestimated the growing threat of the Islamic State group.The back-and-forth revealed a foreign policy split within the Democratic Party, with Sanders playing to the anti-war activists who boosted then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama to the presidential nomination in 2008.Sanders argued for a far more hands-off approach, advocating for Muslim countries to lead the fight and declaring that the war against Islamic State militants is about the ""soul of Islam.""Clinton has a history of advocating for more robust involvement across the globe â both as a presidential candidate eight years ago and as Obama's secretary of state. In recent weeks, she has called for a more aggressive U.S. role in the Syrian conflict, including a no-fly zone over the area, a move the Obama administration opposes.The debate began with a moment of silence followed by the previously unplanned foreign policy questions. All the candidates denounced the attacks, but they gave some fodder to their Republican rivals who coupled condemnation of the Paris attacks with sharp criticism for Obama and Clinton.All three Democrats criticized the term ""radical Islam"" used by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and other Republican candidates as unnecessarily offensive to American Muslims.""We are at war with violent extremism, we are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression,"" said Clinton. ""I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.""GOP candidates immediately seized on the remarks. ""Yes, we are at war with radical Islamic terrorism,"" tweeted former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.The debate pivoted to economic issues, in a conversation that revealed how Sanders' liberal message has helped shift the party to the left on some economic issues.All three agreed that wealthy citizens and corporations should pay more in taxes to benefit the middle class. They tangled over how high to increase the minimum wage, with Clinton backing a $12-per-hour federal floor while Sanders and O'Malley said $15 an hour. And they fought over the degree to which they would curtail large financial institutions, with Sanders describing Wall Street's business model as ""greed and fraud"" â a startling judgment for a major presidential candidate.""I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,"" joked Sanders, saying the 1950s-era president backed a 90 percent marginal tax rate.Clinton defended her relationship with Wall Street, citing her work in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but her statement met with blowback from Republicans who accused her of politicizing the terrorist assaults.While Clinton is wary of alienating Sanders backers whose support she'll need should she win the nomination, she did take a few shots. She attempted to cast some of Sanders' major proposals, including a single-payer health care system and free college, as politically unrealistic.""The revolution never came,"" she said, in a knock on his call for a ""political revolution.""Sanders may have inadvertently helped her in the first debate, when he seemed to dismiss the controversy over her use of a private email account and server by saying Americans are tired of hearing about her ""damn emails.""Saturday night, Sanders declined once again to attack: ""I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email,"" he said.""I agree completely,"" said Clinton, with a laugh.___Lisa Lerer reported from Washington.

"Here are the week’s top stories.1. Military troops patrolled Paris as France and its allies around the world mourned 129 people killed in coordinated assaults on Friday that unfolded over three hours. More than 350 people were wounded, many seriously. The French president blamed the Islamic State, calling the attacks “an act of war that was prepared, organized and planned from abroad, with complicity from the inside.”_______2. France said three teams carried out the attacks, and ended them by detonating suicide belts. One attacker was identified as a man who used a Syrian passport to enter Europe along with the flow of migrants, another as a French national with a criminal record. Confirmation of the Islamic State’s involvement would mean the group has grown from a regional player in the Syrian conflict into a force waging a global terrorist war in less than two years._______3. World leaders condemned the attacks and many tightened security. President Obama is at the G-20 meeting in Turkey for talks certain to be dominated by the fight against the Islamic State and terrorism in general. The U.S.-led campaign against the group had intensified in recent days in Iraq and Syria, and a bigger push is now likely._______4. A new urgency pulsed through talks on a political solution to Syria’s war. Diplomats from the U.S., France, Russia, Iran and other nations met in Vienna on Saturday, facing knotty divisions on a way forward. Secretary of State John Kerry said the Paris attacks were born of “a kind of medieval and modern fascism at the same time, which has no regard for life, which seeks to destroy and create chaos and disorder and fear.”_______5. The second Democratic debate opened with a long discussion of the Paris attacks. Hillary Clinton deftly spun questions that invited her to blame the Obama administration for allowing the rise of the Islamic State, and defended herself from Bernie Sanders’s onslaughts on her relationship with Wall Street. Martin O’Malley may have had the most discussed single line, calling Donald Trump an “immigrant-bashing carnival barker.”_______6. The Republican candidates paused their criticisms of one another, particularly against Marco Rubio’s switch to a hard line on immigration. They broadly agreed that the U.S. should strengthen its military strategy against the Islamic State, and some proposed sending ground troops._______7. Other developments this week were independent of international terrorism. Turmoil over racial discrimination spread to campuses across the country after protests forced top officials at the University of Missouri system to step down. Some students acknowledged they had felt only subtle signs of discrimination. “What matters,” one protester said, “is that we all need to have empathy for the experiences that people of color have even if we don’t have those experiences for ourselves.”_______8. A Times special report found a thriving U.S. black market that moves guns from states with lax gun laws into those with tougher measures. In New York and New Jersey, which have some of the strictest laws in the country, weapons involved in crimes often arrived via the so-called Iron Pipeline — Interstate 95 and its tributaries — from Virginia, Georgia and Florida._______9. The Swiss foundation that holds the copyright to “The Diary of Anne Frank” has listed her father as a co-author. The diary, by all accounts, remains the words of a young girl hiding from the Nazis with her family. Emphasizing Otto Frank’s contributions of edits and a prologue allows the foundation to extend its copyright from 70 years after her death in 1945 at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp to 70 years after his death in 1980._______10. International sports officials banned Russia from track and field competitions after a report accused Russia of running a state-sponsored doping program. And should the country fail to rapidly demonstrate compliance with anti-doping regulations, the ban could be extended to include the 2016 Olympics in Brazil._______11. President Obama is scheduled to head from the G20 meeting in Turkey to Asia, for a lengthy trip to Malaysia and the Philippines. His agenda will include promoting the Trans-Pacific Partnership and attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Manila on Wednesday._______Your Weekend Briefing is published Sundays at 6 a.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Evening Briefing, weeknights at 6 p.m. Eastern.Want to look back?

"The fight against global terrorism will take center stage Saturday night when Democrats gather in Iowa to debate after the gruesome attacks in Paris that laid bare the kinds of threats the next American president will face.A month after the Democratic presidential candidates clashed on gun control and financial regulations in their first debate, which focused largely on domestic and economic issues, they are expected to face more questions on foreign policy and national security. Hours after the deadly attacks, CBS News, a co-host of the event, said it would refocus the debate to give candidates an opportunity to discuss how they would respond to such an international crisis.Despite the tragic nature of the events, the new backdrop represents an opportunity for Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former secretary of state, to shine at a moment when her two remaining rivals, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Martin O’Malley — neither of whom has much foreign policy experience — will be under pressure to blunt her momentum.Since Mrs. Clinton’s crisp debate performance in October, her poll numbers have surged, she weathered hours of congressional questioning about her handling of the Benghazi attacks, and three of her rivals for the nomination have dropped out.“It will be interesting to see if Secretary Clinton can keep doing what she’s been doing,” said Brad Anderson, who was President Obama’s 2012 state director in Iowa. “Her steadiness is why you’re seeing her poll numbers continue to increase, especially when you look at what’s happening on the other side of the aisle.”A New York Times/CBS News survey released this week showed Mrs. Clinton continuing to dominate the race, with more than half of Democratic primary voters backing her and 62 percent thinking she is the candidate who can bring about change in Washington. The shift in the debate’s emphasis to foreign affairs should allow Mrs. Clinton to highlight her deep experience on the international stage, providing an opportunity to extend her advantage.For Mrs. Clinton’s opponents, the debate presents a chance to tell voters otherwise, and her Senate votes and handling of international crises as a senator and a diplomat could come under scrutiny.Still, the event is not expected to resemble the free-for-all atmosphere that has marked Republican debates, which have featured sharp exchanges and personal attacks. While the Republican primary contest is a crowded affair, the Democrats will have considerably more time to make their cases and delve into more detailed policy arguments on Saturday with just three candidates on the stage. Since the last debate, Lincoln Chafee, the former governor of Rhode Island, and former Senator Jim Webb of Virginia have dropped out of the race. Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard professor who was running as a Democrat but was not included in the last debate, also stopped his campaign.Mr. Sanders will get another opportunity to take a harder line against Mrs. Clinton, after he dismissed the controversy surrounding her use of a private email server as secretary of state and largely avoided attacking her directly in their first face-off. He has been preparing sharper lines against Mrs. Clinton on issues like trade, gun control and her emails, and his advisers say he has been studying her record more closely since their October meeting.Democratic strategists say the debate will also be a significant moment for Mr. O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, whose poll numbers lag in the low single digits. Facing Mrs. Clinton’s star power and the grass-roots support behind Mr. Sanders, Mr. O’Malley needs to find a way to capture some of the spotlight.“It’s the play that he has left in his playbook right now, to come out swinging and let people know he’s not just this nice guy and that he can be tough,” said Kevin Geiken, a Democratic political consultant for Bluprint Strategies.Still, it will be a challenge to rattle Mrs. Clinton, who has lurched to the left on issues like trade and the environment while showing a deft ability to repel criticism of her 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq war and her warm relationship with Wall Street.One area on the domestic front that is likely to come up is the issue of criminal justice reform, which the three candidates have been struggling to address after continuing tension between the police and African-Americans.DeRay Mckesson, a leader of the Black Lives Matter movement, said he had a good sense of the plans from Mr. Sanders and Mr. O’Malley, but had not heard a comprehensive proposal on the issue of criminal justice from Mrs. Clinton, despite her meetings with the group.“She’s been eking it out literally one speech at a time,” Mr. McKesson said. “With Hillary, I only have a surface-level understanding. The debate is a chance to learn what she really thinks about the core issues.”But voters will only learn if they tune in. Some political enthusiasts have complained that because of its Saturday night time slot, the two-hour debate, which will be hosted by CBS News and The Des Moines Register and begin at 9 p.m. Eastern time, may not have the audience of previous events that have drawn millions of viewers.Mr. Anderson, the Iowa strategist, noted that the candidates would convene at the same time that the undefeated Iowa Hawkeyes take on the Minnesota Golden Gophers in college football.“The majority of Iowans will be planning their day around that football game,” he said.",ALAN RAPPEPORT,The fight against global terrorism will take center stage after attacks in Paris that laid bare the kinds of threats the next American president will face.,Democratic Debate Has an Unplanned Theme: Terrorism,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/us/politics/democratic-debate-cbs.html,['racial issues'],"['Timothy Anderson', 'Lawrence Lessig', u""Martin O'Malley"", 'Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Jim Webb', 'Brad Anderson', 'Bernie Sanders', 'Lincoln Chafee']",nyt,0.9148687153485446,"[{'author_id': 8381, 'fullname': 'alan rappeport', 'primary_org': 'nyt'}]",2015-11-15 00:33:01,['Senate'],b770967da0ca9ceede7aa3742385563f,2015-11-15 01:00:52.953328
" With the terrible tragedy in Paris Friday, the focus of the second Democratic debate on CBS changed correctly from the economy and domestic issues, to national security and immigration. However, the bickering back and forth between the two candidates going nowhere and the probable nominee -- Mrs. Clinton, really got off the subject very quickly.Hillary said she would be tougher than President Obama. I don't doubt that she will be but that's a pretty low bar.Bernie Sanders, in spite of Friday's terror attacks in Paris, still thinks climate warming is the world’s greatest problem and the root of all evil.Martin O’Malley is prepared to become president because he led Baltimore for 8 years as mayor and the greatest state in the country, Maryland for another four as governor. He must have forgotten that we all got to watch Baltimore explode on national TV a few months back.Sanders thinks Hillary is owned by Wall Street and the Super-PACS and can't be trusted. After hearing O’Malley brag about everything he did in Maryland, I don't know why everyone wouldn't want to live there.The overall message of the night was the Democrats agree on most things. Including, if they would be honest, that Hillary's going to be the nominee. His great strength is that he looks like he could play a president in a TV show like “House of Cards.”  But in reality, he's lucky the Democrats don't have a junior varsity table or he'd be sitting there by himself.The overall message of the night was the Democrats agree on most things. Including, if they would be honest, that Hillary's going to be the nominee.On policy there is little disagreement. First they still believe in redistribution of wealth (the Robin Hood Theory). The rich are too rich and need to pay more in taxes. The upper limit was not quite the 90%  rate in the Eisenhower administration but close (thank you, Bernie Sanders) to certainly a much higher rate for the upper income earners.The middle class is not what it used to be so therefore the government must do something to change all this.The banks and the drug companies and the insurance companies are too big and they are all bad guys so we must regulate them and watch out for them cheating or getting rich.We need more free programs paid for by tax payers. Free public college education for all.To Hillary's credit she didn't buy into this because she doesn't want taxpayers to pay to educate Donald Trump’s kids.Still, there was lots of talk about free health care for all and cheap drugs, too.Who is going to pay for all this? The rich guys, of course.On immigration, we should just let the 11 million immigrants who are here illegally stay because they've been here a long time.Sanders , the avowed Socialist, who represents Vermont, the second smallest state in the Union, kept talking about how great Canada is. Maybe that's because Canada just elected a socialist prime minister.He did waffle on guns a little from the Democratic  position but I am sure that's because nearly every voter in Vermont owns a couple of them.The hardest working guy in the room was John Dickerson, who was the CBS moderator. His biggest task was making sure CBS got its commercial breaks every 10 minutes. About half way through, I confess, I realized that I can't wait for the next “Trump Invitational” as the Republican debates are sometimes called. At least they are not dull! This one was so dull, the network ended it 7 minutes early!   Edward J. Rollins is a Fox News contributor. He is a former assistant to President Reagan and he managed his reelection campaign.

" With the deadly terrorist attacks in Paris as a somber backdrop, three Democratic presidential candidates squared off in Des Moines, Ia., Saturday night in the party’s second 2016 debate.Sometimes the statements made by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley on foreign policy and domestic issues rang true; sometimes their remarks didn’t coincide with the facts. For instance:Sanders criticized Clinton for her support for the Iraq war, saying the was has led to the current instability in the region. Hillary Clinton voted for authorizing the war in Iraq in 2002, which she has since said she regrets. It became an obstacle for her 2008 presidential campaign. In 2006, she said, ""Obviously, if we knew then what we know now, there wouldn't have been a vote, and I certainly wouldn't have voted for it."" Clinton said that Americans spend more than anyone else in the world on prescription drugs. A PBS report last year found that “the United States spends almost $1,000 per person per year on pharmaceuticals. That’s around 40 percent more than the next highest spender, Canada, and more than twice as much as than countries like France and Germany spend.” Sanders aid that Americans spend more on health care than anyone else in the world. This appears to be true, according to a Commonwealth Fund report last year. “The United States health care system is the most expensive in the world, but this report and prior editions consistently show the U.S. under-performs relative to other countries on most dimensions of performance,"" it found. Sanders said climate change contributed to global terrorism and attributed the claim to the CIA. ""Climate change is directly related to the rise of global terrorism,"" the senator said. ""This is what the CIA says.""In a Department of Defense release last year, then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said climate change is a ""trend that will affect national security. Rising global temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, climbing sea levels and more extreme weather events will intensify the challenges of global instability, hunger, poverty and conflict."" O'Malley made a similar connection between climate change and terrorism last September. Politifact rated the claim as ""Mostly True."" It said the drought in Syria – which limited resources – was not the ""sole culprit,"" but rather ""one of many factors that led to the Syrian conflict."" The article stated that Syrian President Bashar Assad's ""recruitment of al Qaida members"" and Sunni Arab genocide are more ""direct"" and ""crystal clear"" causes.Vera Bergengruen, Tori Whitley Iana Kozelsky and David Goldstein contributed.",,"With the deadly terrorist attacks in Paris as a somber backdrop, three Democratic presidential candidates squared off in Des Moines, Ia., Saturday night in the party’s second 2016 debate.

"!--StartFragment-->Jeb Bush has bought his struggling presidential campaign more time, even as Marco Rubio threatens to siphon off the financing that is the lifeblood of his 2016 aspirations.The former Florida governor delivered a solid, issues-oriented performance Tuesday in the latest Republican debate, which calmed top Bush donors and bundlers who had become disenchanted with the direction of his campaign.

" (AP) â The Democratic presidential candidates are debating for the second time in the 2016 nomination contest, this time in Des Moines.The latest developments (all times local):___8:32 p.m.The Republican candidates for president are jumping on the refusal of the Democratic candidates to say the words ""radical Islam"" at their debate.Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tweets, ""Yes, we are at war with radical Islamic terrorism.""Rick Santorum adds on Twitter, ""@HillaryClinton how can we defeat our enemy if we cannot identify who they are and what motivates them?""___8:30 p.m.All three Democratic presidential candidates are declining to use the term ""radical Islam"" at the party's second debate, a description used by many of their Republican rivals.Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton says, ""I don't think we are at war with Islam. ... I think we're at war with jihadists.""She adds that ""it's not particularly helpful"" to use language that alienates many Muslims, and she notes that Republican President George W. Bush made a similar point after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says, ""I don't think the term is important."" He says the more important issue is the ""entire world coming together"" to defeat militants.Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley says using the term ""radical Islam"" is unnecessarily offensive to Muslims in America. He says he prefers ""radical jihadists"" and describes them as a group that is ""perverting the name of a major world religion.""___8:25 p.m.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says countries in the Middle East must get more involved in the fight against the Islamic State.During a foreign policy discussion during the second Democratic debate, Sanders calls the current conflict a ""war for the soul of Islam.""He says that other Muslim countries in the region will need to get ""deeply involved"" and lead the effort. He mentions Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey and Jordan by name.Hillary Rodham Clinton calls the comment ""unfair"" to some counties, in particular Jordan. She says Jordan has ""put a lot on the line"" for the United States.But Clinton says she agrees that Turkey and the Gulf nations should decide if they will stand with the United States against ""this kind of jihadi radicalism.""___8:20 p.m.Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley says simply toppling dictators is not a suitable foreign policy for the 21st century, referring to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.O'Malley is attempting to draw a contrast with former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on foreign policy during the second Democratic debate.He says Syria, Libya and Afghanistan are ""a mess"" and that the United States isn't doing enough to build stable democracies after toppling dictators.He says the United States needs better ""human intelligence"" on the ground to understand what actors will step up to fill the void after dictators fall.___8:17 p.m.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is criticizing former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's vote as a New York senator for the resolution to allow the 2003 invasion of Iraq.Sanders says, ""I don't think any sensible person"" would have supported the use-of-force resolution.He calls the invasion ""the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of the United States.""Clinton has said the 2002 vote was a mistake, but says there were acts leading up to the invasion that suggested Islamic extremists had struck at U.S. installations.___8:15 p.m.Hillary Rodham Clinton is defending the Obama administration's initial approach to the rise of Islamic State, including her actions as secretary of state.Clinton rejects the notion that she underestimated the militants, and she blames their rise on leaders in the Middle East and names former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.Clinton says al-Maliki did not do enough to maintain stability in Iraq once the U.S. turned over control of the nation.She adds that she did advocate that the U.S. do more to ""train and equip moderates"" in Syria, which has since fallen into civil war.___8:10 p.m.A look at the opening statements from the second presidential Democratic debate.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders begins with sharp language for the Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for the attack in Paris.He says, ""Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization.""But Sanders also pivots from the attacks to the economic issues that are the focus of his campaign.Front-runner and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton keeps to the attacks in her statement, saying ""our prayers are with the people of France tonight.""She adds: ""But that is not enough. We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical, Jihadist ideology that motivates organizations ISIS.""Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley touts his executive experience in his opening remarks, and says the U.S. needs ""new thinking"" and ""new leadership"" to respond to threats like those posed by the Islamic State.___8 p.m.The second debate of the Democratic campaign for president is underway, and it's starting with a moment of silence for the victims of the attacks in Paris.A coordinated gun-and-suicide bombing attack tore across Paris on Friday, leaving at least 129 people dead and 352 injured. It marked the deadliest violence on French soil since World War II.French President Francois Hollande has vowed that his country will wage ""merciless"" war on the Islamic State group, which claimed responsibility for the carnage.The candidates will each make an opening statement before the debate's first section focuses on the attacks and foreign policy.___7:45 p.m.The Democratic candidates for president are gathering for the party's second debate of the 2016 campaign, a meeting that will take place in the shadow of the attacks in Paris.The campaigns have tangled with debate host CBS over the format of the debate in the hours before the debate.When CBS said on a conference call with the campaigns that it wanted to focus the opening statement and the first section of the debate on the Paris attacks, the campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders vigorously disagreed.That's according to a participant on the call, who spoke on condition of anonymity and was not authorized to speak publicly.Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver says the key issue is a proposal to shorten the opening statements from 90 seconds to 30 seconds in order to move quickly to questions in a debate unfolding a day after the Paris attacks.The Vermont senator's campaign says it successfully argued on behalf of the longer opening statements, which all three candidates will deliver.The debate will begin with a moment of silence in memory of the victims of the attacks.â By Ken Thomas.",,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — The Democratic presidential candidates are debating for the second time in the 2016 nomination contest, this time in Des Moines.",The Latest: Democratic 2016 candidates meet for 2nd debate,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-11-14-US-DEM-2016-Debate-The-Latest/id-d9be7b6490fd46ddb01521463c80ddce,['foreign policy/national security'],"['Rick Santorum', 'Jeff Weaver', u""Martin O'Malley"", 'Francois Hollande', 'Jeb Bush', 'Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'George W.

" (AP) â With the country still reeling from deadly terrorist attacks in Paris, Hillary Rodham Clinton cast herself as America's strongest leader in a scary world, even as she found herself forced to defend her own role during the rise of the Islamic State militants.""This election is not only about electing a president, it's also about choosing our next commander in chief,"" Clinton said Saturday night in the Democrats' second debate of the presidential campaign. ""All of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.""Amid the backdrop of global anxiety, Clinton found herself fending off questions about not only her foreign policy record but her economic ties, with both Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley painting the former senator from New York as a lackey for Wall Street and corporate interests.""Let's not be naive about it,"" said Sanders, noting that Clinton collected millions in campaign donations from Wall Street bankers. ""They expect to get something. Everybody knows that.""The barbs marked a far more aggressive shift in a primary race that has so far been notable for its civility. Democrats have spent months boasting about the substantive tone of their contest, attempting to set up a favorable early contrast with the ""carnival barker"" insults of the crowded Republican primary.Clinton faced criticism of her national security record, when Sanders traced the current instability in the Middle East to the U.S. Senate's vote â including Clinton's â to authorize military action in Iraq in 2002. He said that U.S. invasion ""unraveled the region.""The former secretary of state fought back, saying terrorism has been erupting for decades, specifically mentioning the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. She said the recent unrest in Libya and other parts of the Middle East is symptomatic of an ""arc of instability from North Africa to Afghanistan.""She rejected the idea that she and the rest of the Obama administration underestimated the growing threat of the Islamic State.The back-and-forth revealed a foreign policy split within the Democratic Party, with Sanders playing to the anti-war activists who boosted then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama to victory in 2008.Sanders argued for a far more hands-off approach, advocating for Muslim countries to lead the fight and declaring that the war against Islamic State militants is about the ""soul of Islam.""Clinton has a history of advocating for more robust involvement across the globe â both as a presidential candidate eight years ago and as Obama's secretary of state. In recent weeks, she has called for a more aggressive U.S. role in the Syrian conflict, including a no-fly zone over the area, a move the Obama administration opposes. But she stood by her opposition to seeking a formal declaration of war against the Islamic State.Foreign relations is an area where Clinton, as a former secretary of state, is in the strongest position to talk about the attacks and the U.S. effort to dismantle the Islamic State group. But she is vulnerable, too, her tenure tied to that of Obama, who's struggled to contain the threat from Islamic militants in Syria and associated terror attacks across the globe.The candidates were meeting in the shadow of the Paris attacks that killed at least 129 and wounded at least 352 people. The debate began with a solemn tone, with a moment of silence followed by previously unplanned foreign policy questions.All the candidates denounced the attacks, the first time the Democratic field spoke about the incidents.They gave some fodder to their Republican critics, who coupled condemnation of the Paris attacks during the day with sharp criticism for Obama and his former secretary of state, Clinton.""We are at war with violent extremism, we are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression,"" said Clinton, arguing the U.S. is not at war with Islam or all Muslims. ""I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.""Sanders and O'Malley agreed with her sentiments, saying the term ""radical Islam"" used by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and other Republican presidential candidates, is unnecessarily offensive to American Muslims.Republicans immediately seized on the remarks. ""Yes, we are at war with radical Islamic terrorism,"" tweeted former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.The conversation later pivoted to economic issues, with the candidates tangling over how to pay for their plans to expand college affordability, family leave and prescription drug coverage. All three agreed that wealthy citizens and corporations should pay more in taxes to benefit the middle class.""I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,"" joked Sanders, saying the former president backed a 90 percent marginal tax rate.The three tangled over how high to increase the minimum wage, with Clinton backing a $12-per-hour federal floor while Sanders and O'Malley said $15 an hour â the rate being pushed by a campaign of fast-food workers and labor unions.While Clinton is wary of alienating Sanders backers whose support she'll need should she win the nomination, she drew a contrast with him on gun control. Highlighting a vote he took giving the gun industry immunity from lawsuits, she charged him with failing to push hard enough to regulate ownership.Since the party's first debate a month ago, Clinton has built a lead in the early voting states, an uptick that has come amid other signs the party is coalescing behind her. An Associated Press survey of superdelegates published Friday found that half of the Democratic insiders are publicly backing Clinton.Sanders may have inadvertently facilitated some of her progress in the first debate, when he seemed to dismiss the controversy over her use of a private email account and server by saying Americans are tired of hearing about her ""damn emails.""Saturday night, Sanders declined once again to attack:  ""I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email. I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email,"" he said.""I agree completely,"" said Clinton, with a laugh.___Follow Lisa Lerer on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/llerer",,"WASHINGTON (AP) — With the country still reeling from deadly terrorist attacks in Paris, Hillary Rodham Clinton cast herself as America's strongest leader in a scary world, even as she found herself forced to defend her own role during the rise of the Islamic State militants.","Clinton, Sanders debate foreign policy after Paris attacks",http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-11-14-US--DEM%202016-Debate/id-838ac0452db545a59dfdb9f7a2186c7a,['foreign policy/national security'],"[u""Martin O'Malley"", 'Jeb Bush', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Lisa Lerer', 'Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Marco Rubio', 'Barack Obama', 'Bernie Sanders']",ap,0.9415475997294712,"[{'author_id': 39735, 'fullname': 'lisa lerer', 'primary_org': 'ap'}]",2015-11-14 22:43:00,['Democratic Party'],2546a16b3e748218a88f38f68865cf82,2015-11-15 04:00:04.745793
"Hillary Clinton should have seen that Wall Street shot coming. Instead, she compounded the damage.The former secretary of state was off to a sound outing in Saturday night’s debate against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland. Friday’s terrorist attacks in Paris dominated at first, allowing her to highlight her superior experience in world affairs. But it was those attacks that made her badly muffed response to questions about her fealty to Wall Street all the more jarring. Here’s the exchange:Mr. Sanders: “I have never heard a candidate, never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military-industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me. I’m going to be independent. Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something. Everybody knows that. Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate. We are relying on small campaign donors, 750,000 of them, 30 bucks apiece. That’s who I’m indebted to.”Mrs. Clinton: “Well John, wait a minute. Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impugn my integrity. Let’s be frank here.”Mr. Sanders: “No, I have not.”Mrs. Clinton: “Oh, wait a minute, senator. You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small. And I’m very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent. So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked. Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.”Predictably, Twitter exploded with demands to know what campaign donations from big banks had to do with New York’s recovery from 9/11.Answer: little to nothing. Since 2001, she and Bill Clinton have earned more than $125 million for speeches, many of the most lucrative made before financial groups.That does not begin to account for the millions of dollars given directly to her campaign, and to political action committees backing her. Nearly 15 years after the 2001 attacks, Mrs. Clinton was earning more than $200,000 for a 20-minute speech. Most of those took place behind guarded doors. But one can guess that she and the financial executives were not still talking about 9/11.Middle-class Americans associate Wall Street with the 2008 meltdown of the economy that cost so many their homes and savings. In the debate Mrs. Clinton repeatedly referred to her plan for reining in banks, but offered precious few specifics. This is what happens when Hillary Clinton the candidate gets complacent. The debate moderator, John Dickerson, had even tipped her off before a commercial break that the next topic was Wall Street.Her effort to tug on Americans’ heartstrings instead of explaining her Wall Street ties — on a day that the scars of 9/11 were exposed anew — was at best botched rhetoric. At worst it was the type of cynical move that Mrs. Clinton would have condemned in Republicans. She should make a fast, thorough effort to explain herself by providing a detailed plan for how she would promote measures protecting middle-class Americans from another financial crisis.",THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"After a good start on national security and terrorism, Hillary Clinton flubbed legitimate questions about her ties to Wall Street on Saturday.",Hillary Clinton Botches Wall Street Questions,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/opinion/hillary-clinton-botches-wall-street-questions.html,['economy'],"['Bill Clinton', 'Bernie Sanders', 'John Dickerson', 'Hillary Clinton', u""Martin O'Malley""]",nyt,0.8708710278871227,"[{'author_id': 697, 'fullname': 'the editorial board', 'primary_org': 'nyt'}]",2015-11-15 21:26:52,[],ac1a1d01775534781b522dfa3ead3ef1,2015-11-15 21:45:54.898058
"Bernie Sanders’ campaign refuted reports that campaign officials were angry about changes in the format of tonight’s Democratic debate to reflect the terrorist attacks in Paris.A top aide to the Vermont senator engaged in a “lengthy dispute with executives from CBS, the network hosting the debate, during a conference call on Saturday morning,” Yahoo News reported. The site reported a staffer for one of the other campaigns who was also on the call describing the exchange as “heated” and even “bizarre.” A second source on the call confirmed the nature of the exchange, the site said.Sanders’ campaign, however, said the candidate was fine with the changes: “The news out of Paris was terrible and important and clearly something that was going to be the focus of the debate,” spokesman Michael Briggs said in a telephone interview.He said changes to the format of the debate were discussed and twice changed, and “in the end the senator was totally satisfied with the changes and looking forward to a good debate.”He added, “if some other campaign wants to make a mountain out of molehill, it’s still a molehill.”He said there was a disagreement of “minor points” over the opening. CBS said it wanted to cut the opening statements by the candidates from 90 seconds to 30 seconds to open up with the Paris attacks -- which the Sanders’ campaign opposed, Jeff Weaver, the Vermont senator's campaign manager told CNN.""They wanted to make some last-minute changes to the debate.

"AMES, Iowa (AP) â Fresh from the second Democratic presidential debate, Hillary Rodham Clinton suggested Sunday that Bernie Sanders would raise middle-class taxes and ""scrap"" President Barack Obama's health care law, in an escalating critique of the Vermont senator.Joined by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, at a fall barbecue, the front-runner said middle-class families ""need a raise, not a tax increase"" and she was the lone Democrat in the debate to commit to raising wages ""and not your taxes.""Without mentioning her main rival by name, Clinton said Democrats should work to build on Obama's health law and not suggest ""we scrap it and start all over again."" During the debate, Clinton questioned Sanders' 2013 health care legislation, saying it would dismantle the law and empower Republican governors like Terry Branstad of Iowa to administer the health care system in each state. Sanders envisions a ""single-payer"" system that would be run by the states under federal rules.Even as the field responded somberly to the deadly attacks in Paris, the debate Saturday night marked a feistier phase in the Democratic campaign. Helped by a strong autumn, Clinton has built a small lead in Iowa and is trying to stave off Sanders in the Feb. 1 presidential caucuses.Sanders put Clinton on the defensive in the debate when he said Wall Street had been the major contributor to her campaigns in order to get support in return.Clinton responded that Sanders was trying to ""impugn my integrity"" and said that as a New York senator, she helped New York City's financial hub rebuild after the Sept. 11 attacks. Her invoking of 9/11 received an incredulous response on social media and Republicans accused her of shamefully hiding behind the attacks to deflect attention from her ties to her wealthiest donors.Taking the stage in Ames, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley said Clinton brought up 9/11 to try to ""mask her proximity to Wall Street and the huge amount of contributions and the dollars she has received personally from the major banks of Wall Street.""""She doesn't have to mask it. It is what it is,"" O'Malley said. ""That is the sort of company, that is the sort economic advice that she would follow.""Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said following the debate that the senator's proposals would be paid for with higher taxes on the wealthy and large corporations. ""He's raising taxes to pay for relief for middle-income and working people,"" he said.He also said Sanders would build upon the health care law to provide universal coverage. ""It's not a question of ripping up Obamacare, it's really expanding on the promise of Obamacare,"" Weaver said.The barbecue inside a massive agriculture center featured another appearance by Bill Clinton, who briefly introduced his wife and joked that after watching the debates, ""I think I'm going to vote for Hillary.""___On Twitter, follow Ken Thomas: https://twitter.com/KThomasDC",,"AMES, Iowa (AP) — Fresh from the second Democratic presidential debate, Hillary Rodham Clinton suggested Sunday that Bernie Sanders would raise middle-class taxes and ""scrap"" President Barack Obama's health care law, in an escalating critique of the Vermont senator.","Clinton goes after Sanders on taxes, health care",http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-11-15-US--DEM%202016-Clinton/id-e642156bd9b549fb8161c27ced2fad72,['health'],"['Jeff Weaver', u""Martin O'Malley"", 'Bill Clinton', 'Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Barack Obama', 'Ken Thomas', 'Bernie Sanders', 'Terry Branstad']",ap,0.535904016805291,"[{'author_id': 39392, 'fullname': 'ken thomas', 'primary_org': 'ap'}]",2015-11-15 16:27:00,['AMES'],339e5cfe47434f9efe0d01fa28b3f86f,2015-11-15 22:00:05.671043
" (AP) â The bloody attacks in Paris are putting the Syrian refugee crisis at center stage in U.S. politics as migrants from that war-torn country surge toward the West and security concerns rise.GOP presidential contender Marco Rubio on Sunday said the United States should no longer accept Syrian refugees because it's impossible to know whether they have links to Islamic militants â an apparent shift from earlier statements in which he left open the prospects of migrants being admitted with proper vetting.""It's not that we don't want to, it's that we can't,"" Rubio said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week.""  ""Because there's no way to background check someone that's coming from Syria.  Who do you call and do a background check on them?""The question of admitting Syrian refugees has for months been part of the national security discussion among 2016 candidates that cuts to the heart of the American identity as a refuge. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush on Sunday told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that the U.S. should admit Syrian Christians, after proper vetting. Other Republican candidates have called for a ban on allowing Syrians into the U.S. All three Democratic presidential candidates have said they would admit Syrians but only after thorough background checks.But Friday night's mass killings in Paris, which left at least 129 people dead, offered evidence that may have backed up what many, including Rubio, had been warning: People with secret ties to Islamic militants could flow across borders as part of waves of refugees.Authorities said a Syrian passport found near one of the Paris attackers that had been registered last month and traveled through three countries along a busy migrant corridor known for lax controls. It was not clear whether the document was real or forged. Officials on Sunday were still trying to identify people involved in the conspiracy. They said as many as three of the seven suicide bombers who died in the attacks were French citizens.A spokesman for President Barack Obama said Sunday that the administration is moving forward with its plan to thoroughly vet and admit as many as 10,000 Syrian refugees.""What we need to be able to do frankly is sort out that foreign fighter flow, those who have gone into Syria and come out and want to launch attacks or those people who have connections with ISIL in Syria,""  Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said on Fox News Sunday. ""At the same time, we have to recognize there's tragic victims of this conflict, there are women, and children, orphans of this war and I think we need to do our part, along with our allies, to provide them a safe haven.""The Paris attacks have elevated national security in the presidential contest. In Saturday night's Democratic presidential debate, which began with a moment of silence for the Paris victims, all three candidates â former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley â said the U.S. should admit far more than the 10,000 Syrians to which Obama has committed, but only with proper screening.Rubio on Sunday said that was impossible.""You can't pick up the phone and call Syria, and that's one of the reasons why I said we won't be able to take more refugees,"" Rubio said on ABC.That is a switch from Rubio's other statements this fall, in which he voiced skepticism about proper vetting but still left the door open to admitting refugees.  In September, he told Boston Herald radio: ""We've always been a country that's been willing to accept people who have been displaced. And I would be open to that if it can do it in a way that allows us to ensure that among them are not infiltrated, people who are part of a terrorist organization.""Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, meanwhile, said Sunday that the U.S. has a responsibility to ""help with refugees after proper screening.""""And I think or focus out to be on the Christians who have no place in Syria anymore,"" he added in NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ''They're being beheaded, they're being executed by both sides.

"Hillary Clinton defended herself against criticism over the money she has raised from the financial industry by invoking her job as a U.S. senator representing New York after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.“I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York,” she said, after finding herself again on the defensive over her perceived close ties to Wall Street. “It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.”The unusual defense emerged during a feisty exchange over financial-industry regulation in Saturday’s Democratic presidential debate hosted by CBS News. Mrs. Clinton also noted that 60% of her donors are women—another effort to turn back the Wall Street fundraising attack from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who has emerged as a formidable opponent in the Democratic primary.Just as in last month’s Democratic debate, the discussion Saturday of financial regulation turned largely on whether Congress should reinstate the New Deal-era banking law, the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated investment banking from commercial banking. President Bill Clinton played a major role ushering in legislation, signed into law in 1999, that repealed Glass-Steagall.Some critics say Glass-Steagall facilitated the financial crisis in 2008 by allowing large banks to grow, in effect, “too big to fail,” forcing the unpopular emergency bailouts. They have pushed legislation to carve up the banks by instating aspects of Glass-Steagall, which the banking industry strongly opposes. Mr. Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley both endorsed that effort again on Saturday.Mrs. Clinton was more restrained. “Reinstating Glass-Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough,” she said, adding that her regulatory-overhaul proposal is “tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive,” because it would target nonbank institutions as well as Wall Street banks and large depository institutions.Mrs. Clinton implied that Glass-Steagall would have done little to forestall the bank bailouts in 2008 because many of the companies that either failed or required bailouts—including American International Group and Lehman Brothers—weren’t big deposit-taking banks. AIG is an insurance company and Lehman Brothers was a standalone investment bank.Critics of the Glass-Steagall repeal don’t agree with this view. They say it too easily overlooks the ways in which banks, particularly Citigroup, took on greater risks that fed increased risk-taking across Wall Street. AIG, for example, got into trouble because it had insured billions of financial products issued by more than a dozen firms—some that had grown thanks to Glass-Steagall and some that, like Lehman and Bear Stearns, had remained standalone investment banks.Stepping back from the bank-regulation arcana, there’s a broader disagreement here. At the heart of Mr. Sanders’s argument over the size of banks is the idea that they have too much political power, an idea that evokes the “trust busting” of President Teddy Roosevelt who sought to break up big industrial monopolies for some of the same reasons.Why do big industries make “millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something. Everybody knows that,” said Mr. Sanders.When Mrs. Clinton said that she would break up banks if they didn’t play by the rules, Mr. Sanders responded with disbelief that this might be in doubt. “The business model of Wall Street is fraud,” he said.Mr. Sanders pledged not to have any Wall Street representatives in his cabinet. “One of the problems we’ve had…whether it’s Republican administrations or Democratic administrations, we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations,” he said.Mr. O’Malley joined in when he said that Richard Rubin and Larry Summers, both former treasury secretaries for President Bill Clinton, wouldn’t be allowed near his administration. Mr. Rubin has been a very influential figure within Democratic policymaking for the last two decades, and many policymakers that he has mentored have served in top positions for President Barack Obama.“They are the architects,” said Mr. O’Malley.Mr. O’Malley was pressed to name who, exactly, would provide him with advise on financial regulation. He didn’t provide any names. “We’ll have an inclusive group,” he said.Financial regulation also emerged as a hot topic in Tuesday’s Republican debate, and it showed how both parties have vastly different interpretations of what caused the financial crisis and, consequently, what should be done to prevent it from happening again.Republicans generally have blamed government policies, from housing to the Federal Reserve, for provoking risk-taking, an idea that draws mixed readings from economists. They say that there is now too much government regulation, singling out for criticism the Dodd-Frank financial-regulatory overhaul, even though they have also tried to sound critical of Wall Street.The clear winner in both the GOP debate earlier this week and in Saturday’s Democratic debate: community banks.“Imagine America without its community banks. Well, that’s what’s happening because of Dodd-Frank,” said former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in Tuesday’s debate.And Mr. Sanders on Saturday: “Support community banks and credit unions. That’s the future of banking in America.”______________________________________________________2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll StandingsPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.

"DES MOINES, Iowa U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton came under heavy criticism in a debate on Saturday for her 2003 vote backing the U.S. invasion of Iraq, with rival Bernie Sanders linking it to regional chaos that aided the rise of Islamic State militants.Sanders and rival Martin O'Malley took a more aggressive tone with Clinton than in their first debate last month, also accusing her of being too cozy with Wall Street and unwilling to stand up to corporate interests.The day after a series of bomb and gun attacks that killed at least 129 people in Paris, Sanders criticized Clinton's vote authorizing the Iraq invasion and said it was ""one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the modern history of the United States.”""I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, unraveled the region immensely, and led to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS,"" said Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont.""I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now,"" he said.Clinton, who has frequently called the vote a mistake, said it should be placed in the historical context of years of terrorism before the invasion.“If we’re ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extremists, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq,” she said.""This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.  It's become more complicated. And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in,"" she said.  The Iraq exchange came early in the second debate for Democrats seeking their party's nomination for the November 2016 presidential election, which focused on foreign policy and ways to combat terrorism after the Paris attacks.The candidates and audience at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, observed a moment of silence at the beginning of the debate to honor those killed in France.Clinton, the former secretary of state, has far more foreign policy experience than either Sanders or O'Malley. But she was forced on the defensive early in the debate about her years of leading President Barack Obama's foreign policy team.Clinton struck a sharp contrast to Obama's comments in an interview aired on Friday that ISIS had been contained. ""We have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network. It cannot be contained, it must be defeated,"" she said.Republican presidential contenders have criticized Obama for what they say was an inadequate response to the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In the aftermath of the attacks, businessman Donald Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz called on the administration to reconsider plans to allow thousands of Syrian refugees to be resettled in the United States.The White House aims to increase to 10,000 the number of Syrian refugees accepted in the United States during fiscal year 2016, from less than 2,000 accepted in the previous year.Clinton has always been from the more hawkish wing of the Democratic Party. Her support for the 2003 Iraq invasion played a major role in her primary loss to Obama in the 2008 White House race.The foreign policy focus was a dramatic shift in emphasis in a Democratic presidential race that so far has been dominated by domestic economic issues such as income inequality, college affordability and family leave.The Democrats returned to that theme later in the debate, and Sanders criticized Clinton for her opposition to reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act, the 1933 law that established a firewall between investment and commercial banking. Its removal has been blamed by some for helping lead to the 2008 financial crisis.""Over her political career, Wall Street has been a major, the major donor to Hillary Clinton. Now maybe they’re dumb, but I don’t think so,"" said Sanders, who favors reinstatement of the act.Clinton accused Sanders of impugning her integrity and said reinstating the law was not enough to rein in corporate influence and reform Wall Street.""Reinstating Glass-Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough,"" she said. ""I just don’t think it would get the job done, I’m all about making sure it actually gets results for whatever we do.” With the political clock ticking to the first nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 1, Clinton has opened a commanding lead over Sanders, her prime challenger, in national and Iowa polls. O'Malley trails well behind, in single digits in most polls.

"A women takes a photo while standing on the stage for Saturday night's Democratic presidential debate between Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt,, Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, Friday, Nov. 13, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders needs to slow frontrunner Hillary Clinton’s run toward the party nomination, and Saturday night’s debate might be such an opportunity.The format of the CBS debate, the second of the 2016 cycle for Democratic White House candidates, was reworked after the Paris terror attacks Friday night to focus more on terrorism, national security and foreign policy.Clinton, as a former secretary of state, has more experience with such matters, compared to both Sanders, a Vermont independent, and fellow challenger Martin O’Malley, a former Maryland governor.However, her record as the State Department leader from 2009 to 2013 could also invite moderator questions and candidate attacks Saturday about her handling of the deadly Sept. 11, 2012, terror attacks on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya.Among the concerns, as frequently highlighted by Republicans, are whether Clinton paid enough attention to security concerns raised by Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who was killed in the attacks, and whether she attempted to cover up that the attacks were terror related.Stevens and three other Americans died in the attacks.Clinton will also likely face questions at the debate in Des Moines, Iowa, about her role in the Obama administration’s efforts to eradicate the Islamic State, the increasingly dangerous terror group that has claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks that killed at least 129 people.Clinton leads Sanders 54.7 percent to 33 percent, with O’Malley at a distant 2.7 percent, according to an averaging of polls by the nonpartisan website RealClearPolitics.com.And an Associated Press survey of superdelegates published Friday found that half of the Democratic insiders are publicly backing Clinton, which further secures her nomination efforts.Clinton’s campaign got off to a rough start following revelations about eight months ago that as secretary of state she used a private server and email accounts for official business, which raised questions about whether classified information was compromised.However, the former first lady and New York senator has been on a recent roll, which started with a good first debate in mid-October and was followed about a week later by her well-prepared testimony before a GOP-led special House committee on the Benghazi matter.Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist whose outsider campaign has drawn large crowds and good polling numbers in early-voting states Iowa and New Hampshire, will indeed be free to attack Clinton on foreign policy.However, his focus on such domestic issues as income inequality, affordable college tuition and social justice reform could present problems Saturday if Clinton or the moderators go deep and hard into the foreign policy issues.Sanders may have inadvertently facilitated some of Clinton’s turnaround when in the first debate he seemed to dismiss the controversy over her use of a private email account and server by saying Americans are tired of hearing about her ""damn emails.""But he has since given her no more passes.Though careful never to mention Clinton by name, Sanders has drawn a series of contrasts with the former secretary of State on issues that include her backing of the war in Iraq, trade and the minimum wage.Sanders advisers say he plans to discuss the email issue only if the moderators raise it.  ""He's definitely going to cut a harder contrast on core issues,"" said Larry Cohen, a senior adviser to Sanders, ""But it's not going to be over personal style.""The problem for Sanders is that Clinton agrees with him on some of the core domestic issues of his campaign, having shifted to the left in recent weeks to oppose construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.""His current arguments aren't enough to get beyond his core voter,"" said Gina Glantz, manager of Bill Bradley's 2000 presidential campaign.While Sanders aides bragged about their candidate's lax preparation for the last debate, they shuttled him to his campaign headquarters in Burlington, Vermont, for mock sessions before this match-up. Clinton, too, has kept her schedule relatively clear over the last several days, leaving plenty of time for rehearsals.""They are absolutely prepared for the fact that Bernie's going to come out swinging,"" said Maria Cardona, a Democratic strategist who worked for Clinton's failed 2008 White House campaign, ""The question is how it's going to happen.""Clinton supporters say their candidate will remain focused on laying out her vision for the future rather than striking back at Sanders. Her campaign has about $15.2 million in television advertising planned through mid-February, compared with a $3.2 million Sanders ad buy that ends next week, according to Kantar Media's CMAG advertising tracker.The Service Employees International Union, an influential force in Democratic politics, is expected to issue their endorsement on Tuesday, according to people knowledgeable about the union's process. Clinton has been backed by more than 72 percent of members in all their internal polling, including the most recent survey conducted a few weeks ago.In addition to her success in the first debate and on Capitol Hill, Clinton has benefited from Vice President Joe Biden's decision to forgo a presidential run.O'Malley has questioned Sanders' commitment to the Democratic Party and President Obama, still a popular figure among Democrats.A more aggressive tone would mark a shift for a race that has so far been notable for its civility. Democrats have spent months boasting about the substantive tone of their contest, attempting to set-up a favorable early contrast with the often carnival-like insults of the crowded Republican primary.The Associated Press contributed to this report.         ",,"Democrat presidential challenger Sen.

"Democratic U.S. presidential candidates Senator Bernie Sanders (L), former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley pose on stage ahead of the second official 2016 U.S. Democratic presidential candidates debate in Des Moines, Iowa, November 14, 2015.   (REUTERS/Jim Young)Hillary Clinton was put on the defensive at the opening of Saturday night’s Democratic presidential debate over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability.The debate in Des Moines, Iowa, came in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which thrust the issues of national security and foreign policy back to the center of the 2016 campaign. The debate format was changed to focus anew on those issues.But, citing the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa, Clinton’s rivals criticized her Senate vote for use of force before the Iraq war and appeared to criticize her support for toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley said America’s role is not to roam the world “looking for new dictators to topple.”He said it is also important to understand “secondary and third consequences” that come after removing a “single dictator.” O’Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a “mess.”Clinton defended her support for toppling Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a “genocide” and America’s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support.She also said “it is imperative” that the U.S. do more to confront the “arc of instability” in the region. And to O’Malley’s critique, she said, “I don’t think you can paint with a broad brush,” and “This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.”Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, referenced Clinton’s support for use of force in Iraq and said the “disastrous invasion” led “to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.”Clinton again called her Iraq war vote a “mistake,” but disputed that the war is the only driver of modern terrorism.The candidates also condemned the Paris terror attacks.“Our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough,” Clinton said.She called for global “resolve” to “root out” the “radical jihadist ideology” that motivates groups like the Islamic State. Clinton, a former secretary of state, said she would coordinate efforts “against the scourge of terrorism.”“It cannot be contained. It must be defeated,” she said of ISIS.Sanders blasted ISIS as a “barbarous organization.”O’Malley called this the “new face” of terror threats.The attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said. In a primary race otherwise dominated by the economy, climate and front-runner Clinton’s personal record, the debate in Des Moines, Iowa, now is expected to focus heavily on security and foreign policy after debate host CBS News reworked the format.  It is an area where Clinton, as former secretary of state, enters with the thickest resume – but also one that could prove problematic, given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable and chaotic nations like Libya and Syria.Sanders, after appearing to give her a pass at the first debate over her personal email controversy, has in recent weeks shown a greater interest in criticizing her record. But his focus on issues like income inequality could be out of place in a discussion focused on global security challenges. Sanders’ campaign objected to some of the CBS News debate tweaks, sources said.Clinton also enters this debate – hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register – facing a narrower field than at their first encounter in October. Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O’Malley.Clinton is seen to have otherwise strengthened her hand since that debate, making it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and seeing one of her biggest potential political threats – a late bid by Vice President Biden – disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.Sanders remains Clinton’s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.Still, the FBI investigation over Clinton’s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding. ",,Hillary Clinton was put on the defensive at the opening of Saturday night’s Democratic presidential debate over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability. ,Clinton on defense over Middle East policies at Dem debate,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/TEOgoe910VE/,['foreign policy/national security'],"['Bernie Sanders', 'Muammar Qaddafi', 'Hillary Clinton', u""Martin O'Malley"", 'Jim Young']",fox,0.9311865151561396,[],2015-11-15 02:02:16,"['Senate', 'Al Qaeda', 'FBI']",b06f7a0e9f9c60524f5011b3887f1e37,2015-11-15 03:00:12.671185
"Here’s the latest:• What is the status of the investigation?The French authorities have released no information since a news conference by the Paris prosecutor on Saturday, and no updates are scheduled for Sunday.The death toll holds at 129, but the number of critically wounded — nearly 100 — signaled that figure was certain to grow.Investigators were hunting down information about the first of the suspects to be publicly identified, Ismaël Omar Mostefaï, 29, a French citizen who was one of three hostage takers at the Bataclan concert hall.In the eastern Paris suburb of Montreuil, the authorities found three Kalashnikov rifles in an abandoned vehicle, a sign that some of the attackers may have escaped.The authorities in Belgium made seven arrests that left open the possibility that the plot had roots there.Fundamental questions remain: How did the terrorists, who acted in three synchronized teams, pull off the deadliest terrorist attack in Western Europe since 2004?And did they receive direction from Islamic State leaders in Iraq and Syria, who until now had never taken responsibility for such a large-scale attack in the West?• What’s happening in Paris?Paris is still by and large shuttered, even for a Sunday, and France remains under a state of emergency.Museums and other cultural centers are closed for a second day. A star-crossed movie opening about a terrorist attack in France was canceled.But small crowds congregated at the Place de la République — as they did after the Charlie Hebdo massacre in January — to show solidarity on Saturday, ignoring government advice to stay home. And French flags are appearing in Parisian apartment windows.The archbishop of Paris officiates at a Mass at the Cathedral of Notre-Dame today. And schools are to reopen on Monday.• What about elsewhere?From Vatican City to Seoul, law enforcement authorities are on heightened alert.Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari of Iraq said his country’s intelligence services obtained information indicating that, besides France, the United States and Iran were among countries being targeted for attack.• What’s next for policy makers?As France deals with the aftermath in Paris, global attention turns to policy and politics. President Obama and other world leaders are in Turkey for a Group of 20 summit meeting today, where the terrorist attacks are already a focus.Migration is, too, because one of the assailants entered the European Union through Greece with other refugees last month and then passed through Serbia, where he sought asylum.That is sure to complicate the vexing problem of how to handle the unceasing flow of people from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere in Europe. Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, said today that Europe should not react by rejecting refugees.European Union justice and interior ministers will hold a special meeting on the Paris attacks Friday.• How is Paris playing in the U.S. presidential campaign?Candidates for the Democratic nomination, in their debate Saturday night in Des Moines, agreed that America is determined to fight terrorism, dedicated to responsibilities to refugees and devoted to diplomacy.But Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont sought to tie the rise of the Islamic State to Hillary Rodham Clinton’s vote as a senator to authorize the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.By contrast, leading Republicans like Donald J. Trump, Ben Carson and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas called on the Obama administration to halt plans to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees next year.Although they broadly agreed that the Paris attacks should be the catalyst for a new military strategy against the Islamic State, most of the Republicans were still tentative about committing more American ground troops to that effort.• Who were the victims?Little seemed to tie the dead at the six attack sites, except that they were out having fun. And that was the point for the Islamic State militant group, which said that it struck France’s symbols of “perversity.”“Bars, a concert, a great game,” Bernard-Henri Lévy, a French author and philosopher, wrote on Twitter. “This is the French art of living together that has been targeted.”Several foreigners, including people from Belgium, Britain, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United States, were killed in the attacks.An American student from California State University in Long Beach, Nohemi Gonzalez, 23, also died in the Paris attacks. She was spending a semester at the Strate School of Design in Paris.Valentin Ribet, a 26-year-old lawyer, was killed at the Bataclan concert hall during a sold-out show by the American rock band Eagles of Death Metal.Guillaume B. Decherf, 43, a critic at a French cultural magazine and a father of two, was killed as well. Three employees from Universal Music France also died, as did Nick Alexander, a British citizen who sold merchandise for the band, and Aurélie De Peretti, 33.“Yesterday, the victims weren’t journalists or famous. They were civilians,” Maxim Ferron, manager of a Paris tea shop, said on Saturday.You can sign up here to get the regular weekday Morning Briefing delivered to your inbox.

" “We will not solve our nation’s problems … by returning to [the] polarizing figures of our past.”This was a not so veiled attack against Hillary Clinton from Martin O’Malley on Saturday night at the second Democratic debate. It was uttered on a night when her opponents were more direct in their criticism but still did not appear to lay a glove on her.  Indeed, O’Malley’s words are poignant, but ultimately won’t make much of a difference. Hillary Clinton is 19 points up nationally and Saturday night’s debate was another example of why she is so far in front.Just as in the first debate, Clinton showed the depth of her experience in politics over the last 30 years. She has the deepest understanding of the issues – particularly foreign policy having been secretary of state – and is a sharp, quick debater.None of the candidates were willing to say that we’re at war with radical Islam. Everyone was watching for this and it seemed that they erred on the side of political correctness. Clinton continued to show herself to be a commanding force on the stage. This isn’t to say that she didn’t have struggles.She tripped up during an answer about Wall Street where she countered that her work to aid the 9/11 recovery while a New York senator made her a crusader against Wall Street. And her vote for the Iraq war haunted her again. These are points the GOP will seize upon and showed flashes of weakness.Saturday debate began with a series of questions on terrorism and how America can combat ISIS, especially in light of the heinous attacks in Paris on Friday night. We knew this would happen, as it should. And each of the candidates emphasized how important American leadership is in the fight against terrorism, something I agree with wholeheartedly.It was no surprise that Clinton was the most hawkish of the three candidates on stage. She talked of using airpower, training and equipping forces in the region and pushes our allies – especially Turkey and the Gulf States – to make up their minds about how much they’re going to help in this effort. Sanders and O’Malley had good rhetoric on the issue, but were vague and non-specific. And we also heard again that climate change is creating terrorism from Sanders – a claim that the Republicans will surely seize on.It must be noted that Clinton was trying to distance herself from Obama's statement that ISIS needs to be ""contained"" by saying they need to be ""defeated."" That being said, she did not declare war on ISIS. She did not forthrightly speak of the singular and unique role the U.S. must play in providing leadership, and sought to deflect attention from Sanders' efforts to link her with the rise of ISIS because of her support of the Iraq war by blaming George Bush.In short, it was a good and effective job for a Democratic primary audience, but all three candidates were on the defensive for much of the first part of the debate over the Middle East and the War on Terror. This will probably be a manageable challenge in the Democratic primary, but will almost certainly be a more serious challenge during the general election campaign. We will have to watch how this unfolds closely.Furthermore, none of the candidates were willing to say that we’re at war with radical Islam. Everyone was watching for this and it seemed that they erred on the side of political correctness.Clinton had the best rationale for not using the term by defending it in terms of not offending our Muslim allies, but coming on the day after the Paris attacks, I’m sure this will be an issue.There was more antagonism on Saturday night than we’ve seen before. Sanders went after Clinton for her close ties to Wall Street and on gun control. And Clinton returned the favor.O’Malley got in on the action to tout how far he went as Maryland governor to raise wages, control gun violence and work to combat climate change. He certainly did better than he has before, but I don’t think he made a strong case for an O’Malley presidency. As Sanders pointed out, it’s not like Baltimore is doing too well right now. And he’s right.The most important thing that voters will have seen at the Iowa debate this week is that a Clinton and a Sanders presidency would be very different.Sanders believes two things are of paramount importance: income inequality and climate change. His plans could push taxes on the rich upwards of 80 percent-- in a light moment he joked about Dwight Eisenhower levying a 90% tax -- and he’d bring back Glass-Steagall and break up the banks. Sanders supports a $15 minimum wage and free college tuition. And he brought the conversation on health care back to the idea of single payer, a favorite of the progressive left.These are all areas where you can see differences with Clinton. She only supports a $12 federal minimum wage and said it should be up to states/cities to raise it above that (this is also what Senate Democrats support). She wouldn’t break up the banks or bring back Glass-Steagall while at the same time arguing that her proposals go the furthest in reining in the banks.On health care, Clinton wants to build on ObamaCare and improve it, especially by focusing on the issue of prescription drug costs.It’s also important to note that all the candidates were allied on immigration – each supports comprehensive immigration plan and a pathway to citizenship.Martin O’Malley was the only candidate to say how many Syrian refugees he’d take in (65,000), but they all argued that it’s our humanitarian duty to take in refugees. This will also be a sticking point after the Paris attacks.All this is to say that Saturday night’s event was a well-moderated debate and all the candidates did well.It’s just that Clinton did that much better. She’s the only one on stage who looked presidential. And I believe everyone could see that. Douglas E. Schoen has served as a pollster for President Bill Clinton.

"WashingtonThe Democratic candidates for president gathered in Des Moines, Iowa, for their second debate Saturday, and CNN's Reality Check team spent the night putting their statements and assertions to the test.The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN selected key statements and rated them: True; Mostly True; True, but Misleading; False; or It's Complicated.Previous CNN Reality Check coverage of the Democratic and Republican candidates can be found here. This story will be updated throughout the night.Reality Check: Sanders on vets with PTSDBy Debra Goldschmidt, CNN HealthVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said, ""When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war, the 500,000 who came home with PTSD and traumatic brain injury.""Roughly 2.6 million veterans served in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs says 11% to 20% of military members who served in Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from PTSD.According to a Veteran Affairs independent study on traumatic brain injury, self-reported data found 15% of troops who were engaged in active combat in Afghanistan and Iraq ""may have suffered"" a mild traumatic brain injury. This falls in line with a report from the Brain Trauma Foundation, which found between 10% to 20% of Iraq veterans suffer from some level of traumatic brain disorder.Verdict: TrueReality Check: O'Malley on net immigration from MexicoBy Sonam Vashi, CNNFormer Gov. Martin O'Malley said, ""The truth of the matter is net immigration from Mexico last year was zero."" He then challenged viewers to fact-check him, and we couldn't resist.According to the Pew Research Center, net migration from Mexico probably reached zero in 2010, and more Mexicans have left the United States than arrived since then.Additionally, the actual number of Mexicans living in the United States consistently declined throughout 2014. The U.S. Border Patrol also reported that in the 2014 fiscal year, the number of Mexicans apprehended along the border decreased 14% when compared to the 2013 fiscal year.The information we have suggests that the net immigration rate is negative -- which is actually not zero -- but it is close, and probably still supports O'Malley's point.Verdict: Mostly true",,,Democratic debate: CNN's Reality Check team inspects the claims,http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/14/politics/democratic-debate-fact-check/index.html,['immigration'],"['Bernie Sanders', u""Martin O'Malley""]",cnn,0.5480945459848154,"[{'author_id': 45638, 'fullname': u""cnn's reality check team"", 'primary_org': 'cnn'}]",2015-11-15 04:09:39,"['U.S. Border Patrol', 'Pew Research Center']",5f763ceb49f12a5e357faeff8b4407dd,2015-11-15 04:16:08.650830

Alex Wong/Getty Images                    Hillary Clinton entered the second debate of the campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination with far less to prove than she had in the first, and, in the end, she probably achieved far less as well. But for the time being, at least, she may be able to afford it. The first debate, in October, corresponded with a time of stress for her candidacy, besieged by various legal and political investigators and drifting downward in voter-preference polls. But Clinton did so well and struck such a blend of competence and charm in the October debate on CNN that she was widely acknowledged to have rescued her fortunes — or at least strengthened her hand. This latest debate on CBS News and staged at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, was never likely to have as great an impact. The likely audience was limited. It was staged on a Saturday night, competing with various sports and entertainment programs. This weekend, in particular, it was overshadowed by the tragedy unfolding in Paris, where at least 129 people died in terrorist attacks Friday night. The group known as Islamic State claimed responsibility for the coordinated attacks by teams of gunmen and suicide bombers. The debaters observed a moment of silence for the victims in Paris and devoted the first quarter of the debate to discussing the attacks and the proper response from the U.S. and its allies. All agreed the U.S. had a major, leading role to play in battling the terrorists, but all also agreed that U.S. allies needed to respond with greater commitment as well. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont noted that the struggles in the Middle East amounted to ""a war for the soul of Islam,"" implying it was a contest beyond the power of the U.S. government to resolve. But Sanders also explicitly assigned responsibility for the current turmoil in the Middle East to the administration of George W. Bush, whose invasion of Iraq in 2003 was responsible for ""all this instability,"" he said. Sanders made the point that he had opposed the invasion on the Senate floor, where Clinton had voted in support. Clinton has since called that vote a mistake. But the most difficult part of that first segment of the debate for Clinton came when CBS News debate moderator John Dickerson asked whether her prescriptions for the fight against the group called Islamic State suffered for her association with President Obama, who has been downplaying, or underestimating, the strength of the group. As recently as this week, the president had said the group had been ""contained,"" at least in its territorial ambitions in Iraq and Syria. On this, Clinton distanced herself from the president somewhat, saying she had advised more involvement in the region after the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq — a shift she said was mandated by the agreement struck with Iraq by the last Bush administration. She had said she warned that ""extremist groups might fill the vacuum."" Sanders said several times that the Department of Defense budget was already $600 billion and that the U.S. should be hesitant to increase that greatly without knowing what it was expecting to accomplish with more military hardware. A self-described Democratic Socialist, Sanders also contrasted his reliance on small donors with the Clinton campaign's donations from the wealthy of Wall Street: ""Maybe they're stupid about what they're going to get [in return], but I don't think so."" Clinton then insisted on a chance to respond, because Sanders had ""impugned my integrity."" That drew an audible sound of anticipation from the crowd, which may not have expected even this degree of confrontation between the candidates after the harmony of the first debate. Clinton then said she had many thousands of donors, most of them not rich, and 60 percent of them women. Although not directly responsive to the Wall Street thrust from Sanders, Clinton's reference to gender prompted applause and cheers from the crowd. This was her best moment of the debate, according to people following the proceedings on social media such as Twitter. Clinton went on to suggest her contributions from Wall Street stemmed from appreciation for all she had done to help the Lower Manhattan financial industry recover from the terror attacks of September 2001. That rationale drew a decidedly mixed response from the audience in the hall and on social media, with many questioning whether it fully explained the generous contributions she still receives from the financial industry more than a dozen years later. .@HillaryClinton vehemently offers support for Wall Street as post-911 recovery effort.  Does that fly?— David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) November 15, 2015Sanders said Clinton's plan to increase regulation of the financial industry was ""not good enough,"" and he had corroborating support from third-place challenger Martin O'Malley, the former governor of Maryland, who called the Clinton plan ""weak tea."" The candidates revisited a divide on gun violence, with Sanders saying he was willing to reconsider his past opposition to legislation stripping gun manufacturers of their liability when their products were used in the commission of crimes. O'Malley sided with Clinton on this issue, only moments after favoring Sanders' point of view on banking regulation. But, in general, the candidates were largely in agreement on major issues. They agreed that President Obama had been right to offer a path to citizenship for young people brought to the U.S. illegally while still minor children. ""The symbol of America is the Statue of Liberty,"" said O'Malley, ""not a barbed-wire fence."" O'Malley also won cheers from the crowd for his reference to ""that immigrant-bashing carnival-barker Donald Trump,"" a reference to the candidate leading most polls among Republican candidates for president. All three candidates supported greater access to a college education, with Sanders saying all public universities and colleges should be tuition-free. Clinton said she did not think taxpayers should pay for Trump's children to go to college, as he is a billionaire. O'Malley noted that he had held the line on tuition increases at state schools when he was a governor. And neither Sanders nor O'Malley took the bait when asked whether Clinton's private e-mail server should have been used for any kind of government business. Sanders in particular refused the chance to criticize her on the issue, saying he was still ""tired of her emails,"" as he had said in the first debate. Dickerson then asked Clinton if there were ""other shoes to drop"" as multiple investigations proceed into her time in office and the activities of her aides. Clinton alluded to her 11 hours of testimony before a House investigative panel last month as an indication to the contrary. Overall, the debate did not seem likely to affect Clinton's standing in the primary field. Despite moments of vulnerability and dubious reaction to her defenses regarding Wall Street contributors, she remained the strong center of the cast on stage. She had 40 percent of the total speaking time, with 35 percent going to Sanders and 25 percent to O'Malley. But as she had arrived at this juncture of the campaign as not only the leader but an increasingly dominant leader, Clinton had little room to improve. Dickerson also invited favorable comparison to his predecessors in the role of debate moderator. His questions were crisp, to the point and frequently challenging — but without the argumentative tone that has brought criticism from participants in earlier debates on the Republican side.",,"Former Maryland Gov.

"Democrats and Republicans, based on their recent presidential debates, are set to offer voters a stark choice in 2016 about how the economy should be managed, with both sides moving toward the outer flanks of their parties.In Saturday’s Democratic debate, candidates said they would seek to rein in Wall Street, raise taxes, increase the minimum wage and expand the federal government’s role in health care. Republicans, meanwhile, are competing to repeal regulations, cut taxes, keep the minimum wage as it stands and roll back President Barack Obama’s signature health-care overhaul.The parties right now “have polar opposite analyses of how the economy works and how it should work,” said Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser in the Obama administration. “It’s obvious but underappreciated how far apart they are on the fundamentals—wages, taxes, financial markets.”Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, sparred Saturday over how to pay for new federal investments in education, infrastructure and health care. Both called for raising taxes on the wealthy, although Mrs. Clinton pledged to do so without hitting families that earn less than $250,000 or increasing deficits, which would constrain new spending ambitions.Mr. Sanders wouldn’t say exactly how high tax rates should rise but noted the top tax rate had been 91% in the 1950s under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican. “I’m not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,” Mr. Sanders said.Republicans have put tax-cutting proposals at the heart of their economic policy agenda, and they have largely shied away from promises made by candidates four years ago to avoid running up budget deficits.The boldness of some proposals drew warnings from one candidate, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, at last week’s Republican presidential debate. “Hillary and the Democrats promise everything on the spending side. We’ve got to be responsible about what we propose on the tax side,” he said.Republicans at last week’s debate also dismissed efforts to boost the federal minimum wage, now at $7.25 an hour, as an ineffective way to raise incomes. Florida Sen.  Marco Rubio and businessman  Donald Trump said it would put U.S. workers at a disadvantage. “You’re going to make people more expensive than a machine,” Mr. Rubio said.Democrats on Saturday debated whether to target a federal minimum wage of $12 or $15 an hour. Mr. Sanders supports the higher threshold, an effort backed by labor unions. He brushed aside warnings issued recently by Alan Krueger, the Princeton University professor who served as Mr. Obama’s top economist, that a $15 minimum wage is an untested, risky level. His research contends minimum-wage increases haven’t decreased employment, and he supports raising wages to $12 an hour.“I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously,” said Mrs. Clinton, who also has endorsed the $12 floor.Mr. Sanders and Martin O’Malley, the third candidate at Saturday’s debate and a former Maryland governor, said they would shun anyone with Wall Street ties from top positions in their administrations, including figures such as  Robert Rubin and Larry Summers, who served as treasury secretaries for President  Bill Clinton.Some Democrats have faulted that approach. “The idea that you have to excommunicate anybody who ever worked in the financial sector is ridiculous,” said Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist Democratic think tank. “We need people who oversee the Federal Reserve system and have high posts at Treasury that have expertise in finance.”Both Republicans and Democrats have promised to crack down on Wall Street, but they disagree sharply over how to do it. Republicans generally have blamed government policies, from housing to Federal Reserve interest-rate decisions, for provoking the financial crisis. They say the Dodd-Frank Act in particular has restrained economic growth and should be repealed.Democrats quarreled Saturday over whether the regulatory overhaul had gone far enough by failing to reinstate a New Deal-era law that separated commercial and investment banking, known as the Glass-Steagall Act.The flare-up over banking laws reflected Mr. Sanders’s broader critique that Democrats and Republicans have given banks too much political power, a throwback to the “trust busting” of President Theodore Roosevelt more than a century ago. Why do big industries make “millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something,” he said in Saturday’s debate. “Everybody knows that.”Both parties did agree in the past week on one thing: the virtues of community banks. Republicans warned that too many were going out of business.

"WASHINGTON The deadly attacks in Paris pushed terrorism and the Syrian refugee crisis to the center of the U.S presidential campaign on Sunday, as Republicans hammered Obama administration plans to take in more refugees as well as Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton's stance on Middle East policy.After officials said one of the Paris gunmen might have slipped into Europe among refugees fleeing Syria's war, more Republicans voiced their opposition to the 10,000 Syrian refugees the White House wants to admit in the coming year.""Bringing people into this country from that area of the world I think is a huge mistake,"" Republican candidate Ben Carson said on the ""Fox News Sunday"" program, echoing comments by fellow Republican contenders on Saturday.While the U.S. number is a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of refugees that Europe is prepared to take, the plan has become a main point of attack for candidates seeking to show a tougher stance on terrorism.The deadliest attack in Europe in a decade could end up reshaping the race to elect a U.S. president in 2016.Clinton, a former secretary of state under President Barack Obama, told a debate on Saturday in Iowa that she supported raising the refugee intake to 65,000, but only with a careful screening and vetting process.Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for Obama, defended the administration's vetting process as thorough and made a humanitarian appeal.""We're also dealing with people who've suffered the horrors of war, women and children, orphans. We can't just shut our doors to those people,"" he said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""Earlier this month, the administration announced plans to accelerate the process for Syrian refugees hoping to enter the United States with new screening outposts in Iraq and Lebanon. More on the Syrian refugee screening processThe events in Paris have highlighted a double-edged foreign policy problem for Clinton. As America's top diplomat from 2009 to 2013, she has international experience none of her rivals can match but can also be called to account for failings on her watch.Clinton's Democratic and Republican opponents said the administration had misjudged the Middle East and underestimated Islamic State, the militant group that claimed credit for bomb and gun attacks that killed at least 132 people in Paris on Friday.Republican presidential candidate Senator Lindsey Graham said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that if he were elected, the United States would be ""part of a world-wide force to destroy ISIL,"" another acronym for Islamic State.""Hillary Clinton,"" he added ""seems to be disconnected from what you need to do. She won’t embrace boots on the ground.""VETTING UNDER SCRUTINYFlorida Senator Marco Rubio, another Republican candidate, said on ABC's ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos"" that just one vetting oversight could jeopardize public safety. ""You can have a thousand people come in and 999 of them are just poor people fleeing oppression and violence, but one of them is an ISIS fighter. ... If that's the case, you have a problem,"" Rubio said.Fellow Republican contenders, Ohio Governor John Kasich and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, have been open to accepting more refugees, but they echoed Rubio's concerns about vetting. ""We can't be in a position of inviting the enemy in, and frankly we better be careful about looking at Americans that have traveled"" in the region, Kasich said on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.""Bush said on ""Meet the Press"" the United States had a special responsibility to help Syrian Christians, who he said had no place in their homeland.Ahead of the first Democratic nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 1, Clinton has opened a commanding lead over main party challenger Bernie Sanders, who argues the invasion of Iraq, which Clinton supported in a U.S. Senate vote in 2003, led to the rise of al Qaeda and Islamic State.For more on the 2016 U.S. presidential race and to learn about the undecided voters who determine elections, visit the Reuters website.

" (AP) â With the country still reeling from deadly terrorist attacks in Paris, Hillary Rodham Clinton cast herself as America's strongest leader in a scary world, even as she found herself forced to defend her own role during the rise of the Islamic State militants.""This election is not only about electing a president, it's also about choosing our next commander in chief,"" Clinton declared Saturday night in the Democrats' second debate of the presidential campaign. ""All of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.""Amid the backdrop of global anxiety, Clinton found herself fending off questions about not only her foreign policy record but her economic ties, with both Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley painting the former senator from New York as a lackey for Wall Street and corporate interests.""Let's not be naive about it,"" said Sanders, noting that Clinton collected millions in campaign donations from Wall Street bankers. ""They expect to get something. Everybody knows that.""Clinton defended her relationship with Wall Street, citing her work in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but her statement met with criticism from Republicans who accused her of politicizing the terrorist assaults.The barbs marked a far more aggressive shift in a primary race that has so far been notable for its civility. Democrats have spent months boasting about the substantive tone of their contest, attempting to set up a favorable early contrast with the ""carnival barker"" insults of the crowded Republican primary.Since the Democrats' first debate a month ago, Clinton has built a lead in the early voting states, gains that have come amid other signs the party is coalescing behind her. But the nomination fight is far from over.Saturday night, Clinton faced criticism of her national security record, when Sanders traced the current instability in the Middle East to the U.S. Senate's vote â including Clinton's â to authorize military action in Iraq in 2002. He said that U.S. invasion ""unraveled the region.""The former secretary of state fought back, saying terrorism has been erupting for decades, specifically mentioning the Sept. 11 attacks. She said the recent unrest in Libya and other parts of the Middle East is symptomatic of an ""arc of instability from North Africa to Afghanistan.""She rejected the idea that she and the rest of the Obama administration underestimated the growing threat of the Islamic State.The back-and-forth revealed a foreign policy split within the Democratic Party, with Sanders playing to the anti-war activists who boosted then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama to victory in 2008.Sanders argued for a far more hands-off approach, advocating for Muslim countries to lead the fight and declaring that the war against Islamic State militants is about the ""soul of Islam.""Clinton has a history of advocating for more robust involvement across the globe â both as a presidential candidate eight years ago and as Obama's secretary of state. In recent weeks, she has called for a more aggressive U.S. role in the Syrian conflict, including a no-fly zone over the area, a move the Obama administration opposes. But she stood by her opposition to seeking a formal declaration of war against the Islamic State.All the candidates denounced the attacks, and the debate began on a solemn note with a moment of silence followed by the previously unplanned foreign policy questions.They gave some fodder to their Republican critics, who coupled condemnation of the Paris attacks during the day with sharp criticism for Obama and his former secretary of state, Clinton.""We are at war with violent extremism, we are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression,"" said Clinton, arguing the U.S. is not at war with Islam or all Muslims. ""I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.""Sanders and O'Malley agreed with her sentiments, saying the term ""radical Islam"" used by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and other Republican presidential candidates, is unnecessarily offensive to American Muslims.Republicans immediately seized on the remarks. ""Yes, we are at war with radical Islamic terrorism,"" tweeted former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.The conversation later pivoted to economic issues, with the candidates tangling over how to pay for their plans to expand college affordability, family leave and prescription drug coverage.The conversation revealed how Sanders' message has helped shift the party to the left on some economic issues.All three agreed that wealthy citizens and corporations should pay more in taxes to benefit the middle class. They tangled over how high to increase the minimum wage, with Clinton backing a $12-per-hour federal floor while Sanders and O'Malley said $15 an hour â the rate being pushed by a campaign of fast-food workers and labor unions. And they fought over the degree to which they would curtail large financial institutions, with Sanders describing Wall Street's business model as ""greed and fraud"" â a startling judgment for a major presidential candidate.""I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,"" joked Sanders, saying the former president backed a 90 percent marginal tax rate.While Clinton is wary of alienating Sanders backers whose support she'll need should she win the nomination, she did take a few shots. She attempted to cast some of Sanders major proposals, including a single payer health care system and free college, as politically unrealistic.""The revolution never came,"" she said, in a knock on his call for a ""political revolution."" ''I waited and I got the scars to show for it.""Sanders may have inadvertently helped her in the first debate, when he seemed to dismiss the controversy over her use of a private email account and server by saying Americans are tired of hearing about her ""damn emails.""Saturday night, Sanders declined once again to attack:  ""I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email,"" he said.""I agree completely,"" said Clinton, with a laugh.___Lisa Lerer reported from Washington.

(REUTERS/Jim Young)PreviousNextHillary Clinton faced tough criticism Saturday night from her Democratic rivals over everything from her Middle East policies to her swaying stance on gun control to her Wall Street ties, at a debate that saw both Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley step up their attacks on the party’s front-runner.The former secretary of state was put on the defensive almost immediately, as she was challenged by her rivals -- and the moderator -- over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability. Vermont Sen. Sanders ripped her support for “regime change.”  But while the Paris terror attacks the night before shifted the early presidential debate focus to national security, the candidates sparred aggressively in the latter half over domestic issues – especially financial industry reform and Clinton’s Wall Street support.Former Maryland Gov. O’Malley called her the “candidate of Wall Street.”Asked about her hefty Wall Street-backed speaking fees and donations, Clinton defended her independence in being able to pursue financial industry reform.But Sanders shot back, “Not good enough.”“Let's not be naive about it. Why …has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?” he said. “You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.”He and O’Malley, unlike Clinton, both want to re-instate a Depression-era banking law known as Glass-Steagall – and they both criticized Clinton’s Wall Street plans as not going far enough. O’Malley called it “weak tea.”In an eyebrow-raising moment, Clinton countered Sanders’ criticism of her Wall Street donations by saying that as New York senator, she helped “rebuild” Wall Street and downtown Manhattan after 9/11.Clinton was later asked about social media reaction claiming she had invoked 9/11 to justify financial industry donations; Clinton said she’s sorry that anyone had that “impression.”Meanwhile, she said she doesn’t think her rivals’ financial industry plans – particularly to reinstate the Depression-era law that separated investment and commercial banking – would get the job done.“I'm all about making sure we actually get results,” Clinton said.The debate in Des Moines, Iowa, came in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which thrust the issues of national security and foreign policy back to the center of the 2016 campaign. The format of the debate – hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register -- was changed to focus anew on those issues in the beginning.Clinton tried to highlight her deep experience in foreign policy issues from the outset.“This election is not only about electing a president. It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief,” she said.But, citing the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa, Clinton’s rivals soon turned to her record as U.S. senator and later as secretary of state to question her judgment in foreign policy matters.O’Malley appeared to criticize her support for toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.He said America’s role is not to roam the world “looking for new dictators to topple.” He said it is also important to understand “secondary and third consequences” that come after removing a “single dictator.” O’Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a “mess.”Clinton defended her support for ousting Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a “genocide” and America’s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support. And to O’Malley’s critique, she said, “I don’t think you can paint with a broad brush” in an “incredibly complicated region of the world.”Sanders, meanwhile, referenced Clinton’s Senate vote for the use of force in Iraq and said the “disastrous invasion” led “to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.” The senator also claimed that “climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.”Clinton again called her Iraq war vote a “mistake,” but disputed that the war is the only driver of modern terrorism.She and O’Malley briefly sparred over America’s role in fighting ISIS. After Clinton said it “cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential,” O’Malley said, “This actually is America’s fight,” though not “solely” America’s fight.Sanders staked out a different position in saying it is the nations in the region that “have to get their hands dirty.”“Those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort,” he said.The candidates declined to categorize the threat itself as “radical Islam.” Asked about that categorization, Clinton said only, “I don’t think we’re at war with Islam.”All the candidates on stage condemned the Paris terror attacks and vowed to take on the threat of terror.“It cannot be contained. It must be defeated,” Clinton said of ISIS, appearing to distance herself from President Obama, who hours before the Paris attacks claimed ISIS was “contained.”The attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said. It brought the issue of terrorism to the forefront of both party’s presidential primary races. Ostensibly, it is an area where Clinton enters with the thickest resume – but also one that could, as the debate showed, prove problematic given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable nations like Libya and Syria.While the tragedy hung over the debate, the candidates were able to tackle of range of domestic issues including wages and immigration.O’Malley landed virtually the only shot of the night against Republican candidate Donald Trump, a favorite target of the Democrats, by calling him an “immigrant-bashing carnival barker.” The Democratic candidates generally agree on the call for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the country.Sanders, meanwhile, continued to advocate for a $15 minimum wage.But the candidates were divided on gun control. While Clinton has tried in the past to cast Sanders as soft on the issue, O’Malley accused Clinton of being “on three sides of this.”“When you ran in 2000, you said we needed federal robust regulations, then in 2008 you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying we don't need those regulations ... and now you’re coming back around here,” he said.The debate was notable in that it saw Sanders and O’Malley taking a more aggressive tone against the front-runner, who seemed to have strengthened her hand since their initial debate.Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O’Malley. She also made it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and saw one of her biggest potential political threats – a late bid by Vice President Biden – disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.Sanders remains Clinton’s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.Still, the FBI investigation over Clinton’s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding. Sanders appeared to give her a pass on the email issue at the first debate by saying he was tired of hearing about the controversy.Sanders, though, stood by his comments at the second debate Saturday night: “I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email, I’m still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email. … Let’s go to the major issues facing America.” ",,"Hillary Clinton faced tough criticism Saturday night from her Democratic rivals over everything from her Middle East policies to her swaying stance on gun control to her Wall Street ties, at a debate that saw both Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley step up their attacks on the party’s front-runner.  ","Clinton hit by Dem rivals over Wall St. ties, Mideast policies at 2nd debate",http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/V8TEBB0dgZ8/,"['foreign policy/national security', 'immigration']","[u""Martin O'Malley"", 'Jim Young', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Donald Trump', 'Muammar Qaddafi', 'Bernie Sanders']",fox,0.9974292038547423,[],2015-11-15 05:15:16,"['Senate', 'Al Qaeda', 'FBI']",79bd7c26a3cede5c90902c1c11117ed4,2015-11-15 06:14:21.385069

" (CNN)Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley met for the second Democratic presidential primary debate on Saturday night, an event that finally saw a fight between the front-runner and her chief opponent, but also coming a day after a deadly terror attack that shocked the world. Here are the six key takeaways from the debates:Clinton distanced herself from President Barack Obama's now-controversial comment in an interview Thursday that the U.S. had ""contained ISIS."" During Saturday's debate, Clinton asserted that ISIS ""cannot be contained"" and must simply be ""defeated."" As she has in the past, Clinton also suggested that she had argued ""early on that we needed to find a way to train and equip moderates."" Clinton reportedly argued for a more forceful administration plan to help the Syrian opposition early on in the civil war that has since exploded.RELATED: Hillary Clinton at Democratic debate: ISIS 'cannot be contained'The Vermont senator in the first debate appeared unprepared or unwilling to go after Clinton with any real vigor.But Saturday night, Sanders suggested Clinton is in the pocket of Wall Street and tied her vote to authorize the war in Iraq to the rise of ISIS. Clinton, meanwhile, knocked Sanders on his mixed record on guns and suggested his policy proposals are too simplistic.In the most forceful exchange of the night, Sanders pointed to the millions of dollars in donations Wall Street has funneled to Clinton's campaigns over her political career.""Why over her political career has Wall Street been a major, the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton? Maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so,"" Sanders said. ""I have never heard a candidate, never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street from the military industrial complex, not one candidate -- 'Oh these, these campaign contributions will not influence me.' But why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something, everybody knows that.""RELATED: Democratic debate: CNN's Reality Check team inspects the claimsClinton responded by accusing Sanders of impugning her ""integrity,"" before claiming that Wall Street has supported her because of the work she did to rebuild the Financial District after it was hit in the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center.  As she did in the first debate, Clinton hit Sanders on guns, calling the Vermont senator's vote to shield gun makers from some lawsuits a ""terrible mistake"" and urging Sanders to admit as much, as she has done regarding her Iraq vote.Sanders responded by suggesting there's little daylight between himself and Clinton and O'Malley on guns.Sanders didn't take the gloves off completely during Saturday night's debate in Iowa.Instead, he took a pass on one of the biggest points of contention of the 2016 cycle: Clinton's record as secretary of state.Given a chance to slam Clinton's tenure, Sanders demurred, instead pivoting to his ""disagreement"" with Clinton over her vote in favor of the Iraq War in 2002, more than six years before she became secretary of state.Republicans are already picking apart Clinton's track record as secretary of state, but Sanders' simply wouldn't take the bait.It was reminiscent of Sanders' ""damn emails"" moment in the first Democratic debate, when he said Americans are tired of hearing about the controversy over Clintons' use of personal email during her time as secretary of state.However, Clinton's response to Sanders -- when she beat back the suggestion that she is influenced by Wall Street donors -- could really come back to bite her.Clinton explained her connection to Wall Street by tying her relationship to her role in helping to rebuild New York's financial district after the 9/11 attacks.Twitter was ablaze Saturday night over the response, and the Republican National Committee was quick to blast out a best-of compilation of political observers' reactions.It's not the only moment that could come back to haunt Clinton -- especially if she faces a younger GOP nominee, like Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida.Clinton at one point said she is ""from the '60s"" -- a moment in the debate that could be replayed in political ads down the line suggesting she is part of the past, not the future, of American leadership.The debate Saturday night began with the candidates pausing on stage, taking a moment of silence to remember the victims of the terrorist attacks that ripped Paris apart just a day earlier.  Clinton said while ""our prayers are with the people of France tonight...that is not enough"" and called for better coordinated efforts to root out ISIS, the radical group that claimed responsibility. She said Americans should see the terrorist attack as a reminder that the election ""is not only about electing a president, it's also about choosing our next commander in chief.""Sanders made brief note of the terrorist attacks at the top of his opening statement, but quickly pivoted to the core message of the campaign: ""a rigged economy"" that benefits billionaires.Still, Sanders made a bold claim in his reference to Paris: ""Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarist (sic) organization called ISIS.""And O'Malley, after saying his heart goes out ""to the people of France in this moment of loss,"" quickly called for ""fresh thinking"" and ""new approaches"" -- a definitive nod to his youth and the generational contrast the  52-year-old offers to Clinton's 68 years and Sanders' 74.All three candidates refused to say the fight was with radical Islam, instead focusing on using the word ""jihadist"" to describe the threats spotlighted in the Paris attacks. RELATED: Clinton calls out 'radical jihadist ideology'O'Malley delivered several strong one-liners throughout the night, notably when he slammed Republican front-runner Donald Trump as a ""carnival barker"" for his immigration policies.But O'Malley also missed a couple of key moments where he could have shined. His central contention is that it's time for a new generation of leadership -- meaning no more baby boomers like Clinton. But he lacked a strong, convincing response to one of the debate's final questions: When have you been most tested in your life, and how did it prepare you for the presidency? O'Malley's response conceded that he is untested -- that nothing he's been through as mayor of Baltimore or governor of Maryland comes close to the crises he would face as President.Trump later responded to O'Malley's insult on Twitter by calling him a ""clown.""

"DES MOINES —  The news team at station KCCI buzzed with nervous anticipation here at Drake University on Saturday night, less than two hours before the start of the Democratic candidates’ debate.It was the first presidential debate that KCCI, the local CBS affiliate, would help present in its 60-year history, and the atmosphere had shifted dramatically in the previous 24 hours — from one charged with excitement to a grave and somber tone following the deadly terror attacks in Paris.Behind a temporary stage erected for the event, KCCI’s news director, Dave Busiek, watched a live stream of CBS News coverage on his iPhone about the latest developments out of Paris. In a nearby workspace, the veteran anchor Kevin Cooney made final preparations for the questions he would pose later about national security as one of debate’s four moderators.Just after 6:15 p.m., cameras flashed on the KCCI anchors Stacey Horst and Steve Karlin, who stood on the stage and welcomed viewers to an area for the news media known as the spin room; they noted how the carnage in Paris would change the focus of the debate.“Our viewers are interested in that,” Mr. Busiek said. “That flows into what will be a very serious discussion with who could be the president of the United States.”Broadcasting from Iowa’s capital city to 434,500 TV households in the country’s 72nd largest television market, KCCI takes on outsize importance among the nation’s local television stations every four years. Iowans are the first in the nation to vote in presidential caucuses, setting the tone for the rest of the campaign season.As a result, presidential candidates devote significant face time to KCCI, the perennial market leader and one of 30 stations owned by Hearst, and its rival WHO-HD, the local NBC affiliate. And the stations respond in kind, adding more political coverage to the menu of news offerings.KCCI started its own Sunday morning half-hour interview program this fall called “Close Up,” which has featured interviews with presidential candidates from both parties. And WHO boasts that it televises 25 percent more news each week than other stations in the market, thanks in large part to a 4 p.m. newscast that presents a more in-depth look at news and politics. WHO also is hosting three special one-hour forums this week featuring the Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Bobby Jindal. The stations also count on campaigns and interest groups to open their checkbooks in the months leading up to the caucuses and the general election. KCCI and its market rivals are likely to reap a disproportionate share of the $3.3 billion in political advertising dollars that analysts project will go to local television stations for 2016 races, particularly for pre-caucus spending.“Technically, the presidential election is a national election,” said Elizabeth Wilner, a senior vice president at Kantar Media/CMAG, a company that monitors political advertising. “But in reality it is a race that occurs in about 10 states. In 2012, seven states saw 84 percent of all local TV ad spend, and we expect that same dynamic again.”That swing in political ad spending is of huge importance to the big media conglomerates that own local television stations, particularly as other categories of advertisers shift a larger share of spending to digital outlets. “In political, TV is still king,” said Kip Cassino, executive vice president for research at Borrell Associates.Over the last several years, a wave of consolidation has swept across the industry with station owners trying to put themselves in the path of more of political advertising dollars. In 2013, for instance, Tribune Company closed a $2.7 billion acquisition of Local TV Holdings that made it one of the country’s largest station owners; it added stations in 16 markets in the transaction, including WHO in Des Moines.Tribune is now expecting to gross about $200 million in political advertising sales in 2016, up 25 percent from adjusted revenues in 2012. “At this point, we’re calling for it to be strong, all signs are pointing to that,” Peter Liguori, chief executive of Tribune Media, said during a recent conference call, noting the company’s strength in swing states. In Des Moines, station executives said that the sales strategy boiled down to waiting for the phones to ring and the orders to come in. “We don’t have to actively go out,” said Dale R. Woods, general manager of WHO. “They are the ones who want to obtain our real estate.”And while ad orders have started trickling in, executives said that the deluge largely has yet to arrive, partly because of the large number of Republican candidates this year, which has prompted campaigns to hold back on paying for advertising as they wait for the field to narrow. The surprising success of Donald J. Trump, who for the most part does not use advertising, has also affected how the candidates spend.“We’re in a decent position,” said Brian Sather, president and general manager of KCCI. “We’re open for business.”The stations also benefit from the rise of outside political action groups. While the stations are required by law to provide equal access to candidates and to charge them the lowest unit rates, there are no laws limiting what they can charge outside groups for commercial time. Analysts project a sharp increase in spending by these groups for 2016.“There is nothing stopping stations from charging groups five to six times as much — or even 10 times as much” as they charge candidates, Ms. Wilner of Kantar said. “Nobody weeps for the poor billionaire that has to pay 10 times as much as the candidate.”But the influx of campaign dollars creates a delicate situation for the stations, which have to juggle their limited supply of commercial time. High demand for political ads in the Des Moines market, particularly in the weeks leading up to the caucus, can put a squeeze on inventory and push out local businesses, such as car dealerships, that are the bread-and-butter advertisers year round.“It is a balancing act,” Mr. Sather said. “We try to do our best.”Mike Schreurs, chief executive of Strategic America, an advertising agency in West Des Moines, said that it is common for businesses to see as many as one out of four commercial spots bumped from local TV during the peak political season. They also might have to pay at least a 30 percent increase in the rates. “It takes the inventory away from smaller retailers and advertisers, not including the fact that it creates something of a toxic environment,” he said.Already, more than 35,000 commercials adding up to more than $22.5 million in spending have aired or are scheduled to air on Iowa television stations through Feb. 2, the day after the Iowa caucuses, according to an analysis of Federal Communications Commission records by The Des Moines Register. On KCCI alone, viewers will see more than 62 ads a day in the eight days leading up to the Iowa caucuses. And at WHO, Hillary Rodham Clinton’s campaign has booked a single spot for $5,800 to air during prime time Monday night. A spot airing during another time the same week cost $60.Back in the spin room after the debate on Saturday night, KCCI anchors wrapped up more than four hours of related coverage. During the coming 78 days leading to the Iowa caucus, the journalists plan to return to the air to cover the twists and turns of the campaign. But, for the moment, Mr. Karlin, one of the anchors, reflected on the Des Moines station’s moment in the national spotlight.“It’s really a privilege for a television station like us to be part of a debate like this,” he said.",EMILY STEEL,"Over the last several years, a wave of consolidation has swept across the industry with station owners trying to put themselves in the path of more of political advertising dollars.","Iowa TV Gets Its Close-Up, Enjoying Outsize Influence",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/business/media/iowa-tv-gets-its-close-up-enjoying-outsize-influence.html,['campaign_finance'],"['Elizabeth Wilner', 'Donald Trump', 'Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Donald J.

"AMES, Iowa – The day after a debate in which Democratic presidential candidates tangled over the causes of Islamic State terrorism but not how to confront it, Hillary Rodham Clinton offered a more forward-looking view of American leadership in response to the threat.“We have to be rallying our partners and allies, pulling countries off the sidelines,” Mrs. Clinton said on Sunday. She called the Islamic State “the first Internet-fueled terrorist group,” which will require strong countermeasures to its propaganda and recruitment.Speaking at an indoor barbecue lunch hosted by several Iowa counties’ Democratic parties, Mrs. Clinton offered no specifics. But she suggested a more proactive approach than she had in the debate, when she dodged a question about whether the Obama administration had underestimated the Islamic State and seemed to take a fatalistic view of terrorism connected to chaos in the Middle East.  “Attacking Paris, the city of light, reminds us that there is no middle ground in going after these terrorists,’’ Mrs. Clinton said. She was notably alone in bringing up the Paris attacks. Former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland, who also spoke at the event, focused almost entirely on domestic issues. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was represented by a surrogate, the former Princeton professor Cornel West.     Mrs. Clinton implicitly pressed her claim as the most qualified Democratic candidate for commander in chief, highlighting terrorism at a moment that the campaigns of both parties seem likely to pivot to national security and American leadership in the world. Although many pundits scored Saturday’s debate a draw, with Mr. O’Malley having his best night yet and Mr. Sanders more focused in his responses, a focus group of undecided Democrats in Des Moines, where the debate took place, gave Mrs. Clinton a clear win.  All 33 likely caucus-goers in the group thought Mrs. Clinton would be the stronger commander in chief, said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic consultant who conducted the focus group.  “It was clear that Clinton’s answers on terrorism, and her improved answers on domestic issues, moved undecided Iowans in striking ways,’’ he said.       Mr. Kofinis identified one vulnerability: Mrs. Clinton’s ties to Wall Street, exemplified by an answer to a question about accepting donations from rich bankers that has been widely mocked. Mr. O’Malley echoed the critique on Sunday, dismissing her explanation that she has been flooded with Wall Street donations in gratitude for her help in rebuilding the New York financial district after the terrorist attacks of 2001. Mrs. Clinton “sadly invoked 9/11 to try to mask’’ her ties to Wall Street bankers, Mr. O’Malley said on Sunday.    The crowd of several hundred largely older Democrats did not respond strongly to Mr. O’Malley’s critiques of Mrs. Clinton, which  included sharper barbs than usual  about her record on guns and immigration.The crowd, which swarmed Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton after she spoke, seemed pragmatic with less than three months before the Iowa caucuses and as Mr. Sanders’s summer surge in the state appears to be ebbing.  “Personally, I like what Sanders and O’Malley have to say,’’ Glenda Eggerling, a retiree, said.  “But I think Hillary will appeal to more voters, and I would really like to see a Democrat in the White House, because I don’t like Republicans’ platforms.’’Sandra McJimsey, also a retiree, said, “I think Bernie has done a great service to the party,” but she declared herself “energized to vote for Hillary.’’Despite their embrace of Mrs. Clinton’s foreign policy experience, Iowa Democrats had no interest in committing ground troops to fight the Islamic State, as several Republican candidates have advocated, or in declaring war, as Jeb Bush suggested on Sunday.Chas Weber, a retiree who recently moved to Ames from Michigan, said the Paris attacks and confronting the Islamic State were “this week’s hot topic,’’ which he predicted would soon give way to something else.An independent who is candidate shopping, Mr. Weber plans to attend a rally for Donald J. Trump later in the week.  But he said he was no fan of Mr. Trump’s call to aggressively bomb the Islamic State and commit ground troops.  “He’s an extremist with no experience,’’ he said.

"Initially solemn, typically wonkish and monotonously polite to the moderators and one another, the three Democratic presidential candidates still managed to provide a few surprising moments during their second debate Saturday night.Hillary Rodham Clinton complimented George W. Bush and accused Bernie Sanders of impugning her integrity.Martin O’Malley called Clinton “Annie Oakley” on gun control and “weak tea” on big banks.Sanders founded yet another T-shirt line by announcing that “Wall Street’s business model is fraud,” CBS used Twitter in a way that did not look like old-media floundering, and Dwight D. Eisenhower continued his 2016 Greatest Hits Tour.A week after Donald Trump praised Ike for deporting more than a million Mexicans, Sanders offered him as a model of high tax rates for the rich: “I’m not much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,” he said.Most important, however, was the moment that did not occur: Though they were resolute in their condemnation of ISIS, none of the candidates went inflammatory or ballistic.Taking place just a day more than 120 people were killed in a series of terrorist attacks in Paris , the debate, which was held in Des Moines and aired on CBS, opened without the now-usual campaign-trail/reality-show pomp and pageantry. Instead, moderator John Dickerson, host of “Face the Nation,” solemnly reminded viewers that open debate is “a symbol of freedom.”Then, after a moment of silence, he began asking newly added questions about the U.S. response to ISIS and unrest in the Middle East.But those hoping for burning rhetoric, sweeping resolutions or even clear plans were probably disappointed.While many of the Republican presidential candidates have made strong statements in the wake of Friday’s horrific attacks — Donald Trump suggested that an armed French citizenry would have prevented the tragedy, Sen. Ted Cruz called for significant air power and many if not all want to close the U.S. to Syrian refugees — the Democratic nominees chose to tread more carefully.So carefully that it was difficult to know what any of them do in similar circumstance should she or he become president. Indeed, during the opening minutes of their second debate, Sanders, Clinton and O’Malley were more explicit in their arguments about what the terrorists should be called — extreme jihadists rather than Islamic extremists — than they were about their visions of an American response.To be fair, Dickerson, for reasons of his own, never asked the obvious question — “What do you think the U.S. should do next?” Instead, he called on each of them to critique President Obama’s, and Clinton’s, handling of terrorism in general and ISIS particular. This put Clinton immediately on the defensive and Sanders and O’Malley in the unenviable position of criticizing their party’s president one day after a horrifying international crisis.O'Malley called for more ""human intelligence"" and Sanders blamed the rise of terrorism on the Iraq war, which, he pointed out, Clinton had voted for. Clinton quickly reminded everyone that many acts of terrorism, including 9/11, had preceded the war, which she once again admitted was a mistake, and unity returned to the conversation.Early minutes were spent agreeing that the Middle East is complicated, the world is dangerous and the enemy is not Islam, a distinction Clinton thanked George W. Bush for making in the days following 9/11.Indeed, until the first commercial break and beyond, the three candidates spent so much time openly agreeing with one another, with minor caveats, that they seemed to have forgotten they were political rivals.That changed when the questions returned to the economy and everyone seemed to feel on firmer ground.As the front-runner, Clinton got the toughest questions and the brunt of the criticism, onstage and off. At one point, Sanders criticized Clinton’s reliance on “Wall Street donors” and all that implies. Clinton defended her impugned integrity in a strange and scattershot way by announcing that 60% of her donors were women and that she had stood by Wall Street, and the rest of New York, during and after 9/11.If Dickerson, who was otherwise strong on calling out contradictions and non-answers, let her get away with evoking 9/11 in a discussion of campaign donations, Twitter didn’t. A few minutes later, co-moderator CBS News congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes asked her to respond to one negative response, marking the first use of Twitter as a real-time participant of a debate.But even with a few mild barbs — O’Malley derided Clinton as having been “Annie Oakley” before changing her stance on gun control, or Sanders dismissed one of O’Malley’s references to his work as governor of Maryland by saying “Baltimore is not now one of the safest cities in America"" — the tenor of the remarks leaned more toward conversation than debate.So much so that Clinton felt comfortable enough to laud the similarities she shares with her rivals. “We have our differences,” she said. “But they pale compared with what’s happening on the Republican side.”“All of us support funding Planned Parenthood,” she continued. “All of us believe climate change is real. All of us want equal pay for equal work. They don't believe in any of that. So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.""Not surprisingly, neither Sanders nor O’Malley disagreed.",,"<p>Initially solemn, typically wonkish and monotonously polite to the moderators and one another, the three Democratic presidential candidates still managed to provide a few surprising moments during their second debate Saturday night.</p> <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton complimented George W.

"Are we heading back to the 1960s, when cities and campuses spiraled into chaos and conservatives won elections by demanding law and order? In a period that has seen riots over police conduct in Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore, attacks on police officers in New York and other cities, and now student protests, it sometimes feels that way.Last week, several Republican candidates sounded as if they were reviving the tough justice theme that helped Ronald Reagan and Richard M. Nixon rise to power almost half a century ago. Donald Trump derided university presidents who bow to student demands as “weak, ineffective people,” and said he wouldn't have quit if he had been in charge at the University of Missouri. Ben Carson warned that if society coddles students, “We will move much further toward anarchy than anybody can imagine.” And Chris Christie said it was all President Obama's fault: “This is a product of the president's own unwillingness and inability to bring people together.”In another flashback to the 1960s, Democrats lined up on the other side, signaling that their sympathies lay with the students. “It's time to address structural racism on college campuses,” Bernie Sanders tweeted. Hillary Rodham Clinton sent a similar message through an aide. And White House spokesman Josh Earnest lauded the Missouri students for their “commitment to fighting hate and intolerance.” Their success, he said, reinforced Obama's view “that a few people speaking up and speaking out can have a profound impact.”There was an unmistakable echo in that micro-debate of the argument after the 2014 unrest in Ferguson, where the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager prompted weeks of angry demonstrations; and the later debate over Black Lives Matter, the movement to curb law enforcement excesses. In all three cases, there has been an impulse toward polarization, reducing the question to: Which side are you on?A few Republicans, notably Christie and Ted Cruz, have charged that BLM is calling for the murder of police officers. (A few demonstrators have done so, but they've been disavowed by the movement's leaders.)“The president encourages this lawlessness,” Christie added last month. (The president has condemned that lawlessness several times, actually, even as he has also condemned excessive police violence.)On the other side, Sanders found himself shouted down by demonstrators when he wasn't emphatic enough in endorsing BLM. (He has made amends since.)The implicit message: You can declare that black lives matter, or that police lives matter — but you don't have the option of believing both those things.Except — and here's where things get interesting — most candidates do believe both those things. If you listen closely and dig beneath the sound bites, yo'll find that things have changed since the 20th century, after all.A recent poll of college students’ attitudes toward free speech (in general and on campus) is a mixed bag.The survey by McLaughlin & Associates for the William F. Buckley Jr. Program at Yale shows that 87% of respondents agreed with this statement: “There is educational value in listening to and...A recent poll of college students’ attitudes toward free speech (in general and on campus) is a mixed bag.The survey by McLaughlin & Associates for the William F. Buckley Jr. Program at Yale shows that 87% of respondents agreed with this statement: “There is educational value in listening to and...Among Republicans, I highlighted the more ferocious voices, but others have been more restrained. Even the ones I quoted, Trump, Carson and Christie, aren't campaigning principally on law and order. They've mostly answered questions thrown at them by reporters, whose job includes goading candidates into making headlines.Most of the Republican candidates have noticed that crime is down, prisons are overcrowded and the cost of incarcerating nonviolent criminals — mostly drug offenders — has become an undue burden. Several have endorsed various brands of criminal justice reform: Rand Paul, most notably, but also Cruz and Christie and Jeb Bush. And one or two have even spoken up to say, in effect, that BLM has a point — although they don't endorse the group's tactics.“This is a legitimate issue,” Marco Rubio said in August. “It is a fact that in the African American community around this country there has been, for a number of years now, a growing resentment toward the way law enforcement and the criminal justice system interacts with the community. It is particularly endemic among young African American males … [who] have a much higher chance of interacting with criminal justice than higher education. We do need to face this. It is a serious problem.”Rubio won't appreciate the comparison, but that wasn't too far from what Clinton said in April.“There is something profoundly wrong when African American men are still far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and sentenced to longer prison terms than are meted out to their white counterparts,” she said in April. It is also wrong, she added, when “brave police officers are attacked in the line of duty.”Despite those knee-jerk reactions to campus upheavals, most Republicans seem to have left the lock 'em up era behind. And so have Democrats; Clinton's position is a shift from the tough-on-crime stance that helped one Bill Clinton get elected in 1992. (Bill Clinton, for his part, was trying to distance himself from the allegedly soft-on-crime Democrats of the 1960s.)It's rare in an election year that candidates are resisting the temptation to polarize — but let's give credit where credit is due. Maybe, in this instance, Carson got it right. “We have people who get in their respective corners and demonize each other, but there's no conversation,” he said recently. “If you ask people to put on the record what their gripes are and what their solutions are, then perhaps they can see that maybe they are not so far apart.”doyle.mcmanus@latimes.comTwitter: @doylemcmanusFollow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook",,"<p>Are we heading back to the 1960s, when cities and campuses spiraled into chaos and conservatives won elections by demanding law and order?

"WASHINGTON — The tragedy in Paris is roiling American politics, bolstering the Republican right’s anti-immigration demands in the short run and perhaps ultimately enhancing Hillary Rodham Clinton and her credentials as the candidate with experience.Politicians from President Obama on down have expressed outrage at the attacks, for which the Islamic State claimed responsibility.Several leading Republicans immediately politicized the issue. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas blamed Mr. Obama and what he called a weak “photo-op” foreign policy, and one of the party’s presidential front-runners, Donald J. Trump, said the tragedy reinforced the need for “tougher” American leadership.“This will be exceptionally important” in shaping the presidential race, said Peter D. Hart, a prominent Democratic poll-taker, suggesting it was likely to help Mrs. Clinton, the only top-tier candidate in either party who has a background in national security.In a debate among Democratic candidates on Saturday, she opened by stating that the United States would be electing a new commander in chief.The attacks seem certain to heighten the importance of foreign policy in an election where it has not been prominent. In a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, only 8 percent of the public cited terrorism as the most important issue.The attacks were immediately seized upon as a reason for cracking down on immigration. “This will help the anti-immigration cause and hurt efforts to bring in Syrian refugees,” predicted Vin Weber, a leading Republican strategist and immigration advocate.Among Republicans, the speculation was about the consequences of the Paris attacks for Mr. Trump. In Iowa on Thursday, he let loose a particularly vicious tirade against some of his rivals.There was a growing sense within the Republican establishment that the “Trump rant” might be the incident that really derails his candidacy, even though he has not been affected by supposedly lethal political acts in the past. The terrorist episode could reverse any political slippage. Mr. Trump has largely set the agenda and dominated the dialogue on immigration; other candidates have followed.Both prominent Republicans and Democrats suggested that a renewed attention to terrorism could harden his core support, though an overall emphasis on foreign policy would not play to Mr. Trump’s strengths.Among the other leading contenders, the boyish-looking Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, 44, has most emphasized a hard line on national security.Yet, Mr. Hart predicts voters “won’t want the kid” in the White House. Mr. Cruz, though the same age, was seen as projecting more forcefulness than his rivals in his response to the attacks, though he may have overreached.Mr. Weber, one of the Republican wise men, said that with time, voters may look “for someone with more gravitas.” He said he hoped this would play to the strength of his candidate, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida.Mr. Bush, considered one of the more mature candidates in either party, has only derivative national security credentials because of his family, particularly his brother, former President George W. Bush. That may prove a mixed blessing for a candidate struggling to regain his footing.The reason Mr. Hart sees an advantage for Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, is that a greater focus on terrorism will cause voters to look even more for a “heavy and strong hand at the tiller.” This might minimize the problems she has among staunchly noninterventionist Democratic primary voters because she is more hawkish on foreign policy than the president she served. And it could help her in a general election, though Republicans constantly criticize the “Obama/Clinton” weakness on foreign policy.In the Democratic debate, Mrs. Clinton took the hardest line on national security: She insisted that the Islamic State “must be defeated,” not just contained, and stressed that she had advised Mr. Obama to approve the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.However this evolves, both Republicans and Democrats agree that Nov. 13 is likely to be an important marker in the selection of the 45th American president.",ALBERT R.

"War Room                         The Paris attacks have reawakened martial feelings absent since 9/11.            By Michael HirshNovember 14, 2015                GettyRemember the mood in America just after 9/11? The surge of super-patriotism (dare we say jingoism)? The pall of political correctness (you’re fired, Bill Maher). The phrases that so resonated: “Let’s roll.” “You’re either with us or against us.” “Bring ‘em on.” Something like that is taking hold in France right now after Friday night’s horror, one of the worst terrorist attacks on Western soil since that terrible day 14 years ago. You could see it in the grim visage of Francois Hollande, socialist-turned-avenger, when the French president declared, “This is an act of war,” pledged a “ruthless” response, and called in effect for a global counterattack against the Islamic State. The frighteningly coordinated attacks that left more than 120 people dead in the heart of one of the world’s most cosmopolitan and beloved cities were, Hollande said, “an act committed by a terrorist army, Daesh, against France, our values, who we are, a free country that speaks to the entire planet.”Story Continued BelowHollande is likely to get a great deal of such support. Because in one night of slaughter, the attacks in Paris have caused the tectonic plates of geopolitics to shift sharply rightward, and no one will be unaffected. The new axis of opinion in the U.S. and Western European countries is plainly going to be harsher, more interventionist and less tolerant of, well, tolerance. Americans were already beginning to lose their post-Iraq war squeamishness about intervening overseas: a November Quinnipiac University poll found that American voters, by a 54-38 percent margin, backed sending U.S. troops to fight the Islamic State in Iraq. It’s safe to assume we’re about to grow more even more interventionist in mood, and Obama, as is his wont, may well follow the public temper, stepping up the minimalist approach he’s taken to countering Islamic State in Iraq and Syria so far.Already in Washington a somewhat more subdued version of this martial mood —subdued only because it didn’t happen here this time—is hardening up the 2016 presidential race. Republicans suddenly possess a new attack line against Obama over his withdrawal from Iraq and reluctance to intervene more dramatically in Syria. Obama’s former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton--who is suddenly on the defensive about something other than Benghazi (though we’ll be hearing more about that too)—will feel compelled to remind everyone at Saturday night’s Democratic debate that she was more hawkish than the president on that particular point.The GOP presidential candidates, of course, immediately seized on Obama’s unfortunately timed declaration in an interview Thursday that “we have contained” the Islamic State. Donald Trump, never one for political niceties, tweeted: ""President Obama said 'ISIL continues to shrink' in an interview just hours before the horrible attack in Paris. He is just so bad! CHANGE.""Ted Cruz, meanwhile, made fun of Obama’s reluctance to blame Islam for repeated acts of terrorism, saying, ""We must immediately recognize that our enemy is not ‘violent extremism.’ It is the radical Islamism that has declared jihad against the West."" He also embraced his own brand of ruthlessness, suggesting it was time to stop worrying about bombing civilians, whom Islamic State radicals have been hiding behind in cities such as Mosul. The Islamic State, he said, “will not be deterred by targeted airstrikes with zero tolerance for civilian casualties, when the terrorists have such utter disregard for innocent life.” Marco Rubio, already building a reputation for himself as the GOP field’s chief hawk, called for “improv[ing] our defenses, destroy[ing] terrorist networks, and depriv[ing] them of the space from which to operate.”This new right-wing normal will also no doubt seal the fate of less hawkish candidates—in particular the already-fading Rand Paul, whom Rubio denounced at the last debate as a “committed isolationist” and who can no doubt hear the tolling of political oblivion even now.***The tenor of diplomacy will change as well, starting today in Vienna, where talks were already underway on whether the U.S., Europeans and Russians could find common ground against Islamic State at a time when they were still sharply divided over Moscow’s contention that Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad should be shored up; that common ground is far more visible than it was a day ago. Against the brazen brutality of the Islamic State, even the barrel-bombing Assad will become slightly more tolerable, at least on an interim basis (delighting Vladimir Putin). Old differences seemed forgotten as Secretary of State John Kerry appeared at a news conference on Saturday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and declared: “We are in absolute and total agreement that these kinds of attacks are the most vile, horrendous, outrageous, unacceptable acts on the planet.”Civil liberties, which made a comeback with the Snowden revelations of 2012, will also now fade once again as an international issue.

"Seeking to shake up the Democratic race and loosen Hillary Rodham Clinton's front-runner status, rivals Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley repeatedly challenged the former secretary of State on Saturday night in a debate where they largely agreed on most issues.The session at Drake University was originally supposed to focus on the economy, but the terrorist attacks in Paris changed that. The deadly assault, which Islamic State extremists took responsibility for, set a somber tone; the debate opened with a moment of silence, the candidates standing on stage with their heads bowed, to mark the tragedy.The contest is about “choosing our next commander in chief,” Clinton pointedly stated in her opening remarks. “All of the other issues we want to deal with depend on our being secure and strong.”The candidates echoed one another in calling for a war against Islamic extremists, agreeing there was a need for better intelligence, a better use of the country's vast military resources and the need for a closer partnership with U.S. allies, especially in the Middle East.Sanders, the independent U.S. senator from Vermont, used the discussion to once more bring up Clinton's 2002 vote in favor of the Iraq war when she was a senator, which she has since called a mistake. Noting his opposition at the time when he was a member of the House, Sanders said the invasion “led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now. I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the modern history of the United States.”Hillary Rodham Clinton waves as Bernie Sanders, left, and Martin O'Malley prepare before a Democratic presidential primary debate, Saturday, Nov. 14, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa.Hillary Rodham Clinton waves as Bernie Sanders, left, and Martin O'Malley prepare before a Democratic presidential primary debate, Saturday, Nov. 14, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa.Clinton said the issue of terrorism was far more complicated, pointing out that the United States had been a target long before the invasion, including the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. “We've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing, and no place more so than in the Middle East,” she said.In light of the horror in Paris, Sanders was asked whether he still believed, as he had earlier stated, that global warming was the greatest threat to national security.“Absolutely,” Sanders replied, suggesting that “climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism” — with the fight over natural resources like water possibly leading to even greater international conflict.Asked by moderator John Dickerson of CBS News whether they would use the words “radical Islam” to describe the United States' enemy — as many Republicans do — all three Democrats balked.“Let's not fall into the trap of thinking all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here,” said former Maryland Gov. O'Malley, suggesting the vast majority of law-abiding Muslims are the “first line of defense” against radical elements.Strikingly, some of the testiest exchanges of the evening came on issues where the differences among the candidates were largely a matter of degree.Sanders and O'Malley insisted, for instance, on setting a $15 national minimum wage rather than the $12 that Clinton favors, and suggested her history of taking generous contributions from Wall Street undercut her promises to impose stiffer regulations. “Weak tea,” O'Malley said dismissively.Clinton repeatedly brushed aside the challenges, saying she shared the same broad goals but would pursue policies that were more pragmatic and more apt to achieve results.“I have nothing against the passion my two friends have here for reinstating Glass-Steagall,” she said, when the debate turned to a discussion of the Depression-era bank regulation. “I just don't think it gets the job done.”Clinton entered the evening in the strongest political position since announcing her candidacy in April, benefiting from an impressive performance at the Democrats' first debate last month and her marathon testimony before lawmakers investigating the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.Nothing she said or did seemed likely to diminish her commanding status.By contrast, Sanders has lost steam after drawing gargantuan crowds over the summer. He has stalled far behind Clinton in national polls, and has also lost ground in some early-voting states, including Iowa, which casts the first votes of the 2016 contest.Stepping onto the debate stage, the Vermonter found himself in something of a quandary of his own design. He has long disparaged negative campaigning, boasting he has never run an attack ad in his decades-long political career.He also seemed to conspicuously foreclose one line of attack on Clinton, her controversial use of a private server while secretary of State, declaring in last month's debate that the “American people were sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.” Aides have been pressing Sanders to assume a more combative stance, but asked Saturday night whether he was reconsidering his comment, Sanders emphatically said he was not. “I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email,” he said. “I am still sick and tired.”“What I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, or we have more people in jail than any other country, or we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality,” Sanders said. “We've gotten off of Hillary Clinton's emails, good. Let's go to major issues facing America.”“I agree completely,” Clinton said. “I couldn't have said it better myself.”But she bridled when Sanders attacked her over her fundraising on Wall Street, suggesting that bankers would not contribute so much money if they did not think they would get something in response. “Maybe they're dumb,” he said. “I don't think so.”Clinton responded that Sanders was trying to “impugn [her] integrity” and noted that two hedge-fund billionaires were already running advertisements against her in Iowa.The exchange led to a seeming Clinton stumble, when she referred to her work helping Wall Street recover from the Sept. 11 attacks. “I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York; that was good for the economy,” Clinton said.The negative reaction on social media was swift, including a Tweet from one critic who was incredulous that Clinton invoked the terrorist attacks in defending her relationship with Wall Street. When the comment was read to her onstage, Clinton said she was sorry if her remark — quickly seized upon by Republican opponents — was misconstrued.In another response that may echo later in the campaign, Clinton inadvertently raised the generational issue during a discussion of the protests sweeping college campuses. Republicans have repeatedly portrayed her as a has-been compared with some of their more youthful candidates.“I come from the '60s, a long time ago,” she said. “There was a lot of activism on campus. Civil rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism. And I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out. Obviously, I believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other.”O'Malley has struggled to be anything more than an afterthought in the Clinton-Sanders contest and he repeatedly took after both rivals.He cited his record as Maryland's chief executive, saying, for instance, that while all three support a higher minimum wage, in his state “it was not just a theory … we did it.”The stage was less crowded than at the Democrats' first debate last month in Las Vegas. Former Sens. Jim Webb of Virginia and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island both quit the contest after their poor showings.That opened up the two-hour program for a longer, deeper series of exchanges. But that didn't mean they broke a lot of new substantive ground. Much of the conversation touched on issues they had covered before.Clinton again attacked Sanders on guns, one of the few areas where she is to the left of the Vermont senator.“There are different records,” Clinton said. “I know that Sen. Sanders had a different vote than I did when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers. That was a terrible mistake. It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate legislators, not just in Washington but across the country.”Sanders cited his votes for certain gun controls and said he would reconsider the liability issue.O'Malley said Clinton had her own consistency problems, arguing she had repeatedly changed her position for political reasons. “There's a big difference between leading by polls and leading by principle,” he said.To the delight of the partisan crowd, all three candidates positioned themselves as aggressively pro-immigrant.“The fact of the matter is — and let's say it in our debate because you will never hear it from that immigrant-bashing carnival barker Donald Trump — the truth of the matter is net immigration from Mexico last year was zero,” O'Malley said in response to weighing immigration reform against the need for border security.“We've been focusing on border security to exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform,” he said. “Our symbol is the Statue of Liberty; it is not a barbed wire fence.”Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, drew one of the biggest laughs of the night from the university audience, during a discussion of taxes. All three candidates said they favored higher rates for well-off Americans to pay for such things as cheaper college tuition for students.“We haven't come up with an exact number yet,” Sanders said. “But it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90%.... I'm not a socialist compared to Eisenhower.”Barabak reported from San Francisco and Halper from Des Moines.

"Jeb Bush said the United States “should declare war” as it responds to the Paris attacks and the rise of ISIS generally.“You take it to them in Syria and Iraq,” Mr. Bush said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” when asked how the United States could expect to “defeat an ideology.”“You destroy ISIS,” he continued. “And then you build a coalition to replace this radical Islamic terrorist threat to our country and to Europe and to the region with something that is more peace-loving.”The host, Chuck Todd, asked Mr. Bush what he would tell an American public wary of foreign entanglements after wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. (Mr. Todd left unsaid the fact that those wars began under Mr. Bush’s brother.)“I tell the American public that a caliphate the size of Indiana garners strength each and every day if it’s not taken out,” Mr. Bush replied.Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, has long sought to establish himself as the adult in a raucous Republican field, and his supporters are hopeful that a greater focus on national security issues could provide an opening for a campaign that has badly struggled.On Sunday, Mr. Bush hinted at the shifting tenor of the race, with some prodding from Mr. Todd, arguing that “as we get closer to the primaries, people are going to want to know who can sit behind the big desk.”He was asked if he would trust Donald J. Trump or Ben Carson as commander-in-chief.“I don’t know,” Mr. Bush said. “The words that I hear them speaking give me some concern. “But he turned quickly to Hillary Rodham Clinton, seizing on comments she made during Saturday night’s Democratic debate. Mrs. Clinton said the fight against ISIS “cannot be an American fight,” before adding that “American leadership is essential.”“I’m more concerned about Hillary Clinton thinking that the United States doesn’t have a leadership role in this,” Mr. Bush said, after the question about his Republican rivals. “That’s my big concern.”",MATT FLEGENHEIMER,"Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, warned that the caliphate was gaining strength “every day” and insisted the United States must take the lead in fighting it in Syria and Iraq.","First Draft: ‘We Should Declare War’ in Fight Against Islamic State, Jeb Bush Says",http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/15/we-should-declare-war-in-fight-against-islamic-state-jeb-bush-says/,['foreign policy/national security'],"['Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Jeb Bush', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Chuck Todd', 'Donald J.

"DES MOINES, Iowa U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton was criticized in a debate on Saturday for her 2003 vote backing the U.S. invasion of Iraq, with rival Bernie Sanders linking it to regional chaos that aided the rise of Islamic State militants.The day after a series of deadly bomb and gun attacks that killed at least 129 people in Paris, Sanders said the invasion was ""one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the modern history of the United States.”""I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, unraveled the region immensely, and led to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS,"" said Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont.""I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now,"" he said.Clinton, who has frequently called the vote a mistake, said it should be placed in the historical context of years of terrorism before the invasion.“If we’re ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extremists, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq,” she said.The exchange came early in the second debate for Democrats seeking their party's nomination for the November 2016 presidential election, with the focus shifted to foreign policy and ways to combat terrorism after the Paris attacks.The candidates and audience at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, observed a moment of silence at the beginning of the debate to honor those killed in France.Clinton, the former secretary of state, has far more foreign policy experience than either Sanders or her other rival, former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley. But she was forced on the defensive early in the debate about her years of leading President Barack Obama's foreign policy team.Clinton struck a sharp contrast to Obama's comments in an interview aired on Friday that ISIS had been contained.""We have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network. It cannot be contained, it must be defeated,"" she said.Republican presidential contenders have criticized Obama for what they say was an inadequate response to the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In the aftermath of the attacks, businessman Donald Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz called on the administration to reconsider plans to allow thousands of Syrian refugees to be resettled in the United States.The White House aims to increase to 10,000 the number of Syrian refugees accepted in the United States during fiscal year 2016, from less than 2,000 accepted in the previous year.Clinton has always been from the more hawkish wing of the Democratic Party. Her support for the 2003 Iraq invasion played a major role in her primary loss to Obama in the 2008 White House race.The foreign policy focus was a dramatic shift in emphasis in a Democratic presidential race that so far has been dominated by domestic economic issues such as income inequality, college affordability and family leave.The Democrats returned to that theme later in the debate, and Sanders criticized Clinton for being too cozy with Wall Street and not being in favor of reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act, the 1933 law that established a firewall between investment and commercial banking.""Over her political career, Wall Street has been a major, the major donor to Hillary Clinton. Now maybe they’re dumb, but I don’t think so,"" said Sanders, who favors reinstatement of the act.Clinton accused Sanders of impugning her integrity and said reinstating the law was not enough to rein in corporate influence and reform Wall Street.""Reinstating Glass-Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough,"" she said. ""I go after all of Wall Street, not just the big banks.""With the political clock ticking to the first nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 1, Clinton has opened a commanding lead over Sanders, her prime challenger, in national and Iowa polls. O'Malley trails well behind, in single digits in most polls.

"There is plenty of anger swirling around the 2016 presidential campaign. Anger at Washington, disdain for Wall Street, disgust with career politicians. Anger is all the rage, and both parties clearly have candidates that are successfully riding the wave. Neither Bernie Sanders nor Donald Trump would be where he is without the substantial number of fed-up voters in their parties. Everyone can see that. It's obvious.But loathing doesn't account for the differences we are witnessing between the GOP and Democratic Party nomination fights. Fear does. Or the absence of fear. Although both sides are angry, Republicans are more angry at the Republican Party leadership than they are afraid of Democrats, while Democrats are more afraid of Republicans than they are angry at the Democratic Party leadership. That's why Trump and Ben Carson, extreme outsiders, are dominating on the right while Hillary Rodham Clinton, the consummate insider, is dominating on the left.This relationship isn't new: The extent to which fear of the other side tempers anger at one's own often determines the nominee.In 2004, when I ran Howard Dean's campaign for president, Democrats were seething at the Democratic establishment, which had voted with the GOP to invade Iraq. But this anger over time gave way to a very real fear that Bush would win reelection.Bernie Sanders' success on the campaign trail does not defy explanation in quite the way that Donald Trump's does — Sanders has not dominated the polls, for one thing — but it's improbable all the same. He is a 74-year-old grandfather with thick glasses and frequently disheveled white hair. And...Bernie Sanders' success on the campaign trail does not defy explanation in quite the way that Donald Trump's does — Sanders has not dominated the polls, for one thing — but it's improbable all the same. He is a 74-year-old grandfather with thick glasses and frequently disheveled white hair. And...As fear of Bush's victory rose, voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, who had been attracted to Howard Dean's progressive politics and willingness to take on the party leadership, moved to John Kerry. Venting, they realized, wasn't as important as nominating someone with a better chance to win.This year, fear within the Democratic Party of a GOP win is off the charts. The GOP has majorities in the House of Representative and the U.S. Senate. For Democrats, losing the presidency in 2016 would be catastrophic. With control of both the executive and legislative branches of government, the GOP would be able to roll back all of the accomplishments of the Obama administration and fill any number of Supreme Court vacancies, guaranteeing a rightward shift in the makeup of the court for a generation.Bernie Sanders can tap into the very real anger at Wall Street and Washington all he wants, but he's not going anywhere; the party rank and file isn't going to risk the 2016 election by nominating an untested democratic socialist. Fear has a way of making voters put ideological purity aside and rally around the most tested, most viable general election candidate: Hillary Rodham Clinton.The fact that many Republicans are probably snickering at those last few sentences helps explain the starkly different race for the GOP nomination. There is a complete absence of fear within the GOP rank and file right now. Having won the House and the Senate, having taken over most state legislatures, the party feels as if the wind is at its back. Are they sick of Barack Obama? Absolutely. Are they sick of Clinton? Certainly. But they don't fear either one of them. They're convinced that the country could not possibly want another four years with a Democrat in the White House.Any fear they had of Clinton was erased by months of pundits proclaiming her collapse, her fumbling response to the private server scandal and Sanders' surprising popularity in early primary states. GOP primary voters' opinion of her was so low they happily bought into the idea of her vulnerability, and still do.It's the absence of fear that is driving Jeb Bush into the ground and holding Marco Rubio, John Kasich and others from gaining any real traction. Why compromise for someone who calls illegal immigration “an act of love,” or someone who once supported a path to citizenship, if there is no way you can lose? Why not go with the guy who wants to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants, then let the “good ones” back in?Of course, there's still time for the GOP to get scared straight. As Clinton's strengths become more obvious, and they will, fear within the GOP will rise. Republican primary voters could abandon Trump and Carson for Rubio, Kasich, Christie or even Bush — just as Democratic primary voters abandoned Dean for Kerry in 2004.The establishment candidates just have to hope that fear will overcome loathing sooner rather than later.Joe Trippi is a Democratic strategist and media consultant who ran Howard Dean's campaign for president and was a media advisor to Gov.

Why do — why, over her political career has Wall Street been a major — the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton? You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.Here is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street. It ain't complicated. You have six financial institutions today that have assets of 56%, equivalent to 56% of the GDP In America. They issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages.If Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, were alive today, you know what he'd say? ""Break them up."" Reestablish Glass-Steagall. And Teddy Roosevelt is right. That is the issue. Now I am the only candidate up here that doesn't have a super PAC. I am not asking Wall Street or the billionaires for money. I will break up these banks. Support community banks and credit unions. That's the future of banking in America.DICKERSON: Great follow up because you — and Secretary Clinton, you will get a chance to respond. You said they know what they're going to get. What are they going to get?SANDERS: I have never heard a candidate never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me. I'm going to be independent. Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? they expect to get something. Everybody knows that.

" Hillary Clinton talked tough and played defense Saturday at the second Democratic presidential debate, as rivals questioned her record and plans to fight the Islamic State.A day after a terrorist attack in Paris, terrorism and foreign policy took center stage in the two-hour debate with questions from the moderator and criticisms from rivals often focusing on her record as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first four years in office.Clinton remains the Democrats’ clear front-runner, but the debate illustrated how she will have to answer for administration policy on terrorism and foreign policy. Clinton last month broke with the White House, urging a no-fly zone in Syria and doing more to help rebels there. But she can’t shed her ties to the administration, and Republicans are hitting her hard on her role.The debate also showed how Clinton retains considerable advantages. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, can’t match her foreign policy experience or command of world politics. Perhaps most important, neither is drawing sharp distinctions with her on anti-terrorist policies.Highlights:The three opened with a moment of silence for the victims in Paris, then talked about their approach to the Islamic State terror group.“It cannot be contained. It must be defeated,” Clinton said, a slight jab at Obama who said just before the Paris attacks that ISIS had been contained.“But it cannot be an American fight,”she added. “This cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.”Her two rivals were more assertive about U.S. leadership.“I would disagree with Secretary Clinton,” said O’Malley. “This actually is America’s fight. It cannot solely be America’s fight. ... America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.“Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of ... ISIS,” said Sanders.Republicans complain that Democrats won’t use the words Muslim or Islam in describing terrorists.Saturday, the Democratic candidates appeared to rally to the term Jihadi or Jihadist, which derive from the word for a holy war by Muslims.Clinton Saturday referred to a “radical jihadist ideology.” “I don’t think we’re at war with Islam,” she added. “I don’t think we’re at war with all Muslims.”O’Malley used the term “radical jihadis,” but also warned against labeling terrorists with the broad term of Muslim, saying that would unfairly brand the majority of American Muslims who are needed to help fight back violent extremism.Said Sanders: “I don’t think the term is what’s important.”EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIMO’Malley proposed allowing 65,000 Syrian refugees into the country, more than the 10,000 proposed by Obama, though he said they need “proper screening.” Clinton also argued for a higher number, adding “I said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine.”EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIMHillary Clinton: “I don’t think we’re at war with Islam, I don’t think we’re at war with all Muslims.”Bernie Sanders: “I’m not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,” referring to the 91 percent top income tax rate in the 1950s.Martin O’Malley: “You will never heard this from that immigrant-bashing carnival barker Donald Trump”EDITORS: STORY CAN END HEREClintonClinton had to defend her years as secretary of state. Moderator John Dickerson asked if the Obama administration underestimated the Islamic State threat. Clinton didn’t answer at first, then tried to tie the current crisis to President George W. Bush’s decision to end American involvement in Iraq. Each time she was challenged, Clinton would launch into detailed histories of the region’s turmoil and American involvement. Backers will praise her command of detail; opponents will contend she’s avoiding responsibility for being part of a team that didn’t take the Islamic threat seriously enough.Sanders He got off to a rocky start. He only briefly touched on the Paris terrorist attacks in his opening remarks before turning to his standard speech assailing income inequality and the corrosive nature of money in politics. Viewers then watched as Clinton and O’Malley devoted their entire opening statement to the attacks. Viewers may also have been puzzled when Sanders said that climate change is the country’s greatest threat and a contributor to the spread of terrorism. He also failed to gain traction out of his criticism that Clinton had voted for the Iraq War that he opposed.O’Malley O’Malley, who has languished in single digits in the polls, performed ably, holding his own with the former Secretary of State and U.S. senator on foreign and domestic policy, including health care and taxes. How would he pay for his policies? He explained. Can a former governor lead the U.S. in a time of global terror? Yes, he said. But he needed a breakthrough performance to attract new attention and enthusiasm to his campaign and his performance fell short.EDITORS: STORY CAN END HEREWall Street.

"Democratic U.S. presidential candidates Senator Bernie Sanders (L), former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley pose on stage ahead of the second official 2016 U.S. Democratic presidential candidates debate in Des Moines, Iowa, November 14, 2015.   (REUTERS/Jim Young)Hillary Clinton was put on the defensive at the opening of Saturday night’s Democratic presidential debate over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability.The debate in Des Moines, Iowa, came in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which thrust the issues of national security and foreign policy back to the center of the 2016 campaign. The debate format was changed to focus anew on those issues.But, citing the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa, Clinton’s rivals criticized her Senate vote for use of force before the Iraq war and appeared to criticize her support for toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley said America’s role is not to roam the world “looking for new dictators to topple.”He said it is also important to understand “secondary and third consequences” that come after removing a “single dictator.” O’Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a “mess.”Clinton defended her support for toppling Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a “genocide” and America’s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support.She also said “it is imperative” that the U.S. do more to confront the “arc of instability” in the region. And to O’Malley’s critique, she said, “I don’t think you can paint with a broad brush,” and “This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.”Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, referenced Clinton’s support for use of force in Iraq and said the “disastrous invasion” led “to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.”Clinton again called her Iraq war vote a “mistake,” but disputed that the war is the only driver of modern terrorism.The candidates also condemned the Paris terror attacks.“Our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough,” Clinton said.She called for global “resolve” to “root out” the “radical jihadist ideology” that motivates groups like the Islamic State. Clinton, a former secretary of state, said she would coordinate efforts “against the scourge of terrorism.”“It cannot be contained. It must be defeated,” she said of ISIS.Sanders blasted ISIS as a “barbarous organization.”O’Malley called this the “new face” of terror threats.The attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said. In a primary race otherwise dominated by the economy, climate and front-runner Clinton’s personal record, the debate in Des Moines, Iowa, now is expected to focus heavily on security and foreign policy after debate host CBS News reworked the format.  It is an area where Clinton, as former secretary of state, enters with the thickest resume – but also one that could prove problematic, given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable and chaotic nations like Libya and Syria.Sanders, after appearing to give her a pass at the first debate over her personal email controversy, has in recent weeks shown a greater interest in criticizing her record. But his focus on issues like income inequality could be out of place in a discussion focused on global security challenges. Sanders’ campaign objected to some of the CBS News debate tweaks, sources said.Clinton also enters this debate – hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register – facing a narrower field than at their first encounter in October. Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O’Malley.Clinton is seen to have otherwise strengthened her hand since that debate, making it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and seeing one of her biggest potential political threats – a late bid by Vice President Biden – disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.Sanders remains Clinton’s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.Still, the FBI investigation over Clinton’s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding. ",,,DEMOCRATIC DEBATE  2016 candidates condemn Paris attacks at opening,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate/,['foreign policy/national security'],"['Bernie Sanders', 'Muammar Qaddafi', 'Hillary Clinton', u""Martin O'Malley"", 'Jim Young']",fox,0.9318134445268402,[],2015-11-15 02:32:43,"['Senate', 'Al Qaeda', 'FBI']",1e6c60a4b3334c751ae09ef925cc938d,2015-11-15 03:00:05.529453
"Donald Trump has dramatically escalated his attacks on his nearest rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Ben Carson. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll may explain why: the billionaire real estate magnate is bleeding support among avid church-goers and women to the retired neurosurgeon. While the unconstrained Trump has a comfortable double-digit lead over the soft-spoken Carson, the data points to a possible emerging threat to Trump's hopes of capturing the party's nomination for the November 2016 election. The poll of likely Republican primary voters also shows that Carson is drawing strong support from the rural Midwest, including Iowa, which holds the first Republican nominating contest on Feb. 1. Trump, in contrast, is drawing strong support in the northeast and southeast.That geographical divide is significant, analysts said, because Carson's dominance in more socially conservative states like Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska reflects how his story of personal redemption is resonating strongly with evangelical voters. They traditionally play an outsize role not just in the first nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 1, but in Nevada and South Carolina, which also hold nominating votes in February.""If Carson keeps his nose clean he could win those states and could catch lightning in a bottle,"" said Ford O'Connell, a Republican strategist not affiliated with either campaign.Trump, who has topped national polls of likely Republican primary voters for months, has until now enjoyed strong support among the key constituency of low-income, blue-collar, church-going voters, who have been attracted by his image as a straight-talking political outsider.But Carson's similar appeal as an outsider taking on the Republican establishment has undercut Trump's support in recent weeks, and Carson has surged to the top of a few recent national polls.Carson's growing support with women and blue collar voters may explain Trump's recent attacks on his rival, said O'Connell. Trump has highlighted media reports questioning elements of Carson's personal story, and on Thursday he called Carson ""pathological"" and likened him to a child molester.""OUTSIDER VOTE""""Trump is desperate to consolidate the 'outsider' vote. The blue collar vote is very, very key to Trump's success in that. He has tried everything to shake Carson off and it hasn't worked, so he has decided to go nuclear,"" said O'Connell, an advisor to Republican Senator John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign.To be sure, a separate rolling five-day Reuters/Ipsos poll shows Trump surging to 42 percent of likely Republican primary voters, up from 25 percent, since Nov. 6 while Carson was flat at 23 percent.The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the polling data. Barry Bennett, Carson’s campaign manager, said of Trump's heightened criticism of Carson: “It’s hard to explain his remarks but clearly he’s feeling some pressure and overreacting.”Bridget Miller, 43, from Stilwell, Kansas, said she had initially considered voting for Trump, but had switched to Carson. ""Carson is pro-life; he's pro-gun; he's saved baby's lives. He speaks to a lot of our values here,"" she said.Other likely Republican primary voters say they initially supported Trump but his latest criticism of Carson and his ""child molester"" comments only confirmed their belief that he is unsuited to the presidency.Janis Anderson, 54, from Fargo, North Dakota, said she had considered Donald Trump, but his latest comments about Carson were “ridiculous.”Trump still either leads or shares the lead among most geographical and demographic groups, including wealthy and middle-income voters, people with and without college degrees, the southeast, northeast, the Upper Midwest and the American West.But the story is different among lower-paid workers. In September, Carson had just over 14 percent of support among voters in households with an annual income of $50,000 or less, according to the broader Reuters/Ipsos data. By the end of October, that had jumped to over 23 percent support. Trump's support in the same group was flat at around 33 percent.Among likely female Republican primary voters, Carson has seen his support jump since September from about 19 to 27 percent - the highest of any Republican candidate - while Trump's has slipped from 30 percent to 25.Carson's support among regular churchgoers has also risen sharply, according to the Reuters/Ipsos survey, jumping 10 points between September and November to 32 percent, the highest of any Republican candidate. Trump's support with religious voters has slipped from 26 percent to 22 percent.""As the campaign has evolved over time, Trump has begun to wear a little bit thin, especially voters who want a softer, more gentlemanly approach to politics,"" said David Gergen, an adviser to four former U.S. presidents from both parties. ""Carson is wearing better with women than Trump.""The surveys of likely Republican voters was taken from Sept. 1 until Oct. 31. The Reuters/Ipsos poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 to 8 percent.

" (CNN)CNN Opinion asked a range of contributors for their take on the second Democratic presidential debate held at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. Who were the winner and loser? The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors.This debate was more difficult for Hillary Clinton than was expected. Though she had opportunities to highlight her extensive experience and leadership skills, she was still thrown on the defense in two pivotal areas. On foreign policy, in the aftermath of Paris, she was forced to defend the record of the Obama administration in Syria and saw how this issue -- foreign policy -- could be turned against her. This, more than the vote in Iraq, will be a challenge.Domestic policy also remained a concern as Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley hit harder in her ties to Wall Street and more centrist views on some economic issues. Clinton still exits from the debate as the most formidable candidate in the group and the one best positioned to defeat the GOP. O'Malley continues to struggle gaining any traction and Sanders still seems too left for the party.But the debate was a warning. It brought out some of the questions that Clinton will face in the coming months. In the coming weeks, she will need to provide stronger answers if she wants a smooth victory in the primaries and the general election. Winner: No clear winner.Loser: Martin O'Malley. Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of ""The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society"" and co-editor of a new book, ""Medicare and Medicaid at 50: America's Entitlement Programs in the Age of Affordable Care."" The good news for Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley was that they shared a victory in this debate by criticizing Hillary Clinton directly and to her face, pushing back against the notion that Clinton's nomination is inevitable. Not if Sanders and O'Malley have anything to say about it.When asked about the role of Wall Street, Sanders, who has criticized the influence of big-money donors in American politics, said Clinton's many backers from financial corporations are seeking to curry favor with her.""Maybe they're dumb, and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so,"" Sanders said of Clinton's Wall Street donors. ""Why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something, everybody knows it.""Clinton, clearly stung by the statement, pointed out that Sanders ""has basically used his answer to impugn my integrity."" At issue was a call by Sanders and O'Malley to tighten regulatory controls over banking institutions by reviving elements of the now-defunct Glass-Steagall Act.  Clinton dismissed her critics: ""My proposal is tougher, more comprehensive and more effective,"" she said. But O'Malley called her ideas ""weak tea"" and the cheers Sanders got by taking her on suggest a sizable portion of Democrats want the next president to control Wall Street rather than the other way around. The Sanders-O'Malley duo also scored points by pushing for a $15 minimum wage, considerably higher than the $12 Clinton advocates. The recent nationwide strikes and demonstrations in favor of a $15 minimum wage -- which translates into an annual full-time salary of $31,000 -- show that Sanders and O'Malley are riding a powerful grassroots wave. If Clinton sticks to her $12 proposal, she should expect more verbal slugfests with her opponents -- and a Democratic base that may jump off the Clinton bandwagon if she doesn't move in a more liberal direction.Errol Louis is the host of ""Inside City Hall,"" a nightly political show on NY1, a New York all-news channel. A day after ISIS terrorized Paris in multiple coordinated attacks with guns and suicide bombs, killing over 100 and injuring hundreds more, Democrat frontrunner Hillary Clinton left doubts she's up to the task to protect America. In opening questions on foreign policy during the CBS-moderated debate, Clinton danced around her lack of accomplishments as secretary of state under President Barack Obama. When asked about Obama's Syria policy, Clinton said she disagreed with Obama's strategy from the start and warned him if the United States didn't intervene in Syria, our enemies would fill the void.  Clinton said the ""Middle East is a complicated region"" and ""the arch of instability."" Americans don't vote for a president to tell them what they already know. Clinton's textbook responses to foreign policy questions were rote. More disturbing was she couldn't point to any accomplishments as secretary of state other than advising Obama on Osama bin Laden's capture. Libya, Syria, Egypt and Russia all fell apart under her tenure. If elected president, Clinton didn't convince voters she would do anything differently or make America safer, which brings us to terrorism.When asked if she would declare war against Islam like President Francois Hollande has, Clinton replied no. ""We're not at war with Islam. We're not at war with Muslims.""  Yet, that's just the problem. Islam is at war with America and the world and we need a president who will finally acknowledges this, not one who shrinks from this challenge. Obama hasn't. In an interview with ""Good Morning America"" that aired the day of the Paris attack, Obama said ISIS had been contained.Over the last four years since the civil war unraveled in Syria, ISIS has taken root there, training Muslims from around the world to be jihadists. France has a large population of Muslim nationals, many of whom have freely entered the country. America, like Germany and France, have welcomed thousands of Syrian refugees. It won't be long before what happened in Paris makes it's way to our homeland. During the second Democrat debate, Hillary Clinton revealed her biggest strength may be her biggest weakness -- her foreign policy experience.Crystal Wright is a conservative writer who runs the blog ConservativeBlackChick.com. She also is a principal at the Baker Wright Group, a communications and public relations firm. You can follow her @GOPBlackChick.On a very tough night to talk politics, it seemed all three candidates were a little off their game.Hillary Clinton was well-positioned coming in to look tough -- and presidential -- on terrorism. But she didn't anticipate Martin O'Malley lurching to her right. ""It is America's fight,"" he corrected her, ""but not solely America's fight."" With Bernie Sanders attacking from the left, she was suddenly stuck in the middle, playing defense. On the discussion regarding banks and campaign finance, however, Sanders should have had the natural upper hand, but he couldn't land a punch. Clinton won the issue in the room. Sanders also might be the first Democrat to acknowledge raising the minimum wage will have some negative repercussions, which I think will come back to haunt him.O'Malley had some blunders as well. He floated a frightening 70% tax rate on the wealthy, unprompted. He walked into a critique from Sanders on the safety of Baltimore, the city he ran as mayor. All told, they each had some unexpected highlights and some surprising misses. When Clinton loses on foreign policy but wins on the banks, you know it's a weird night.S.E. Cupp is the author of ""Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media's Attack on Christianity,"" co-author of ""Why Yo're Wrong About the Right"" and a columnist at the New York Daily News.  Two moments in tonight's debate clarified why Bernie Sanders won't assume the role of frontrunner any time soon.  In the first, Sanders reiterated his noble, but politically disastrous, appeal that we all stop talking about Hillary Clinton's (damn) emails.  It's the high road, for sure.  But by extricating her from a scandal that had bedeviled her campaign for months, Sanders has ceded the space needed for Clinton to take flight.The second moment illustrates the difficulty Sanders has faced in winning over African Americans.  When asked about Black Lives Matter, Sanders rattled off a bunch of standard statistics about incarceration and unemployment rates. Clinton, by contrast, acknowledged the profound pain that black mothers feel when they lose their children to violence, and she then paid tribute -- by name -- to some of the young men who have lost their lives to police violence.Winner: Hillary Clinton. She came across as shrewd, measured, and worldly.  Nothing about the debate tonight changed the fundamental dynamics of this race. Most improved: Martin O'Malley.  He spoke fluidly and forcefully about all manner of issues. He made a showing tonight; it just won't make much of a difference.Lastly, a note on format.  With just a handful of Democratic contenders left in the race for president, the conversation in tonight's debate sank reasonably deep into policy details. The kinds of zingers and gaffes that separate winners from losers on a stage of ten just don't count for nearly as much on a stage of three.  May the Republicans take notice and winnow their ranks soon.William Howell is the Sydney Stein professor in American politics at the University of Chicago. Once again, Democrats proved that they are the adults in this race by having a civilized, high-minded and respectful debate about the important issues facing our country.  They also demonstrated they are all better equipped to lead the nation going into the 21st century as we face unprecedented threats from abroad and an economy that needs continued Democratic leadership to fully recover and give middle class voters all the tools they need to succeed.There were fireworks as both Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley tried to take the fight to Hillary Clinton, specifically on her Iraq vote and her connections to Wall Street.  She swatted away the criticisms with ease, with facts, and demonstrated she is best suited to lead the country as president and commander in chief. On foreign policy, her knowledge of the issues, her grasp of the nuances involved in global diplomacy and her determination to implement unparalleled American leadership to defeat ISIS and radical extremist jihadists in the Middle East, put her head and shoulders above the rest, both in the Democratic field as well as all Republicans vying for the presidency. On economic and domestic issues, Clinton underscored differences with Sanders and O'Malley, again showing important nuances on positions such as the minimum wage, college affordability and gun control, showing her grasp of details and the ""weeds"" of these complex issues.  She showed her policies would put middle class families first while ensuring our economy can absorb them without disruption. O'Malley had a great debate, showing his passionate progressive positions, at times taking the critique to both of his opponents, but mostly agreeing with them on key issues.  While his resume is impressive and he has many accomplishments to show as Maryland governor, unfortunately, he was not able to have a sufficient breakout moment that will enable him to climb out of the single digits in the polls. Sanders continued to show his passionate commitment to liberal positions, focusing on climate change and income inequality, both of which are tremendously important to the progressive base.  But his knowledge of foreign policy and issues going on in the Middle East came up wanting and did not inspire broad-based trust needed to be elected as commander In chief.As an issue that is front and center, immigration brought out the best in all of the Democratic candidates -- an easy feat given the contrast with the ridiculous, unworkable, unjust and unelectable positions that are held by most Republicans. Importantly, Clinton was the first one to contrast all the Democrats with the Republicans and was the only one to defend President Obama's record.  A brilliant and important move to excite and mobilize the Democratic base.Overall, Clinton outshined her Democratic opponents, showing her proposals would pay for the opportunities and the level playing field that would help create more good paying jobs and expand economic growth for those who have been left behind.  And both Sanders and O'Malley took a definitive back seat to Clinton when it came to foreign policy, defense of the homeland and what it takes to confront the challenges we face, tragically demonstrated by last night's Paris attacks.

"GREENVILLE, S.C.–Sen. Ted Cruz brought his presidential campaign to an evangelical bastion here Saturday, travelling to a Christian college to hold a religious liberty rally that was shadowed by anxiety about the terrorist attacks in Paris.Mr. Cruz opened the rally at Bob Jones University with a moment of silence for the victims of the attacks and called for a decisive response to the Islamic militants who claimed responsibility.“This is an evil that will not quietly slip away,” Mr. Cruz said in his opening prayer. “We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism. This evil will no longer walk the face of the earth.”The focus of the rally, however, was the threat to religious freedom that many conservatives see in the U.S., an issue that is central to the Cruz campaign effort to win over evangelical voters. He is reaching out to people who believe their right to act on their religious beliefs is threatened by government actions supporting such social changes as the legalization of gay marriage and limits on public religious worship.At the rally, similar one Mr. Cruz held in Iowa in August, he shared the stage with Christians who think their religious rights were violated, such as Joe Kennedy– a high school football coach in Washington state who was placed on leave recently for kneeling in silent prayer on the field after games.“What kind of country have we become when kneeling in prayer is regarded as an act of civil disobedience,” Mr. Cruzsaid. “These threats are real and they are growing each and every day.”Mr. Cruz’s staff estimated that 2,500 people attended the rally at Bob Jones, a college that has a stirred controversy in the past for its treatment of blacks and gays. The school’s ban on interracial dating sparked criticism of George W. Bush when he campaigned here during the 2000 presidential campaign. That ban subsequently ended, and the college is reemerging as a destination for GOP presidential candidates seeking evangelical support.One of Mr. Cruz’s leading rivals for support of evangelical voters, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, appeared on the campus Friday for a town hall meeting with South Carolina GOP Sen. Tim Scott.The two presidential candidates provided the community with a study in contrast: Mr. Cruz gave a fiery, emotional speech that filled an auditorium; Mr. Carson was more measured and low key.For some in the audience, the violence in Paris led them to focus more acutely on the candidates’ ability to lead in a world crisis and prosecute a war on terrorism. For Janessa Fortner, a Greenville Republican who is inclined to support businessman Donald Trump, those developments raised new reservations in her mind about the low key Mr. Carson.“He’s not going to strike fear in ISIS,” Mrs. Fortner said. “Who would you want handling what happened last night?’’______________________________________________________2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll StandingsPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.

"Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, a New America fellow and author of ""The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN)Until now, Donald Trump has defied all the expectations. Most of the political experts predicted he would be one of the media-fueled candidates who have emerged in last few primary seasons, propped up by intense coverage and then deflated when reporters turned their attention to another candidate. The Donald has proven to be a much more durable candidate than they expected, maintaining a strong position in national polls as well as in local polling in key primary states such as New Hampshire. He has demonstrated tremendous savvy in keeping the media's attention for a sustained period of time, which is not a total surprise given his deep experience on ""The Apprentice"" as well as the dynamics of what I have called the click-bait primary, where incendiary statements are more likely to win attention than to receive widespread rebuke. But the Republican campaign is starting to enter a new phase where there are a number of questions about how Trump will fare. Now that the early phase of the competition will soon wind down -- a free-for-all primarily revolving around televised debates -- Trump will have to prove his chops if he is to win in Iowa, New Hampshire and the primaries that follow. The most pertinent question has to do with grass-roots organization. In less than three months, the voting will actually begin. When it comes to the caucuses and primaries, old-fashioned retail politics still matters. As Barack Obama proved in 2008, the winner of these contests needs to put together a formidable grass-roots organization to mobilize and bring out the vote.In a few states like Iowa, Trump's campaign has given indications that it understand this. It has brought on some talented figures and started to put together a campaign. In Iowa, Trump scored a success by hiring Chuck Laudner, the grass-roots campaign operative who put together Rick Santorum's surprise victory there in 2012, to handle his operations. But it is not yet clear whether Trump is willing to devote the money or can devote the kind of day-to-day appearances that the campaign will require, and how well-organized his strategic voter mobilization plan will be. Tim Fernholz reported, for instance, that Trump had not even purchased some of the basic voter information databases that are prerequisites for victory. Trump has made a point of saying he is self-funding his campaign, trying to draw a contrast with his rivals. While it is true he used some of his money, donations are still funding a lot of his campaign, and it's not clear how much of his fortune he is willing to commit to this effort, particularly if his odds of winning start to diminish.  Soon Trump will also have to contend with an actual establishment candidate. The leaders of the Republican Party are starting to coalesce around a main candidate, very likely Sen. Marco Rubio. Trump has thrived in part because the GOP did not yet have a central candidate upon whom to shower its resources and energy. The divisions and uncertainty that have resulted from Jeb Bush's poor run have opened up room in the campaign for some of the ""outsiders"" who have gained support. If party leaders settle on Rubio, or Bush somehow engineers a miraculous comeback, the pressure against outsiders such as Trump will intensify. The party leaders will do much more, through their candidate, to unload blistering political and personal attacks on opponents within the party. Most recently, The Wall Street Journal, a scion of the Republican establishment, published a scathing editorial about how little Trump seemed to know about what was in the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal.  When Trump responded by calling the editors ""dummies"" through a tweet, the paper stood by its comments. If Trump is able to transition to the next phase with his standing in the polls intact, the media still have a lot of exposing to do. Everyone who has followed him since he made a splash on the national scene in 1980s New York as a ""greed is good"" real estate mogul knows there is a long record to explore.Despite all the attention he has received thus far, the scrutiny has been relatively contained. Ironically, the fame with which he entered into the contest has diminished the incentive of some reporters to dig more deeply into his life. It is a contrast with candidates such as Ben Carson about whom the media didn't really know much. That made reporters more curious to figure it out. With Trump, and the assumption we know everything there is about him, there has not been as much investigation as we might expect. But if he remains a serious candidate, more scrutiny will focus on his failed business ventures and his rocky marriages. There are a number of important issues that have barely made it onto the radar. For example, a handful of reports have surfaced on how little Trump has given to charity over the years, a measure for the values of a wealthy person who has not been in public service, and the ways in which he has greatly exaggerated and misconstrued the money that he has donated.The Associated Press produced a scathing report in August showing how he has overstated his contributions, how they are small compared with others of his income status, and that they advance his personal interests. This record would not sit well with some voters, who are seeking a populist voice, especially from a billionaire candidate who is now insisting that the wages of workers are too high. His recent attacks on Carson, such as comparing what he called the neurosurgeon's ""pathological temper"" to the sickness of a ""child molester"" have offered a reminder as to just how nasty the thin-skinned businessman can become against his opponents.There are also questions about Trump himself. Thus far he has clearly enjoyed the ride. Yet it is not evident how he will feel as the campaign slog really gets going, with the brutal hours that it requires, and if he starts to fall from his plateau. It is not clear how passionate Trump is about the job and the kind of commitment winning a presidential race requires. He has already made some comments about his willingness to quit if he is not doing well. In October, he told ""Meet the Press"": ""I'm not a masochist. And if I was dropping in the polls, where I saw that I wasn't going to win, why would I continue?"" He gives off a different sentiment than some of the other candidates, such as Rubio, who are clearly willing to invest everything they have for as long as they are still viable. For those who have always doubted whether this is about promoting his brand name as opposed to promoting a vision for the White House, there are doubts about whether he might just be willing to fire himself if this process turned unpleasant. The brutal terrorist attacks in Paris this weekend are also a stark reminder of the immense security challenges that the United States and the world faces. These are serious times that call for extraordinary leaders. In this context, Trump's yelling and insults, combined with questions about whether he would really be up for this job, are likely to become bigger liabilities among voters.It is clear Trump has the potential to survive over the long run, and the state of the Republican Party might give him room to make it much further than anyone suspected. But the going is about to get a lot tougher, and the challenges Trump will have to overcome will intensify in the next few months.

"An unsettling yet telling split-screen changed the view of the presidential campaign Saturday night: three Democratic candidates who had come to Iowa to talk about domestic issues found their debate hijacked by a foreign policy crisis dominating the news from a world away.As metaphors for the last two presidencies go, the turnabout was apt: Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama came into office with domestic issues prime on their minds, only to have conflicts abroad hobble and frustrate their tenures.Foreign policy, and specifically her vote for the Iraq War, also frustrated Hillary Rodham Clinton in her unsuccessful run for president in 2008. Not even an ad that year asserting that she was most experienced to take the 3 a.m. crisis call—the implication being that Obama wasn’t—was enough to overcome Democrats' embrace of his early opposition to the war.As much as anything, Saturday night's debate in the shocked aftermath of the Paris terrorist attack offered Clinton an opportunity to argue anew that her experience is necessary—and her opponents' is insufficient--for any 3 a.m. call. That allowed her to eclipse her rivals on stage, although in doing so, she may have created vulnerabilities a Republican could exploit next fall.As a former senator and secretary of State, Clinton spoke with fluency about the contradictory puzzle and complicated players in the Middle East, and the tensions there that already have spilled into violence on the European continent. She recounted her experience helping downtown New York recover from the Sept. 11, 2001, attack (weirdly, however, it was in response to a criticism of her closeness with Wall Street donors).Seeking to shake up the Democratic race and loosen Hillary Rodham Clinton's front-runner status, rivals Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley repeatedly challenged the former secretary of State on Saturday night in a debate where they largely agreed on most issues.The session at Drake University...Seeking to shake up the Democratic race and loosen Hillary Rodham Clinton's front-runner status, rivals Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley repeatedly challenged the former secretary of State on Saturday night in a debate where they largely agreed on most issues.The session at Drake University...When asked to recount a crisis that had tested her, she dramatically retold the story of advising President Obama to go after Osama bin Laden in 2011 despite concerns by many in the administration that the mission could fail. And, she noted, she offered the advice without consulting anyone, even her husband, former President Bill Clinton.It was that question, more than any other, that demonstrated Clinton’s advantage once the focus turned to foreign policy. By contrast, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley recounted the daily tribulations of a mayor and state executive, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told of a veterans' bill, one in which he was not successful in achieving his initial goal and had to negotiate a compromise.Indeed, discomfort on the part of Sanders and O'Malley was palpable from the start. After a moment of silence for the victims in Paris, the candidates moved to opening statements. Speaking before Clinton, Sanders jumped quickly into his familiar arguments about a ""rigged economy,"" a ""corrupt campaign finance system"" and the need for millions of Americans to stand and say that ""enough is enough.""Speaking after Clinton, O’Malley averred that the Paris attacks showed the need for ""new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership."" But he did not offer any of the first two, and on the third, his mention that he worried about terrorism as a governor only underscored his lack of front-line international experience.Clinton went right to the point.""We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, the barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist, terrorist group,"" she said, adding pointedly: ""This election is not only about electing a president. It's also about choosing our next commander in chief.""Clinton did not offer many operational details, apart from working with American allies on a united anti-jihadist front. But neither did her opponents.The Democratic frontrunner undoubtedly would have received a rougher going-over had the debate been against a Republican free to oppose her actions as secretary of State from a perspective 180 degrees opposite hers (and all of the GOP candidates' views are.) Her weakest moment came in a muddled response to an obvious question about President Obama's failure—and hers--to anticipate the powerful rise of the Islamic State militants. That's a point Republicans are sure to hammer.Clinton seemed intent on carefully navigating her party's shoals. She mildly distanced herself from Obama’s ill-timed assertion—delivered just before the Paris attack—that the Islamic State was contained. ""It cannot be contained, it must be defeated,"" she said.But she immediately moved to calm the left: ""What the president has consistently said--which I agree with--is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS,"" she said, citing the U.S. forces training Arab and Kurdish militaries. ""But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential."" She mentioned the limits of American involvement twice.The Democratic counter to Clinton was far more difficult to make, giving the debate performances of Sanders and O'Malley the feel of a collection of pulled punches.Sanders has ridden a wave of support from the party's liberal left. Flaying Clinton for being insufficiently aggressive against the Islamic State and other terrorist groups would have inevitably risked a collision with the anti-interventionist views of his supporters, which by all evidence the senator ardently shares. O'Malley, with no clear path to the nomination besides his generational pitch, was effectively in the same fix.Neither candidate, for example, explicitly hit Clinton on one of the most significant events of her tenure as secretary of State, the loss of four Americans at the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya. Republicans have argued that attack would have been prevented by a more aggressive posture.The irony of terrorism and foreign policy overtaking a Democratic debate is that the party's candidates have largely avoided the subject this election cycle.Republicans have brawled over the level of aggression each would apply in the Mideast, with several candidates advocating no-fly zones that would put the country's military in direct conflict with Russian planes operating over Syria. Several also have advocated a sharp rise in American troops overseas.But for Democrats, the subject has been far more fraught. Obama came to office in the aftermath of Bush's intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan and vowed to disentangle America from both fights. He has since disappointed some of his followers by announcing that he would keep at least 5,500 troops in Afghanistan beyond the previously announced 2016 withdrawal. He also said recently that he would send special operations troops to Syria to assist rebels there --language that uncomfortably echoes the beginning of involvements in past military theaters.So for the Democratic candidates there had been no real primary season rationale for a focus on foreign policy. The first Democratic debate stuck to the candidates' nuanced differences on issues like economic policy, healthcare and criminal justice, and their agreements on matters such as changing immigration policy and raising the minimum wage.Then Paris exploded in violence.Whether terrorism will remain at the forefront of the campaign is impossible to predict, given that nearly a year remains before the election. But if it happens, more detail will be required from both the Democrats and Republicans seeking the White House.Ironically, as the candidates spoke to a country shaken by the Paris attack and wondering if it could happen here, one question was left unasked Saturday night: If France couldn't find a handful of terrorists in a country of 66 million people, how would the next president find them in a country of 320 million?cathleen.decker@latimes.comFor political news and analysis, follow me on Twitter: @cathleendecker .

"Republican presidential candidates have criticized Democratic White House hopeful Hillary Clinton for decliningÂ to use term such as âradical Islam” and “Islamic terrorism”Â to describe the extremists who have unleashed a string of terrorist attacks on Western targets recently.Asked at the second Democratic debate on Saturday night whether the U.S. was âat war with radical Islam,â Ms. Clinton drew a distinction between the worldâs 1.6 billion Muslims and those who commit acts of violent extremism.âI donât think weâre at war with Islam. I donât think weâre at war with all Muslims,â she said. âI think weâre at war with jihadists. We are at war with violent extremism. We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression, and yes, we are at war with those people, but I donât want us to be painting with too broad a brush.âShe recounted admiringly former president George W. Bushâs call forÂ tolerance in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.âIslam is peace,â Mr. Bush said in a speech at the Islamic Center of Washington, D.C. the week after the attacks.Mrs. Clinton’sÂ answer prompted reproach from Republicans who insisted she use the phrase, âradical Islam.âFormer Arkansas governor and Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee on Twitter mocked Democrats, writing âSay it with me: âIslamic Terrorism.ââ Carly Fiorina wrote on Twitter that unlike Hillary Clinton, she would use the phrase âIslamic terrorism.âYou’re all grown up now. You can do it. Three words. Ten syllables. Say it with me: “Radical Islamic terrorism.” #DemDebateâ Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) November 15, 2015We need a President who will see and speak and act on the truth…Hillary Clinton will not call this Islamic terrorism. I will.â Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) November 15, 2015On Sunday morning, Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who has put an aggressive foreign policy at the center of his presidential campaign, called the fight against terrorism âa clash of civilizationsâ and said he was baffled by Ms. Clintonâs reluctance to use the term âradical Islam.ââI donât understand it. That would be like saying we werenât at war with Nazis, because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but werenât violent themselves,â he said. âWe are at war with radical Islam, with an interpretation of Islam by a significant number of people around the world, who they believe now justifies them in killing those who donât agree with their ideology.âAnd on CNN on Sunday morning, Former Florida governor and Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said, âI know what Islamic terrorism is. This is not a question of religion. This is a political ideology that has co-opted a religion. And I think it’s more than acceptable just to call it for what it is and then organize an effort to destroy it.âHe also described the fight against terrorism as âa fight for Western civilization.âAbout 1% of the U.S. population are Muslims, according to the Pew Research Center.Â About 26% are evangelical Protestants, a group who hold considerably influence among the GOP primary electorate in the early nominating states of Iowa and South Carolina.______________________________________________________2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll StandingsPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.

"A women takes a photo while standing on the stage for Saturday night's Democratic presidential debate between Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt,, Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, Friday, Nov. 13, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)The Democratic presidential candidates faced off for their second debate Saturday night, with the issues of terrorism and national security thrust back into the spotlight in the wake of the deadly Paris attacks.All three candidates have weighed in on the tragedy, condemning the attacks for which the Islamic State has claimed responsibility. The attacks across multiple locations in the city killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said.  In a primary race otherwise dominated by the economy, climate and front-runner Hillary Clinton’s personal record, the debate in Des Moines, Iowa, now is expected to focus heavily on security and foreign policy after debate host CBS News reworked the format.   It is an area where Clinton, as former secretary of state, enters with the thickest resume – but also one that could prove problematic, given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable and chaotic nations like Libya and Syria.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, after appearing to give her a pass at the first debate over her personal email controversy, has in recent weeks shown a greater interest in criticizing her record. But his focus on issues like income inequality could be out of place in a discussion focused on global security challenges.Clinton also enters this debate – hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register – facing a narrower field than at their first encounter in October. Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley.Clinton is seen to have otherwise strengthened her hand since that debate, making it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and seeing one of her biggest potential political threats – a late bid by Vice President Biden – disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.Sanders remains Clinton’s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.Still, the FBI investigation over Clinton’s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding.",,"The Democratic presidential candidates faced off for their second debate Saturday night, with the issues of terrorism and national security thrust back into the spotlight in the wake of the deadly Paris attacks.",Democratic 2016 candidates face off for 2nd debate,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/TEOgoe910VE/,['foreign policy/national security'],"['Bernie Sanders', 'Charlie Neibergall', 'Hillary Clinton', u""Martin O'Malley"", 'Hillary Rodham Clinton']",fox,0.8547615578685663,[],2015-11-15 02:02:16,['FBI'],16cb890d4d44df5c90d0eef0d397081f,2015-11-15 02:15:49.625467
"Republican candidates for president called on the Obama administration to tighten border controls amid reports that one of the suicide bombers who carried outÂ Fridayâs attacks in Paris may have entered Europe as a Syrian migrant.Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee said President Barack Obama should âclose our borders.ââIf a left-wing politically-correct country like France will close its borders, it’s time for us to put a moratorium on people coming here from countries where there are ISIS or al Qaeda ties,â he told CNN on Saturday.Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, another GOP presidential candidate, said the difficulty of running background checks on Syrian refugees should preclude further migration from Syria into the U.S.âYou canât pick up the phone and call Syria, and thatâs one of the reasons why I said we wonât be able to take more refugees,â he said on ABC on Sunday.He added: âYou can have 1,000 people come in, and 999 of them are just poor people fleeing oppression and violence, but one of them is an ISIS fighter. If thatâs the case, you have a problem, and there is no way to vet that out.âThe news that one of the bombers may have entered Europe amidst the flood of Middle Eastern refugees has galvanized opponents of Chancellor Angela Merkelâs open-door policy, with critics saying migrants represented a grave security threat.Jeb Bush, whose support for legal status for undocumented immigrants in the U.S. puts him at odds with the mainstream of the Republican Party, said the U.S. had the capacity to screen refugees based on their religion.âWe do that all the time. We do that,â he said on CNN on Sunday. âIt takes almost a year for a refugee to be processed into the United States.”He called for the U.S. to take a âlimited numberâ and to prioritize Christians who are fleeing religiously motivated persecution in Syria.The U.S. is preparing to admit at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next year, a six-fold increase from the number currently in the country, the White House announced in September.Ben Rhodes, deputy national security advisor to President Obama, said the administration had no intention of changing its refugee policy and said it had extensive screening procedures already in place for all Syrian refugees entering the U.S.âThere’s a very careful vetting process that includes our intelligence community, our national Counterterrorism Center, the Department of Homeland Security,â he said on NBC on Sunday.âWe need to sort out how to focus on the terrorists that we need to keep out of the country. But I think we do need to do our part to take those refugees who are in need.â______________________________________________________2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll StandingsPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.

"(Updates with comments from candidates)By John Whitesides and Amanda BeckerDES MOINES, Iowa Nov 14 U.S. Democraticpresidential front-runner Hillary Clinton was criticized in adebate on Saturday for her 2003 vote backing the U.S. invasionof Iraq, with rival Bernie Sanders linking it to regional chaosthat aided the rise of Islamic State militants.The day after a series of deadly bomb and gun attacks thatkilled at least 129 people in Paris, Sanders said the invasionwas ""one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the modernhistory of the United States.""""I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq,something that I strongly opposed, unraveled the regionimmensely, and led to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS,"" saidSanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont.""I don't think any sensible person would disagree that theinvasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we areseeing right now,"" he said.Clinton, who has frequently called the vote a mistake, saidit should be placed in the historical context of years ofterrorism before the invasion.""If we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed byjihadi extremists, we need to understand it and realize that ithas antecedents to what happened in Iraq,"" she said.The exchange came early in the second debate for Democratsseeking their party's nomination for the November 2016presidential election, with the focus shifted to foreign policyand ways to combat terrorism after the Paris attacks.The candidates and audience at Drake University in DesMoines, Iowa, observed a moment of silence at the beginning ofthe debate to honor those killed in France.Clinton, the former secretary of state, has far more foreignpolicy experience than either Sanders or her other rival, formerMaryland Governor Martin O'Malley. But she was forced on thedefensive early in the debate about her years of leadingPresident Barack Obama's foreign policy team.Clinton struck a sharp contrast to Obama's comments in aninterview aired on Friday that ISIS had been contained.""We have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of aninternational terror network. It cannot be contained, it must bedefeated,"" she said.Republican presidential contenders have criticized Obama forwhat they say was an inadequate response to the rise of IslamicState in Iraq and Syria. In the aftermath of the attacks,businessman Donald Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz called on theadministration to reconsider plans to allow thousands of Syrianrefugees to be resettled in the United States.The White House aims to increase to 10,000 the number ofSyrian refugees accepted in the United States during fiscal year2016, from less than 2,000 accepted in the previous year.Clinton has always been from the more hawkish wing of theDemocratic Party. Her support for the 2003 Iraq invasion playeda major role in her primary loss to Obama in the 2008 WhiteHouse race.The foreign policy focus was a dramatic shift in emphasis ina Democratic presidential race that so far has been dominated bydomestic economic issues such as income inequality, collegeaffordability and family leave.The Democrats returned to that theme later in the debate,and Sanders criticized Clinton for being too cozy with WallStreet and not being in favor of reinstating the Glass-SteagallAct, the 1933 law that established a firewall between investmentand commercial banking.""Over her political career, Wall Street has been a major,the major donor to Hillary Clinton. Now maybe they're dumb, butI don't think so,"" said Sanders, who favors reinstatement of theact.Clinton accused Sanders of impugning her integrity and saidreinstating the law was not enough to rein in corporateinfluence and reform Wall Street.""Reinstating Glass-Steagall is a part of what very wellcould help, but it is nowhere near enough,"" she said. ""I goafter all of Wall Street, not just the big banks.""With the political clock ticking to the first nominatingcontest in Iowa on Feb. 1, Clinton has opened a commanding leadover Sanders, her prime challenger, in national and Iowa polls.O'Malley trails well behind, in single digits in most polls.

"AMES, Iowa A top aide to U.S. Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton said on Sunday that criticism of her remarks in Saturday's debate regarding 9/11 and Wall Street campaign contributions would not resonate with average voters.“They were attacking her for being too close to Wall Street,” Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri said of a tense exchange among Clinton, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, her chief rival for the Democratic nomination, and former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley at the party's debate in Iowa.“The point she was making, is that as a senator, she did things for Wall Street, particularly after 9/11, but she also spoke out as a senator and now when she thought they were going too far,” Palmieri told reporters.Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for the 2016 election, was asked during the debate about contributions she had received from the financial industry and whether it would affect her plans to regulate it.Sanders said Clinton’s response was “not good enough.”“Now, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something. Everybody knows that,” Sanders said.Clinton said Sanders had impugned her integrity.“I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked,” Clinton said. “Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan, where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.”Clinton’s answer drew immediate criticism from Republican operatives and on social media. Moderators cited a response posted on Twitter when asking Clinton a follow-up question.“I don’t think that this is something that caucus-goers in Iowa or voters are going to focus on,” Palmieri said of the state that in February holds the first party nominating contest.“It’s pretty clear where she stands on issues, and donations don’t play a role in how she’s going to come down on that issue.”For more on the 2016 U.S. presidential race and to learn about the undecided voters who determine elections, visit the Reuters website.

"As Donald Trump and other Republicans talked tough on illegal immigration during last week's presidential debate, an exasperated Jeb Bush noted that Hillary Clinton's campaign aides were, right then, exchanging high-fives.He might have added: And Republican leaders in many states, like California, were once again despairing.From the beginning of the summer of Trump, many Republicans here hoped he would disappear quickly, to limit damage to the party's image. Summer turned to fall, and Trump still dominates the presidential campaign. And so does the subject of illegal immigration, posing a mighty threat.How mighty could be seen in a USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll published last week. It demonstrated again what California sees in every election: The party's positions on immigration and other issues, like gay marriage, have cost Republicans a generation of good will and support. Here, the poll reminded, Republicans are limited mostly to older and white voters, religious voters and residents of inland California.The current brouhaha over illegal immigration is important because new voters will carry their views of the political parties with them for a very long time.""The experiences people have when they enter the political system do stay with them,"" said Jon Cohen, vice president of survey research for SurveyMonkey, the firm that conducted the poll. Political views ""can shift … but those initial moments are important and do frame how they see things.""Republican difficulties can be seen in three key areas.Young and minority votersThere's substantial overlap in the membership of these groups, and in their reasons for siding with Democrats and the party's candidates.According to the poll, 36% of voters ages 18 to 29 strongly approve of President Obama. Another 40% approve of him more mildly, meaning three-quarters of young California voters are on Obama's side. Asked whether the country was headed in the right direction, 40% said it was — not a majority but six points above the percentage for California voters overall.Asked whether immigrants strengthened or weakened American society, 7 in 10 of the 18- to 29-year-olds said they represented a strength. (Among those age 65 and older, a slight majority felt the same way.)Views among Latino, African American and Asian voters were similar. All told, three-quarters of black voters, almost two-thirds of Latino voters and 70% of Asian voters supported President Obama. By strong majorities, all said immigration was positive for the country. Latino and Asian voters were about as positive about the direction of the country as were young voters.Those voters receive a contrary message from the Republican candidates for president. To hear them, the country is falling apart, President Obama is an abject failure and immigration is a threat. (The USC Dornsife/Times poll did not test views on the president's healthcare plan, but polls taken since the measure passed showed that it is broadly popular among minority voters. The GOP presidential candidates regularly scorn it and pledge to repeal it.)Interestingly, young Republicans are not that different in some ways from their elders — their presidential selections were quite similar — but they, too, have more moderate positions on immigration, gay marriage and other cultural issues.The state's coastal-inland splitThe traditional California fight is between north and south. The political split is between west and east, coastal and inland.Take the Obama support rating: Along the coast, 61% supported him. Inland, only 44% did. Two of the most conservative areas of the state, the Central Valley and Inland Empire, had only a 46% and 34% support rating for him, respectively. In both places, strong opposition was by far the dominant view.Here's the problem: The Central Valley represents 19% of the state's voters, and the Inland Empire another 10%. The two largest Democratic areas, Los Angeles County and the Bay Area, make up 44% of the state's voters.Even inland, demography is cutting into Republican unanimity. A majority of voters in the Central Valley said that immigrants strengthen this country, and 43% of Inland Empire voters agreed. (Growing Latino voting strength everywhere in the state has pushed many inland Republican members of Congress to support changes in immigration policy opposed by their leaders.)Religion, or lack thereofReligion has long been a dividing line in politics — the more common attendance at services, the greater the likelihood of political conservatism. It was true in the new poll as well.About half of Republican candidate Ben Carson's supporters said they attend church at least once a week, the highest percentage for any candidate. Only 20% of Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton's supporters reported that they attend services at least once a week.The problem for Republicans? There aren't enough Californians who are that religious.In California, 28% said they attend services at least once a week, and 44% said they attend seldom or never. Nationally, 35% were actively religious, while 38% seldom or never attended services.Republicans might be tempted to write off California, but their problem is that trends that started here are spreading. In presidential elections, Nevada and New Mexico have become regularly Democratic and Colorado has turned into a toss-up state because of California-style demographic changes.There would appear to be two solutions: a rapid influx of inland church-goers moving into the state, or a shift by the candidates toward moderation. At this early point of the presidential contest, the odds of the former seem greater than the odds of the latter.cathleen.decker@latimes.comTwitter: @cathleendecker For more on politics, go to www.latimes.com/decker and www.latimes.com/politics.",,"<p>As Donald Trump and other Republicans talked tough on illegal immigration during last week's presidential debate, an exasperated Jeb Bush noted that Hillary Clinton's campaign aides were, right then, exchanging high-fives.</p> <p>He might have added: And Republican leaders in many states, like California,...</p>",Three key areas that give Republicans trouble in California,http://www.latimes.com/la-me-pol-ca-california-politics-poll-20151115-story.html,['immigration'],"['Donald Trump', 'Rodham Clinton', 'Jeb Bush', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Ben Carson']",latimes,0.9969839217021564,"[{'author_id': 41997, 'fullname': 'cathleen decker', 'primary_org': 'latimes'}]",2015-11-15 08:05:00,"['GOP', 'Congress', 'Los Angeles County']",5bf4d8ad78d9540c95882d1c5942fa1e,2015-11-15 08:26:25.829957
"Nov. 14, 2015: Hillary Rodham Clinton shakes hands with Martin O'Malley after a Democratic presidential primary debate in Des Moines, Iowa. (AP)Hillary Clinton invoked the 9/11 terror attacks as she defended herself against complaints about her Wall Street donations during Saturday night’s debate, a response that drew bipartisan criticism.The former New York senator made the reference after Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders repeatedly criticized her for taking money from the financial sector and questioned whether she had the independence to overhaul the industry.“I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked,” Clinton pointed out. “Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York.”Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus slammed Clinton for the comments after the debate in Des Moines ended.“[I]n a new low, Hillary Clinton shamefully hid behind the 9/11 terrorist attacks in a bizarre attempt to deflect attention from her ties to her wealthy donors,” he said in a statement.The backlash also surfaced during the CBS-hosted debate itself. Shortly after Clinton made the remarks, the moderators cited social media reaction, including a tweet saying she had invoked 9/11 to justify Wall Street donations.“Well, I'm sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild,” Clinton said.Sanders acknowledged she was the senator from New York at the time and did help rebuild. But he also said Wall Street has too much power.Earlier, he suggested Clinton would not be able to overhaul the industry given its support for her.“Let's not be naive about it. Why …has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?” he said. “You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.”Even Clinton’s former campaign manager, Patti Solis Doyle, questioned the 9/11 reference following the debate.“I do think that the 9/11 reference was probably better used when she was talking about terrorism. She was the senator when the 9/11 attacks happened. She was the senator when we needed to rebuild that city. And it would have been more powerful talking about terrorism,” she said on CNN.          ",,"Hillary Clinton invoked the 9/11 terror attacks as she defended herself against complaints about her Wall Street donations during Saturday night’s debate, a response that drew bipartisan criticism.","Clinton invokes 9/11 in countering criticism of Wall St. donations, takes heat",http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/vdZmq3POxBM/,"['campaign_finance', 'foreign policy/national security']","[u""Martin O'Malley"", 'Patti Solis Doyle', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Reince Priebus', 'Bernie Sanders']",fox,0.7299152360001901,[],2015-11-15 05:45:07,['Republican National Committee'],15a5a21203942c704b394e703f0091ce,2015-11-15 07:00:17.338498
"Senator Marco Rubio, arguing that the United States is “at war with radical Islam,” sharply criticized Hillary Rodham Clinton for declining to characterize the perpetrators of the Paris attacks in that way, invoking Nazi Germany to make his point.“That would be like saying we weren’t at war with Nazis, because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but weren’t violent themselves,” Mr. Rubio said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”At the Democratic debate on Saturday night, Mrs. Clinton said she was wary about “painting with too broad a brush” while describing Muslims and terror.“I don’t think we’re at war with all Muslims,” she said. “I think we’re at war with jihadists. We are at war with violent extremism. We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression.”Republican presidential candidates have repeatedly condemned Democrats like Mrs. Clinton for their reluctance to use the term “radical Islam” while describing how they would respond to the violence wrought by ISIS.Mr. Rubio, the Florida senator, also called on Sunday for the invocation of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which declares an attack on one member of NATO as an attack on all.He demurred when asked about the prospect of placing American troops on the ground.“I think it’s premature to say the exact numbers,” he said, though he called for an increase in the number of “special operators on the ground.”",MATT FLEGENHEIMER,"Attacking Mrs. Clinton, the Florida senator drew a parallel between members of the Nazi Party who did not commit acts of violence and Muslims who are not violent extremists.","First Draft: Invoking Nazis, Marco Rubio Hits Hillary Clinton for Not Saying U.S. at War With ‘Radical Islam’",http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/15/invoking-nazis-marco-rubio-hits-hillary-clinton-for-not-saying-u-s-at-war-with-radical-islam/,['foreign policy/national security'],"['Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Marco Rubio', 'Hillary Clinton']",nyt,0.6955656874739587,"[{'author_id': 358, 'fullname': 'matt flegenheimer', 'primary_org': 'nyt'}]",2015-11-15 15:56:02,['NATO'],16ad84a36862fa7f625bcbade71ca7be,2015-11-15 16:31:51.866074
"Republican presidential candidate and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said U.S. allies should invoke the collective defense clause of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in response to terrorist attacks in Paris.“This is clearly an act of war and an attack on one of our NATO allies, and we should invoke Article 5 of the NATO agreement, and bring everyone together to put together a coalition to confront this challenge,” Mr. Rubio said Sunday morning on ABC.French president Francois Hollande called the attacks “an act of war” and cited Islamic State as responsible.Former Florida governor and GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush stopped short calling for an Article 5 declaration, which is the formal recognition that an attack on one NATO member represents an attack on them all, and sets the groundwork for collective military action.“I think the president should convene the North Atlantic Council to discuss that,” Mr. Bush said Sunday morning on CNN. “If that’s what the French want, then, our longest and strongest and most loyal ally over our entire history, we should certainly consider it.”The only time the collective defense provision was invoked came after the Sept. 11 terror attacks in the U.S.Later, on NBC, Mr. Bush said: “This is a threat to western civilization and we should consider it that way.”The U.S. and France already work together in operations in Iraq and Syria, sharing intelligence and coordinating airstrikes.Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser to President Barack Obama, agreed with Mr. Hollande that the attacks in Paris were an act of war. He said the U.S. wants “to continue to intensify that coordination” with France.While France hasn’t invoked Article 5, NATO’s secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said members are ready to assist.______________________________________________________2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll StandingsPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.
