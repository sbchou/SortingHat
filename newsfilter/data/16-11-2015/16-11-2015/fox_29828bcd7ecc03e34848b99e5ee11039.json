(REUTERS/Jim Young)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\nHillary Clinton faced tough criticism Saturday night from her Democratic rivals over everything from her Middle East policies to her swaying stance on gun control to her Wall Street ties, at a debate that saw both Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley step up their attacks on the party\u2019s front-runner.\nThe former secretary of state was put on the defensive almost immediately, as she was challenged by her rivals -- and the moderator -- over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability. Vermont Sen. Sanders ripped her support for \u201cregime change.\u201d \u00a0\nBut while the Paris terror attacks the night before shifted the early presidential debate focus to national security, the candidates sparred aggressively in the latter half over domestic issues \u2013 especially financial industry reform and Clinton\u2019s Wall Street support.\nFormer Maryland Gov. O\u2019Malley called her the \u201ccandidate of Wall Street.\u201d\nAsked about her hefty Wall Street-backed speaking fees and donations, Clinton defended her independence in being able to pursue financial industry reform.\n\nBut Sanders shot back, \u201cNot good enough.\u201d\n\u201cLet's not be naive about it. Why \u2026has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.\u201d\nHe and O\u2019Malley, unlike Clinton, both want to re-instate a Depression-era banking law known as Glass-Steagall \u2013 and they both criticized Clinton\u2019s Wall Street plans as not going far enough.\u00a0\nO\u2019Malley called it \u201cweak tea.\u201d\nIn an eyebrow-raising moment, Clinton countered Sanders\u2019 criticism of her Wall Street donations by saying that as New York senator, she helped \u201crebuild\u201d Wall Street and downtown Manhattan after 9/11.\nClinton was later asked about social media reaction claiming she had invoked 9/11 to justify financial industry donations; Clinton said she\u2019s sorry that anyone had that \u201cimpression.\u201d\nMeanwhile, she said she doesn\u2019t think her rivals\u2019 financial industry plans \u2013 particularly to reinstate the Depression-era law that separated investment and commercial banking \u2013 would get the job done.\n\u201cI'm all about making sure we actually get results,\u201d Clinton said.\nThe debate in Des Moines, Iowa, came in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which thrust the issues of national security and foreign policy back to the center of the 2016 campaign. The format of the debate \u2013 hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register -- was changed to focus anew on those issues in the beginning.\nClinton tried to highlight her deep experience in foreign policy issues from the outset.\n\u201cThis election is not only about electing a president. It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief,\u201d she said.\nBut, citing the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa, Clinton\u2019s rivals soon turned to her record as U.S. senator and later as secretary of state to question her judgment in foreign policy matters.\nO\u2019Malley appeared to criticize her support for toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.\nHe said America\u2019s role is not to roam the world \u201clooking for new dictators to topple.\u201d He said it is also important to understand \u201csecondary and third consequences\u201d that come after removing a \u201csingle dictator.\u201d O\u2019Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a \u201cmess.\u201d\nClinton defended her support for ousting Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a \u201cgenocide\u201d and America\u2019s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support. And to O\u2019Malley\u2019s critique, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think you can paint with a broad brush\u201d in an \u201cincredibly complicated region of the world.\u201d\nSanders, meanwhile, referenced Clinton\u2019s Senate vote for the use of force in Iraq and said the \u201cdisastrous invasion\u201d led \u201cto the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.\u201d The senator also claimed that \u201cclimate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.\u201d\nClinton again called her Iraq war vote a \u201cmistake,\u201d but disputed that the war is the only driver of modern terrorism.\nShe and O\u2019Malley briefly sparred over America\u2019s role in fighting ISIS. After Clinton said it \u201ccannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential,\u201d O\u2019Malley said, \u201cThis actually is America\u2019s fight,\u201d though not \u201csolely\u201d America\u2019s fight.\nSanders staked out a different position in saying it is the nations in the region that \u201chave to get their hands dirty.\u201d\n\u201cThose Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort,\u201d he said.\nThe candidates declined to categorize the threat itself as \u201cradical Islam.\u201d Asked about that categorization, Clinton said only, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with Islam.\u201d\nAll the candidates on stage condemned the Paris terror attacks and vowed to take on the threat of terror.\n\u201cIt cannot be contained. It must be defeated,\u201d Clinton said of ISIS, appearing to distance herself from President Obama, who hours before the Paris attacks claimed ISIS was \u201ccontained.\u201d\nThe attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said. It brought the issue of terrorism to the forefront of both party\u2019s presidential primary races. Ostensibly, it is an area where Clinton enters with the thickest resume \u2013 but also one that could, as the debate showed, prove problematic given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable nations like Libya and Syria.\nWhile the tragedy hung over the debate, the candidates were able to tackle of range of domestic issues including wages and immigration.\nO\u2019Malley landed virtually the only shot of the night against Republican candidate Donald Trump, a favorite target of the Democrats, by calling him an \u201cimmigrant-bashing carnival barker.\u201d The Democratic candidates generally agree on the call for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the country.\nSanders, meanwhile, continued to advocate for a $15 minimum wage.\nBut the candidates were divided on gun control. While Clinton has tried in the past to cast Sanders as soft on the issue, O\u2019Malley accused Clinton of being \u201con three sides of this.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you ran in 2000, you said we needed federal robust regulations, then in 2008 you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying we don't need those regulations ... and now you\u2019re coming back around here,\u201d he said.\nThe debate was notable in that it saw Sanders and O\u2019Malley taking a more aggressive tone against the front-runner, who seemed to have strengthened her hand since their initial debate.\nSince that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O\u2019Malley. She also made it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and saw one of her biggest potential political threats \u2013 a late bid by Vice President Biden \u2013 disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.\nSanders remains Clinton\u2019s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.\nStill, the FBI investigation over Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding. Sanders appeared to give her a pass on the email issue at the first debate by saying he was tired of hearing about the controversy.\nSanders, though, stood by his comments at the second debate Saturday night: \u201cI was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email, I\u2019m still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email. \u2026 Let\u2019s go to the major issues facing America.\u201d\u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "Hillary Clinton faced tough criticism Saturday night from her Democratic rivals over everything from her Middle East policies to her swaying stance on gun control to her Wall Street ties, at a debate that saw both Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley step up their attacks on the party\u2019s front-runner.\u00a0\u00a0", "title": "Clinton hit by Dem rivals over Wall St. ties, Mideast policies at 2nd debate", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/V8TEBB0dgZ8/", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "immigration"], "people": ["Martin O'Malley", "Jim Young", "Hillary Clinton", "Donald Trump", "Muammar Qaddafi", "Bernie Sanders"], "orgs": ["Senate", "Al Qaeda", "FBI"], "election_confidence": 0.9974292038547423, "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-11-15 05:15:16", "org": "fox", "article_id": "29828bcd7ecc03e34848b99e5ee11039", "date_access": "2015-11-15 06:14:40.351600"}
