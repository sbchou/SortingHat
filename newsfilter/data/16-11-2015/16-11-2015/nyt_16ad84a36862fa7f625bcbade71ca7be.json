{"body": "Senator Marco Rubio, arguing that the United States is \u201cat war with radical Islam,\u201d sharply criticized Hillary Rodham Clinton for declining to characterize the perpetrators of the Paris attacks in that way, invoking Nazi Germany to make his point.\n\n\u201cThat would be like saying we weren\u2019t at war with Nazis, because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but weren\u2019t violent themselves,\u201d Mr. Rubio said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nAt the Democratic debate on Saturday night, Mrs. Clinton said she was wary about \u201cpainting with too broad a brush\u201d while describing Muslims and terror.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with all Muslims,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we\u2019re at war with jihadists. We are at war with violent extremism. We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression.\u201d\n\nRepublican presidential candidates have repeatedly condemned Democrats like Mrs. Clinton for their reluctance to use the term \u201cradical Islam\u201d while describing how they would respond to the violence wrought by ISIS.\n\nMr. Rubio, the Florida senator, also called on Sunday for the invocation of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which declares an attack on one member of NATO as an attack on all.\n\nHe demurred when asked about the prospect of placing American troops on the ground.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s premature to say the exact numbers,\u201d he said, though he called for an increase in the number of \u201cspecial operators on the ground.\u201d", "byline": "MATT FLEGENHEIMER", "description": "Attacking Mrs. Clinton, the Florida senator drew a parallel between members of the Nazi Party who did not commit acts of violence and Muslims who are not violent extremists.", "title": "First Draft: Invoking Nazis, Marco Rubio Hits Hillary Clinton for Not Saying U.S. at War With \u2018Radical Islam\u2019", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/15/invoking-nazis-marco-rubio-hits-hillary-clinton-for-not-saying-u-s-at-war-with-radical-islam/", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Marco Rubio", "Hillary Clinton"], "orgs": ["NATO"], "election_confidence": 0.6955656874739587, "authors": [{"author_id": 358, "fullname": "matt flegenheimer", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-11-15 15:56:02", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "16ad84a36862fa7f625bcbade71ca7be", "date_access": "2015-11-15 16:31:51.866074"}
