Until now,\u201d Grewal\u2019s tweet read.When one of the debate\u2019s moderators, CBS News\u2019s Nancy Cordes, read the tweet aloud, Clinton did not push back on the characterization. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression, because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild,\u201d Clinton said.Clinton\u2019s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, said that Grewal, the Twitter user, had mischaracterized the remark.\u201cThis is not in response to donations,\u201d Palmieri said. \u201cThat is what the person on Twitter did.\u201dThe point, she told reporters after the debate, was that Clinton\u2019s work as a senator in New York wouldn\u2019t make her less likely to pursue Wall Street legislation: \u201cShe was senator of New York during 9/11, and I think she was proud to help that industry recover,\u201d said Palmieri. \u201cBut when she disagreed with them in 2007, as she did, about the direction the industry was going in, she never afraid to stand up and say she disagreed with them.\u201d\u201cIt was the person on Twitter who connected it to donations. That is not what she did,\u201d she said.The exchange, among several forceful back-and-forths aimed at Clinton, began with a question from Sanders: \u201cWhy, over her political career has Wall Street been a major \u2014 the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou know, maybe they\u2019re dumb and they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to get, but I don\u2019t think so.\u201dClinton pushed back: the majority of her campaign donors make small contributions, she said, and 60% are women. \u201cSo,\u201d she said, \u201cI represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked. Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is.\u201d\u201cI did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat was good for New York. It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.\u201dPalmieri noted that in 2007, Clinton warned of the mortgage practices that led to the recession. This fall, Clinton also outlined a Wall Street plan that would tax high-frequency trading, close a loophole in the \u201cVolcker rule,\u201d and regular risk across banks and hedge funds.\u201cObviously she\u2019s got a plan now that a lot of people on Wall Street don\u2019t like,\u201d Palmieri said.\nLINK: Hillary Clinton Invokes 9/11 In Defense Of Wall Street Contributions\n\n", "title": "Clinton Campaign Pins 9/11 Remark Response On Twitter User", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/clinton-campaign-pins-911-remark-on-twitter-user", "topics": ["economy"], "people": ["Bernie Sanders", "Jennifer Palmieri", "Hillary Clinton", "Mandel Ngan", "Nancy Cordes"], "orgs": ["DES MOINES"], "election_confidence": 0.751130491896289, "authors": [{"author_id": 6688, "fullname": "ruby cramer", "primary_org": "buzzfeed"}], "date_written": "2015-11-15 07:38:18", "org": "buzzfeed", "article_id": "3bb75baf1b2131ea7a0738ce389b50c8", "date_access": "2015-11-15 09:09:13.497825"}
