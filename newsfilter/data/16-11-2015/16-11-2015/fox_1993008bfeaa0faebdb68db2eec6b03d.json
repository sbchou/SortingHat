Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley declined to use the words after being asked during the CBS debate whether they would agree with GOP presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio saying, \u201cWe are at war with radical Islam.\u201d\nThe front-running Clinton said using the term \u201cradical Islam\u201d would be \u201cpainting with too\u00a0broad a brush.\u201d\nShe also said the term was \u201cnot particularly helpful.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with Islam,\u201d Clinton continued. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with all Muslims. I think we\u2019re at war with jihadists.\u201d\n\nHowever, Clinton said the world is indeed at war with \u201cviolent extremists\u201d and those who use religion for \u201cpower\u201d and \u201coppression.\u201d\nGOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee tweeted: \u201cYou\u2019re all grown up now. You can do it. Three words. Ten syllables. Say it with me: \u2018Radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d\nThe Islamic State has taken credit for the three coordinated attacks in and around Paris that killed 129 people and wounded more than 350.\nFrench President Francois Hollande called the attacks \u201can act of war\u201d by the terror group ISIS, which claimed responsibility for the strikes.\nDuring the debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, Sanders said he didn\u2019t think the term \u201cis what's important.\u201d\nHe argued the real issue is groups such as ISIS and Al Qaeda, and their mistreatment of women and children, have become \u201ca danger to modern society\u201d and that \u201cAmerican leadership can and must come together to destroy them.\u201d\nO\u2019Malley, like Clinton and Sanders, also took special consideration not to offend the entire Muslim community.\n\u201cI believe calling it what it is \u2026 radical jihadis,\u201d he said. \u201cLet's not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our Muslim-American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here. They are our first line of defense. \u2026 We need our Muslim-American neighbors to stand up and to be a part of this.\u201d\nGOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush tweeted: \u201cYes, we are at war with radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d\nDuring the debate, Clinton also was asked about a December 2014 speech in which she said it\u2019s important to show \u201crespect even for one's enemy\u201d and to try to \u201cempathize with their perspective and point of view.\u201d\nClinton responded: \u201cIt is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking, what they will be doing, how they will react.\u201d\nClinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri told Yahoo News after the debate that she didn\u2019t think Clinton was getting a lot of criticism for remarks.\n\u201cI think she was really clear that we don\u2019t need to go to war,\u201d Palmieri said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to go to war with Islam. We\u2019re going to war with extremists.\u201d \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "Hillary Clinton and the other Democratic presidential candidates are being criticized for declining in Saturday night\u2019s debate to use the worlds \u201cradical Islam,\u201d following the deadly terror attacks in Paris.", "title": "Clinton and the other Democratic presidential candidates in debate decline to use term 'radical Islam'", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/iCqF8dYLSfs/", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Martin O'Malley", "Francois Hollande", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Jennifer Palmieri", "Marco Rubio", "Mike Huckabee", "Bernie Sanders"], "orgs": ["Al Qaeda", "GOP"], "election_confidence": 0.9805286484201229, "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-11-15 14:42:39", "org": "fox", "article_id": "1993008bfeaa0faebdb68db2eec6b03d", "date_access": "2015-11-15 15:16:59.194482"}
