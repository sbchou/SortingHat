{"body": "Hillary Clinton defended herself against criticism over the\u00a0money she has\u00a0raised from the financial industry\u00a0by invoking her job as a U.S. senator representing New York after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\u201cI did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York,\u201d she said, after finding herself again on the defensive over her perceived close ties to Wall Street. \u201cIt was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.\u201d\nThe unusual defense emerged during a feisty exchange over financial-industry regulation in\u00a0Saturday\u2019s\u00a0Democratic presidential debate hosted by CBS News. Mrs. Clinton also noted that 60% of her donors are women\u2014another effort to turn back the Wall Street fundraising attack from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who has emerged as a formidable opponent in the Democratic primary.\nJust as in last month\u2019s Democratic debate, the discussion Saturday of financial regulation turned largely on whether Congress should reinstate the New Deal-era banking law, the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated investment banking from commercial banking. President Bill Clinton played a major role ushering in legislation, signed into law in 1999, that repealed Glass-Steagall.\nSome critics say Glass-Steagall facilitated the financial crisis in 2008 by allowing large banks to grow, in effect, \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d forcing the unpopular emergency bailouts. They have pushed legislation to carve up the banks by instating aspects of Glass-Steagall, which the banking industry strongly opposes. Mr. Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley both endorsed that effort again\u00a0on Saturday.\nMrs. Clinton was more restrained. \u201cReinstating Glass-Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough,\u201d she said, adding that her regulatory-overhaul proposal is \u201ctougher, more effective, and more comprehensive,\u201d because it would target nonbank institutions as well as Wall Street banks and large depository institutions.\nMrs. Clinton implied that Glass-Steagall would have done little to forestall the bank bailouts in 2008 because many of the companies that either failed or required bailouts\u2014including American International Group and Lehman Brothers\u2014weren\u2019t big deposit-taking banks. AIG is an insurance company and Lehman Brothers was a standalone investment bank.\nCritics of the Glass-Steagall repeal don\u2019t agree with this view. They say it too easily overlooks the ways in which banks, particularly Citigroup, took on greater risks that fed increased risk-taking across Wall Street. AIG, for example, got into trouble because it had insured billions of financial products issued by more than a dozen firms\u2014some that had grown thanks to Glass-Steagall and some that, like Lehman and Bear Stearns, had remained standalone investment banks.\nStepping back from the bank-regulation arcana, there\u2019s a broader disagreement here. At the heart of Mr. Sanders\u2019s argument over the size of banks is the idea that they have too much political power, an idea that\u00a0evokes the \u201ctrust busting\u201d of President Teddy Roosevelt who sought to break up big industrial monopolies for some of the same reasons.\nWhy do big industries make \u201cmillions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something. Everybody knows that,\u201d said Mr. Sanders.\nWhen Mrs. Clinton said that she would break up banks if they didn\u2019t play by the rules, Mr. Sanders responded with disbelief that this might be in doubt. \u201cThe business model of Wall Street is fraud,\u201d he said.\nMr. Sanders pledged not to have any Wall Street representatives in his cabinet. \u201cOne of the problems we\u2019ve had\u2026whether it\u2019s Republican administrations or Democratic administrations, we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations,\u201d he said.\nMr. O\u2019Malley joined in when he said that Richard Rubin and Larry Summers, both former treasury secretaries for President Bill Clinton, wouldn\u2019t be allowed near his administration. Mr. Rubin has been a very influential figure within Democratic policymaking for the last two decades, and many policymakers that he has mentored have served in top positions for President Barack Obama.\n\u201cThey are the architects,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Malley.\nMr. O\u2019Malley was pressed to name who, exactly, would provide him with advise on financial regulation. He didn\u2019t provide any names. \u201cWe\u2019ll have an inclusive group,\u201d he said.\nFinancial regulation also emerged as a hot topic in\u00a0Tuesday\u2019s\u00a0Republican debate, and it showed how both parties have vastly different interpretations of what caused the financial crisis and, consequently, what should be done to prevent it from happening again.\nRepublicans generally have blamed government policies, from housing to the Federal Reserve, for provoking risk-taking, an idea that draws mixed readings from economists. They say that there is now too much government regulation, singling out for criticism the Dodd-Frank financial-regulatory overhaul, even though they have also tried to sound critical of Wall Street.\nThe clear winner in both the GOP debate earlier this week and in\u00a0Saturday\u2019s\u00a0Democratic debate: community banks.\n\u201cImagine America without its community banks. Well, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening because of Dodd-Frank,\u201d said former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in\u00a0Tuesday\u2019s\u00a0debate.\nAnd Mr. Sanders\u00a0on Saturday:\u00a0\u201cSupport community banks and credit unions. That\u2019s the future of banking in America.\u201d\n\n______________________________________________________\n2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll Standings\n\n\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops. \r\n\nCapital Journal Daybreak Newsletter: Sign up to get the latest on politics, policy and defense delivered to your inbox every morning.\r\nFor the latest Washington news, follow @wsjpolitics\r\nFor outside analysis, follow @wsjthinktank", "byline": "", "description": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton defended herself against criticism that she raised money from the financial industry by invoking her job as a U.S. senator representing New York after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.", "title": "Hillary Clinton Invokes 9/11 in Defending Wall Street Ties", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-invokes-911-in-defending-wall-street-ties/", "topics": ["financial regulation"], "people": ["Martin O'Malley", "Bill Clinton", "Richard Rubin", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Barack Obama", "Lehman Brothers", "Bernie Sanders", "Teddy Roosevelt", "Larry Summers"], "orgs": ["WSJ", "Federal Reserve", "Congress", "Dodd", "American International Group", "Goldman Sachs", "Capital Journal", "AIG", "Citigroup", "GOP"], "election_confidence": 0.8325589707651082, "authors": [{"author_id": 1142, "fullname": "nick timiraos", "primary_org": "wsj"}], "date_written": "2015-11-15 05:16:37", "org": "wsj", "article_id": "abb2681d02c742e0d300a81300445aed", "date_access": "2015-11-15 05:51:17.389493"}
