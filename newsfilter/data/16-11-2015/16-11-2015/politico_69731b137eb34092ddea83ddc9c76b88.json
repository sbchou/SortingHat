But the real target of their barbs was each other, as nearly every GOP candidate stressed their conservative bona fides on a topic that has fired up voters, powered the rise of Donald Trump and hobbled Jeb Bush's strategy of being willing to \"lose the primary to win the general.\"\nStory Continued Below\nAt the Sunshine Summit Republican gathering here, Chris Christie, Rand Paul and Bobby Jindal all tied the attacks to immigration on Saturday and raised the prospect that agents of ISIL had slipped into the United States already or could do so if the administration proceeds with plans to allow in Syrian refugees. On the campaign trail in Texas and South Carolina, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz did the same.\n\u201cPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2019s idea that we should bring tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees to America: it is nothing less than lunacy,\u201d Cruz told Fox News from the site of his campaign\u2019s \u201crally for religious liberty\u201d in Greenville.\nAt a rally in Beaumont, Texas, Trump \u2014 who expressed support for taking in Syrian refugees in September but later reversed himself \u2014 called the administration\u2019s plan to admit thousands of them \u201cinsane.\u201d\n\n\n\n            By \nNahal Toosi\n\n\u201cOur president wants to take in 250,000 from Syria,\u201d said Trump, inflating the actual figure, which is 10,000. \u201cWe all have heart, and we all want people taken care of and all that, but some of them are going to have problems, big problems.\u201d\nChristie rewrote his entire speech at the Republican Party of Florida\u2019s Sunshine Summit in response to the attacks, beginning with his account of the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, when he lost contact with his wife Mary Pat for five hours as she evacuated her office at the World Trade Center in New York.\nHe said that the federal government\u2019s failure to secure America\u2019s borders had left the country vulnerable to terrorist infiltration. \u201cOn an afternoon like this afternoon we wouldn\u2019t be worried about ISIS slipping across our borders to commit unspeakable acts of violence\u201d if the government had addressed the issue, he said.\nNoting that French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande had ordered the emergency closure of France\u2019s borders in the immediate aftermath of Friday\u2019s attacks, Jindal suggested the United States should follow his lead. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us here in America to secure our borders and keep us safe as well from these radical evil terrorists,\u201d said the Louisiana governor.\nEarlier at the summit, at a Friday evening post-speech press conference as the attacks were still unfolding, Carson said he opposed the admission of Syrian refugees into the country. If the administration does proceed with its plan to admit the refugees, Carson said, Islamic State leaders would be stupid not to try to plant terrorists among them. \u201cThat would almost be malpractice, you know?\u201d\nIn his speech at the summit, Paul targeted his Republican rival Marco Rubio as he addressed border security in light of the attacks.\n\u201cI think one of the lessons we should learn from the tragedy in Paris is that we have to be very careful, and very cautious \u2014 extraordinarily cautious \u2014 about who comes to visit, who immigrates here and who studies here,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n            By \nGabriel Debenedetti\n\nHe recounted the story of two Iraqi refugees who immigrated to his hometown of Bowling Green, Kentucky, and were later arrested for arranging to buy to surface-to-air missiles, saying that federal authorities do not do enough to screen out potential terrorists before allowing them into the country. \u201cWho in the hell is in charge of scrutinizing these people?\u201d he asked.\nPaul said he had attempted to strengthen border security by offering a \u201ctrust but verify\u201d amendment to the 2013 \u201cGang of Eight\u201d immigration bill that would have mandated an improved visa tracking system and greater congressional oversight of border policing.\nHe said that Rubio and Sen. Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, struck a \u201csecret\u201d deal to thwart conservative amendments to the bill. Paul\u2019s amendment was defeated and the bill itself died in the House.\n\u201cI don't know what Senator Paul is talking about,\u201d responded Rubio spokesman Alex Conant. \u201cIt would appear Senator Paul is trying to change the subject away from his dangerous isolationist agenda and proposals to cut defense spending. \u2026 Marco has been warning for months that ISIS terrorists could hide among refugees.\u201d\nNot all Republicans were ready to make political points in the immediate aftermath of the attack. The Republican opposition research group America Rising called off its rapid response to Hillary Clinton during Saturday night\u2019s Democratic debate because of its proximity to the attacks.\nAsked at the summit about the Obama administration\u2019s policies and the attacks, Florida Lieutenant Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, a Republican Senate candidate, took a pass, saying, \"It's all in poor taste today to be laying blame.\u201d\nMarc Caputo contributed to this report.\n\nBen Schreckinger is a reporter for Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Trump, Cruz and others say their rhetoric on border security and Syrian refugees has been vindicated.", "title": "GOP candidates link Paris attacks to immigration", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/paris-attacks-republicans-immigration-trump-cruz-215895", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Francois Hollande", "Alex Conant", "Jesse Rifkin", "Henry C.
