(Mr. Todd left unsaid the fact that those wars began under Mr. Bush\u2019s brother.)\n\n\u201cI tell the American public that a caliphate the size of Indiana garners strength each and every day if it\u2019s not taken out,\u201d Mr. Bush replied.\n\nMr. Bush, the former Florida governor, has long sought to establish himself as the adult in a raucous Republican field, and his supporters are hopeful that a greater focus on national security issues could provide an opening for a campaign that has badly struggled.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Bush hinted at the shifting tenor of the race, with some prodding from Mr. Todd, arguing that \u201cas we get closer to the primaries, people are going to want to know who can sit behind the big desk.\u201d\n\nHe was asked if he would trust Donald J. Trump or Ben Carson as commander-in-chief.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. Bush said. \u201cThe words that I hear them speaking give me some concern. \u201c\n\nBut he turned quickly to Hillary Rodham Clinton, seizing on comments she made during Saturday night\u2019s Democratic debate. Mrs. Clinton said the fight against ISIS \u201ccannot be an American fight,\u201d before adding that \u201cAmerican leadership is essential.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more concerned about Hillary Clinton thinking that the United States doesn\u2019t have a leadership role in this,\u201d Mr. Bush said, after the question about his Republican rivals. \u201cThat\u2019s my big concern.\u201d", "byline": "MATT FLEGENHEIMER", "description": "Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, warned that the caliphate was gaining strength \u201cevery day\u201d and insisted the United States must take the lead in fighting it in Syria and Iraq.", "title": "First Draft: \u2018We Should Declare War\u2019 in Fight Against Islamic State, Jeb Bush Says", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/15/we-should-declare-war-in-fight-against-islamic-state-jeb-bush-says/", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Chuck Todd", "Donald J.
