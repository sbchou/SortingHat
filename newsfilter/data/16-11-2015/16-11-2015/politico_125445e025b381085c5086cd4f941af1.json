From boos for \u201cgotcha\u201d questions and angry complaints directly from the candidates \u2014 sometimes right on stage \u2014 over debate formats, it\u2019s been a brutal run for some moderators (though a ratings bonanza for the networks).  The ferret-like journalistic questioning of CBS\u2019s John Dickerson, the moderator of Saturday night\u2019s debate and host of \u201cFace the Nation,\" represented something of an honorable mean between the contentiousness of the CNBC anchors at last month\u2019s unruly Republican debate and the cautiousness of Fox Business anchors at this month\u2019s GOP encounter. \nFew people expected many fireworks from Saturday night\u2019s Democratic primary debate. The horror of the attacks in Paris put a somber damper on the evening, dominating the first half of the debate. But moderator Dickerson and his fellow questioners \u2013 CBS News congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes, Iowa\u2019s KCCI-TV anchor Kevin Cooney and Des Moines Register political columnist Kathie Obradovich \u2014 were widely praised for being aggressive but respectful, concentrating on sharpening the exchanges and surfacing underlying tensions between the candidates. \nStory Continued Below\n\u201cYou said Sen. Sanders took a vote on [gun] immunity you don\u2019t like. If he can be tattooed by a single vote and that ruins all future opinions by him on this issue, why then isn\u2019t he right that your vote on Iraq tattoos you forever for your judgment?\" Dickerson asked Hillary Clinton at one point. \nThe question didn\u2019t immediately elicit fireworks, as Clinton quickly responded that her Iraq vote was a mistake, and challenged Bernie Sanders to say the same about his gun vote. But it eventually led to a revealing exchange between the two nonetheless.\nObradovich pushed Sanders on what level of \u201cjob loss\u201d he would consider acceptable in exchange for a higher minimum wage, and after he danced around the answer, she prodded further: \u201cDo you think job losses are a consequence that are worth accepting?\u201d \n\nDebate Night \n\n            By \nEli Stokols\n\nThe first hour was more uneven, as the candidates cautiously parsed their differences on national security in the wake of the Paris attacks. But Dickerson, who led the terrorism discussion, deftly cited aspects of the candidates\u2019 record and past inconsistencies to clarify their positions.\nHe smartly latched onto a 2014 speech from Clinton in which she said she \"could not have predicted the extent to which ISIS could be effective in seizing cities in Iraq.\" \n\"So you've got prescriptions for the future. But how-- how do we know if those prescriptions are any good if you missed it in the past?\u201d Dickerson asked. \n His tone, throughout the night, stayed calm and curious, only rising when it came time to cut candidates\u2019 off for a commercial break.\n\u201cIs the world too dangerous for a governor with no foreign policy experience?\u201d he queried a ruffled Martin O\u2019Malley. \nDickerson's question of the night, destined to become a GOP attack line, got all three candidates to dance around the term \u201cradical Islam,\u201d refusing to characterize the Paris attackers by their religion. \n\"Marco Rubio, also running for president, said that this attack showed in Paris showed that we are at war with radical Islam. Do you agree with that characterization, radical Islam?\u201d Dickerson asked, directing his question first to Clinton. \nThe Saturday evening time slot \u2014 known to be one of the lowest rated nights of the week for television \u2014 made for less engagement on social media than in previous debates. But CBS wisely decided to integrate the debate with Twitter \u2014 the candidates\u2019 Twitter handle names were plastered on each podium \u2014 and used social media to get the candidates to address real-time responses from viewers.\n\n\nOne Twitter comment, highlighted by the moderators, questioned Clinton\u2019s attempt to attribute her large trove of donations from Wall Street to her work rebuilding New York\u2019s business district in the aftermath of the World Trade Center destruction, something many reporters and political watchers were asking themselves. It was one of the toughest questions of the night and generated the most conversation on Twitter. \nThe move to integrate Twitter was widely praised by journalists and political watchers as, finally, the right way to integrate the social media platform. CBS, tweeted the conservative pollster and analyst Frank Luntz, \u201cjust used Twitter perfectly. That question about linking 9/11 and Hillary\u2019s donations was masterful.\u201d\nDickerson\u2019s performance also won plaudits on social media, especially for his calm demeanor.\n \"Boy, John Dickerson is really winning this debate,\u201d John Podhoretz, the editor of Commentary, tweeted. \n \"So far Dickerson has had a fair-minded but bracing question for each candidate so far,\u201d NPR\u2019s Ron Elving tweeted. \n Concluded Peter Suderman, a senior editor at Reason, \"I hope John Dickerson moderates a general election debate.\u201d\n\nHadas Gold is a reporter at\u00a0Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "In a tough debate season for TV questioners, the CBS moderator was almost perfect.", "title": "Winner of the 2nd Democratic debate: John Dickerson", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/cbs-democratic-debate-moderator-215898", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Jesse Rifkin", "Hillary Clinton", "Henry C.
