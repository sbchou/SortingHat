Yet about a half hour into a debate, the pall cast over the proceedings by the horrendous Paris terror attacks lifted and spirited sparring commenced. \nBernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley, desperate to reverse Clinton\u2019s momentum, pounced on her connections to Wall Street to put her on the stumbling defensive \u2013 exactly as the duo of Barack Obama and John Edwards did to deadly effect in the fall of 2007. But Clinton isn\u2019t nearly as vulnerable this time (mainly because neither of her tormenters is named Obama) and she emerged intact, if not entirely unscathed. \nStory Continued Below\nUnlike Clinton\u2019s nearly flawless first debate a month ago, Saturday night\u2019s skirmish exposed familiar weaknesses \u2013 a tendency to bog down in stultifying technocrat-ese when she\u2019s playing it safe, coupled with a penchant for spouting factually funky weirdnesses using the very same voice of authority she uses when making perfect sense.\nHere are five takeaways:\n1. Wall Street is Hillary Clinton\u2019s golden albatross. When not bogged down in the email saga, Clinton and her staff spent much of the summer trying to head off trouble from the anti-Wall Street, Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic party by producing a comprehensive financial services regulation proposal. It didn\u2019t quite work.\nThe plan, released last month \u2013 which included personal penalties for financial malefactors and imposition of a \u201crisk fee\u201d on big banks \u2013 was generally well received by mainstream liberals like New York Times columnist Paul Krugman. But it did little to assuage progressives who suspect she\u2019s a Potemkin Village sheriff \u2013 with big Wall Street guns like Tom Nides, Larry Summers and Robert Rubin lining up to run her economic team in the White House. \u201cNot good enough,\u201d Sanders said in his most direct attack on Clinton yet. \"Why, over her political career, has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton? Maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're gonna get, but I don't think so.\u201d\n\nDebate Night \n\n            By \nEli Stokols\n\nThe biggest wedge issue is the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act \u2013 which separated savings and investment banking \u2013 under her husband\u2019s administration 17 years ago. Sanders, Warren and many progressives view the repeal as the single biggest contributor to the reckless activity that led to the 2008 financial collapse. But Clinton opposes the repeal \u2013 even though it undercuts the central argument of her candidacy, that she\u2019s an indefatigable fighter for working-class Americans.\n2. Hillary said something really cray-cray. The pressure of the dual Sanders-O\u2019Malley attack on Clinton\u2019s Wall Street connections prompted her to say one of the craziest things she\u2019s uttered in public during this campaign or any other. When Sanders acidly pointed out that Clinton has raked in millions from the wealthy executives at Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, she riposted with a clever reference to gender politics: \u201cYou know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small, and I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60%.\u201d\nCool. But things got weird. Even though Bill Clinton had close ties to Wall Street (his Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin would go on to become head of Citigroup) and financial sector\u2019s donors ponied up plenty of cash for her 2000 New York Senate run, she claimed that the main reason bankers have flocked to her cause is \u2013 wait for it \u2013 because of the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center. \u201cSo I\u2014 I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked,\u201d she said, as the moderators from CBS gaped, gob-smacked. \u201cWhere were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy, and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.\u201d\nNeedless to say, the remark \u2013 delivered in her emphatic shout-voice -- raised eyebrows 24 hours after the terror attacks in Paris killed more than 120 people. And it\u2019s not likely to go away. A cascade of obligatory, outraged piling-on ensued: \u201c@HillaryClinton, you reached a new low tonight by using 9/11 to defend your campaign donations,\u201d Tweeted RNC Chairman Reince Priebus.\n3. Martin O\u2019Malley sort of won. It doesn\u2019t matter. When Clinton worked the rope line at her post debate party, a supporter shouted \u201cGive' em hell, Hill!\u201d according to CNN\u2019s Dan Merica \u2013 but it was really the poll-challenged O\u2019Malley who wielded the pitchfork. Languishing at 5 percent in the polls, O\u2019Malley has often found himself crushed between Clinton\u2019s mainstream support and Sanders hoarse populism, too marginal to attract her support, too polished to garner his. But he\u2019s found his voice, besting both during an energetic speech at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner a couple of weeks ago, and he was a confident and confrontational presence on the stage in Des Moines on Saturday \u2013 thwacking Sanders on gun rights and Clinton on banks.\n\n\n\n            By \nNahal Toosi\n\nHis best moment: When Clinton and Sanders were dryly discussing approaches to destroying ISIS, O\u2019Malley \u2013 reflecting the views of a deeply dove-ish Democratic base \u2013 offered an anecdote from the trail. O\u2019Malley told the story of a U.S. service member\u2019s mother who told him not use the term \"boots on the ground\" because, she told him, \u201cmy son is not a pair of boots on the ground.\u201d\n4. Bernie Sanders was bad on Paris. Sanders is an idiosyncratic candidate whose idea of orthodoxy is doing whatever the hell he wants to do. That\u2019s his big selling point as an outsider, but there are reasons why politicians play by a specific set of rules. As my colleague Annie Karni reported, Sanders staff wrangled with debate sponsors to keep his 90-second general opening statement from being replaced by each candidate\u2019s response to the killings in France. That elicited criticism from some fellow Democrats, including some Obama campaign veterans, but Sanders seemed intent not to let the crisis serial him from his core economic inequality message.\nClinton and O\u2019Malley devoted their entire monologues to the crisis, but Sanders offered about 20 seconds \u2013 two sentences \u2013 to express his shock and disgust before plowing into his planned speech. His transition was beyond awkward: \u201cThis country will rid our planet of this marvelous organization called ISIS. I'm running for president because as I go around this nation I talk to a lotta people. And what I hear is people concerned that the economy we have is a rigged economy.\u201d\n5. Emails? What emails? The Department of Justice \u2013 which seems to be widening its probe of the \u201chomebrew\u201d email server Clinton used at the State Department \u2013 may ultimately have the last word. But the debate\u2019s moderators, O\u2019Malley and Sanders were content to make the issue a non-issue. There was a grand total of one question on the topic, and Sanders \u2013 who garnered headlines simply by telling the Wall Street Journal that the DOJ probe was appropriate \u2013 reiterated his disinterest in Clinton\u2019s damn emails.\n\u201cThat's just media fluff. I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email. I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email.\u201d\nGlenn Thrush is POLITICO's chief political correspondent. \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Clinton shows vulnerabilities, Sanders sounds tone-deaf and O'Malley lives to fight another day.", "title": "Five takeaways from the Democratic debate", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/2016-democratic-debate-takeaways-215900", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Larry Summers", "Paul Krugman", "Jesse Rifkin", "Henry C.
