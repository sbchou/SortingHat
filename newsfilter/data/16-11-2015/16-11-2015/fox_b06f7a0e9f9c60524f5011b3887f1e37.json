(REUTERS/Jim Young)\n\n\nHillary Clinton was put on the defensive at the opening of Saturday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability.\nThe debate in Des Moines, Iowa, came in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which thrust the issues of national security and foreign policy back to the center of the 2016 campaign. The debate format was changed to focus anew on those issues.\nBut, citing the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa, Clinton\u2019s rivals criticized her Senate vote for use of force before the Iraq war and appeared to criticize her support for toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley said America\u2019s role is not to roam the world \u201clooking for new dictators to topple.\u201d\nHe said it is also important to understand \u201csecondary and third consequences\u201d that come after removing a \u201csingle dictator.\u201d O\u2019Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a \u201cmess.\u201d\n\nClinton defended her support for toppling Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a \u201cgenocide\u201d and America\u2019s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support.\nShe also said \u201cit is imperative\u201d that the U.S. do more to confront the \u201carc of instability\u201d in the region. And to O\u2019Malley\u2019s critique, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think you can paint with a broad brush,\u201d and \u201cThis is an incredibly complicated region of the world.\u201d\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, referenced Clinton\u2019s support for use of force in Iraq and said the \u201cdisastrous invasion\u201d led \u201cto the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.\u201d\nClinton again called her Iraq war vote a \u201cmistake,\u201d but disputed that the war is the only driver of modern terrorism.\nThe candidates also condemned the Paris terror attacks.\n\u201cOur prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough,\u201d Clinton said.\nShe called for global \u201cresolve\u201d to \u201croot out\u201d the \u201cradical jihadist ideology\u201d that motivates groups like the Islamic State. Clinton, a former secretary of state, said she would coordinate efforts \u201cagainst the scourge of terrorism.\u201d\n\u201cIt cannot be contained. It must be defeated,\u201d she said of ISIS.\nSanders blasted ISIS as a \u201cbarbarous organization.\u201d\nO\u2019Malley called this the \u201cnew face\u201d of terror threats.\nThe attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said.\u00a0\nIn a primary race otherwise dominated by the economy, climate and front-runner Clinton\u2019s personal record, the debate in Des Moines, Iowa, now is expected to focus heavily on security and foreign policy after debate host CBS News reworked the format.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt is an area where Clinton, as former secretary of state, enters with the thickest resume \u2013 but also one that could prove problematic, given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable and chaotic nations like Libya and Syria.\nSanders, after appearing to give her a pass at the first debate over her personal email controversy, has in recent weeks shown a greater interest in criticizing her record. But his focus on issues like income inequality could be out of place in a discussion focused on global security challenges. Sanders\u2019 campaign objected to some of the CBS News debate tweaks, sources said.\nClinton also enters this debate \u2013 hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register \u2013 facing a narrower field than at their first encounter in October. Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O\u2019Malley.\nClinton is seen to have otherwise strengthened her hand since that debate, making it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and seeing one of her biggest potential political threats \u2013 a late bid by Vice President Biden \u2013 disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.\nSanders remains Clinton\u2019s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.\nStill, the FBI investigation over Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding.\u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "Hillary Clinton was put on the defensive at the opening of Saturday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability.\u00a0", "title": "Clinton on defense over Middle East policies at Dem debate", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/TEOgoe910VE/", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Bernie Sanders", "Muammar Qaddafi", "Hillary Clinton", "Martin O'Malley", "Jim Young"], "orgs": ["Senate", "Al Qaeda", "FBI"], "election_confidence": 0.9311865151561396, "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-11-15 02:02:16", "org": "fox", "article_id": "b06f7a0e9f9c60524f5011b3887f1e37", "date_access": "2015-11-15 03:00:12.671185"}
