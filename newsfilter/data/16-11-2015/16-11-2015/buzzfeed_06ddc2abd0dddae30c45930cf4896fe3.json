Martin O\u2019Malley joined in when he could get the airtime, drawing contrasts on gun control, the Middle East, and Glass-Steagall.All night at the second Democratic debate, Hillary Clinton was a target. But in a brief exchange here at Drake University, the Democratic frontrunner volunteered her own major policy critique \u2014 casting a Sanders health care plan as an effort dismantle the Affordable Care Act and place legislative control in the hands of states run by Republican governors.Clinton, responding to a question about a single-payer health care, brought up a 2013 bill, sponsored by Sanders, that would replace President Obama\u2019s health program, as well as private health insurance and other programs, in favor of a universal benefits and coverage system.\u201cI've looked at the legislation that Sen. Sanders has proposed,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd basically, he does eliminate the Affordable Care Act, eliminate private insurance, eliminates Medicare, eliminates Medicaid, Tri-care, children's health insurance program \u2014 puts it all together in a big program, which he then hands over to the state to administer.\u201dSanders has advocated for a universal health care system this year, but has yet to detail a proposal specific to his presidential campaign. Clinton\u2019s comments on Saturday night \u2014 among the most critical she has made of any Democratic opponent this year \u2014 referred specifically to the senator\u2019s American Health and Security Act.Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton\u2019s communications director, said after the debate that the proposal should worry Democratic voters who worked in support of Obama\u2019s sweeping legislation.\u201cIt\u2019s something that she\u2019s obviously really concerned about,\u201d Palmieri said of Clinton. \u201cThey\u2019re tearing down Affordable Care Act and bringing the country into another big health care debate. That\u2019s not a great way to make progress.\u201dSanders\u2019s plan, Clinton told voters here, would turn health care over to Republican governors like Iowa\u2019s Terry Branstad. (The bill does includes a provision ensuring that, in the absence of a state plan, the federal government would implement one.)\u201cI have to tell you, I would not want, if I lived in Iowa, Terry Branstad administering my health care,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI think as Democrats, we ought to proudly support the Affordable Care Act, improve it, and make it the model that we know it can be.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not as if the ACA doesn\u2019t need to be improved,\u201d Palmieri added afterward. \u201cIt does. But don\u2019t tear it down and then let it up in the state\u2019s control.\u201dGiven the chance to respond during the debate, Sanders said the Affordable Care Act already grants Republican governors state control. His administration, he said, would make health care a citizen-wide right. \u201cWe don't eliminate Medicare. We expand Medicare to all people,\u201d said Sanders.Later on Saturday night, his campaign aides acknowledged the issue as a substantive difference between the two candidates. But they also suggested that Clinton had been unfair to suggest that his proposals would give more control to Republicans.Plus, his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, argued that support for Sanders, a longtime Independent, would help usher in more Democratic leadership.\u201cRepublican governors are a problem everywhere. They\u2019re a problem with Obamacare,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cYou know how we deal with that problem? We nominate Bernie Sanders to be president of the United States. We bring out millions of young people, working-class people in the political process, and we sweep those people out of office.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be anymore a problem than it is under Obamacare,\u201d said Weaver.\n", "title": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s New Hit On Sanders: Health Care", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/hillary-clintons-new-hit-on-sanders-health-care", "topics": ["health"], "people": ["Charlie Neibergall", "Jeff Weaver", "Martin O'Malley", "Hillary Clinton", "Jennifer Palmieri", "Bernie Sanders", "Terry Branstad"], "orgs": ["Health Care", "United States.", "ACA", "DES MOINES"], "election_confidence": 0.9222439747599511, "authors": [{"author_id": 6688, "fullname": "ruby cramer", "primary_org": "buzzfeed"}], "date_written": "2015-11-15 08:43:52", "org": "buzzfeed", "article_id": "06ddc2abd0dddae30c45930cf4896fe3", "date_access": "2015-11-15 10:08:31.051588"}
