Purdum\n\nBernie Sanders had the weakest night of the three Democrats onstage at Saturday night\u2019s debate. \nThat\u2019s according to a survey of the POLITICO Caucus, a bipartisan group of influential strategists, operatives and activists in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, who weighed in immediately following the second Democratic primary debate.\nStory Continued Below\nNearly half of Democrats surveyed said the Vermont senator lost the debate, and only 10 percent of Democrats said he won. Those insiders who said Sanders had the worst night argued that he appeared out of his depth on foreign policy a day after terrorist attacks rocked France. He spent just a few seconds addressing the matter in his opening statement before pivoting to his familiar pitch about the economy, in stark contrast to rival Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state who devoted her entire statement to the Paris attacks.\n\u201cHe made a mistake right off the bat in switching from Paris to the economy, and had an uneven performance,\u201d a New Hampshire Democrat said.\n\"He was clearly not comfortable discussing detail on foreign policy matters,\" agreed another New Hampshire Democrat.\nOthers said the self-described democratic socialist made no effort to appeal to the broader Democratic Party, and reinforced perceptions Saturday night that he is unelectable.\n\u201cFocused entirely on his base which demands the pure,\" said an unaligned Iowa Democrat. \"Worst answer: Asked directly how he would work with a GOP Congress, he argued that the Political Revolution would sweep aside all in its path.\u201d\n\u201cThe early primaries and caucuses are getting closer and closer, and he is failing to come across as viable and presidential to pick up the new supporters he needs,\u201d said a Nevada Democrat, who instead thought Martin O\u2019Malley won. \u201cTime is running out.\u201d\nAgreed a New Hampshire Democrat, \"Sanders showed he is just too out of step with middle America to be President.\"\nSeventy-seven percent of Democratic insiders surveyed called Clinton the winner, saying that of the three candidates on the stage, she showed the most presidential stature.\n\"It was a very good night for O'Malley but Secretary Clinton still proved that she is the most prepared to be POTUS,\" said an unaligned South Carolina Democrat.\nAdded a New Hampshire Democrat, \u201cNot even close; Hillary Clinton, once again, demonstrated her mastery of all issues both foreign and domestic; she was truly presidential. Sen. Sanders and Gov. O'Malley are both fine men, but their issue knowledge stops at the water's edge.\u201d\nO\u2019Malley, who took direct aim at Clinton over her ties to Wall Street and her record on gun control, lags badly in the polls, but insiders said he had a slightly better night than Sanders did, with 13 percent naming him the winner and 41 percent saying he had the worst night.\n\u201cO'Malley showed he deserved to be in that stage and should be taken seriously,\u201d a New Hampshire Democrat said.\nAgreed a New Hampshire Republican, \u201cHow could Bernie say climate change was a bigger threat than terrorism given last night? How could Hillary invoke 9/11 as a reason for accepting contributions from Wall Street? O'Malley seemed to be the only one that didn't have a tin ear!\u201d\nAmong Republicans, nearly half said Clinton won and were close to evenly divided on which candidate lost, but Sanders pulled the most votes on that question.\n\"He's the new metric for \"far left\" and it's awesome!\" gloated a South Carolina Republican.\nHowever, some Republicans flagged Clinton missteps that they expect their candidates to seize on, including when she cited her Senate work on behalf of New Yorkers following the September 11 terrorist attacks as a reason she has so many Wall Street donors.\n\"HRC will be reminded of several blunders from this debate,\" said an Iowa Republican, \"not the least of which [is] throwing 9/11 up as a block to the criticism that she takes quite a bit of campaign money from Wall Street.\" \nThese are the members of the POLITICO Caucus, not all of whom participated this week:Iowa: Tim Albrecht, Brad Anderson, Rob Barron, Jeff Boeyink, Bonnie Campbell, Dave Caris, Sam Clovis, Sara Craig, Jerry Crawford, John Davis, Steve Deace, John Deeth, Derek Eadon, Ed Failor Jr., Karen Fesler, David Fischer, Doug Gross, Steve Grubbs, Tim Hagle, Bob Haus, Joe Henry, Drew Ivers, Jill June, Lori Jungling, Jeff Kaufmann, Brian Kennedy, Jake Ketzner, David Kochel, Chris Larimer, Chuck Larson, Jill Latham, Jeff Link, Dave Loebsack, Mark Lucas, Liz Mathis, Jan Michelson, Chad Olsen, David Oman, Matt Paul, Marlys Popma, Troy Price, Christopher Rants, Kim Reem, Craig Robinson, Sam Roecker, David Roederer, Nick Ryan, Tamara Scott, Joni Scotter, Karen Slifka, John Smith, AJ Spiker, Norm Sterzenbach, John Stineman, Matt Strawn, Phil Valenziano, Jessica Vanden Berg, Nate Willems, Eric Woolson, Grant Young\nNew Hampshire: Charlie Arlinghaus, Arnie Arnesen, Patrick Arnold, Rich Ashooh, Dean Barker, Juliana Bergeron, D.J.
