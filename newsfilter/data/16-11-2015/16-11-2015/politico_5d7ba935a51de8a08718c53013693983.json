And we need to begin to take this seriously. These are individuals motivated by their faith.\"\n\nOff Message\n\n            By \nGlenn Thrush\n\n\u201cOf course, not all Muslims are not members of violent jihadist groups,\u201d Rubio added. \u201cBut there is a global jihadist movement in the world, motivated by their interpretation of Islam, in this case Sunni Islam, in the case of ISIS, and it needs to be confronted for what it is. This is not a geopolitical movement. It\u2019s a religiously oriented movement.\u201d \nAsked what he\u2019d do if he were president, Rubio called for stepping up support for the Kurds, whom he called \u201cthe best fighters on the ground.\u201d He also said he favored an \u201cincreased number of special operations attacks,\u201d targeting leaders of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. \nBut he did not endorse sending 10,000 U.S. troops to Syria, as his GOP presidential rival, South Carolina Sen. Lindsay Graham, has, saying it was \u201cpremature\u201d to discuss the exact number of troops needed.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Rubio sees a &apos;clash of civilizations&apos;", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/marco-rubio-paris-attacks-isil-215905", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["George Stephanopoulos", "Jesse Rifkin", "Henry C.
