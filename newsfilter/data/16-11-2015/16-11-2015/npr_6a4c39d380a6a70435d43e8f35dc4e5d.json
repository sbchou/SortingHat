O'Malley said he disagreed: \"This is America's fight, but not America's alone.\" We'll leave you with the two must-watch moments \u2014 a confrontation between Sanders and Clinton over campaign finance and Sanders cracks a joke about socialism: \nVIDEO: Martin O'Malley & Bernie Sanders hammer Hillary of her close ties to Wall Street #DemDebate https://t.co/Asvuvlak18\u2014 NowThis (@nowthisnews) November 15, 2015\n\n\n\n\nSanders 'not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower' https://t.co/GglqthV2EN via @washingtonpost\u2014 Revolving Skull (@RevolvingSkull) November 15, 2015\n\n\n\nThat's the quickie version of what happened in the second Democratic presidential debate of the 2016 race Saturday night.
