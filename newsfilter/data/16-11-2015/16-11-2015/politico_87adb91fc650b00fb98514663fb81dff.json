Clinton distances herself from Obama.Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state in the Obama administration, wasted no time contrasting with her former boss when asked about confronting Islamic State in the wake of Friday\u2019s attacks in Paris. \u201cISIS cannot be contained, it must be defeated,\u201d she said.\nOn Thursday, before the attacks in France, President Barack Obama said of ISIS, \u201cfrom the start, our goal has been first to contain, and we have contained them.\u201d \nClinton\u2019s tough assertion was an attempt to create some distance from that statement, as was her effort to remind viewers that early on, she supported finding ways to \u201ctrain and equip\u201d moderates in Syria, another break with some in the administration.\n2. Jihadists? Yes. Radical Islamists? No.Clinton was pressed on whether she would agree with the notion, held by many Republicans, that the United States is at war with \u201cradical Islam.\u201d But she appeared uncomfortable using that term, a dynamic on which Republicans on social media were quick to pounce.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with Islam, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with all Muslims, I think we\u2019re at war with jihadists,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2026You can talk about Islamists who clearly are also jihadists.\u201d\nShe went on to urge outreach to Muslim countries, and to praise former President George W. Bush for stressing, in the days following the September 11, 2001, that the U.S. is \"not at war\" with Islam.\nRepublican 2016 contenders were quick to pounce on Twitter. For example, Mike Huckabee tweeted: \"You're all grown up now. You can do it. Three words. Ten syllables. Say it with me: 'Radical Islamic terrorism.'\"\n3. Clinton takes heat over Wall Street support.Both Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley tore into Clinton over the support she enjoys from Wall Street donors. Her explanation\u2014that she has a record of pushing reforms on financial institutions, and has a tough plan to further rein in Wall Street, so her donors know what they\u2019re getting into\u2014is \u201cnot good enough,\u201d Sanders said.\n\u201cWhy, over her political career, has Wall Street been\u2026the major campaign contributor\u201d to Clinton, Sanders asked. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re dumb, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to get, but I don\u2019t think so.\u201d \nClinton suggested that part of her support from Wall Street goes back to the work she did as a U.S. senator from New York in the wake of Sept. 11, which directly affected Manhattan\u2019s financial district. The comment was quickly criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\u201c@HillaryClinton, you reached a new low tonight by using 9/11 to defend your campaign donations. #DemDebate,\u201d tweeted Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. \nO'Malley deputy campaign manager Lis Smith suggested she was personally offended by the suggestion. \"My dad worked in [World Trade Center] from the day it was built to the day it went down. @HillaryClinton, never invoke 9/11 to justify your Wall St positions,\" she tweeted. \n4. Sanders under attack on guns.Sanders was next up to feel the pressure, as both Clinton and O'Malley criticized him over his relatively conservative record on gun control. In one of the better moments for Clinton, the front-runner went after the Vermont senator for his position on gun control, forcing him to review his record over and over again.\n\u201cI know that Sen. Sanders had a different vote than I did when it came to giving immunity to gunmakers and sellers,\u201d she said. Adding that that decision made the \u201cgun lobby\u201d more powerful, she added, \u201cThat was a terrible mistake,\u201d and said that she would \u201clove\u201d to see Sanders join with some of her former Senate colleagues to reverse that decision.\nSanders, trying to defuse the moment, said at one point in the exchange, \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any disagreement here.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes there is,\u201d interjected O\u2019Malley, who also sought to denigrate Clinton\u2019s record on gun control, saying that when she last ran for president she portrayed herself as \u201cAnnie Oakley,\u201d and accused her of being on \u201cthree sides of this\u201d issue.\n5. O'Malley has a moment--thanks to Donald Trump.Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who badly trails Clinton and Sanders in the polls, enjoyed several strong moments in the debate. His first big turn in the spotlight came when he criticized Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump over his hardline approach to illegal immigration.\n\"Let's say it in our debate because you'll never hear it from that immigrant-bashing carnival barker Donald Trump,\" he said, as Clinton smiled approvingly and the crowd cheered.\nHe went on to urge a more compassionate approach to immigration reform.\n6. Sanders is still \u201csick\" of hearing about Clinton\u2019s emails.In the first Democratic debate, Sanders effectively shut down discussion of Clinton\u2019s email practices while at the State Department by saying he was sick and tired of hearing about her \u201cdamn emails\u201d\u2014and he made clear Saturday that that remains the case, despite a recent Wall Street Journal interview he gave, suggesting that there might be \u201cvalid questions\u201d remaining. \n\u201cThat\u2019s just media stuff,\u201d he said on Saturday. \u201cI was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email. I still am sick and tired of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email.\u201d\nThe crowd cheered.\nLater in the evening, Clinton aimed to push back again on email scrutiny, which has brought with it questions about whether those that went through her private account contained classified information. During the raid that ultimately killed Osama bin Laden, Clinton said onstage, she didn\u2019t even tell her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who instead found out about it from Obama. It was an understated attempt at a reminder that she can be trusted with serious and confidential matters.\n7. Clinton: Enough about me, let\u2019s talk about youAfter a debate that zeroed in on Clinton\u2019s ties to Wall Street and hawkish foreign policy record, Clinton sought to broaden the focus with her closing statement.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve all heard a lot about me in this debate,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to keep talking and thinking about all of you.\u201d\nShe went on to promise to \u201cwork my heart out\u201d and to say that \u201cI need your help\u201d as she ticked through her career, which, she said, has always been dedicated to helping others.\n8. Clinton subtly references her bid to make history.\u201cUltimately I think the president\u2019s job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do, to lift up the people of this country, starting with our children and moving forward,\u201d she said to applause in her closing statement.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "The 8 key moments in the Democratic debate", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/2016-democratic-debate-explosive-moments-215870", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Jesse Rifkin", "Henry C.
