But hopes among the Bernie faithful that the debate would give Sanders a chance to regain the extraordinary momentum he lost in October didn\u2019t materialize.Sanders got a chance to be Sanders during the debate \u2014 a back-and-forth over Wall Street ties with Clinton left Hillaryland feeling the Bern, big time \u2014 but he still didn\u2019t move the needle on gun control, where he\u2019s been pummeled by his rivals over past votes against the Brady Bill.And asked twice to attack Clinton on Saturday night, Sanders stopped short, in ways that left some observers scratching their heads.If the takeaway moment from the first debate was Sanders standing up for Clinton on her emails, this time, Sanders was clearly looking for a different soundbite. Earlier in the day on Saturday, his campaign quietly uploaded video of Sanders\u2019s speech on the House floor opposing the Iraq War to its YouTube page. Sanders mentioned his vote against the war and Clinton\u2019s vote for it in his first answer of the debate.After the Iraq war moment, Sanders was asked directly if he could criticize anything specific about Clinton\u2019s term as secretary of state. He didn\u2019t, instead criticizing a raft of U.S. foreign policy moves from decades before.\u201cI think we have a disagreement, and the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq. If you look at history, John, you will find that regime change \u2014 whether it was in the early '50s in Iran, whether it was toppling Salvador Allende in Chile, whether it is overthrowing the government of Guatemala way back when \u2014 these invasions, these toppling of governments, regime changes have unintended consequences,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI would say that on this issue, I'm a little bit more conservative than the secretary and that I am not a great fan of regime change.\u201dAnd after the back-and-forth over Clinton\u2019s Wall Street donors \u2014 a moment that gave Sanders, the only candidate besides Donald Trump without a super PAC, a time to really shine \u2014 Sanders similarly held back.Asked \u201cwhat is it in Secretary Clinton's record that shows you that she's been influenced\u201d by her Wall Street donors, Sanders replied that Clinton is opposed to reinstituting the Glass-Steagall law, which banned commerical and investment banks from being combined. But he didn\u2019t directly tie Clinton\u2019s votes to her Wall Street donors.This was after Sanders said Clinton\u2019s claim that her millions in Wall Street donations have no power over her politics was \u201cNot good enough.\u201dIn the spin room after the debate, Sanders campaign guru Tad Devine said Sanders walking away from chances to more directly call out Clinton was part of a strategy.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you why: Bernie Sanders is not looking to have a negative campaign with Hillary Clinton. I know there\u2019s a lot of appetite for it, I know people are looking for negative politics, but it is not the politics he practices,\u201d Devine said. \u201cThis campaign is never going to be about attacking her, and pushing back on her and diminishing her.\u201dGuns, the area where Clinton and the third man on the stage, Martin O\u2019Malley, have attacked Sanders the most, still proved to be a tough spot for the Vermont senator. Sanders was asked several times if his votes against the Brady Bill were a mistake, especially given that today he supports essentially the same gun control agenda as his rivals. He first refused to say that it was and then eventually stood quietly and said nothing while the moderator asked a final time. O\u2019Malley jumped into the silence to make his own points, bailing Sanders out.Devine said the mistake question was frivolous.\u201cIf you go back 25 or 30 years, the situation was completely different than the situation we confront today,\u201d Devine said, citing the mass shootings that have come to define the gun debate in recent years. \u201cI think when you go back and say, \u2018I would have done this that or the other thing differently,\u2019 I think it\u2019s not completely honest. You can say what you want about Bernie Sanders but you can\u2019t say the guy\u2019s not honest.\u201d\n", "title": "Bernie Sanders Has A Fine Night In Des Moines", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/evanmcsan/bernie-sanders-has-a-fine-night-in-des-moines", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Brady Bill", "Martin O'Malley", "Hillary Clinton", "Mandel Ngan", "Donald Trump", "Bernie Sanders", "Tad Devine"], "orgs": ["PAC", "DES MOINES"], "election_confidence": 0.9675354344071934, "authors": [{"author_id": 6685, "fullname": "evan mcmorris-santoro", "primary_org": "buzzfeed"}], "date_written": "2015-11-15 07:33:02", "org": "buzzfeed", "article_id": "fe0579d2968aa1430723f4650a4f3357", "date_access": "2015-11-15 08:09:09.296893"}
