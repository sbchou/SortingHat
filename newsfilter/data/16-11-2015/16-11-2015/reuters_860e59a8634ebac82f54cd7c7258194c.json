{"body": "AMES, Iowa A top aide to U.S. Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton said on Sunday that criticism of her remarks in Saturday's debate regarding 9/11 and Wall Street campaign contributions would not resonate with average voters.\n\u201cThey were attacking her for being too close to Wall Street,\u201d Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri said of a tense exchange among Clinton, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, her chief rival for the Democratic nomination, and former Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley at the party's debate in Iowa.\n\u201cThe point she was making, is that as a senator, she did things for Wall Street, particularly after 9/11, but she also spoke out as a senator and now when she thought they were going too far,\u201d Palmieri told reporters.\nClinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for the 2016 election, was asked during the debate about contributions she had received from the financial industry and whether it would affect her plans to regulate it.\nSanders said Clinton\u2019s response was \u201cnot good enough.\u201d\n\u201cNow, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions?\u00a0They expect to get something. Everybody knows that,\u201d Sanders said.\nClinton said Sanders had impugned her integrity.\n\u201cI represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWhere were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan, where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.\u201d\nClinton\u2019s answer drew immediate criticism from Republican operatives and on social media. Moderators cited a response posted on Twitter when asking Clinton a follow-up question.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that this is something that caucus-goers in Iowa or voters are going to focus on,\u201d Palmieri said of the state that in February holds the first party nominating contest.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear where she stands on issues, and donations don\u2019t play a role in how she\u2019s going to come down on that issue.\u201d\nFor more on the 2016 U.S. presidential race and to learn about the undecided voters who determine elections, visit the Reuters website.
