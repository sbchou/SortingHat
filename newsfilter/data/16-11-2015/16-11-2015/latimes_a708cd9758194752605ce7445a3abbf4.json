{"body": "Initially solemn, typically wonkish and monotonously polite to the moderators and one another, the three Democratic presidential candidates still managed to provide a few surprising moments during their second debate Saturday night.\nHillary Rodham Clinton\n complimented \nGeorge W. Bush\n and accused \nBernie Sanders\n of impugning her integrity.\nMartin O\u2019Malley called Clinton \u201cAnnie Oakley\u201d on gun control and \u201cweak tea\u201d on big banks.\nSanders founded yet another T-shirt line by announcing that \u201cWall Street\u2019s business model is fraud,\u201d CBS used Twitter in a way that did not look like old-media floundering, and Dwight D. Eisenhower continued his 2016 Greatest Hits Tour.\nA week after \nDonald Trump\n praised Ike for deporting more than a million Mexicans, Sanders offered him as a model of high tax rates for the rich: \u201cI\u2019m not much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,\u201d he said.\nMost important, however, was the moment that did not occur: Though they were resolute in their condemnation of ISIS, none of the candidates went inflammatory or ballistic.\nTaking place just a day more than 120 people were killed in a series of terrorist attacks in Paris , the debate, which was held in Des Moines and aired on CBS, opened without the now-usual campaign-trail/reality-show pomp and pageantry. Instead, moderator John Dickerson, host of \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d solemnly reminded viewers that open debate is \u201ca symbol of freedom.\u201d\nThen, after a moment of silence, he began asking newly added questions about the U.S. response to ISIS and unrest in the Middle East.\nBut those hoping for burning rhetoric, sweeping resolutions or even clear plans were probably disappointed.\nWhile many of the Republican presidential candidates have made strong statements in the wake of Friday\u2019s horrific attacks \u2014 Donald Trump suggested that an armed French citizenry would have prevented the tragedy, Sen. Ted Cruz called for significant air power and many if not all want to close the U.S. to Syrian refugees \u2014 the Democratic nominees chose to tread more carefully.\nSo carefully that it was difficult to know what any of them do in similar circumstance should she or he become president.\u00a0\nIndeed, during the opening minutes of their second debate, Sanders, Clinton and O\u2019Malley were more explicit in their arguments about what the terrorists should be called \u2014 extreme jihadists rather than Islamic extremists \u2014 than they were about their visions of an American response.\nTo be fair, Dickerson, for reasons of his own, never asked the obvious question \u2014 \u201cWhat do you think the U.S. should do next?\u201d Instead, he called on each of them to critique President Obama\u2019s, and Clinton\u2019s, handling of terrorism in general and ISIS particular. This put Clinton immediately on the defensive and Sanders and O\u2019Malley in the unenviable position of criticizing their party\u2019s president one day after a horrifying international crisis.\nO'Malley called for more \"human intelligence\" and Sanders blamed the rise of terrorism on the Iraq war, which, he pointed out, Clinton had voted for. Clinton quickly reminded everyone that many acts of terrorism, including 9/11, had preceded the war, which she once again admitted was a mistake, and unity returned to the conversation.\nEarly minutes were spent agreeing that the Middle East is complicated, the world is dangerous and the enemy is not Islam, a distinction Clinton thanked George W. Bush for making in the days following 9/11.\nIndeed, until the first commercial break and beyond, the three candidates spent so much time openly agreeing with one another, with minor caveats, that they seemed to have forgotten they were political rivals.\nThat changed when the questions returned to the economy and everyone seemed to feel on firmer ground.\nAs the front-runner, Clinton got the toughest questions and the brunt of the criticism, onstage and off. At one point, Sanders criticized Clinton\u2019s reliance on \u201cWall Street donors\u201d and all that implies. Clinton defended her impugned integrity in a strange and scattershot way by announcing that 60% of her donors were women and that she had stood by Wall Street, and the rest of New York, during and after 9/11.\nIf Dickerson, who was otherwise strong on calling out contradictions and non-answers, let her get away with evoking 9/11 in a discussion of campaign donations, Twitter didn\u2019t. A few minutes later, co-moderator CBS News congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes asked her to respond to one negative response, marking the first use of Twitter as a real-time participant of a debate.\nBut even with a few mild barbs \u2014 O\u2019Malley derided Clinton as having been \u201cAnnie Oakley\u201d before changing her stance on gun control, or Sanders dismissed one of O\u2019Malley\u2019s references to his work as governor of Maryland by saying \u201cBaltimore is not now one of the safest cities in America\" \u2014 the tenor of the remarks leaned more toward conversation than debate.\nSo much so that Clinton felt comfortable enough to laud the similarities she shares with her rivals. \u201cWe have our differences,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they pale compared with what\u2019s happening on the Republican side.\u201d\n\u201cAll of us support funding Planned Parenthood,\u201d she continued. \u201cAll of us believe climate change is real. All of us want equal pay for equal work. They don't believe in any of that. So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.\"\nNot surprisingly, neither Sanders nor O\u2019Malley disagreed.", "byline": "", "description": "<p>Initially solemn, typically wonkish and monotonously polite to the moderators and one another, the three Democratic presidential candidates still managed to provide a few surprising moments during their second debate Saturday night.</p> <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton complimented George W.
