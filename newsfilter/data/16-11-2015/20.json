A new Reuters/Ipsos poll may explain why: the billionaire real estate magnate is bleeding support among avid church-goers and women to the retired neurosurgeon. \nWhile the unconstrained Trump has a comfortable double-digit lead over the soft-spoken Carson, the data points to a possible emerging threat to Trump's hopes of capturing the party's nomination for the November 2016 election. \nThe poll of likely Republican primary voters also shows that Carson is drawing strong support from the rural Midwest, including Iowa, which holds the first Republican nominating contest on Feb. 1. Trump, in contrast, is drawing strong support in the northeast and southeast.\nThat geographical divide is significant, analysts said, because Carson's dominance in more socially conservative states like Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska reflects how his story of personal redemption is resonating strongly with evangelical voters. They traditionally play an outsize role not just in the first nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 1, but in Nevada and South Carolina, which also hold nominating votes in February.\n\"If Carson keeps his nose clean he could win those states and could catch lightning in a bottle,\" said Ford O'Connell, a Republican strategist not affiliated with either campaign.\nTrump, who has topped national polls of likely Republican primary voters for months, has until now enjoyed strong support among the key constituency of low-income, blue-collar, church-going voters, who have been attracted by his image as a straight-talking political outsider.\nBut Carson's similar appeal as an outsider taking on the Republican establishment has undercut Trump's support in recent weeks, and Carson has surged to the top of a few recent national polls.\nCarson's growing support with women and blue collar voters may explain Trump's recent attacks on his rival, said O'Connell. Trump has highlighted media reports questioning elements of Carson's personal story, and on Thursday he called Carson \"pathological\" and likened him to a child molester.\n\n\"OUTSIDER VOTE\"\n\"Trump is desperate to consolidate the 'outsider' vote. The blue collar vote is very, very key to Trump's success in that. He has tried everything to shake Carson off and it hasn't worked, so he has decided to go nuclear,\" said O'Connell, an advisor to Republican Senator John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign.\nTo be sure, a separate rolling five-day Reuters/Ipsos poll shows Trump surging to 42 percent of likely Republican primary voters, up from 25 percent, since Nov. 6 while Carson was flat at 23 percent.\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the polling data. \nBarry Bennett, Carson\u2019s campaign manager, said of Trump's heightened criticism of Carson: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain his remarks but clearly he\u2019s feeling some pressure and overreacting.\u201d\nBridget Miller, 43, from Stilwell, Kansas, said she had initially considered voting for Trump, but had switched to Carson. \"Carson is pro-life; he's pro-gun; he's saved baby's lives. He speaks to a lot of our values here,\" she said.\nOther likely Republican primary voters say they initially supported Trump but his latest criticism of Carson and his \"child molester\" comments only confirmed their belief that he is unsuited to the presidency.\nJanis Anderson, 54, from Fargo, North Dakota, said she had considered Donald Trump, but his latest comments about Carson were \u201cridiculous.\u201d\nTrump still either leads or shares the lead among most geographical and demographic groups, including wealthy and middle-income voters, people with and without college degrees, the southeast, northeast, the Upper Midwest and the American West.\nBut the story is different among lower-paid workers. In September, Carson had just over 14 percent of support among voters in households with an annual income of $50,000 or less, according to the broader Reuters/Ipsos data. By the end of October, that had jumped to over 23 percent support. Trump's support in the same group was flat at around 33 percent.\nAmong likely female Republican primary voters, Carson has seen his support jump since September from about 19 to 27 percent - the highest of any Republican candidate - while Trump's has slipped from 30 percent to 25.\nCarson's support among regular churchgoers has also risen sharply, according to the Reuters/Ipsos survey, jumping 10 points between September and November to 32 percent, the highest of any Republican candidate. Trump's support with religious voters has slipped from 26 percent to 22 percent.\n\"As the campaign has evolved over time, Trump has begun to wear a little bit thin, especially voters who want a softer, more gentlemanly approach to politics,\" said David Gergen, an adviser to four former U.S. presidents from both parties. \"Carson is wearing better with women than Trump.\"\nThe surveys of likely Republican voters was taken from Sept. 1 until Oct. 31. The Reuters/Ipsos poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 to 8 percent. \n\n (Editing by Ross Colvin)", "byline": "", "description": "(Reuters) - Donald Trump has dramatically escalated his attacks on his nearest rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Ben Carson.

In a period that has seen riots over police conduct in Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore, attacks on police officers in New York and other cities, and now student protests, it sometimes feels that way.\nLast week, several Republican candidates sounded as if they were reviving the tough justice theme that helped Ronald Reagan and Richard M. Nixon rise to power almost half a century ago. Donald Trump derided university presidents who bow to student demands as \u201cweak, ineffective people,\u201d and said he wouldn't have quit if he had been in charge at the University of Missouri. Ben Carson warned that if society coddles students, \u201cWe will move much further toward anarchy than anybody can imagine.\u201d And Chris Christie said it was all President Obama's fault: \u201cThis is a product of the president's own unwillingness and inability to bring people together.\u201d\nIn another flashback to the 1960s, Democrats lined up on the other side, signaling that their sympathies lay with the students. \u201cIt's time to address structural racism on college campuses,\u201d Bernie Sanders tweeted. Hillary Rodham Clinton sent a similar message through an aide. And White House spokesman Josh Earnest lauded the Missouri students for their \u201ccommitment to fighting hate and intolerance.\u201d Their success, he said, reinforced Obama's view \u201cthat a few people speaking up and speaking out can have a profound impact.\u201d\nThere was an unmistakable echo in that micro-debate of the argument after the 2014 unrest in Ferguson, where the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager prompted weeks of angry demonstrations; and the later debate over Black Lives Matter, the movement to curb law enforcement excesses. In all three cases, there has been an impulse toward polarization, reducing the question to: Which side are you on?\nA few Republicans, notably Christie and Ted Cruz, have charged that BLM is calling for the murder of police officers. (A few demonstrators have done so, but they've been disavowed by the movement's leaders.)\n\u201cThe president encourages this lawlessness,\u201d Christie added last month. (The president has condemned that lawlessness several times, actually, even as he has also condemned excessive police \nviolence.)\nOn the other side, Sanders found himself shouted down by demonstrators when he wasn't emphatic enough in endorsing BLM. (He has made amends since.)\nThe implicit message: You can declare that black lives matter, or that police lives matter \u2014 but you don't have the option of believing both those things.\nExcept \u2014 and here's where things get interesting \u2014 most candidates do believe both those things. If you listen closely and dig beneath the sound bites, you'll find that things have changed since the 20th century, after all.\nA recent\u00a0\npoll\n of college students\u2019 attitudes toward free speech (in general and on campus) is a mixed bag.\nThe survey by McLaughlin & Associates for the William F. Buckley Jr. Program at Yale shows that 87% of respondents agreed with this statement: \u201cThere is educational value in listening to and...\nA recent\u00a0\npoll\n of college students\u2019 attitudes toward free speech (in general and on campus) is a mixed bag.\nThe survey by McLaughlin & Associates for the William F. Buckley Jr. Program at Yale shows that 87% of respondents agreed with this statement: \u201cThere is educational value in listening to and...\nAmong Republicans, I highlighted the more ferocious voices, but others have been more restrained. Even the ones I quoted, Trump, Carson and Christie, aren't campaigning principally on law and order. They've mostly answered questions thrown at them by reporters, whose job includes goading candidates into making headlines.\nMost of the Republican candidates have noticed that crime is down, prisons are overcrowded and the cost of incarcerating nonviolent criminals \u2014 mostly drug offenders \u2014 has become an undue burden. Several have endorsed various brands of criminal justice reform: Rand Paul, most notably, but also Cruz and Christie and Jeb Bush. And one or two have even spoken up to say, in effect, that BLM has a point \u2014 although they don't endorse the group's tactics.\n\u201cThis is a legitimate issue,\u201d Marco Rubio said in August. \u201cIt is a fact that in the African American community around this country there has been, for a number of years now, a growing resentment toward the way law enforcement and the criminal justice system interacts with the community. It is particularly endemic among young African American males \u2026 [who] have a much higher chance of interacting with criminal justice than higher education. We do need to face this. It is a serious problem.\u201d\nRubio won't appreciate the comparison, but that wasn't too far from what Clinton said in April.\n\u201cThere is something profoundly wrong when African American men are still far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and sentenced to longer prison terms than are meted out to their white counterparts,\u201d she said in April. It is also wrong, she added, when \u201cbrave police officers are attacked in the line of duty.\u201d\nDespite those knee-jerk reactions to campus upheavals, most Republicans seem to have left the lock 'em up era behind. And so have Democrats; Clinton's position is a shift from the tough-on-crime stance that helped one Bill Clinton get elected in 1992. (Bill Clinton, for his part, was trying to distance himself from the allegedly soft-on-crime Democrats of the 1960s.)\nIt's rare in an election year that candidates are resisting the temptation to polarize \u2014 but let's give credit where credit is due. Maybe, in this instance, Carson got it right. \u201cWe have people who get in their respective corners and demonize each other, but there's no conversation,\u201d he said recently. \u201cIf you ask people to put on the record what their gripes are and what their solutions are, then perhaps they can see that maybe they are not so far apart.\u201d\ndoyle.mcmanus@latimes.com\nTwitter: \n@doylemcmanus\nFollow the Opinion section on Twitter \n@latimesopinion\n and \nFacebook", "byline": "", "description": "<p>Are we heading back to the 1960s, when cities and campuses spiraled into chaos and conservatives won elections by demanding law and order?

Clinton last month broke with the White House, urging a no-fly zone in Syria and doing more to help rebels there. But she can\u2019t shed her ties to the administration, and Republicans are hitting her hard on her role.\nThe debate also showed how Clinton retains considerable advantages. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Martin O\u2019Malley, the former governor of Maryland, can\u2019t match her foreign policy experience or command of world politics. Perhaps most important, neither is drawing sharp distinctions with her on anti-terrorist policies.\nHighlights:\nThe three opened with a moment of silence for the victims in Paris, then talked about their approach to the Islamic State terror group.\n\u201cIt cannot be contained. It must be defeated,\u201d Clinton said, a slight jab at Obama who said just before the Paris attacks that ISIS had been contained.\n\u201cBut it cannot be an American fight,\u201dshe added. \u201cThis cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.\u201d\nHer two rivals were more assertive about U.S. leadership.\n\u201cI would disagree with Secretary Clinton,\u201d said O\u2019Malley. \u201cThis actually is America\u2019s fight. It cannot solely be America\u2019s fight. ... America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.\n\u201cTogether, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of ... ISIS,\u201d said Sanders.\nRepublicans complain that Democrats won\u2019t use the words Muslim or Islam in describing terrorists.\nSaturday, the Democratic candidates appeared to rally to the term Jihadi or Jihadist, which derive from the word for a holy war by Muslims.\nClinton Saturday referred to a \u201cradical jihadist ideology.\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with Islam,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with all Muslims.\u201d\nO\u2019Malley used the term \u201cradical jihadis,\u201d but also warned against labeling terrorists with the broad term of Muslim, saying that would unfairly brand the majority of American Muslims who are needed to help fight back violent extremism.\nSaid Sanders: \u201cI don\u2019t think the term is what\u2019s important.\u201d\nEDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM\nO\u2019Malley proposed allowing 65,000 Syrian refugees into the country, more than the 10,000 proposed by Obama, though he said they need \u201cproper screening.\u201d \nClinton also argued for a higher number, adding \u201cI said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine.\u201d\nEDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM\nHillary Clinton: \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with Islam, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with all Muslims.\u201d\nBernie Sanders: \u201cI\u2019m not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,\u201d referring to the 91 percent top income tax rate in the 1950s.\nMartin O\u2019Malley: \u201cYou will never heard this from that immigrant-bashing carnival barker Donald Trump\u201d\nEDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE\nClinton\nClinton had to defend her years as secretary of state. Moderator John Dickerson asked if the Obama administration underestimated the Islamic State threat. Clinton didn\u2019t answer at first, then tried to tie the current crisis to President George W. Bush\u2019s decision to end American involvement in Iraq. Each time she was challenged, Clinton would launch into detailed histories of the region\u2019s turmoil and American involvement. Backers will praise her command of detail; opponents will contend she\u2019s avoiding responsibility for being part of a team that didn\u2019t take the Islamic threat seriously enough.\nSanders \nHe got off to a rocky start. He only briefly touched on the Paris terrorist attacks in his opening remarks before turning to his standard speech assailing income inequality and the corrosive nature of money in politics. Viewers then watched as Clinton and O\u2019Malley devoted their entire opening statement to the attacks. Viewers may also have been puzzled when Sanders said that climate change is the country\u2019s greatest threat and a contributor to the spread of terrorism. He also failed to gain traction out of his criticism that Clinton had voted for the Iraq War that he opposed.\nO\u2019Malley \nO\u2019Malley, who has languished in single digits in the polls, performed ably, holding his own with the former Secretary of State and U.S. senator on foreign and domestic policy, including health care and taxes. How would he pay for his policies? He explained. Can a former governor lead the U.S. in a time of global terror? Yes, he said. But he needed a breakthrough performance to attract new attention and enthusiasm to his campaign and his performance fell short.\nEDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE\nWall Street. The term came up often, as Sanders and O\u2019Malley challenged Clinton over her ties to the financial industry.

And we need to begin to take this seriously. These are individuals motivated by their faith.\"\n\nOff Message\n\n            By \nGlenn Thrush\n\n\u201cOf course, not all Muslims are not members of violent jihadist groups,\u201d Rubio added. \u201cBut there is a global jihadist movement in the world, motivated by their interpretation of Islam, in this case Sunni Islam, in the case of ISIS, and it needs to be confronted for what it is. This is not a geopolitical movement. It\u2019s a religiously oriented movement.\u201d \nAsked what he\u2019d do if he were president, Rubio called for stepping up support for the Kurds, whom he called \u201cthe best fighters on the ground.\u201d He also said he favored an \u201cincreased number of special operations attacks,\u201d targeting leaders of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. \nBut he did not endorse sending 10,000 U.S. troops to Syria, as his GOP presidential rival, South Carolina Sen. Lindsay Graham, has, saying it was \u201cpremature\u201d to discuss the exact number of troops needed.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Rubio sees a &apos;clash of civilizations&apos;", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/marco-rubio-paris-attacks-isil-215905", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["George Stephanopoulos", "Jesse Rifkin", "Henry C.

Yet about a half hour into a debate, the pall cast over the proceedings by the horrendous Paris terror attacks lifted and spirited sparring commenced. \nBernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley, desperate to reverse Clinton\u2019s momentum, pounced on her connections to Wall Street to put her on the stumbling defensive \u2013 exactly as the duo of Barack Obama and John Edwards did to deadly effect in the fall of 2007. But Clinton isn\u2019t nearly as vulnerable this time (mainly because neither of her tormenters is named Obama) and she emerged intact, if not entirely unscathed. \nStory Continued Below\nUnlike Clinton\u2019s nearly flawless first debate a month ago, Saturday night\u2019s skirmish exposed familiar weaknesses \u2013 a tendency to bog down in stultifying technocrat-ese when she\u2019s playing it safe, coupled with a penchant for spouting factually funky weirdnesses using the very same voice of authority she uses when making perfect sense.\nHere are five takeaways:\n1. Wall Street is Hillary Clinton\u2019s golden albatross. When not bogged down in the email saga, Clinton and her staff spent much of the summer trying to head off trouble from the anti-Wall Street, Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic party by producing a comprehensive financial services regulation proposal. It didn\u2019t quite work.\nThe plan, released last month \u2013 which included personal penalties for financial malefactors and imposition of a \u201crisk fee\u201d on big banks \u2013 was generally well received by mainstream liberals like New York Times columnist Paul Krugman. But it did little to assuage progressives who suspect she\u2019s a Potemkin Village sheriff \u2013 with big Wall Street guns like Tom Nides, Larry Summers and Robert Rubin lining up to run her economic team in the White House. \u201cNot good enough,\u201d Sanders said in his most direct attack on Clinton yet. \"Why, over her political career, has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton? Maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're gonna get, but I don't think so.\u201d\n\nDebate Night \n\n            By \nEli Stokols\n\nThe biggest wedge issue is the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act \u2013 which separated savings and investment banking \u2013 under her husband\u2019s administration 17 years ago. Sanders, Warren and many progressives view the repeal as the single biggest contributor to the reckless activity that led to the 2008 financial collapse. But Clinton opposes the repeal \u2013 even though it undercuts the central argument of her candidacy, that she\u2019s an indefatigable fighter for working-class Americans.\n2. Hillary said something really cray-cray. The pressure of the dual Sanders-O\u2019Malley attack on Clinton\u2019s Wall Street connections prompted her to say one of the craziest things she\u2019s uttered in public during this campaign or any other. When Sanders acidly pointed out that Clinton has raked in millions from the wealthy executives at Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, she riposted with a clever reference to gender politics: \u201cYou know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small, and I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60%.\u201d\nCool. But things got weird. Even though Bill Clinton had close ties to Wall Street (his Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin would go on to become head of Citigroup) and financial sector\u2019s donors ponied up plenty of cash for her 2000 New York Senate run, she claimed that the main reason bankers have flocked to her cause is \u2013 wait for it \u2013 because of the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center. \u201cSo I\u2014 I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked,\u201d she said, as the moderators from CBS gaped, gob-smacked. \u201cWhere were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy, and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.\u201d\nNeedless to say, the remark \u2013 delivered in her emphatic shout-voice -- raised eyebrows 24 hours after the terror attacks in Paris killed more than 120 people. And it\u2019s not likely to go away. A cascade of obligatory, outraged piling-on ensued: \u201c@HillaryClinton, you reached a new low tonight by using 9/11 to defend your campaign donations,\u201d Tweeted RNC Chairman Reince Priebus.\n3. Martin O\u2019Malley sort of won. It doesn\u2019t matter. When Clinton worked the rope line at her post debate party, a supporter shouted \u201cGive' em hell, Hill!\u201d according to CNN\u2019s Dan Merica \u2013 but it was really the poll-challenged O\u2019Malley who wielded the pitchfork. Languishing at 5 percent in the polls, O\u2019Malley has often found himself crushed between Clinton\u2019s mainstream support and Sanders hoarse populism, too marginal to attract her support, too polished to garner his. But he\u2019s found his voice, besting both during an energetic speech at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner a couple of weeks ago, and he was a confident and confrontational presence on the stage in Des Moines on Saturday \u2013 thwacking Sanders on gun rights and Clinton on banks.\n\n\n\n            By \nNahal Toosi\n\nHis best moment: When Clinton and Sanders were dryly discussing approaches to destroying ISIS, O\u2019Malley \u2013 reflecting the views of a deeply dove-ish Democratic base \u2013 offered an anecdote from the trail. O\u2019Malley told the story of a U.S. service member\u2019s mother who told him not use the term \"boots on the ground\" because, she told him, \u201cmy son is not a pair of boots on the ground.\u201d\n4. Bernie Sanders was bad on Paris. Sanders is an idiosyncratic candidate whose idea of orthodoxy is doing whatever the hell he wants to do. That\u2019s his big selling point as an outsider, but there are reasons why politicians play by a specific set of rules. As my colleague Annie Karni reported, Sanders staff wrangled with debate sponsors to keep his 90-second general opening statement from being replaced by each candidate\u2019s response to the killings in France. That elicited criticism from some fellow Democrats, including some Obama campaign veterans, but Sanders seemed intent not to let the crisis serial him from his core economic inequality message.\nClinton and O\u2019Malley devoted their entire monologues to the crisis, but Sanders offered about 20 seconds \u2013 two sentences \u2013 to express his shock and disgust before plowing into his planned speech. His transition was beyond awkward: \u201cThis country will rid our planet of this marvelous organization called ISIS. I'm running for president because as I go around this nation I talk to a lotta people. And what I hear is people concerned that the economy we have is a rigged economy.\u201d\n5. Emails? What emails? The Department of Justice \u2013 which seems to be widening its probe of the \u201chomebrew\u201d email server Clinton used at the State Department \u2013 may ultimately have the last word. But the debate\u2019s moderators, O\u2019Malley and Sanders were content to make the issue a non-issue. There was a grand total of one question on the topic, and Sanders \u2013 who garnered headlines simply by telling the Wall Street Journal that the DOJ probe was appropriate \u2013 reiterated his disinterest in Clinton\u2019s damn emails.\n\u201cThat's just media fluff. I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email. I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email.\u201d\nGlenn Thrush is POLITICO's chief political correspondent. \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Clinton shows vulnerabilities, Sanders sounds tone-deaf and O'Malley lives to fight another day.", "title": "Five takeaways from the Democratic debate", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/2016-democratic-debate-takeaways-215900", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Larry Summers", "Paul Krugman", "Jesse Rifkin", "Henry C.

Bush\n and \nBarack Obama\n came into office with domestic issues prime on their minds, only to have conflicts abroad hobble and frustrate their tenures.\nForeign policy, and specifically her vote for the Iraq War, also frustrated \nHillary Rodham Clinton\n in her unsuccessful run for president in 2008. Not even an ad that year asserting that she was most experienced to take the 3 a.m. crisis call\u2014the implication being that Obama wasn\u2019t\u2014was enough to overcome \nDemocrats\n' embrace of his early opposition to the war.\nAs much as anything, Saturday night's debate in the shocked aftermath of the Paris terrorist attack offered \nClinton\n an opportunity to argue anew that her experience is necessary\u2014and her opponents' is insufficient--for any 3 a.m. call. That allowed her to eclipse her rivals on stage, although in doing so, she may have created vulnerabilities a Republican could exploit next fall.\nAs a former senator and secretary of State, Clinton spoke with fluency about the contradictory puzzle and complicated players in the Middle East, and the tensions there that already have spilled into violence on the European continent. She recounted her experience helping downtown New York recover from the Sept. 11, 2001, attack (weirdly, however, it was in response to a criticism of her closeness with Wall Street donors).\nSeeking to shake up the Democratic race and loosen Hillary Rodham Clinton's front-runner status, rivals Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley repeatedly challenged the former secretary of State on Saturday night in a debate where they largely agreed on most issues.\nThe session at Drake University...\nSeeking to shake up the Democratic race and loosen Hillary Rodham Clinton's front-runner status, rivals Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley repeatedly challenged the former secretary of State on Saturday night in a debate where they largely agreed on most issues.\nThe session at Drake University...\nWhen asked to recount a crisis that had tested her, she dramatically retold the story of advising President Obama to go after Osama bin Laden in 2011 despite concerns by many in the administration that the mission could fail. And, she noted, she offered the advice without consulting anyone, even her husband, former President Bill Clinton.\nIt was that question, more than any other, that demonstrated Clinton\u2019s advantage once the focus turned to foreign policy. By contrast, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley recounted the daily tribulations of a mayor and state executive, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told of a veterans' bill, one in which he was not successful in achieving his initial goal and had to negotiate a compromise.\nIndeed, discomfort on the part of Sanders and O'Malley was palpable from the start. After a moment of silence for the victims in Paris, the candidates moved to opening statements. Speaking before Clinton, Sanders jumped quickly into his familiar arguments about a \"rigged economy,\" a \"corrupt campaign finance system\" and the need for millions of Americans to stand and say that \"enough is enough.\"\nSpeaking after Clinton, O\u2019Malley averred that the Paris attacks showed the need for \"new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership.\" But he did not offer any of the first two, and on the third, his mention that he worried about terrorism as a governor only underscored his lack of front-line international experience.\nClinton went right to the point.\n\"We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like \nISIS\n, the barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist, terrorist group,\" she said, adding pointedly: \"This election is not only about electing a president. It's also about choosing our next commander in chief.\"\nClinton did not offer many operational details, apart from working with American allies on a united anti-jihadist front. But neither did her opponents.\nThe Democratic frontrunner undoubtedly would have received a rougher going-over had the debate been against a Republican free to oppose her actions as secretary of State from a perspective 180 degrees opposite hers (and all of the GOP candidates' views are.) Her weakest moment came in a muddled response to an obvious question about President Obama's failure\u2014and hers--to anticipate the powerful rise of the Islamic State militants. That's a point Republicans are sure to hammer.\nClinton seemed intent on carefully navigating her party's shoals. She mildly distanced herself from Obama\u2019s ill-timed assertion\u2014delivered just before the Paris attack\u2014that the Islamic State was contained. \"It cannot be contained, it must be defeated,\" she said.\nBut she immediately moved to calm the left: \"What the president has consistently said--which I agree with--is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS,\" she said, citing the U.S. forces training Arab and Kurdish militaries. \"But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.\" She mentioned the limits of American involvement twice.\nThe Democratic counter to Clinton was far more difficult to make, giving the debate performances of Sanders and O'Malley the feel of a collection of pulled punches.\nSanders has ridden a wave of support from the party's liberal left. Flaying Clinton for being insufficiently aggressive against the Islamic State and other terrorist\u00a0groups would have inevitably risked a collision with the anti-interventionist views of his supporters, which by all evidence the senator ardently shares. O'Malley, with no clear path to the nomination besides his generational pitch, was effectively in the same fix.\nNeither candidate, for example, explicitly hit Clinton on one of the most significant events of her tenure as secretary of State, the loss of four Americans at the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya. Republicans have argued that attack would have been prevented by a more aggressive posture.\nThe irony of terrorism and foreign policy overtaking a Democratic debate is that the party's candidates have largely avoided the subject this election cycle.\nRepublicans have brawled over the level of aggression each would apply in the Mideast, with several candidates advocating no-fly zones that would put the country's military in direct conflict with Russian planes operating over Syria. Several also have advocated a sharp rise in American troops overseas.\nBut for Democrats, the subject has been far more fraught. Obama came to office in the aftermath of Bush's intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan and vowed to disentangle America from both fights. He has since disappointed some of his followers by announcing that he would keep at least 5,500 troops in Afghanistan beyond the previously announced 2016 withdrawal. He also said recently that he would send special operations troops to Syria to assist rebels there --language that uncomfortably echoes the beginning of involvements in past military theaters.\nSo for the Democratic candidates there had been no real primary season rationale for a focus on foreign policy. The first Democratic debate stuck to the candidates' nuanced differences on issues like economic policy, healthcare and criminal justice, and their agreements on matters such as changing immigration policy and raising the minimum wage.\nThen Paris exploded in violence.\nWhether terrorism will remain at the forefront of the campaign is impossible to predict, given that nearly a year remains before the election. But if it happens, more detail will be required from both the Democrats and Republicans seeking the White House.\nIronically, as the candidates spoke to a country shaken by the Paris attack and wondering if it could happen here, one question was left unasked Saturday night: If France couldn't find a handful of terrorists in a country of 66 million people, how would the next president find them in a country of 320 million?\ncathleen.decker@latimes.com\nFor political news and analysis, follow me on Twitter: \n@cathleendecker \n.

However, the bickering back and forth between the two candidates going nowhere and the probable nominee -- Mrs. Clinton, really got off the subject very quickly.\nHillary said she would be tougher than President Obama. I don't doubt that she will be but that's a pretty low bar.\nBernie Sanders, in spite of Friday's terror attacks in Paris, still thinks climate warming is the world\u2019s greatest problem and the root of all evil.\nMartin O\u2019Malley is prepared to become president because he led Baltimore for 8 years as mayor and the greatest state in the country, Maryland for another four as governor. He must have forgotten that we all got to watch Baltimore explode on national TV a few months back.\nSanders thinks Hillary is owned by Wall Street and the Super-PACS and can't be trusted. After hearing O\u2019Malley brag about everything he did in Maryland, I don't know why everyone wouldn't want to live there.\n\nThe overall message of the night was the Democrats agree on most things.

Including, if they would be honest, that Hillary's going to be the nominee.\nOn policy there is little disagreement. First they still believe in redistribution of wealth (the Robin Hood Theory). The rich are too rich and need to pay more in taxes. The upper limit was not quite the 90%\u00a0 rate in the Eisenhower administration but close (thank you, Bernie Sanders) to certainly a much higher rate for the upper income earners.\nThe middle class is not what it used to be so therefore the government must do something to change all this.\nThe banks and the drug companies and the insurance companies are too big and they are all bad guys so we must regulate them and watch out for them cheating or getting rich.\nWe need more free programs paid for by tax payers. Free public college education for all.\nTo Hillary's credit she didn't buy into this because she doesn't want taxpayers to pay to educate Donald Trump\u2019s kids.\nStill, there was lots of talk about free health care for all and cheap drugs, too.\nWho is going to pay for all this? The rich guys, of course.\nOn immigration, we should just let the 11 million immigrants who are here illegally stay because they've been here a long time.\nSanders , the avowed Socialist, who represents Vermont, the second smallest state in the Union, kept talking about how great Canada is. Maybe that's because Canada just elected a socialist prime minister.\nHe did waffle on guns a little from the Democratic \u00a0position but I am sure that's because nearly every voter in Vermont owns a couple of them.\nThe hardest working guy in the room was John Dickerson, who was the CBS moderator. His biggest task was making sure CBS got its commercial breaks every 10 minutes. About half way through, I confess, I realized that I can't wait for the next \u201cTrump Invitational\u201d as the Republican debates are sometimes called. At least they are not dull!

Republicans, meanwhile, are competing to repeal regulations, cut taxes, keep the minimum wage as it stands and roll back President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health-care overhaul.\nThe parties right now \u201chave polar opposite analyses of how the economy works and how it should work,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser in the Obama administration. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious but underappreciated how far apart they are on the fundamentals\u2014wages, taxes, financial markets.\u201d\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, sparred Saturday over how to pay for new federal investments in education, infrastructure and health care. Both called for raising taxes on the wealthy, although Mrs. Clinton pledged to do so without hitting families that earn less than $250,000 or increasing deficits, which would constrain new spending ambitions.\nMr. Sanders wouldn\u2019t say exactly how high tax rates should rise but noted the top tax rate had been 91% in the 1950s under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican. \u201cI\u2019m not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.\nRepublicans have put tax-cutting proposals at the heart of their economic policy agenda, and they have largely shied away from promises made by candidates four years ago to avoid running up budget deficits.\nThe boldness of some proposals drew warnings from one candidate, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, at last week\u2019s Republican presidential debate. \u201cHillary and the Democrats promise everything on the spending side. We\u2019ve got to be responsible about what we propose on the tax side,\u201d he said.\nRepublicans at last week\u2019s debate also dismissed efforts to boost the federal minimum wage, now at $7.25 an hour, as an ineffective way to raise incomes. Florida Sen.  Marco Rubio and businessman  Donald Trump said it would put U.S. workers at a disadvantage. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make people more expensive than a machine,\u201d Mr. Rubio said.\nDemocrats on Saturday debated whether to target a federal minimum wage of $12 or $15 an hour. Mr. Sanders supports the higher threshold, an effort backed by labor unions. He brushed aside warnings issued recently by Alan Krueger, the Princeton University professor who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s top economist, that a $15 minimum wage is an untested, risky level. His research contends minimum-wage increases haven\u2019t decreased employment, and he supports raising wages to $12 an hour.\n\u201cI do take what Alan Krueger said seriously,\u201d said Mrs. Clinton, who also has endorsed the $12 floor.\nMr. Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley, the third candidate at Saturday\u2019s debate and a former Maryland governor, said they would shun anyone with Wall Street ties from top positions in their administrations, including figures such as  Robert Rubin and Larry Summers, who served as treasury secretaries for President  Bill Clinton.\nSome Democrats have faulted that approach. \u201cThe idea that you have to excommunicate anybody who ever worked in the financial sector is ridiculous,\u201d said Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist Democratic think tank. \u201cWe need people who oversee the Federal Reserve system and have high posts at Treasury that have expertise in finance.\u201d\nBoth Republicans and Democrats have promised to crack down on Wall Street, but they disagree sharply over how to do it. Republicans generally have blamed government policies, from housing to Federal Reserve interest-rate decisions, for provoking the financial crisis. They say the Dodd-Frank Act in particular has restrained economic growth and should be repealed.\nDemocrats quarreled Saturday over whether the regulatory overhaul had gone far enough by failing to reinstate a New Deal-era law that separated commercial and investment banking, known as the Glass-Steagall Act.\nThe flare-up over banking laws reflected Mr. Sanders\u2019s broader critique that Democrats and Republicans have given banks too much political power, a throwback to the \u201ctrust busting\u201d of President Theodore Roosevelt more than a century ago. Why do big industries make \u201cmillions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something,\u201d he said in Saturday\u2019s debate. \u201cEverybody knows that.\u201d\nBoth parties did agree in the past week on one thing: the virtues of community banks. Republicans warned that too many were going out of business.

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)\n\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders needs to slow frontrunner Hillary Clinton\u2019s run toward the party nomination, and Saturday night\u2019s debate might be such an opportunity.\nThe format of the CBS debate, the second of the 2016 cycle for Democratic White House candidates, was reworked after the Paris terror attacks Friday night to focus more on terrorism, national security and foreign policy.\nClinton, as a former secretary of state, has more experience with such matters, compared to both Sanders, a Vermont independent, and fellow challenger Martin O\u2019Malley, a former Maryland governor.\nHowever, her record as the State Department leader from 2009 to 2013 could also invite moderator questions and candidate attacks Saturday about her handling of the deadly Sept. 11, 2012, terror attacks on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya.\nAmong the concerns, as frequently highlighted by Republicans, are whether Clinton paid enough attention to security concerns raised by Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who was killed in the attacks, and whether she attempted to cover up that the attacks were terror related.\n\nStevens and three other Americans died in the attacks.\nClinton will also likely face questions at the debate in Des Moines, Iowa, about her role in the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to eradicate the Islamic State, the increasingly dangerous terror group that has claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks that killed at least 129 people.\nClinton leads Sanders 54.7 percent to 33 percent, with O\u2019Malley at a distant 2.7 percent, according to an averaging of polls by the nonpartisan website RealClearPolitics.com.\nAnd an Associated Press survey of superdelegates published Friday found that half of the Democratic insiders are publicly backing Clinton, which further secures her nomination efforts.\nClinton\u2019s campaign got off to a rough start following revelations about eight months ago that as secretary of state she used a private server and email accounts for official business, which raised questions about whether classified information was compromised.\nHowever, the former first lady and New York senator has been on a recent roll, which started with a good first debate in mid-October and was followed about a week later by her well-prepared testimony before a GOP-led special House committee on the Benghazi matter.\nSanders, a self-described Democratic socialist whose outsider campaign has drawn large crowds and good polling numbers in early-voting states Iowa and New Hampshire, will indeed be free to attack Clinton on foreign policy.\nHowever, his focus on such domestic issues as income inequality, affordable college tuition and social justice reform could present problems Saturday if Clinton or the moderators go deep and hard into the foreign policy issues.\nSanders may have inadvertently facilitated some of Clinton\u2019s turnaround when in the first debate he seemed to dismiss the controversy over her use of a private email account and server by saying Americans are tired of hearing about her \"damn emails.\"\nBut he has since given her no more passes.\nThough careful never to mention Clinton by name, Sanders has drawn a series of contrasts with the former secretary of State on issues that include her backing of the war in Iraq, trade and the minimum wage.\nSanders advisers say he plans to discuss the email issue only if the moderators raise it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"He's definitely going to cut a harder contrast on core issues,\" said Larry Cohen, a senior adviser to Sanders, \"But it's not going to be over personal style.\"\nThe problem for Sanders is that Clinton agrees with him on some of the core domestic issues of his campaign, having shifted to the left in recent weeks to oppose construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.\n\"His current arguments aren't enough to get beyond his core voter,\" said Gina Glantz, manager of Bill Bradley's 2000 presidential campaign.\nWhile Sanders aides bragged about their candidate's lax preparation for the last debate, they shuttled him to his campaign headquarters in Burlington, Vermont, for mock sessions before this match-up. Clinton, too, has kept her schedule relatively clear over the last several days, leaving plenty of time for rehearsals.\n\"They are absolutely prepared for the fact that Bernie's going to come out swinging,\" said Maria Cardona, a Democratic strategist who worked for Clinton's failed 2008 White House campaign, \"The question is how it's going to happen.\"\nClinton supporters say their candidate will remain focused on laying out her vision for the future rather than striking back at Sanders. Her campaign has about $15.2 million in television advertising planned through mid-February, compared with a $3.2 million Sanders ad buy that ends next week, according to Kantar Media's CMAG advertising tracker.\nThe Service Employees International Union, an influential force in Democratic politics, is expected to issue their endorsement on Tuesday, according to people knowledgeable about the union's process. Clinton has been backed by more than 72 percent of members in all their internal polling, including the most recent survey conducted a few weeks ago.\nIn addition to her success in the first debate and on Capitol Hill, Clinton has benefited from Vice President Joe Biden's decision to forgo a presidential run.\nO'Malley has questioned Sanders' commitment to the Democratic Party and President Obama, still a popular figure among Democrats.\nA more aggressive tone would mark a shift for a race that has so far been notable for its civility. Democrats have spent months boasting about the substantive tone of their contest, attempting to set-up a favorable early contrast with the often carnival-like insults of the crowded Republican primary.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "byline": "", "description": "Democrat presidential challenger Sen.

But for the time being, at least, she may be able to afford it. The first debate, in October, corresponded with a time of stress for her candidacy, besieged by various legal and political investigators and drifting downward in voter-preference polls. But Clinton did so well and struck such a blend of competence and charm in the October debate on CNN that she was widely acknowledged to have rescued her fortunes \u2014 or at least strengthened her hand. This latest debate on CBS News and staged at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, was never likely to have as great an impact. The likely audience was limited. It was staged on a Saturday night, competing with various sports and entertainment programs. This weekend, in particular, it was overshadowed by the tragedy unfolding in Paris, where at least 129 people died in terrorist attacks Friday night. The group known as Islamic State claimed responsibility for the coordinated attacks by teams of gunmen and suicide bombers. The debaters observed a moment of silence for the victims in Paris and devoted the first quarter of the debate to discussing the attacks and the proper response from the U.S. and its allies. All agreed the U.S. had a major, leading role to play in battling the terrorists, but all also agreed that U.S. allies needed to respond with greater commitment as well. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont noted that the struggles in the Middle East amounted to \"a war for the soul of Islam,\" implying it was a contest beyond the power of the U.S. government to resolve. But Sanders also explicitly assigned responsibility for the current turmoil in the Middle East to the administration of George W. Bush, whose invasion of Iraq in 2003 was responsible for \"all this instability,\" he said. Sanders made the point that he had opposed the invasion on the Senate floor, where Clinton had voted in support. Clinton has since called that vote a mistake. But the most difficult part of that first segment of the debate for Clinton came when CBS News debate moderator John Dickerson asked whether her prescriptions for the fight against the group called Islamic State suffered for her association with President Obama, who has been downplaying, or underestimating, the strength of the group. As recently as this week, the president had said the group had been \"contained,\" at least in its territorial ambitions in Iraq and Syria. On this, Clinton distanced herself from the president somewhat, saying she had advised more involvement in the region after the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq \u2014 a shift she said was mandated by the agreement struck with Iraq by the last Bush administration. She had said she warned that \"extremist groups might fill the vacuum.\" Sanders said several times that the Department of Defense budget was already $600 billion and that the U.S. should be hesitant to increase that greatly without knowing what it was expecting to accomplish with more military hardware. A self-described Democratic Socialist, Sanders also contrasted his reliance on small donors with the Clinton campaign's donations from the wealthy of Wall Street: \"Maybe they're stupid about what they're going to get [in return], but I don't think so.\" Clinton then insisted on a chance to respond, because Sanders had \"impugned my integrity.\" That drew an audible sound of anticipation from the crowd, which may not have expected even this degree of confrontation between the candidates after the harmony of the first debate. Clinton then said she had many thousands of donors, most of them not rich, and 60 percent of them women. Although not directly responsive to the Wall Street thrust from Sanders, Clinton's reference to gender prompted applause and cheers from the crowd. This was her best moment of the debate, according to people following the proceedings on social media such as Twitter. Clinton went on to suggest her contributions from Wall Street stemmed from appreciation for all she had done to help the Lower Manhattan financial industry recover from the terror attacks of September 2001. That rationale drew a decidedly mixed response from the audience in the hall and on social media, with many questioning whether it fully explained the generous contributions she still receives from the financial industry more than a dozen years later. \n.@HillaryClinton vehemently offers support for Wall Street as post-911 recovery effort.  Does that fly?\u2014 David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) November 15, 2015\n\n\n\nSanders said Clinton's plan to increase regulation of the financial industry was \"not good enough,\" and he had corroborating support from third-place challenger Martin O'Malley, the former governor of Maryland, who called the Clinton plan \"weak tea.\" The candidates revisited a divide on gun violence, with Sanders saying he was willing to reconsider his past opposition to legislation stripping gun manufacturers of their liability when their products were used in the commission of crimes. O'Malley sided with Clinton on this issue, only moments after favoring Sanders' point of view on banking regulation. But, in general, the candidates were largely in agreement on major issues. They agreed that President Obama had been right to offer a path to citizenship for young people brought to the U.S. illegally while still minor children. \"The symbol of America is the Statue of Liberty,\" said O'Malley, \"not a barbed-wire fence.\" O'Malley also won cheers from the crowd for his reference to \"that immigrant-bashing carnival-barker Donald Trump,\" a reference to the candidate leading most polls among Republican candidates for president. All three candidates supported greater access to a college education, with Sanders saying all public universities and colleges should be tuition-free. Clinton said she did not think taxpayers should pay for Trump's children to go to college, as he is a billionaire. O'Malley noted that he had held the line on tuition increases at state schools when he was a governor. And neither Sanders nor O'Malley took the bait when asked whether Clinton's private e-mail server should have been used for any kind of government business. Sanders in particular refused the chance to criticize her on the issue, saying he was still \"tired of her emails,\" as he had said in the first debate. Dickerson then asked Clinton if there were \"other shoes to drop\" as multiple investigations proceed into her time in office and the activities of her aides. Clinton alluded to her 11 hours of testimony before a House investigative panel last month as an indication to the contrary. Overall, the debate did not seem likely to affect Clinton's standing in the primary field. Despite moments of vulnerability and dubious reaction to her defenses regarding Wall Street contributors, she remained the strong center of the cast on stage. She had 40 percent of the total speaking time, with 35 percent going to Sanders and 25 percent to O'Malley. But as she had arrived at this juncture of the campaign as not only the leader but an increasingly dominant leader, Clinton had little room to improve. Dickerson also invited favorable comparison to his predecessors in the role of debate moderator. His questions were crisp, to the point and frequently challenging \u2014 but without the argumentative tone that has brought criticism from participants in earlier debates on the Republican side.", "byline": "", "description": "Former Maryland Gov.

Instead, she compounded the damage.\n\nThe former secretary of state was off to a sound outing in Saturday night\u2019s debate against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland. Friday\u2019s terrorist attacks in Paris dominated at first, allowing her to highlight her superior experience in world affairs. But it was those attacks that made her badly muffed response to questions about her fealty to Wall Street all the more jarring. Here\u2019s the exchange:\n\nMr. Sanders: \u201cI have never heard a candidate, never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military-industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me. I\u2019m going to be independent. Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something. Everybody knows that. Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate. We are relying on small campaign donors, 750,000 of them, 30 bucks apiece. That\u2019s who I\u2019m indebted to.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton: \u201cWell John, wait a minute. Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impugn my integrity. Let\u2019s be frank here.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders: \u201cNo, I have not.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton: \u201cOh, wait a minute, senator. You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small. And I\u2019m very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent. So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked. Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.\u201d\n\nPredictably, Twitter exploded with demands to know what campaign donations from big banks had to do with New York\u2019s recovery from 9/11.\n\nAnswer: little to nothing. Since 2001, she and Bill Clinton have earned more than $125 million for speeches, many of the most lucrative made before financial groups.\n\nThat does not begin to account for the millions of dollars given directly to her campaign, and to political action committees backing her. Nearly 15 years after the 2001 attacks, Mrs. Clinton was earning more than $200,000 for a 20-minute speech. Most of those took place behind guarded doors. But one can guess that she and the financial executives were not still talking about 9/11.\n\nMiddle-class Americans associate Wall Street with the 2008 meltdown of the economy that cost so many their homes and savings. In the debate Mrs. Clinton repeatedly referred to her plan for reining in banks, but offered precious few specifics. This is what happens when Hillary Clinton the candidate gets complacent. The debate moderator, John Dickerson, had even tipped her off before a commercial break that the next topic was Wall Street.\n\nHer effort to tug on Americans\u2019 heartstrings instead of explaining her Wall Street ties \u2014 on a day that the scars of 9/11 were exposed anew \u2014 was at best botched rhetoric. At worst it was the type of cynical move that Mrs. Clinton would have condemned in Republicans. She should make a fast, thorough effort to explain herself by providing a detailed plan for how she would promote measures protecting middle-class Americans from another financial crisis.", "byline": "THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "description": "After a good start on national security and terrorism, Hillary Clinton flubbed legitimate questions about her ties to Wall Street on Saturday.", "title": "Hillary Clinton Botches Wall Street Questions", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/opinion/hillary-clinton-botches-wall-street-questions.html", "topics": ["economy"], "people": ["Bill Clinton", "Bernie Sanders", "John Dickerson", "Hillary Clinton", "Martin O'Malley"], "org": "nyt", "election_confidence": 0.8708710278871227, "authors": [{"author_id": 697, "fullname": "the editorial board", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-11-15 21:26:52", "orgs": [], "article_id": "ac1a1d01775534781b522dfa3ead3ef1", "date_access": "2015-11-15 21:45:54.898058"}, {"body": "With the deadly terrorist attacks in Paris as a somber backdrop, three Democratic presidential candidates squared off in Des Moines, Ia., Saturday night in the party\u2019s second 2016 debate.\nSometimes the statements made by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Sen.

For instance:\nSanders criticized Clinton for her support for the Iraq war, saying the was has led to the current instability in the region. Hillary Clinton voted for authorizing the war in Iraq in 2002, which she has since said she regrets. It became an obstacle for her 2008 presidential campaign. In 2006, she said, \"Obviously, if we knew then what we know now, there wouldn't have been a vote, and I certainly wouldn't have voted for it.\" \nClinton said that Americans spend more than anyone else in the world on prescription drugs. A PBS report last year found that \u201cthe United States spends almost $1,000 per person per year on pharmaceuticals. That\u2019s around 40 percent more than the next highest spender, Canada, and more than twice as much as than countries like France and Germany spend.\u201d \nSanders aid that Americans spend more on health care than anyone else in the world.

Rising global temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, climbing sea levels and more extreme weather events will intensify the challenges of global instability, hunger, poverty and conflict.\" \nO'Malley made a similar connection between climate change and terrorism last September. Politifact rated the claim as \"Mostly True.\" It said the drought in Syria \u2013 which limited resources \u2013 was not the \"sole culprit,\" but rather \"one of many factors that led to the Syrian conflict.\" \nThe article stated that Syrian President Bashar Assad's \"recruitment of al Qaida members\" and Sunni Arab genocide are more \"direct\" and \"crystal clear\" causes.\nVera Bergengruen, Tori Whitley Iana Kozelsky and David Goldstein contributed.", "byline": "", "description": "With the deadly terrorist attacks in Paris as a somber backdrop, three Democratic presidential candidates squared off in Des Moines, Ia., Saturday night in the party\u2019s second 2016 debate.

Military troops patrolled Paris as France and its allies around the world mourned 129 people killed in coordinated assaults on Friday that unfolded over three hours. More than 350 people were wounded, many seriously. The French president blamed the Islamic State, calling the attacks \u201can act of war that was prepared, organized and planned from abroad, with complicity from the inside.\u201d\n\n_______\n\n2. France said three teams carried out the attacks, and ended them by detonating suicide belts. One attacker was identified as a man who used a Syrian passport to enter Europe along with the flow of migrants, another as a French national with a criminal record. Confirmation of the Islamic State\u2019s involvement would mean the group has grown from a regional player in the Syrian conflict into a force waging a global terrorist war in less than two years.\n\n_______\n\n3. World leaders condemned the attacks and many tightened security. President Obama is at the G-20 meeting in Turkey for talks certain to be dominated by the fight against the Islamic State and terrorism in general. The U.S.-led campaign against the group had intensified in recent days in Iraq and Syria, and a bigger push is now likely.\n\n_______\n\n4. A new urgency pulsed through talks on a political solution to Syria\u2019s war. Diplomats from the U.S., France, Russia, Iran and other nations met in Vienna on Saturday, facing knotty divisions on a way forward. Secretary of State John Kerry said the Paris attacks were born of \u201ca kind of medieval and modern fascism at the same time, which has no regard for life, which seeks to destroy and create chaos and disorder and fear.\u201d\n\n_______\n\n5. The second Democratic debate opened with a long discussion of the Paris attacks. Hillary Clinton deftly spun questions that invited her to blame the Obama administration for allowing the rise of the Islamic State, and defended herself from Bernie Sanders\u2019s onslaughts on her relationship with Wall Street. Martin O\u2019Malley may have had the most discussed single line, calling Donald Trump an \u201cimmigrant-bashing carnival barker.\u201d\n\n_______\n\n6. The Republican candidates paused their criticisms of one another, particularly against Marco Rubio\u2019s switch to a hard line on immigration. They broadly agreed that the U.S. should strengthen its military strategy against the Islamic State, and some proposed sending ground troops.\n\n_______\n\n7. Other developments this week were independent of international terrorism. Turmoil over racial discrimination spread to campuses across the country after protests forced top officials at the University of Missouri system to step down. Some students acknowledged they had felt only subtle signs of discrimination. \u201cWhat matters,\u201d one protester said, \u201cis that we all need to have empathy for the experiences that people of color have even if we don\u2019t have those experiences for ourselves.\u201d\n\n_______\n\n8. A Times special report found a thriving U.S. black market that moves guns from states with lax gun laws into those with tougher measures. In New York and New Jersey, which have some of the strictest laws in the country, weapons involved in crimes often arrived via the so-called Iron Pipeline \u2014 Interstate 95 and its tributaries \u2014 from Virginia, Georgia and Florida.\n\n_______\n\n9. The Swiss foundation that holds the copyright to \u201cThe Diary of Anne Frank\u201d has listed her father as a co-author. The diary, by all accounts, remains the words of a young girl hiding from the Nazis with her family. Emphasizing Otto Frank\u2019s contributions of edits and a prologue allows the foundation to extend its copyright from 70 years after her death in 1945 at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp to 70 years after his death in 1980.\n\n_______\n\n10. International sports officials banned Russia from track and field competitions after a report accused Russia of running a state-sponsored doping program. And should the country fail to rapidly demonstrate compliance with anti-doping regulations, the ban could be extended to include the 2016 Olympics in Brazil.\n\n_______\n\n11. President Obama is scheduled to head from the G20 meeting in Turkey to Asia, for a lengthy trip to Malaysia and the Philippines. His agenda will include promoting the Trans-Pacific Partnership and attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Manila on Wednesday.\n\n_______\n\nYour Weekend Briefing is published Sundays at 6 a.m. Eastern.\n\nAnd don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing, weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Evening Briefing, weeknights at 6 p.m. Eastern.\n\nWant to look back?

Sanders failed to deliver in small and large ways at the Democratic presidential debate Saturday that would have either cast positive attention on him or negative attention on her.\nIt\u2019s a dynamic that explains why she\u2019s pulling comfortably ahead of him in the Democratic race and likely to remain there in the critical weeks to come. \nAfter the terrorist attack in Paris hours before, Americans expected to hear about foreign policy and more specifically how the candidates planned to fight the Islamic State which took responsibility for killing more than 100 people. \nBut when Sanders in his opening statement was asked to share his thoughts on the attacks, he uttered a mere two sentences on terrorism \u2013 totaling about 20 seconds \u2013 before quickly switching back to his standard stump speech.\n\u201cI\u2019m running for president because as I go around this nation I talk to a lotta people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what I hear is people concerned that the economy we have is a rigged economy.\u201d\nThe abrupt switch from terrorism as well as his claim that climate change is the greatest threat to national security seemed out of place as the Paris attacks dominated the world\u2019s attention.\n\nClimate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism. And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say you're gonna see countries all over the world...you're gonna see all kinds of international conflict, Bernie Sanders\nSanders\u2019 problems with the debate began even before the candidates walked on stage. His campaign spent hours refuting published reports that aides were angry about changes in the format to reflect the Paris attacks. Clinton supporters flooded social media saying anyone who couldn\u2019t change topics based on world events couldn\u2019t handle being president.\nThe independent senator from Vermont has surprised political observers, even himself, with his popularity in the contest that has translated to large crowds and millions of dollars in contributions. But he needs to do something more if he expects to compete with Clinton for the nomination.\nWith the candidates not debating again for five more weeks, the debate was perhaps his best hope to blunt her rise in the polls. He did provide several strong answers, particularly on reining in Wall Street and ridding politics of unaccountable money. But to get ahead he needed to criticize her, something he and his aides repeatedly say he\u2019s not comfortable with. \nEDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM\nWhen asked if he had any criticism in the way Clinton performed as secretary of state, Sanders spoke vaguely about \u201cregime change,\u201d saying forcing leadership changes in some countries are not always beneficial while he barely mentioned her or explained that she has supported such moves. \nEDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM\nSanders instead found himself agreeing with her more than once.\n\u201cI agree with much of what the secretary said,\u201d he said about terrorism.\n\u201cThe secretary\u2019s obviously right,\u201d he said on her assessment of the Middle East. \nSanders did manage to criticize her more than he did in their first debate in October.\nHe forcefully went after her for voting to authorize the invasion of Iraq in 2003 as a senator, saying it created instability that led to the rise of the Islamic State.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the level of instability that we have now,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the history of the United States.\u201d\nClinton acknowledged once again that she made a mistake on the Iraq war. But she then called on him to acknowledge his mistake on a vote he cast to grant immunity to gun manufacturers and dealers from liability if their firearms are used criminally. \n\nThat was a terrible mistake. It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate, legislators not just in Washington but across the country, Hillary Clinton.\nHe didn\u2019t and instead delivered a muddled answer. \u201cWe will talk of that bill which I agree with parts, I disagree \u2013 I am certainly absolutely willing to look at that bill and make sure \u2013 and not a form of the bill,\u201d he said.\nEDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM\nHe also failed to focus on what political observers consider one of his best lines of attacks \u2013 accusing Clinton of flipping on policy positions. \nEDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM\nIf all else failed, Sanders could have used the emails.

From boos for \u201cgotcha\u201d questions and angry complaints directly from the candidates \u2014 sometimes right on stage \u2014 over debate formats, it\u2019s been a brutal run for some moderators (though a ratings bonanza for the networks).  The ferret-like journalistic questioning of CBS\u2019s John Dickerson, the moderator of Saturday night\u2019s debate and host of \u201cFace the Nation,\" represented something of an honorable mean between the contentiousness of the CNBC anchors at last month\u2019s unruly Republican debate and the cautiousness of Fox Business anchors at this month\u2019s GOP encounter. \nFew people expected many fireworks from Saturday night\u2019s Democratic primary debate. The horror of the attacks in Paris put a somber damper on the evening, dominating the first half of the debate. But moderator Dickerson and his fellow questioners \u2013 CBS News congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes, Iowa\u2019s KCCI-TV anchor Kevin Cooney and Des Moines Register political columnist Kathie Obradovich \u2014 were widely praised for being aggressive but respectful, concentrating on sharpening the exchanges and surfacing underlying tensions between the candidates. \nStory Continued Below\n\u201cYou said Sen. Sanders took a vote on [gun] immunity you don\u2019t like. If he can be tattooed by a single vote and that ruins all future opinions by him on this issue, why then isn\u2019t he right that your vote on Iraq tattoos you forever for your judgment?\" Dickerson asked Hillary Clinton at one point. \nThe question didn\u2019t immediately elicit fireworks, as Clinton quickly responded that her Iraq vote was a mistake, and challenged Bernie Sanders to say the same about his gun vote. But it eventually led to a revealing exchange between the two nonetheless.\nObradovich pushed Sanders on what level of \u201cjob loss\u201d he would consider acceptable in exchange for a higher minimum wage, and after he danced around the answer, she prodded further: \u201cDo you think job losses are a consequence that are worth accepting?\u201d \n\nDebate Night \n\n            By \nEli Stokols\n\nThe first hour was more uneven, as the candidates cautiously parsed their differences on national security in the wake of the Paris attacks. But Dickerson, who led the terrorism discussion, deftly cited aspects of the candidates\u2019 record and past inconsistencies to clarify their positions.\nHe smartly latched onto a 2014 speech from Clinton in which she said she \"could not have predicted the extent to which ISIS could be effective in seizing cities in Iraq.\" \n\"So you've got prescriptions for the future. But how-- how do we know if those prescriptions are any good if you missed it in the past?\u201d Dickerson asked. \n His tone, throughout the night, stayed calm and curious, only rising when it came time to cut candidates\u2019 off for a commercial break.\n\u201cIs the world too dangerous for a governor with no foreign policy experience?\u201d he queried a ruffled Martin O\u2019Malley. \nDickerson's question of the night, destined to become a GOP attack line, got all three candidates to dance around the term \u201cradical Islam,\u201d refusing to characterize the Paris attackers by their religion. \n\"Marco Rubio, also running for president, said that this attack showed in Paris showed that we are at war with radical Islam. Do you agree with that characterization, radical Islam?\u201d Dickerson asked, directing his question first to Clinton. \nThe Saturday evening time slot \u2014 known to be one of the lowest rated nights of the week for television \u2014 made for less engagement on social media than in previous debates. But CBS wisely decided to integrate the debate with Twitter \u2014 the candidates\u2019 Twitter handle names were plastered on each podium \u2014 and used social media to get the candidates to address real-time responses from viewers.\n\n\nOne Twitter comment, highlighted by the moderators, questioned Clinton\u2019s attempt to attribute her large trove of donations from Wall Street to her work rebuilding New York\u2019s business district in the aftermath of the World Trade Center destruction, something many reporters and political watchers were asking themselves. It was one of the toughest questions of the night and generated the most conversation on Twitter. \nThe move to integrate Twitter was widely praised by journalists and political watchers as, finally, the right way to integrate the social media platform. CBS, tweeted the conservative pollster and analyst Frank Luntz, \u201cjust used Twitter perfectly. That question about linking 9/11 and Hillary\u2019s donations was masterful.\u201d\nDickerson\u2019s performance also won plaudits on social media, especially for his calm demeanor.\n \"Boy, John Dickerson is really winning this debate,\u201d John Podhoretz, the editor of Commentary, tweeted. \n \"So far Dickerson has had a fair-minded but bracing question for each candidate so far,\u201d NPR\u2019s Ron Elving tweeted. \n Concluded Peter Suderman, a senior editor at Reason, \"I hope John Dickerson moderates a general election debate.\u201d\n\nHadas Gold is a reporter at\u00a0Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "In a tough debate season for TV questioners, the CBS moderator was almost perfect.", "title": "Winner of the 2nd Democratic debate: John Dickerson", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/cbs-democratic-debate-moderator-215898", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Jesse Rifkin", "Hillary Clinton", "Henry C.

Summer turned to fall, and Trump still dominates the presidential campaign. And so does the subject of illegal immigration, posing a mighty threat.\nHow mighty could be seen in a USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll published last week. It demonstrated again what California sees in every election: The party's positions on immigration and other issues, like gay marriage, have cost Republicans a generation of good will and support. Here, the poll reminded, Republicans are limited mostly to older and white voters, religious voters and residents of inland California.\nThe current brouhaha over illegal immigration is important because new voters will carry their views of the political parties with them for a very long time.\n\"The experiences people have when they enter the political system do stay with them,\" said Jon Cohen, vice president of survey research for SurveyMonkey, the firm that conducted the poll. Political views \"can shift \u2026 but those initial moments are important and do frame how they see things.\"\nRepublican difficulties can be seen in three key areas.\nYoung and minority voters\nThere's substantial overlap in the membership of these groups, and in their reasons for siding with Democrats and the party's candidates.\nAccording to the poll, 36% of voters ages 18 to 29 strongly approve of \nPresident Obama\n. Another 40% approve of him more mildly, meaning three-quarters of young California voters are on Obama's side. Asked whether the country was headed in the right direction, 40% said it was \u2014 not a majority but six points above the percentage for California voters overall.\nAsked whether immigrants strengthened or weakened American society, 7 in 10 of the 18- to 29-year-olds said they represented a strength. (Among those age 65 and older, a slight majority felt the same way.)\nViews among Latino, African American and Asian voters were similar. All told, three-quarters of black voters, almost two-thirds of Latino voters and 70% of Asian voters supported President Obama. By strong majorities, all said immigration was positive for the country. Latino and Asian voters were about as positive about the direction of the country as were young voters.\nThose voters receive a contrary message from the Republican candidates for president. To hear them, the country is falling apart, President Obama is an abject failure and immigration is a threat. (The USC Dornsife/Times poll did not test views on the president's healthcare plan, but polls taken since the measure passed showed that it is broadly popular among minority voters. The GOP presidential candidates regularly scorn it and pledge to repeal it.)\nInterestingly, young Republicans are not that different in some ways from their elders \u2014 their presidential selections were quite similar \u2014 but they, too, have more moderate positions on immigration, gay marriage and other cultural issues.\nThe state's coastal-inland split\nThe traditional California fight is between north and south. The political split is between west and east, coastal and inland.\nTake the Obama support rating: Along the coast, 61% supported him. Inland, only 44% did. Two of the most conservative areas of the state, the Central Valley and Inland Empire, had only a 46% and 34% support rating for him, respectively. In both places, strong opposition was by far the dominant view.\nHere's the problem: The Central Valley represents 19% of the state's voters, and the Inland Empire another 10%. The two largest Democratic areas, Los Angeles County and the Bay Area, make up 44% of the state's voters.\nEven inland, demography is cutting into Republican unanimity. A majority of voters in the Central Valley said that immigrants strengthen this country, and 43% of Inland Empire voters agreed. (Growing Latino voting strength everywhere in the state has pushed many inland Republican members of Congress to support changes in immigration policy opposed by their leaders.)\nReligion, or lack thereof\nReligion has long been a dividing line in politics \u2014 the more common attendance at services, the greater the likelihood of political conservatism. It was true in the new poll as well.\nAbout half of Republican candidate Ben Carson's supporters said they attend church at least once a week, the highest percentage for any candidate. Only 20% of Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton's supporters reported that they attend services at least once a week.\nThe problem for Republicans? There aren't enough Californians who are that religious.\nIn California, 28% said they attend services at least once a week, and 44% said they attend seldom or never. Nationally, 35% were actively religious, while 38% seldom or never attended services.\nRepublicans might be tempted to write off California, but their problem is that trends that started here are spreading. In presidential elections, Nevada and New Mexico have become regularly Democratic and Colorado has turned into a toss-up state because of California-style demographic changes.\nThere would appear to be two solutions: a rapid influx of inland church-goers moving into the state, or a shift by the candidates toward moderation. At this early point of the presidential contest, the odds of the former seem greater than the odds of the latter.\ncathleen.decker@latimes.com\nTwitter: \n@cathleendecker \nFor more on politics, go to\n \nwww.latimes.com/decker\n \nand \nwww.latimes.com/politics\n.", "byline": "", "description": "<p>As Donald Trump and other Republicans talked tough on illegal immigration during last week's presidential debate, an exasperated Jeb Bush noted that Hillary Clinton's campaign aides were, right then, exchanging high-fives.</p> <p>He might have added: And Republican leaders in many states, like California,...</p>", "title": "Three key areas that give Republicans trouble in California", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/la-me-pol-ca-california-politics-poll-20151115-story.html", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Rodham Clinton", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Ben Carson"], "org": "latimes", "election_confidence": 0.9969839217021564, "authors": [{"author_id": 41997, "fullname": "cathleen decker", "primary_org": "latimes"}], "date_written": "2015-11-15 08:05:00", "orgs": ["GOP", "Congress", "Los Angeles County"], "article_id": "5bf4d8ad78d9540c95882d1c5942fa1e", "date_access": "2015-11-15 08:26:25.829957"}, {"body": "AMES, Iowa (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Fresh from the second Democratic presidential debate, Hillary Rodham Clinton suggested Sunday that Bernie Sanders would raise middle-class taxes and \"scrap\" President Barack Obama's health care law, in an escalating critique of the Vermont senator.\nJoined by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, at a fall barbecue, the front-runner said middle-class families \"need a raise, not a tax increase\" and she was the lone Democrat in the debate to commit to raising wages \"and not your taxes.\"\nWithout mentioning her main rival by name, Clinton said Democrats should work to build on Obama's health law and not suggest \"we scrap it and start all over again.\" During the debate, Clinton questioned Sanders' 2013 health care legislation, saying it would dismantle the law and empower Republican governors like Terry Branstad of Iowa to administer the health care system in each state. Sanders envisions a \"single-payer\" system that would be run by the states under federal rules.\nEven as the field responded somberly to the deadly attacks in Paris, the debate Saturday night marked a feistier phase in the Democratic campaign. Helped by a strong autumn, Clinton has built a small lead in Iowa and is trying to stave off Sanders in the Feb. 1 presidential caucuses.\nSanders put Clinton on the defensive in the debate when he said Wall Street had been the major contributor to her campaigns in order to get support in return.\nClinton responded that Sanders was trying to \"impugn my integrity\" and said that as a New York senator, she helped New York City's financial hub rebuild after the Sept. 11 attacks. Her invoking of 9/11 received an incredulous response on social media and Republicans accused her of shamefully hiding behind the attacks to deflect attention from her ties to her wealthiest donors.\nTaking the stage in Ames, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley said Clinton brought up 9/11 to try to \"mask her proximity to Wall Street and the huge amount of contributions and the dollars she has received personally from the major banks of Wall Street.\"\n\"She doesn't have to mask it. It is what it is,\" O'Malley said. \"That is the sort of company, that is the sort economic advice that she would follow.\"\nSanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said following the debate that the senator's proposals would be paid for with higher taxes on the wealthy and large corporations. \"He's raising taxes to pay for relief for middle-income and working people,\" he said.\nHe also said Sanders would build upon the health care law to provide universal coverage. \"It's not a question of ripping up Obamacare, it's really expanding on the promise of Obamacare,\" Weaver said.\nThe barbecue inside a massive agriculture center featured another appearance by Bill Clinton, who briefly introduced his wife and joked that after watching the debates, \"I think I'm going to vote for Hillary.\"\n___\nOn Twitter, follow Ken Thomas: https://twitter.com/KThomasDC", "byline": "", "description": "AMES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Fresh from the second Democratic presidential debate, Hillary Rodham Clinton suggested Sunday that Bernie Sanders would raise middle-class taxes and \"scrap\" President Barack Obama's health care law, in an escalating critique of the Vermont senator.", "title": "Clinton goes after Sanders on taxes, health care", "url": "http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-11-15-US--DEM%202016-Clinton/id-e642156bd9b549fb8161c27ced2fad72", "topics": ["health"], "people": ["Jeff Weaver", "Martin O'Malley", "Bill Clinton", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Barack Obama", "Ken Thomas", "Bernie Sanders", "Terry Branstad"], "org": "ap", "election_confidence": 0.535904016805291, "authors": [{"author_id": 39392, "fullname": "ken thomas", "primary_org": "ap"}], "date_written": "2015-11-15 16:27:00", "orgs": ["AMES"], "article_id": "339e5cfe47434f9efe0d01fa28b3f86f", "date_access": "2015-11-15 22:00:05.671043"}]
