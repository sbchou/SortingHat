[{"body": "AMES, Iowa \u2013 The day after a debate in which Democratic presidential candidates tangled over the causes of Islamic State terrorism but not how to confront it, Hillary Rodham Clinton offered a more forward-looking view of American leadership in response to the threat.\n\n\u201cWe have to be rallying our partners and allies, pulling countries off the sidelines,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said on Sunday. \n\nShe called the Islamic State \u201cthe first Internet-fueled terrorist group,\u201d which will require strong countermeasures to its propaganda and recruitment.\n\nSpeaking at an indoor barbecue lunch hosted by several Iowa counties\u2019 Democratic parties, Mrs. Clinton offered no specifics. But she suggested a more proactive approach than she had in the debate, when she dodged a question about whether the Obama administration had underestimated the Islamic State and seemed to take a fatalistic view of terrorism connected to chaos in the Middle East.  \n\n\u201cAttacking Paris, the city of light, reminds us that there is no middle ground in going after these terrorists,\u2019\u2019 Mrs. Clinton said. She was notably alone in bringing up the Paris attacks. Former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland, who also spoke at the event, focused almost entirely on domestic issues. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was represented by a surrogate, the former Princeton professor Cornel West.     \n\nMrs. Clinton implicitly pressed her claim as the most qualified Democratic candidate for commander in chief, highlighting terrorism at a moment that the campaigns of both parties seem likely to pivot to national security and American leadership in the world. \n\nAlthough many pundits scored Saturday\u2019s debate a draw, with Mr. O\u2019Malley having his best night yet and Mr. Sanders more focused in his responses, a focus group of undecided Democrats in Des Moines, where the debate took place, gave Mrs. Clinton a clear win.  \n\nAll 33 likely caucus-goers in the group thought Mrs. Clinton would be the stronger commander in chief, said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic consultant who conducted the focus group.  \u201cIt was clear that Clinton\u2019s answers on terrorism, and her improved answers on domestic issues, moved undecided Iowans in striking ways,\u2019\u2019 he said.       \n\nMr. Kofinis identified one vulnerability: Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ties to Wall Street, exemplified by an answer to a question about accepting donations from rich bankers that has been widely mocked. \n\nMr. O\u2019Malley echoed the critique on Sunday, dismissing her explanation that she has been flooded with Wall Street donations in gratitude for her help in rebuilding the New York financial district after the terrorist attacks of 2001. \n\nMrs. Clinton \u201csadly invoked 9/11 to try to mask\u2019\u2019 her ties to Wall Street bankers, Mr. O\u2019Malley said on Sunday.    \n\nThe crowd of several hundred largely older Democrats did not respond strongly to Mr. O\u2019Malley\u2019s critiques of Mrs. Clinton, which  included sharper barbs than usual  about her record on guns and immigration.\n\nThe crowd, which swarmed Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton after she spoke, seemed pragmatic with less than three months before the Iowa caucuses and as Mr. Sanders\u2019s summer surge in the state appears to be ebbing.  \u201cPersonally, I like what Sanders and O\u2019Malley have to say,\u2019\u2019 Glenda Eggerling, a retiree, said.  \u201cBut I think Hillary will appeal to more voters, and I would really like to see a Democrat in the White House, because I don\u2019t like Republicans\u2019 platforms.\u2019\u2019\n\nSandra McJimsey, also a retiree, said, \u201cI think Bernie has done a great service to the party,\u201d but she declared herself \u201cenergized to vote for Hillary.\u2019\u2019\n\nDespite their embrace of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s foreign policy experience, Iowa Democrats had no interest in committing ground troops to fight the Islamic State, as several Republican candidates have advocated, or in declaring war, as Jeb Bush suggested on Sunday.\n\nChas Weber, a retiree who recently moved to Ames from Michigan, said the Paris attacks and confronting the Islamic State were \u201cthis week\u2019s hot topic,\u2019\u2019 which he predicted would soon give way to something else.\n\nAn independent who is candidate shopping, Mr. Weber plans to attend a rally for Donald J. Trump later in the week.  But he said he was no fan of Mr. Trump\u2019s call to aggressively bomb the Islamic State and commit ground troops.  \u201cHe\u2019s an extremist with no experience,\u2019\u2019 he said.", "byline": "TRIP GABRIEL", "description": "A day after the second Democratic presidential debate, where the candidates did not offer ideas on confronting extremists, Mrs. Clinton said the United States had to rally its allies, \u201cpulling countries off the sidelines.\u201d", "title": "First Draft: Hillary Clinton Takes a More Defined Stance on ISIS", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/15/hillary-clinton-takes-a-more-defined-stance-on-isis/", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Martin O'Malley", "Bill Clinton", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Vin Weber", "Donald Trump", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Donald J.

(REUTERS/Jim Young)\n\n\nHillary Clinton was put on the defensive at the opening of Saturday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability.\nThe debate in Des Moines, Iowa, came in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which thrust the issues of national security and foreign policy back to the center of the 2016 campaign. The debate format was changed to focus anew on those issues.\nBut, citing the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa, Clinton\u2019s rivals criticized her Senate vote for use of force before the Iraq war and appeared to criticize her support for toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley said America\u2019s role is not to roam the world \u201clooking for new dictators to topple.\u201d\nHe said it is also important to understand \u201csecondary and third consequences\u201d that come after removing a \u201csingle dictator.\u201d O\u2019Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a \u201cmess.\u201d\n\nClinton defended her support for toppling Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a \u201cgenocide\u201d and America\u2019s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support.\nShe also said \u201cit is imperative\u201d that the U.S. do more to confront the \u201carc of instability\u201d in the region. And to O\u2019Malley\u2019s critique, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think you can paint with a broad brush,\u201d and \u201cThis is an incredibly complicated region of the world.\u201d\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, referenced Clinton\u2019s support for use of force in Iraq and said the \u201cdisastrous invasion\u201d led \u201cto the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.\u201d\nClinton again called her Iraq war vote a \u201cmistake,\u201d but disputed that the war is the only driver of modern terrorism.\nThe candidates also condemned the Paris terror attacks.\n\u201cOur prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough,\u201d Clinton said.\nShe called for global \u201cresolve\u201d to \u201croot out\u201d the \u201cradical jihadist ideology\u201d that motivates groups like the Islamic State. Clinton, a former secretary of state, said she would coordinate efforts \u201cagainst the scourge of terrorism.\u201d\n\u201cIt cannot be contained. It must be defeated,\u201d she said of ISIS.\nSanders blasted ISIS as a \u201cbarbarous organization.\u201d\nO\u2019Malley called this the \u201cnew face\u201d of terror threats.\nThe attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said.\u00a0\nIn a primary race otherwise dominated by the economy, climate and front-runner Clinton\u2019s personal record, the debate in Des Moines, Iowa, now is expected to focus heavily on security and foreign policy after debate host CBS News reworked the format.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt is an area where Clinton, as former secretary of state, enters with the thickest resume \u2013 but also one that could prove problematic, given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable and chaotic nations like Libya and Syria.\nSanders, after appearing to give her a pass at the first debate over her personal email controversy, has in recent weeks shown a greater interest in criticizing her record. But his focus on issues like income inequality could be out of place in a discussion focused on global security challenges. Sanders\u2019 campaign objected to some of the CBS News debate tweaks, sources said.\nClinton also enters this debate \u2013 hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register \u2013 facing a narrower field than at their first encounter in October. Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O\u2019Malley.\nClinton is seen to have otherwise strengthened her hand since that debate, making it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and seeing one of her biggest potential political threats \u2013 a late bid by Vice President Biden \u2013 disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.\nSanders remains Clinton\u2019s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.\nStill, the FBI investigation over Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding.", "byline": "", "description": "Hillary Clinton was put on the defensive at the opening of Saturday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability.\u00a0", "title": "Clinton on defense over Middle East policies at Dem debate", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/TEOgoe910VE/", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Bernie Sanders", "Muammar Qaddafi", "Hillary Clinton", "Martin O'Malley", "Jim Young"], "org": "fox", "election_confidence": 0.9311865151561396, "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-11-15 02:02:16", "orgs": ["Senate", "Al Qaeda", "FBI"], "article_id": "b06f7a0e9f9c60524f5011b3887f1e37", "date_access": "2015-11-15 03:00:12.671185"}, {"body": "Republican candidates for president called on the Obama administration to tighten border controls amid reports that one of the suicide bombers who carried out\u00c2\u00a0Friday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attacks in Paris may have entered Europe as a Syrian migrant.\nFormer Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee said President Barack Obama should \u00e2\u0080\u009cclose our borders.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf a left-wing politically-correct country like France will close its borders, it\u2019s time for us to put a moratorium on people coming here from countries where there are ISIS or al Qaeda ties,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told CNN on Saturday.\nFlorida Sen.

Rand Paul addresses the Sunshine Summit. | AP Photo\n\n2016\n\n                        Trump, Cruz and others say their rhetoric on border security and Syrian refugees has been vindicated.\n\n            By \nBen Schreckinger\n\n11/15/15 06:44 AM EST\nORLANDO, Fla. \u2014The day after a series of terrorist attacks rocked Paris, Republican presidential candidates delivered a new message on immigration and border security: We told you so.\nIn the attacks \u2014 perpetrated by agents of the Islamic State, at least one of whom may have entered the European Union among a group of Syrian refugees \u2014 several Republican contenders saw vindication of their criticisms of President Obama on those issues. But the real target of their barbs was each other, as nearly every GOP candidate stressed their conservative bona fides on a topic that has fired up voters, powered the rise of Donald Trump and hobbled Jeb Bush's strategy of being willing to \"lose the primary to win the general.\"\nStory Continued Below\nAt the Sunshine Summit Republican gathering here, Chris Christie, Rand Paul and Bobby Jindal all tied the attacks to immigration on Saturday and raised the prospect that agents of ISIL had slipped into the United States already or could do so if the administration proceeds with plans to allow in Syrian refugees. On the campaign trail in Texas and South Carolina, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz did the same.\n\u201cPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2019s idea that we should bring tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees to America: it is nothing less than lunacy,\u201d Cruz told Fox News from the site of his campaign\u2019s \u201crally for religious liberty\u201d in Greenville.\nAt a rally in Beaumont, Texas, Trump \u2014 who expressed support for taking in Syrian refugees in September but later reversed himself \u2014 called the administration\u2019s plan to admit thousands of them \u201cinsane.\u201d\n\n\n\n            By \nNahal Toosi\n\n\u201cOur president wants to take in 250,000 from Syria,\u201d said Trump, inflating the actual figure, which is 10,000. \u201cWe all have heart, and we all want people taken care of and all that, but some of them are going to have problems, big problems.\u201d\nChristie rewrote his entire speech at the Republican Party of Florida\u2019s Sunshine Summit in response to the attacks, beginning with his account of the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, when he lost contact with his wife Mary Pat for five hours as she evacuated her office at the World Trade Center in New York.\nHe said that the federal government\u2019s failure to secure America\u2019s borders had left the country vulnerable to terrorist infiltration. \u201cOn an afternoon like this afternoon we wouldn\u2019t be worried about ISIS slipping across our borders to commit unspeakable acts of violence\u201d if the government had addressed the issue, he said.\nNoting that French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande had ordered the emergency closure of France\u2019s borders in the immediate aftermath of Friday\u2019s attacks, Jindal suggested the United States should follow his lead. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us here in America to secure our borders and keep us safe as well from these radical evil terrorists,\u201d said the Louisiana governor.\nEarlier at the summit, at a Friday evening post-speech press conference as the attacks were still unfolding, Carson said he opposed the admission of Syrian refugees into the country. If the administration does proceed with its plan to admit the refugees, Carson said, Islamic State leaders would be stupid not to try to plant terrorists among them. \u201cThat would almost be malpractice, you know?\u201d\nIn his speech at the summit, Paul targeted his Republican rival Marco Rubio as he addressed border security in light of the attacks.\n\u201cI think one of the lessons we should learn from the tragedy in Paris is that we have to be very careful, and very cautious \u2014 extraordinarily cautious \u2014 about who comes to visit, who immigrates here and who studies here,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n            By \nGabriel Debenedetti\n\nHe recounted the story of two Iraqi refugees who immigrated to his hometown of Bowling Green, Kentucky, and were later arrested for arranging to buy to surface-to-air missiles, saying that federal authorities do not do enough to screen out potential terrorists before allowing them into the country. \u201cWho in the hell is in charge of scrutinizing these people?\u201d he asked.\nPaul said he had attempted to strengthen border security by offering a \u201ctrust but verify\u201d amendment to the 2013 \u201cGang of Eight\u201d immigration bill that would have mandated an improved visa tracking system and greater congressional oversight of border policing.\nHe said that Rubio and Sen. Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, struck a \u201csecret\u201d deal to thwart conservative amendments to the bill. Paul\u2019s amendment was defeated and the bill itself died in the House.\n\u201cI don't know what Senator Paul is talking about,\u201d responded Rubio spokesman Alex Conant. \u201cIt would appear Senator Paul is trying to change the subject away from his dangerous isolationist agenda and proposals to cut defense spending. \u2026 Marco has been warning for months that ISIS terrorists could hide among refugees.\u201d\nNot all Republicans were ready to make political points in the immediate aftermath of the attack. The Republican opposition research group America Rising called off its rapid response to Hillary Clinton during Saturday night\u2019s Democratic debate because of its proximity to the attacks.\nAsked at the summit about the Obama administration\u2019s policies and the attacks, Florida Lieutenant Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, a Republican Senate candidate, took a pass, saying, \"It's all in poor taste today to be laying blame.\u201d\nMarc Caputo contributed to this report.\n\nBen Schreckinger is a reporter for Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Trump, Cruz and others say their rhetoric on border security and Syrian refugees has been vindicated.", "title": "GOP candidates link Paris attacks to immigration", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/paris-attacks-republicans-immigration-trump-cruz-215895", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Francois Hollande", "Alex Conant", "Jesse Rifkin", "Henry C.

Marco Rubio said U.S. allies should invoke the collective defense clause of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in response to terrorist attacks in Paris.\n\u201cThis is clearly an act of war and an attack on one of our NATO allies, and we should invoke Article 5 of the NATO agreement, and bring everyone together to put together a coalition to confront this challenge,\u201d Mr. Rubio said Sunday morning on ABC.\nFrench president Francois Hollande called the attacks \u201can act of war\u201d and cited Islamic State as responsible.\nFormer Florida governor and GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush stopped short calling for an Article 5 declaration, which is the formal recognition that an attack on one NATO member represents an attack on them all, and sets the groundwork for collective military action.\n\u201cI think the president should convene the North Atlantic Council to discuss that,\u201d Mr. Bush said Sunday morning on CNN. \u201cIf that\u2019s what the French want, then, our longest and strongest and most loyal ally over our entire history, we should certainly consider it.\u201d\nThe only time the collective defense provision was invoked came after the Sept. 11 terror attacks in the U.S.\nLater, on NBC, Mr. Bush said: \u201cThis is a threat to western civilization and we should consider it that way.\u201d\nThe U.S. and France already work together in operations in Iraq and Syria, sharing intelligence and coordinating airstrikes.\nBen Rhodes, deputy national security adviser to President Barack Obama, agreed with Mr.\u00a0Hollande that the attacks in Paris were an act of war. He said the U.S. wants \u201cto continue to intensify that coordination\u201d with France.\nWhile France hasn\u2019t invoked\u00a0Article 5,\u00a0NATO\u2019s secretary-general\u00a0Jens Stoltenberg said members are ready to assist.\n______________________________________________________\n2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll Standings\n\n\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops. \r\n\nCapital Journal Daybreak Newsletter: Sign up to get the latest on politics, policy and defense delivered to your inbox every morning.\r\nFor the latest Washington news, follow @wsjpolitics\r\nFor outside analysis, follow @wsjthinktank", "byline": "", "description": "Republican presidential candidate and Florida Sen.

It's become more complicated. And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in,\" she said.  \nThe Iraq exchange came early in the second debate for Democrats seeking their party's nomination for the November 2016 presidential election, which focused on foreign policy and ways to combat terrorism after the Paris attacks.\nThe candidates and audience at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, observed a moment of silence at the beginning of the debate to honor those killed in France.\nClinton, the former secretary of state, has far more foreign policy experience than either Sanders or O'Malley. But she was forced on the defensive early in the debate about her years of leading President Barack Obama's foreign policy team.\nClinton struck a sharp contrast to Obama's comments in an interview aired on Friday that ISIS had been contained. \"We have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network. It cannot be contained, it must be defeated,\" she said.\nRepublican presidential contenders have criticized Obama for what they say was an inadequate response to the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In the aftermath of the attacks, businessman Donald Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz called on the administration to reconsider plans to allow thousands of Syrian refugees to be resettled in the United States.\nThe White House aims to increase to 10,000 the number of Syrian refugees accepted in the United States during fiscal year 2016, from less than 2,000 accepted in the previous year.\nClinton has always been from the more hawkish wing of the Democratic Party. Her support for the 2003 Iraq invasion played a major role in her primary loss to Obama in the 2008 White House race.\nThe foreign policy focus was a dramatic shift in emphasis in a Democratic presidential race that so far has been dominated by domestic economic issues such as income inequality, college affordability and family leave.\nThe Democrats returned to that theme later in the debate, and Sanders criticized Clinton for her opposition to reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act, the 1933 law that established a firewall between investment and commercial banking. Its removal has been blamed by some for helping lead to the 2008 financial crisis.\n\"Over her political career, Wall Street has been a major, the major donor to Hillary Clinton. Now maybe they\u2019re dumb, but I don\u2019t think so,\" said Sanders, who favors reinstatement of the act.\nClinton accused Sanders of impugning her integrity and said reinstating the law was not enough to rein in corporate influence and reform Wall Street.\n\"Reinstating Glass-Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough,\" she said. \"I just don\u2019t think it would get the job done, I\u2019m all about making sure it actually gets results for whatever we do.\u201d \nWith the political clock ticking to the first nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 1, Clinton has opened a commanding lead over Sanders, her prime challenger, in national and Iowa polls. O'Malley trails well behind, in single digits in most polls.\n\n (Additional reporting by Megan Cassella and Luciana Lopez; Editing by Ken Wills)", "byline": "", "description": "DES MOINES, Iowa (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton came under heavy criticism in a debate on Saturday for her 2003 vote backing the U.S. invasion of Iraq, with rival Bernie Sanders linking it to regional chaos that aided the rise of Islamic State militants.", "title": "Clinton's Iraq vote, Wall Street stance criticized at Democratic debate", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/MostRead/~3/Y6L5GIMrkjQ/story01.htm", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Martin O'Malley", "Hillary Clinton", "Donald Trump", "Ken Wills", "Barack Obama", "Luciana Lopez", "Bernie Sanders", "Megan Cassella", "Ted Cruz"], "org": "reuters", "election_confidence": 0.8535870643969636, "authors": [{"author_id": 34291, "fullname": "john whitesides", "primary_org": "reuters"}, {"author_id": 33388, "fullname": "amanda becker", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-11-15 04:43:11", "orgs": ["Al Qaeda", "United States.", "Democratic Party", "DES MOINES"], "article_id": "a4954896a255a78dba2f6c30de441264", "date_access": "2015-11-15 06:00:46.954433"}, {"body": "Republican presidential candidates have criticized Democratic White House hopeful Hillary Clinton for declining\u00c2\u00a0to use term such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cradical Islam\u201d and \u201cIslamic terrorism\u201d\u00c2\u00a0to describe the extremists who have unleashed a string of terrorist attacks on Western targets recently.\nAsked at the second Democratic debate on Saturday night whether the U.S. was \u00e2\u0080\u009cat war with radical Islam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Clinton drew a distinction between the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1.6 billion Muslims and those who commit acts of violent extremism.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at war with Islam.

The debate format was changed to focus anew on those issues.\nBut, citing the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa, Clinton\u2019s rivals criticized her Senate vote for use of force before the Iraq war and appeared to criticize her support for toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.\nFormer Maryland Gov.

But his focus on issues like income inequality could be out of place in a discussion focused on global security challenges. Sanders\u2019 campaign objected to some of the CBS News debate tweaks, sources said.\nClinton also enters this debate \u2013 hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register \u2013 facing a narrower field than at their first encounter in October. Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O\u2019Malley.\nClinton is seen to have otherwise strengthened her hand since that debate, making it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and seeing one of her biggest potential political threats \u2013 a late bid by Vice President Biden \u2013 disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.\nSanders remains Clinton\u2019s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke.

Hours after the deadly attacks, CBS News, a co-host of the event, said it would refocus the debate to give candidates an opportunity to discuss how they would respond to such an international crisis.\n\nDespite the tragic nature of the events, the new backdrop represents an opportunity for Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former secretary of state, to shine at a moment when her two remaining rivals, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Martin O\u2019Malley \u2014 neither of whom has much foreign policy experience \u2014 will be under pressure to blunt her momentum.\n\nSince Mrs. Clinton\u2019s crisp debate performance in October, her poll numbers have surged, she weathered hours of congressional questioning about her handling of the Benghazi attacks, and three of her rivals for the nomination have dropped out.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see if Secretary Clinton can keep doing what she\u2019s been doing,\u201d said Brad Anderson, who was President Obama\u2019s 2012 state director in Iowa. \u201cHer steadiness is why you\u2019re seeing her poll numbers continue to increase, especially when you look at what\u2019s happening on the other side of the aisle.\u201d\n\nA New York Times/CBS News survey released this week showed Mrs. Clinton continuing to dominate the race, with more than half of Democratic primary voters backing her and 62 percent thinking she is the candidate who can bring about change in Washington. The shift in the debate\u2019s emphasis to foreign affairs should allow Mrs. Clinton to highlight her deep experience on the international stage, providing an opportunity to extend her advantage.\n\nFor Mrs. Clinton\u2019s opponents, the debate presents a chance to tell voters otherwise, and her Senate votes and handling of international crises as a senator and a diplomat could come under scrutiny.\n\nStill, the event is not expected to resemble the free-for-all atmosphere that has marked Republican debates, which have featured sharp exchanges and personal attacks. While the Republican primary contest is a crowded affair, the Democrats will have considerably more time to make their cases and delve into more detailed policy arguments on Saturday with just three candidates on the stage. Since the last debate, Lincoln Chafee, the former governor of Rhode Island, and former Senator Jim Webb of Virginia have dropped out of the race. Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard professor who was running as a Democrat but was not included in the last debate, also stopped his campaign.\n\nMr. Sanders will get another opportunity to take a harder line against Mrs. Clinton, after he dismissed the controversy surrounding her use of a private email server as secretary of state and largely avoided attacking her directly in their first face-off. He has been preparing sharper lines against Mrs. Clinton on issues like trade, gun control and her emails, and his advisers say he has been studying her record more closely since their October meeting.\n\nDemocratic strategists say the debate will also be a significant moment for Mr. O\u2019Malley, the former governor of Maryland, whose poll numbers lag in the low single digits. Facing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s star power and the grass-roots support behind Mr. Sanders, Mr. O\u2019Malley needs to find a way to capture some of the spotlight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the play that he has left in his playbook right now, to come out swinging and let people know he\u2019s not just this nice guy and that he can be tough,\u201d said Kevin Geiken, a Democratic political consultant for Bluprint Strategies.\n\nStill, it will be a challenge to rattle Mrs. Clinton, who has lurched to the left on issues like trade and the environment while showing a deft ability to repel criticism of her 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq war and her warm relationship with Wall Street.\n\nOne area on the domestic front that is likely to come up is the issue of criminal justice reform, which the three candidates have been struggling to address after continuing tension between the police and African-Americans.\n\nDeRay Mckesson, a leader of the Black Lives Matter movement, said he had a good sense of the plans from Mr. Sanders and Mr. O\u2019Malley, but had not heard a comprehensive proposal on the issue of criminal justice from Mrs. Clinton, despite her meetings with the group.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been eking it out literally one speech at a time,\u201d Mr. McKesson said. \u201cWith Hillary, I only have a surface-level understanding. The debate is a chance to learn what she really thinks about the core issues.\u201d\n\nBut voters will only learn if they tune in.

It was uttered on a night when her opponents were more direct in their criticism but still did not appear to lay a glove on her. \u00a0\nIndeed, O\u2019Malley\u2019s words are poignant, but ultimately won\u2019t make much of a difference. Hillary Clinton is 19 points up nationally and Saturday night\u2019s debate was another example of why she is so far in front.\nJust as in the first debate, Clinton showed the depth of her experience in politics over the last 30 years. She has the deepest understanding of the issues \u2013 particularly foreign policy having been secretary of state \u2013 and is a sharp, quick debater.\n\nNone of the candidates were willing to say that we\u2019re at war with radical Islam. Everyone was watching for this and it seemed that they erred on the side of political correctness. \n\nClinton continued to show herself to be a commanding force on the stage. This isn\u2019t to say that she didn\u2019t have struggles.\nShe tripped up during an answer about Wall Street where she countered that her work to aid the 9/11 recovery while a New York senator made her a crusader against Wall Street. And her vote for the Iraq war haunted her again. These are points the GOP will seize upon and showed flashes of weakness.\nSaturday debate began with a series of questions on terrorism and how America can combat ISIS, especially in light of the heinous attacks in Paris on Friday night. We knew this would happen, as it should. And each of the candidates emphasized how important American leadership is in the fight against terrorism, something I agree with wholeheartedly.\nIt was no surprise that Clinton was the most hawkish of the three candidates on stage. She talked of using airpower, training and equipping forces in the region and pushes our allies \u2013 especially Turkey and the Gulf States \u2013 to make up their minds about how much they\u2019re going to help in this effort. Sanders and O\u2019Malley had good rhetoric on the issue, but were vague and non-specific. And we also heard again that climate change is creating terrorism from Sanders \u2013 a claim that the Republicans will surely seize on.\nIt must be noted that Clinton was trying to distance herself from Obama's statement that ISIS needs to be \"contained\" by saying they need to be \"defeated.\" That being said, she did not declare war on ISIS. She did not forthrightly speak of the singular and unique role the U.S. must play in providing leadership, and sought to deflect attention from Sanders' efforts to link her with the rise of ISIS because of her support of the Iraq war by blaming George Bush.\nIn short, it was a good and effective job for a Democratic primary audience, but all three candidates were on the defensive for much of the first part of the debate over the Middle East and the War on Terror. This will probably be a manageable challenge in the Democratic primary, but will almost certainly be a more serious challenge during the general election campaign. We will have to watch how this unfolds closely.\nFurthermore, none of the candidates were willing to say that we\u2019re at war with radical Islam. Everyone was watching for this and it seemed that they erred on the side of political correctness.\nClinton had the best rationale for not using the term by defending it in terms of not offending our Muslim allies, but coming on the day after the Paris attacks, I\u2019m sure this will be an issue.\nThere was more antagonism on Saturday night than we\u2019ve seen before. Sanders went after Clinton for her close ties to Wall Street and on gun control. And Clinton returned the favor.\nO\u2019Malley got in on the action to tout how far he went as Maryland governor to raise wages, control gun violence and work to combat climate change. He certainly did better than he has before, but I don\u2019t think he made a strong case for an O\u2019Malley presidency. As Sanders pointed out, it\u2019s not like Baltimore is doing too well right now. And he\u2019s right.\nThe most important thing that voters will have seen at the Iowa debate this week is that a Clinton and a Sanders presidency would be very different.\nSanders believes two things are of paramount importance: income inequality and climate change. His plans could push taxes on the rich upwards of 80 percent-- in a light moment he joked about Dwight Eisenhower levying a 90% tax -- and he\u2019d bring back Glass-Steagall and break up the banks. Sanders supports a $15 minimum wage and free college tuition. And he brought the conversation on health care back to the idea of single payer, a favorite of the progressive left.\nThese are all areas where you can see differences with Clinton. She only supports a $12 federal minimum wage and said it should be up to states/cities to raise it above that (this is also what Senate Democrats support). She wouldn\u2019t break up the banks or bring back Glass-Steagall while at the same time arguing that her proposals go the furthest in reining in the banks.\nOn health care, Clinton wants to build on ObamaCare and improve it, especially by focusing on the issue of prescription drug costs.\nIt\u2019s also important to note that all the candidates were allied on immigration \u2013 each supports comprehensive immigration plan and a pathway to citizenship.\nMartin O\u2019Malley was the only candidate to say how many Syrian refugees he\u2019d take in (65,000), but they all argued that it\u2019s our humanitarian duty to take in refugees. This will also be a sticking point after the Paris attacks.\nAll this is to say that Saturday night\u2019s event was a well-moderated debate and all the candidates did well.\nIt\u2019s just that Clinton did that much better. She\u2019s the only one on stage who looked presidential. And I believe everyone could see that. \n\nDouglas E. Schoen has served as a pollster for President Bill Clinton.

Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley painting the former senator from New York as a lackey for Wall Street and corporate interests.\n\"Let's not be naive about it,\" said Sanders, noting that Clinton collected millions in campaign donations from Wall Street bankers. \"They expect to get something. Everybody knows that.\"\nThe barbs marked a far more aggressive shift in a primary race that has so far been notable for its civility. Democrats have spent months boasting about the substantive tone of their contest, attempting to set up a favorable early contrast with the \"carnival barker\" insults of the crowded Republican primary.\nClinton faced criticism of her national security record, when Sanders traced the current instability in the Middle East to the U.S. Senate's vote \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including Clinton's \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to authorize military action in Iraq in 2002. He said that U.S. invasion \"unraveled the region.\"\nThe former secretary of state fought back, saying terrorism has been erupting for decades, specifically mentioning the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. She said the recent unrest in Libya and other parts of the Middle East is symptomatic of an \"arc of instability from North Africa to Afghanistan.\"\nShe rejected the idea that she and the rest of the Obama administration underestimated the growing threat of the Islamic State.\nThe back-and-forth revealed a foreign policy split within the Democratic Party, with Sanders playing to the anti-war activists who boosted then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama to victory in 2008.\nSanders argued for a far more hands-off approach, advocating for Muslim countries to lead the fight and declaring that the war against Islamic State militants is about the \"soul of Islam.\"\nClinton has a history of advocating for more robust involvement across the globe \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both as a presidential candidate eight years ago and as Obama's secretary of state. In recent weeks, she has called for a more aggressive U.S. role in the Syrian conflict, including a no-fly zone over the area, a move the Obama administration opposes. But she stood by her opposition to seeking a formal declaration of war against the Islamic State.\nForeign relations is an area where Clinton, as a former secretary of state, is in the strongest position to talk about the attacks and the U.S. effort to dismantle the Islamic State group. But she is vulnerable, too, her tenure tied to that of Obama, who's struggled to contain the threat from Islamic militants in Syria and associated terror attacks across the globe.\nThe candidates were meeting in the shadow of the Paris attacks that killed at least 129 and wounded at least 352 people. The debate began with a solemn tone, with a moment of silence followed by previously unplanned foreign policy questions.\nAll the candidates denounced the attacks, the first time the Democratic field spoke about the incidents.\nThey gave some fodder to their Republican critics, who coupled condemnation of the Paris attacks during the day with sharp criticism for Obama and his former secretary of state, Clinton.\n\"We are at war with violent extremism, we are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression,\" said Clinton, arguing the U.S. is not at war with Islam or all Muslims. \"I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.\"\nSanders and O'Malley agreed with her sentiments, saying the term \"radical Islam\" used by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and other Republican presidential candidates, is unnecessarily offensive to American Muslims.\nRepublicans immediately seized on the remarks. \"Yes, we are at war with radical Islamic terrorism,\" tweeted former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\nThe conversation later pivoted to economic issues, with the candidates tangling over how to pay for their plans to expand college affordability, family leave and prescription drug coverage. All three agreed that wealthy citizens and corporations should pay more in taxes to benefit the middle class.\n\"I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,\" joked Sanders, saying the former president backed a 90 percent marginal tax rate.\nThe three tangled over how high to increase the minimum wage, with Clinton backing a $12-per-hour federal floor while Sanders and O'Malley said $15 an hour \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the rate being pushed by a campaign of fast-food workers and labor unions.\nWhile Clinton is wary of alienating Sanders backers whose support she'll need should she win the nomination, she drew a contrast with him on gun control. Highlighting a vote he took giving the gun industry immunity from lawsuits, she charged him with failing to push hard enough to regulate ownership.\nSince the party's first debate a month ago, Clinton has built a lead in the early voting states, an uptick that has come amid other signs the party is coalescing behind her. An Associated Press survey of superdelegates published Friday found that half of the Democratic insiders are publicly backing Clinton.\nSanders may have inadvertently facilitated some of her progress in the first debate, when he seemed to dismiss the controversy over her use of a private email account and server by saying Americans are tired of hearing about her \"damn emails.\"\nSaturday night, Sanders declined once again to attack:  \"I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email. I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email,\" he said.\n\"I agree completely,\" said Clinton, with a laugh.\n___\nFollow Lisa Lerer on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/llerer", "byline": "", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 With the country still reeling from deadly terrorist attacks in Paris, Hillary Rodham Clinton cast herself as America's strongest leader in a scary world, even as she found herself forced to defend her own role during the rise of the Islamic State militants.", "title": "Clinton, Sanders debate foreign policy after Paris attacks", "url": "http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2015-11-14-US--DEM%202016-Debate/id-838ac0452db545a59dfdb9f7a2186c7a", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Martin O'Malley", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Lisa Lerer", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Marco Rubio", "Barack Obama", "Bernie Sanders"], "org": "ap", "election_confidence": 0.9415475997294712, "authors": [{"author_id": 39735, "fullname": "lisa lerer", "primary_org": "ap"}], "date_written": "2015-11-14 22:43:00", "orgs": ["Democratic Party"], "article_id": "cf5e8d280f01a588e9a6f8606eb8bc7a", "date_access": "2015-11-15 04:00:02.878079"}]
