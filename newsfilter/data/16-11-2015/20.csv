"Democratic U.S. presidential candidates Senator Bernie Sanders (L), former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley pose on stage ahead of the second official 2016 U.S. Democratic presidential candidates debate in Des Moines, Iowa, November 14, 2015.   (REUTERS/Jim Young)Hillary Clinton was put on the defensive at the opening of Saturday night’s Democratic presidential debate over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability.The debate in Des Moines, Iowa, came in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which thrust the issues of national security and foreign policy back to the center of the 2016 campaign. The debate format was changed to focus anew on those issues.But, citing the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa, Clinton’s rivals criticized her Senate vote for use of force before the Iraq war and appeared to criticize her support for toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley said America’s role is not to roam the world “looking for new dictators to topple.”He said it is also important to understand “secondary and third consequences” that come after removing a “single dictator.” O’Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a “mess.”Clinton defended her support for toppling Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a “genocide” and America’s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support.She also said “it is imperative” that the U.S. do more to confront the “arc of instability” in the region. And to O’Malley’s critique, she said, “I don’t think you can paint with a broad brush,” and “This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.”Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, referenced Clinton’s support for use of force in Iraq and said the “disastrous invasion” led “to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.”Clinton again called her Iraq war vote a “mistake,” but disputed that the war is the only driver of modern terrorism.The candidates also condemned the Paris terror attacks.“Our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough,” Clinton said.She called for global “resolve” to “root out” the “radical jihadist ideology” that motivates groups like the Islamic State. Clinton, a former secretary of state, said she would coordinate efforts “against the scourge of terrorism.”“It cannot be contained. It must be defeated,” she said of ISIS.Sanders blasted ISIS as a “barbarous organization.”O’Malley called this the “new face” of terror threats.The attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said. In a primary race otherwise dominated by the economy, climate and front-runner Clinton’s personal record, the debate in Des Moines, Iowa, now is expected to focus heavily on security and foreign policy after debate host CBS News reworked the format.  It is an area where Clinton, as former secretary of state, enters with the thickest resume – but also one that could prove problematic, given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable and chaotic nations like Libya and Syria.Sanders, after appearing to give her a pass at the first debate over her personal email controversy, has in recent weeks shown a greater interest in criticizing her record. But his focus on issues like income inequality could be out of place in a discussion focused on global security challenges. Sanders’ campaign objected to some of the CBS News debate tweaks, sources said.Clinton also enters this debate – hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register – facing a narrower field than at their first encounter in October. Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O’Malley.Clinton is seen to have otherwise strengthened her hand since that debate, making it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and seeing one of her biggest potential political threats – a late bid by Vice President Biden – disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.Sanders remains Clinton’s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.Still, the FBI investigation over Clinton’s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding. ",,Hillary Clinton was put on the defensive at the opening of Saturday night’s Democratic presidential debate over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability. ,Clinton on defense over Middle East policies at Dem debate,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/TEOgoe910VE/,['foreign policy/national security'],"['Bernie Sanders', 'Muammar Qaddafi', 'Hillary Clinton', u""Martin O'Malley"", 'Jim Young']",fox,0.9311865151561396,[],2015-11-15 02:02:16,"['Senate', 'Al Qaeda', 'FBI']",b06f7a0e9f9c60524f5011b3887f1e37,2015-11-15 03:00:12.671185
"Here’s the latest:• What is the status of the investigation?The French authorities have released no information since a news conference by the Paris prosecutor on Saturday, and no updates are scheduled for Sunday.The death toll holds at 129, but the number of critically wounded — nearly 100 — signaled that figure was certain to grow.Investigators were hunting down information about the first of the suspects to be publicly identified, Ismaël Omar Mostefaï, 29, a French citizen who was one of three hostage takers at the Bataclan concert hall.In the eastern Paris suburb of Montreuil, the authorities found three Kalashnikov rifles in an abandoned vehicle, a sign that some of the attackers may have escaped.The authorities in Belgium made seven arrests that left open the possibility that the plot had roots there.Fundamental questions remain: How did the terrorists, who acted in three synchronized teams, pull off the deadliest terrorist attack in Western Europe since 2004?And did they receive direction from Islamic State leaders in Iraq and Syria, who until now had never taken responsibility for such a large-scale attack in the West?• What’s happening in Paris?Paris is still by and large shuttered, even for a Sunday, and France remains under a state of emergency.Museums and other cultural centers are closed for a second day. A star-crossed movie opening about a terrorist attack in France was canceled.But small crowds congregated at the Place de la République — as they did after the Charlie Hebdo massacre in January — to show solidarity on Saturday, ignoring government advice to stay home. And French flags are appearing in Parisian apartment windows.The archbishop of Paris officiates at a Mass at the Cathedral of Notre-Dame today. And schools are to reopen on Monday.• What about elsewhere?From Vatican City to Seoul, law enforcement authorities are on heightened alert.Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari of Iraq said his country’s intelligence services obtained information indicating that, besides France, the United States and Iran were among countries being targeted for attack.• What’s next for policy makers?As France deals with the aftermath in Paris, global attention turns to policy and politics. President Obama and other world leaders are in Turkey for a Group of 20 summit meeting today, where the terrorist attacks are already a focus.Migration is, too, because one of the assailants entered the European Union through Greece with other refugees last month and then passed through Serbia, where he sought asylum.That is sure to complicate the vexing problem of how to handle the unceasing flow of people from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere in Europe. Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, said today that Europe should not react by rejecting refugees.European Union justice and interior ministers will hold a special meeting on the Paris attacks Friday.• How is Paris playing in the U.S. presidential campaign?Candidates for the Democratic nomination, in their debate Saturday night in Des Moines, agreed that America is determined to fight terrorism, dedicated to responsibilities to refugees and devoted to diplomacy.But Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont sought to tie the rise of the Islamic State to Hillary Rodham Clinton’s vote as a senator to authorize the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.By contrast, leading Republicans like Donald J. Trump, Ben Carson and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas called on the Obama administration to halt plans to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees next year.Although they broadly agreed that the Paris attacks should be the catalyst for a new military strategy against the Islamic State, most of the Republicans were still tentative about committing more American ground troops to that effort.• Who were the victims?Little seemed to tie the dead at the six attack sites, except that they were out having fun. And that was the point for the Islamic State militant group, which said that it struck France’s symbols of “perversity.”“Bars, a concert, a great game,” Bernard-Henri Lévy, a French author and philosopher, wrote on Twitter. “This is the French art of living together that has been targeted.”Several foreigners, including people from Belgium, Britain, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United States, were killed in the attacks.An American student from California State University in Long Beach, Nohemi Gonzalez, 23, also died in the Paris attacks. She was spending a semester at the Strate School of Design in Paris.Valentin Ribet, a 26-year-old lawyer, was killed at the Bataclan concert hall during a sold-out show by the American rock band Eagles of Death Metal.Guillaume B. Decherf, 43, a critic at a French cultural magazine and a father of two, was killed as well. Three employees from Universal Music France also died, as did Nick Alexander, a British citizen who sold merchandise for the band, and Aurélie De Peretti, 33.“Yesterday, the victims weren’t journalists or famous. They were civilians,” Maxim Ferron, manager of a Paris tea shop, said on Saturday.You can sign up here to get the regular weekday Morning Briefing delivered to your inbox.

" “We will not solve our nation’s problems … by returning to [the] polarizing figures of our past.”This was a not so veiled attack against Hillary Clinton from Martin O’Malley on Saturday night at the second Democratic debate. It was uttered on a night when her opponents were more direct in their criticism but still did not appear to lay a glove on her.  Indeed, O’Malley’s words are poignant, but ultimately won’t make much of a difference. Hillary Clinton is 19 points up nationally and Saturday night’s debate was another example of why she is so far in front.Just as in the first debate, Clinton showed the depth of her experience in politics over the last 30 years. She has the deepest understanding of the issues – particularly foreign policy having been secretary of state – and is a sharp, quick debater.None of the candidates were willing to say that we’re at war with radical Islam. Everyone was watching for this and it seemed that they erred on the side of political correctness. Clinton continued to show herself to be a commanding force on the stage. This isn’t to say that she didn’t have struggles.She tripped up during an answer about Wall Street where she countered that her work to aid the 9/11 recovery while a New York senator made her a crusader against Wall Street. And her vote for the Iraq war haunted her again. These are points the GOP will seize upon and showed flashes of weakness.Saturday debate began with a series of questions on terrorism and how America can combat ISIS, especially in light of the heinous attacks in Paris on Friday night. We knew this would happen, as it should. And each of the candidates emphasized how important American leadership is in the fight against terrorism, something I agree with wholeheartedly.It was no surprise that Clinton was the most hawkish of the three candidates on stage. She talked of using airpower, training and equipping forces in the region and pushes our allies – especially Turkey and the Gulf States – to make up their minds about how much they’re going to help in this effort. Sanders and O’Malley had good rhetoric on the issue, but were vague and non-specific. And we also heard again that climate change is creating terrorism from Sanders – a claim that the Republicans will surely seize on.It must be noted that Clinton was trying to distance herself from Obama's statement that ISIS needs to be ""contained"" by saying they need to be ""defeated."" That being said, she did not declare war on ISIS. She did not forthrightly speak of the singular and unique role the U.S. must play in providing leadership, and sought to deflect attention from Sanders' efforts to link her with the rise of ISIS because of her support of the Iraq war by blaming George Bush.In short, it was a good and effective job for a Democratic primary audience, but all three candidates were on the defensive for much of the first part of the debate over the Middle East and the War on Terror. This will probably be a manageable challenge in the Democratic primary, but will almost certainly be a more serious challenge during the general election campaign. We will have to watch how this unfolds closely.Furthermore, none of the candidates were willing to say that we’re at war with radical Islam. Everyone was watching for this and it seemed that they erred on the side of political correctness.Clinton had the best rationale for not using the term by defending it in terms of not offending our Muslim allies, but coming on the day after the Paris attacks, I’m sure this will be an issue.There was more antagonism on Saturday night than we’ve seen before. Sanders went after Clinton for her close ties to Wall Street and on gun control. And Clinton returned the favor.O’Malley got in on the action to tout how far he went as Maryland governor to raise wages, control gun violence and work to combat climate change. He certainly did better than he has before, but I don’t think he made a strong case for an O’Malley presidency. As Sanders pointed out, it’s not like Baltimore is doing too well right now. And he’s right.The most important thing that voters will have seen at the Iowa debate this week is that a Clinton and a Sanders presidency would be very different.Sanders believes two things are of paramount importance: income inequality and climate change. His plans could push taxes on the rich upwards of 80 percent-- in a light moment he joked about Dwight Eisenhower levying a 90% tax -- and he’d bring back Glass-Steagall and break up the banks. Sanders supports a $15 minimum wage and free college tuition. And he brought the conversation on health care back to the idea of single payer, a favorite of the progressive left.These are all areas where you can see differences with Clinton. She only supports a $12 federal minimum wage and said it should be up to states/cities to raise it above that (this is also what Senate Democrats support). She wouldn’t break up the banks or bring back Glass-Steagall while at the same time arguing that her proposals go the furthest in reining in the banks.On health care, Clinton wants to build on ObamaCare and improve it, especially by focusing on the issue of prescription drug costs.It’s also important to note that all the candidates were allied on immigration – each supports comprehensive immigration plan and a pathway to citizenship.Martin O’Malley was the only candidate to say how many Syrian refugees he’d take in (65,000), but they all argued that it’s our humanitarian duty to take in refugees. This will also be a sticking point after the Paris attacks.All this is to say that Saturday night’s event was a well-moderated debate and all the candidates did well.It’s just that Clinton did that much better. She’s the only one on stage who looked presidential. And I believe everyone could see that. Douglas E. Schoen has served as a pollster for President Bill Clinton.

"WashingtonThe Democratic candidates for president gathered in Des Moines, Iowa, for their second debate Saturday, and CNN's Reality Check team spent the night putting their statements and assertions to the test.The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN selected key statements and rated them: True; Mostly True; True, but Misleading; False; or It's Complicated.Previous CNN Reality Check coverage of the Democratic and Republican candidates can be found here. This story will be updated throughout the night.Reality Check: Sanders on vets with PTSDBy Debra Goldschmidt, CNN HealthVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said, ""When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war, the 500,000 who came home with PTSD and traumatic brain injury.""Roughly 2.6 million veterans served in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs says 11% to 20% of military members who served in Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from PTSD.According to a Veteran Affairs independent study on traumatic brain injury, self-reported data found 15% of troops who were engaged in active combat in Afghanistan and Iraq ""may have suffered"" a mild traumatic brain injury. This falls in line with a report from the Brain Trauma Foundation, which found between 10% to 20% of Iraq veterans suffer from some level of traumatic brain disorder.Verdict: TrueReality Check: O'Malley on net immigration from MexicoBy Sonam Vashi, CNNFormer Gov. Martin O'Malley said, ""The truth of the matter is net immigration from Mexico last year was zero."" He then challenged viewers to fact-check him, and we couldn't resist.According to the Pew Research Center, net migration from Mexico probably reached zero in 2010, and more Mexicans have left the United States than arrived since then.Additionally, the actual number of Mexicans living in the United States consistently declined throughout 2014. The U.S. Border Patrol also reported that in the 2014 fiscal year, the number of Mexicans apprehended along the border decreased 14% when compared to the 2013 fiscal year.The information we have suggests that the net immigration rate is negative -- which is actually not zero -- but it is close, and probably still supports O'Malley's point.Verdict: Mostly true",,,Democratic debate: CNN's Reality Check team inspects the claims,http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/14/politics/democratic-debate-fact-check/index.html,['immigration'],"['Bernie Sanders', u""Martin O'Malley""]",cnn,0.5480945459848154,"[{'author_id': 45638, 'fullname': u""cnn's reality check team"", 'primary_org': 'cnn'}]",2015-11-15 04:09:39,"['U.S. Border Patrol', 'Pew Research Center']",5f763ceb49f12a5e357faeff8b4407dd,2015-11-15 04:16:08.650830
"i            Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Martin O'Malley stand on the stage prior to Saturday's Democratic primary presidential debate in Des Moines, Iowa.                                                        Alex Wong/Getty Images                            hide captionitoggle caption                Alex Wong/Getty Images            Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Martin O'Malley stand on the stage prior to Saturday's Democratic primary presidential debate in Des Moines, Iowa.                        Alex Wong/Getty Images                    Hillary Clinton entered the second debate of the campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination with far less to prove than she had in the first, and, in the end, she probably achieved far less as well. But for the time being, at least, she may be able to afford it. The first debate, in October, corresponded with a time of stress for her candidacy, besieged by various legal and political investigators and drifting downward in voter-preference polls. But Clinton did so well and struck such a blend of competence and charm in the October debate on CNN that she was widely acknowledged to have rescued her fortunes — or at least strengthened her hand. This latest debate on CBS News and staged at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, was never likely to have as great an impact. The likely audience was limited. It was staged on a Saturday night, competing with various sports and entertainment programs. This weekend, in particular, it was overshadowed by the tragedy unfolding in Paris, where at least 129 people died in terrorist attacks Friday night. The group known as Islamic State claimed responsibility for the coordinated attacks by teams of gunmen and suicide bombers. The debaters observed a moment of silence for the victims in Paris and devoted the first quarter of the debate to discussing the attacks and the proper response from the U.S. and its allies. All agreed the U.S. had a major, leading role to play in battling the terrorists, but all also agreed that U.S. allies needed to respond with greater commitment as well. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont noted that the struggles in the Middle East amounted to ""a war for the soul of Islam,"" implying it was a contest beyond the power of the U.S. government to resolve. But Sanders also explicitly assigned responsibility for the current turmoil in the Middle East to the administration of George W. Bush, whose invasion of Iraq in 2003 was responsible for ""all this instability,"" he said. Sanders made the point that he had opposed the invasion on the Senate floor, where Clinton had voted in support. Clinton has since called that vote a mistake. But the most difficult part of that first segment of the debate for Clinton came when CBS News debate moderator John Dickerson asked whether her prescriptions for the fight against the group called Islamic State suffered for her association with President Obama, who has been downplaying, or underestimating, the strength of the group. As recently as this week, the president had said the group had been ""contained,"" at least in its territorial ambitions in Iraq and Syria. On this, Clinton distanced herself from the president somewhat, saying she had advised more involvement in the region after the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq — a shift she said was mandated by the agreement struck with Iraq by the last Bush administration. She had said she warned that ""extremist groups might fill the vacuum."" Sanders said several times that the Department of Defense budget was already $600 billion and that the U.S. should be hesitant to increase that greatly without knowing what it was expecting to accomplish with more military hardware. A self-described Democratic Socialist, Sanders also contrasted his reliance on small donors with the Clinton campaign's donations from the wealthy of Wall Street: ""Maybe they're stupid about what they're going to get [in return], but I don't think so."" Clinton then insisted on a chance to respond, because Sanders had ""impugned my integrity."" That drew an audible sound of anticipation from the crowd, which may not have expected even this degree of confrontation between the candidates after the harmony of the first debate. Clinton then said she had many thousands of donors, most of them not rich, and 60 percent of them women. Although not directly responsive to the Wall Street thrust from Sanders, Clinton's reference to gender prompted applause and cheers from the crowd. This was her best moment of the debate, according to people following the proceedings on social media such as Twitter. Clinton went on to suggest her contributions from Wall Street stemmed from appreciation for all she had done to help the Lower Manhattan financial industry recover from the terror attacks of September 2001. That rationale drew a decidedly mixed response from the audience in the hall and on social media, with many questioning whether it fully explained the generous contributions she still receives from the financial industry more than a dozen years later. .@HillaryClinton vehemently offers support for Wall Street as post-911 recovery effort.  Does that fly?— David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) November 15, 2015Sanders said Clinton's plan to increase regulation of the financial industry was ""not good enough,"" and he had corroborating support from third-place challenger Martin O'Malley, the former governor of Maryland, who called the Clinton plan ""weak tea."" The candidates revisited a divide on gun violence, with Sanders saying he was willing to reconsider his past opposition to legislation stripping gun manufacturers of their liability when their products were used in the commission of crimes. O'Malley sided with Clinton on this issue, only moments after favoring Sanders' point of view on banking regulation. But, in general, the candidates were largely in agreement on major issues. They agreed that President Obama had been right to offer a path to citizenship for young people brought to the U.S. illegally while still minor children. ""The symbol of America is the Statue of Liberty,"" said O'Malley, ""not a barbed-wire fence."" O'Malley also won cheers from the crowd for his reference to ""that immigrant-bashing carnival-barker Donald Trump,"" a reference to the candidate leading most polls among Republican candidates for president. All three candidates supported greater access to a college education, with Sanders saying all public universities and colleges should be tuition-free. Clinton said she did not think taxpayers should pay for Trump's children to go to college, as he is a billionaire. O'Malley noted that he had held the line on tuition increases at state schools when he was a governor. And neither Sanders nor O'Malley took the bait when asked whether Clinton's private e-mail server should have been used for any kind of government business. Sanders in particular refused the chance to criticize her on the issue, saying he was still ""tired of her emails,"" as he had said in the first debate. Dickerson then asked Clinton if there were ""other shoes to drop"" as multiple investigations proceed into her time in office and the activities of her aides. Clinton alluded to her 11 hours of testimony before a House investigative panel last month as an indication to the contrary. Overall, the debate did not seem likely to affect Clinton's standing in the primary field. Despite moments of vulnerability and dubious reaction to her defenses regarding Wall Street contributors, she remained the strong center of the cast on stage. She had 40 percent of the total speaking time, with 35 percent going to Sanders and 25 percent to O'Malley. But as she had arrived at this juncture of the campaign as not only the leader but an increasingly dominant leader, Clinton had little room to improve. Dickerson also invited favorable comparison to his predecessors in the role of debate moderator. His questions were crisp, to the point and frequently challenging — but without the argumentative tone that has brought criticism from participants in earlier debates on the Republican side.",,"Former Maryland Gov.

"Democrats and Republicans, based on their recent presidential debates, are set to offer voters a stark choice in 2016 about how the economy should be managed, with both sides moving toward the outer flanks of their parties.In Saturday’s Democratic debate, candidates said they would seek to rein in Wall Street, raise taxes, increase the minimum wage and expand the federal government’s role in health care. Republicans, meanwhile, are competing to repeal regulations, cut taxes, keep the minimum wage as it stands and roll back President Barack Obama’s signature health-care overhaul.The parties right now “have polar opposite analyses of how the economy works and how it should work,” said Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser in the Obama administration. “It’s obvious but underappreciated how far apart they are on the fundamentals—wages, taxes, financial markets.”Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, sparred Saturday over how to pay for new federal investments in education, infrastructure and health care. Both called for raising taxes on the wealthy, although Mrs. Clinton pledged to do so without hitting families that earn less than $250,000 or increasing deficits, which would constrain new spending ambitions.Mr. Sanders wouldn’t say exactly how high tax rates should rise but noted the top tax rate had been 91% in the 1950s under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican. “I’m not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,” Mr. Sanders said.Republicans have put tax-cutting proposals at the heart of their economic policy agenda, and they have largely shied away from promises made by candidates four years ago to avoid running up budget deficits.The boldness of some proposals drew warnings from one candidate, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, at last week’s Republican presidential debate. “Hillary and the Democrats promise everything on the spending side. We’ve got to be responsible about what we propose on the tax side,” he said.Republicans at last week’s debate also dismissed efforts to boost the federal minimum wage, now at $7.25 an hour, as an ineffective way to raise incomes. Florida Sen.  Marco Rubio and businessman  Donald Trump said it would put U.S. workers at a disadvantage. “You’re going to make people more expensive than a machine,” Mr. Rubio said.Democrats on Saturday debated whether to target a federal minimum wage of $12 or $15 an hour. Mr. Sanders supports the higher threshold, an effort backed by labor unions. He brushed aside warnings issued recently by Alan Krueger, the Princeton University professor who served as Mr. Obama’s top economist, that a $15 minimum wage is an untested, risky level. His research contends minimum-wage increases haven’t decreased employment, and he supports raising wages to $12 an hour.“I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously,” said Mrs. Clinton, who also has endorsed the $12 floor.Mr. Sanders and Martin O’Malley, the third candidate at Saturday’s debate and a former Maryland governor, said they would shun anyone with Wall Street ties from top positions in their administrations, including figures such as  Robert Rubin and Larry Summers, who served as treasury secretaries for President  Bill Clinton.Some Democrats have faulted that approach. “The idea that you have to excommunicate anybody who ever worked in the financial sector is ridiculous,” said Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist Democratic think tank. “We need people who oversee the Federal Reserve system and have high posts at Treasury that have expertise in finance.”Both Republicans and Democrats have promised to crack down on Wall Street, but they disagree sharply over how to do it. Republicans generally have blamed government policies, from housing to Federal Reserve interest-rate decisions, for provoking the financial crisis. They say the Dodd-Frank Act in particular has restrained economic growth and should be repealed.Democrats quarreled Saturday over whether the regulatory overhaul had gone far enough by failing to reinstate a New Deal-era law that separated commercial and investment banking, known as the Glass-Steagall Act.The flare-up over banking laws reflected Mr. Sanders’s broader critique that Democrats and Republicans have given banks too much political power, a throwback to the “trust busting” of President Theodore Roosevelt more than a century ago. Why do big industries make “millions of dollars of campaign contributions?

"WASHINGTON The deadly attacks in Paris pushed terrorism and the Syrian refugee crisis to the center of the U.S presidential campaign on Sunday, as Republicans hammered Obama administration plans to take in more refugees as well as Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton's stance on Middle East policy.After officials said one of the Paris gunmen might have slipped into Europe among refugees fleeing Syria's war, more Republicans voiced their opposition to the 10,000 Syrian refugees the White House wants to admit in the coming year.""Bringing people into this country from that area of the world I think is a huge mistake,"" Republican candidate Ben Carson said on the ""Fox News Sunday"" program, echoing comments by fellow Republican contenders on Saturday.While the U.S. number is a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of refugees that Europe is prepared to take, the plan has become a main point of attack for candidates seeking to show a tougher stance on terrorism.The deadliest attack in Europe in a decade could end up reshaping the race to elect a U.S. president in 2016.Clinton, a former secretary of state under President Barack Obama, told a debate on Saturday in Iowa that she supported raising the refugee intake to 65,000, but only with a careful screening and vetting process.Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for Obama, defended the administration's vetting process as thorough and made a humanitarian appeal.""We're also dealing with people who've suffered the horrors of war, women and children, orphans. We can't just shut our doors to those people,"" he said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""Earlier this month, the administration announced plans to accelerate the process for Syrian refugees hoping to enter the United States with new screening outposts in Iraq and Lebanon. More on the Syrian refugee screening processThe events in Paris have highlighted a double-edged foreign policy problem for Clinton. As America's top diplomat from 2009 to 2013, she has international experience none of her rivals can match but can also be called to account for failings on her watch.Clinton's Democratic and Republican opponents said the administration had misjudged the Middle East and underestimated Islamic State, the militant group that claimed credit for bomb and gun attacks that killed at least 132 people in Paris on Friday.Republican presidential candidate Senator Lindsey Graham said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that if he were elected, the United States would be ""part of a world-wide force to destroy ISIL,"" another acronym for Islamic State.""Hillary Clinton,"" he added ""seems to be disconnected from what you need to do. She won’t embrace boots on the ground.""VETTING UNDER SCRUTINYFlorida Senator Marco Rubio, another Republican candidate, said on ABC's ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos"" that just one vetting oversight could jeopardize public safety. ""You can have a thousand people come in and 999 of them are just poor people fleeing oppression and violence, but one of them is an ISIS fighter. ... If that's the case, you have a problem,"" Rubio said.Fellow Republican contenders, Ohio Governor John Kasich and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, have been open to accepting more refugees, but they echoed Rubio's concerns about vetting. ""We can't be in a position of inviting the enemy in, and frankly we better be careful about looking at Americans that have traveled"" in the region, Kasich said on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.""Bush said on ""Meet the Press"" the United States had a special responsibility to help Syrian Christians, who he said had no place in their homeland.Ahead of the first Democratic nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 1, Clinton has opened a commanding lead over main party challenger Bernie Sanders, who argues the invasion of Iraq, which Clinton supported in a U.S. Senate vote in 2003, led to the rise of al Qaeda and Islamic State.For more on the 2016 U.S. presidential race and to learn about the undecided voters who determine elections, visit the Reuters website.

" (AP) â With the country still reeling from deadly terrorist attacks in Paris, Hillary Rodham Clinton cast herself as America's strongest leader in a scary world, even as she found herself forced to defend her own role during the rise of the Islamic State militants.""This election is not only about electing a president, it's also about choosing our next commander in chief,"" Clinton declared Saturday night in the Democrats' second debate of the presidential campaign. ""All of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.""Amid the backdrop of global anxiety, Clinton found herself fending off questions about not only her foreign policy record but her economic ties, with both Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley painting the former senator from New York as a lackey for Wall Street and corporate interests.""Let's not be naive about it,"" said Sanders, noting that Clinton collected millions in campaign donations from Wall Street bankers. ""They expect to get something. Everybody knows that.""Clinton defended her relationship with Wall Street, citing her work in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but her statement met with criticism from Republicans who accused her of politicizing the terrorist assaults.The barbs marked a far more aggressive shift in a primary race that has so far been notable for its civility. Democrats have spent months boasting about the substantive tone of their contest, attempting to set up a favorable early contrast with the ""carnival barker"" insults of the crowded Republican primary.Since the Democrats' first debate a month ago, Clinton has built a lead in the early voting states, gains that have come amid other signs the party is coalescing behind her. But the nomination fight is far from over.Saturday night, Clinton faced criticism of her national security record, when Sanders traced the current instability in the Middle East to the U.S. Senate's vote â including Clinton's â to authorize military action in Iraq in 2002. He said that U.S. invasion ""unraveled the region.""The former secretary of state fought back, saying terrorism has been erupting for decades, specifically mentioning the Sept. 11 attacks. She said the recent unrest in Libya and other parts of the Middle East is symptomatic of an ""arc of instability from North Africa to Afghanistan.""She rejected the idea that she and the rest of the Obama administration underestimated the growing threat of the Islamic State.The back-and-forth revealed a foreign policy split within the Democratic Party, with Sanders playing to the anti-war activists who boosted then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama to victory in 2008.Sanders argued for a far more hands-off approach, advocating for Muslim countries to lead the fight and declaring that the war against Islamic State militants is about the ""soul of Islam.""Clinton has a history of advocating for more robust involvement across the globe â both as a presidential candidate eight years ago and as Obama's secretary of state. In recent weeks, she has called for a more aggressive U.S. role in the Syrian conflict, including a no-fly zone over the area, a move the Obama administration opposes. But she stood by her opposition to seeking a formal declaration of war against the Islamic State.All the candidates denounced the attacks, and the debate began on a solemn note with a moment of silence followed by the previously unplanned foreign policy questions.They gave some fodder to their Republican critics, who coupled condemnation of the Paris attacks during the day with sharp criticism for Obama and his former secretary of state, Clinton.""We are at war with violent extremism, we are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression,"" said Clinton, arguing the U.S. is not at war with Islam or all Muslims. ""I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.""Sanders and O'Malley agreed with her sentiments, saying the term ""radical Islam"" used by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and other Republican presidential candidates, is unnecessarily offensive to American Muslims.Republicans immediately seized on the remarks. ""Yes, we are at war with radical Islamic terrorism,"" tweeted former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.The conversation later pivoted to economic issues, with the candidates tangling over how to pay for their plans to expand college affordability, family leave and prescription drug coverage.The conversation revealed how Sanders' message has helped shift the party to the left on some economic issues.All three agreed that wealthy citizens and corporations should pay more in taxes to benefit the middle class. They tangled over how high to increase the minimum wage, with Clinton backing a $12-per-hour federal floor while Sanders and O'Malley said $15 an hour â the rate being pushed by a campaign of fast-food workers and labor unions. And they fought over the degree to which they would curtail large financial institutions, with Sanders describing Wall Street's business model as ""greed and fraud"" â a startling judgment for a major presidential candidate.""I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,"" joked Sanders, saying the former president backed a 90 percent marginal tax rate.While Clinton is wary of alienating Sanders backers whose support she'll need should she win the nomination, she did take a few shots. She attempted to cast some of Sanders major proposals, including a single payer health care system and free college, as politically unrealistic.""The revolution never came,"" she said, in a knock on his call for a ""political revolution."" ''I waited and I got the scars to show for it.""Sanders may have inadvertently helped her in the first debate, when he seemed to dismiss the controversy over her use of a private email account and server by saying Americans are tired of hearing about her ""damn emails.""Saturday night, Sanders declined once again to attack:  ""I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email,"" he said.""I agree completely,"" said Clinton, with a laugh.___Lisa Lerer reported from Washington.

(REUTERS/Jim Young)PreviousNextHillary Clinton faced tough criticism Saturday night from her Democratic rivals over everything from her Middle East policies to her swaying stance on gun control to her Wall Street ties, at a debate that saw both Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley step up their attacks on the party’s front-runner.The former secretary of state was put on the defensive almost immediately, as she was challenged by her rivals -- and the moderator -- over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability. Vermont Sen. Sanders ripped her support for “regime change.”  But while the Paris terror attacks the night before shifted the early presidential debate focus to national security, the candidates sparred aggressively in the latter half over domestic issues – especially financial industry reform and Clinton’s Wall Street support.Former Maryland Gov. O’Malley called her the “candidate of Wall Street.”Asked about her hefty Wall Street-backed speaking fees and donations, Clinton defended her independence in being able to pursue financial industry reform.But Sanders shot back, “Not good enough.”“Let's not be naive about it. Why …has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?” he said. “You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.”He and O’Malley, unlike Clinton, both want to re-instate a Depression-era banking law known as Glass-Steagall – and they both criticized Clinton’s Wall Street plans as not going far enough. O’Malley called it “weak tea.”In an eyebrow-raising moment, Clinton countered Sanders’ criticism of her Wall Street donations by saying that as New York senator, she helped “rebuild” Wall Street and downtown Manhattan after 9/11.Clinton was later asked about social media reaction claiming she had invoked 9/11 to justify financial industry donations; Clinton said she’s sorry that anyone had that “impression.”Meanwhile, she said she doesn’t think her rivals’ financial industry plans – particularly to reinstate the Depression-era law that separated investment and commercial banking – would get the job done.“I'm all about making sure we actually get results,” Clinton said.The debate in Des Moines, Iowa, came in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which thrust the issues of national security and foreign policy back to the center of the 2016 campaign. The format of the debate – hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register -- was changed to focus anew on those issues in the beginning.Clinton tried to highlight her deep experience in foreign policy issues from the outset.“This election is not only about electing a president. It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief,” she said.But, citing the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa, Clinton’s rivals soon turned to her record as U.S. senator and later as secretary of state to question her judgment in foreign policy matters.O’Malley appeared to criticize her support for toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.He said America’s role is not to roam the world “looking for new dictators to topple.” He said it is also important to understand “secondary and third consequences” that come after removing a “single dictator.” O’Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a “mess.”Clinton defended her support for ousting Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a “genocide” and America’s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support. And to O’Malley’s critique, she said, “I don’t think you can paint with a broad brush” in an “incredibly complicated region of the world.”Sanders, meanwhile, referenced Clinton’s Senate vote for the use of force in Iraq and said the “disastrous invasion” led “to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.” The senator also claimed that “climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.”Clinton again called her Iraq war vote a “mistake,” but disputed that the war is the only driver of modern terrorism.She and O’Malley briefly sparred over America’s role in fighting ISIS. After Clinton said it “cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential,” O’Malley said, “This actually is America’s fight,” though not “solely” America’s fight.Sanders staked out a different position in saying it is the nations in the region that “have to get their hands dirty.”“Those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort,” he said.The candidates declined to categorize the threat itself as “radical Islam.” Asked about that categorization, Clinton said only, “I don’t think we’re at war with Islam.”All the candidates on stage condemned the Paris terror attacks and vowed to take on the threat of terror.“It cannot be contained. It must be defeated,” Clinton said of ISIS, appearing to distance herself from President Obama, who hours before the Paris attacks claimed ISIS was “contained.”The attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said. It brought the issue of terrorism to the forefront of both party’s presidential primary races. Ostensibly, it is an area where Clinton enters with the thickest resume – but also one that could, as the debate showed, prove problematic given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable nations like Libya and Syria.While the tragedy hung over the debate, the candidates were able to tackle of range of domestic issues including wages and immigration.O’Malley landed virtually the only shot of the night against Republican candidate Donald Trump, a favorite target of the Democrats, by calling him an “immigrant-bashing carnival barker.” The Democratic candidates generally agree on the call for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the country.Sanders, meanwhile, continued to advocate for a $15 minimum wage.But the candidates were divided on gun control. While Clinton has tried in the past to cast Sanders as soft on the issue, O’Malley accused Clinton of being “on three sides of this.”“When you ran in 2000, you said we needed federal robust regulations, then in 2008 you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying we don't need those regulations ... and now you’re coming back around here,” he said.The debate was notable in that it saw Sanders and O’Malley taking a more aggressive tone against the front-runner, who seemed to have strengthened her hand since their initial debate.Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O’Malley. She also made it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and saw one of her biggest potential political threats – a late bid by Vice President Biden – disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.Sanders remains Clinton’s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.Still, the FBI investigation over Clinton’s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding. Sanders appeared to give her a pass on the email issue at the first debate by saying he was tired of hearing about the controversy.Sanders, though, stood by his comments at the second debate Saturday night: “I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email, I’m still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email. … Let’s go to the major issues facing America.” ",,"Hillary Clinton faced tough criticism Saturday night from her Democratic rivals over everything from her Middle East policies to her swaying stance on gun control to her Wall Street ties, at a debate that saw both Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley step up their attacks on the party’s front-runner.  ","Clinton hit by Dem rivals over Wall St. ties, Mideast policies at 2nd debate",http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/V8TEBB0dgZ8/,"['foreign policy/national security', 'immigration']","[u""Martin O'Malley"", 'Jim Young', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Donald Trump', 'Muammar Qaddafi', 'Bernie Sanders']",fox,0.9974292038547423,[],2015-11-15 05:15:16,"['Senate', 'Al Qaeda', 'FBI']",79bd7c26a3cede5c90902c1c11117ed4,2015-11-15 06:14:21.385069

" (CNN)Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley met for the second Democratic presidential primary debate on Saturday night, an event that finally saw a fight between the front-runner and her chief opponent, but also coming a day after a deadly terror attack that shocked the world. Here are the six key takeaways from the debates:Clinton distanced herself from President Barack Obama's now-controversial comment in an interview Thursday that the U.S. had ""contained ISIS."" During Saturday's debate, Clinton asserted that ISIS ""cannot be contained"" and must simply be ""defeated."" As she has in the past, Clinton also suggested that she had argued ""early on that we needed to find a way to train and equip moderates."" Clinton reportedly argued for a more forceful administration plan to help the Syrian opposition early on in the civil war that has since exploded.RELATED: Hillary Clinton at Democratic debate: ISIS 'cannot be contained'The Vermont senator in the first debate appeared unprepared or unwilling to go after Clinton with any real vigor.But Saturday night, Sanders suggested Clinton is in the pocket of Wall Street and tied her vote to authorize the war in Iraq to the rise of ISIS. Clinton, meanwhile, knocked Sanders on his mixed record on guns and suggested his policy proposals are too simplistic.In the most forceful exchange of the night, Sanders pointed to the millions of dollars in donations Wall Street has funneled to Clinton's campaigns over her political career.""Why over her political career has Wall Street been a major, the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton? Maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so,"" Sanders said. ""I have never heard a candidate, never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street from the military industrial complex, not one candidate -- 'Oh these, these campaign contributions will not influence me.' But why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something, everybody knows that.""RELATED: Democratic debate: CNN's Reality Check team inspects the claimsClinton responded by accusing Sanders of impugning her ""integrity,"" before claiming that Wall Street has supported her because of the work she did to rebuild the Financial District after it was hit in the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center.  As she did in the first debate, Clinton hit Sanders on guns, calling the Vermont senator's vote to shield gun makers from some lawsuits a ""terrible mistake"" and urging Sanders to admit as much, as she has done regarding her Iraq vote.Sanders responded by suggesting there's little daylight between himself and Clinton and O'Malley on guns.Sanders didn't take the gloves off completely during Saturday night's debate in Iowa.Instead, he took a pass on one of the biggest points of contention of the 2016 cycle: Clinton's record as secretary of state.Given a chance to slam Clinton's tenure, Sanders demurred, instead pivoting to his ""disagreement"" with Clinton over her vote in favor of the Iraq War in 2002, more than six years before she became secretary of state.Republicans are already picking apart Clinton's track record as secretary of state, but Sanders' simply wouldn't take the bait.It was reminiscent of Sanders' ""damn emails"" moment in the first Democratic debate, when he said Americans are tired of hearing about the controversy over Clintons' use of personal email during her time as secretary of state.However, Clinton's response to Sanders -- when she beat back the suggestion that she is influenced by Wall Street donors -- could really come back to bite her.Clinton explained her connection to Wall Street by tying her relationship to her role in helping to rebuild New York's financial district after the 9/11 attacks.Twitter was ablaze Saturday night over the response, and the Republican National Committee was quick to blast out a best-of compilation of political observers' reactions.It's not the only moment that could come back to haunt Clinton -- especially if she faces a younger GOP nominee, like Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida.Clinton at one point said she is ""from the '60s"" -- a moment in the debate that could be replayed in political ads down the line suggesting she is part of the past, not the future, of American leadership.The debate Saturday night began with the candidates pausing on stage, taking a moment of silence to remember the victims of the terrorist attacks that ripped Paris apart just a day earlier.  Clinton said while ""our prayers are with the people of France tonight...that is not enough"" and called for better coordinated efforts to root out ISIS, the radical group that claimed responsibility. She said Americans should see the terrorist attack as a reminder that the election ""is not only about electing a president, it's also about choosing our next commander in chief.""Sanders made brief note of the terrorist attacks at the top of his opening statement, but quickly pivoted to the core message of the campaign: ""a rigged economy"" that benefits billionaires.Still, Sanders made a bold claim in his reference to Paris: ""Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarist (sic) organization called ISIS.""And O'Malley, after saying his heart goes out ""to the people of France in this moment of loss,"" quickly called for ""fresh thinking"" and ""new approaches"" -- a definitive nod to his youth and the generational contrast the  52-year-old offers to Clinton's 68 years and Sanders' 74.All three candidates refused to say the fight was with radical Islam, instead focusing on using the word ""jihadist"" to describe the threats spotlighted in the Paris attacks. RELATED: Clinton calls out 'radical jihadist ideology'O'Malley delivered several strong one-liners throughout the night, notably when he slammed Republican front-runner Donald Trump as a ""carnival barker"" for his immigration policies.But O'Malley also missed a couple of key moments where he could have shined. His central contention is that it's time for a new generation of leadership -- meaning no more baby boomers like Clinton. But he lacked a strong, convincing response to one of the debate's final questions: When have you been most tested in your life, and how did it prepare you for the presidency? O'Malley's response conceded that he is untested -- that nothing he's been through as mayor of Baltimore or governor of Maryland comes close to the crises he would face as President.Trump later responded to O'Malley's insult on Twitter by calling him a ""clown.""

"DES MOINES —  The news team at station KCCI buzzed with nervous anticipation here at Drake University on Saturday night, less than two hours before the start of the Democratic candidates’ debate.It was the first presidential debate that KCCI, the local CBS affiliate, would help present in its 60-year history, and the atmosphere had shifted dramatically in the previous 24 hours — from one charged with excitement to a grave and somber tone following the deadly terror attacks in Paris.Behind a temporary stage erected for the event, KCCI’s news director, Dave Busiek, watched a live stream of CBS News coverage on his iPhone about the latest developments out of Paris. In a nearby workspace, the veteran anchor Kevin Cooney made final preparations for the questions he would pose later about national security as one of debate’s four moderators.Just after 6:15 p.m., cameras flashed on the KCCI anchors Stacey Horst and Steve Karlin, who stood on the stage and welcomed viewers to an area for the news media known as the spin room; they noted how the carnage in Paris would change the focus of the debate.“Our viewers are interested in that,” Mr. Busiek said. “That flows into what will be a very serious discussion with who could be the president of the United States.”Broadcasting from Iowa’s capital city to 434,500 TV households in the country’s 72nd largest television market, KCCI takes on outsize importance among the nation’s local television stations every four years. Iowans are the first in the nation to vote in presidential caucuses, setting the tone for the rest of the campaign season.As a result, presidential candidates devote significant face time to KCCI, the perennial market leader and one of 30 stations owned by Hearst, and its rival WHO-HD, the local NBC affiliate. And the stations respond in kind, adding more political coverage to the menu of news offerings.KCCI started its own Sunday morning half-hour interview program this fall called “Close Up,” which has featured interviews with presidential candidates from both parties. And WHO boasts that it televises 25 percent more news each week than other stations in the market, thanks in large part to a 4 p.m. newscast that presents a more in-depth look at news and politics. WHO also is hosting three special one-hour forums this week featuring the Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Bobby Jindal. The stations also count on campaigns and interest groups to open their checkbooks in the months leading up to the caucuses and the general election. KCCI and its market rivals are likely to reap a disproportionate share of the $3.3 billion in political advertising dollars that analysts project will go to local television stations for 2016 races, particularly for pre-caucus spending.“Technically, the presidential election is a national election,” said Elizabeth Wilner, a senior vice president at Kantar Media/CMAG, a company that monitors political advertising. “But in reality it is a race that occurs in about 10 states. In 2012, seven states saw 84 percent of all local TV ad spend, and we expect that same dynamic again.”That swing in political ad spending is of huge importance to the big media conglomerates that own local television stations, particularly as other categories of advertisers shift a larger share of spending to digital outlets. “In political, TV is still king,” said Kip Cassino, executive vice president for research at Borrell Associates.Over the last several years, a wave of consolidation has swept across the industry with station owners trying to put themselves in the path of more of political advertising dollars. In 2013, for instance, Tribune Company closed a $2.7 billion acquisition of Local TV Holdings that made it one of the country’s largest station owners; it added stations in 16 markets in the transaction, including WHO in Des Moines.Tribune is now expecting to gross about $200 million in political advertising sales in 2016, up 25 percent from adjusted revenues in 2012. “At this point, we’re calling for it to be strong, all signs are pointing to that,” Peter Liguori, chief executive of Tribune Media, said during a recent conference call, noting the company’s strength in swing states. In Des Moines, station executives said that the sales strategy boiled down to waiting for the phones to ring and the orders to come in. “We don’t have to actively go out,” said Dale R. Woods, general manager of WHO. “They are the ones who want to obtain our real estate.”And while ad orders have started trickling in, executives said that the deluge largely has yet to arrive, partly because of the large number of Republican candidates this year, which has prompted campaigns to hold back on paying for advertising as they wait for the field to narrow. The surprising success of Donald J. Trump, who for the most part does not use advertising, has also affected how the candidates spend.“We’re in a decent position,” said Brian Sather, president and general manager of KCCI. “We’re open for business.”The stations also benefit from the rise of outside political action groups. While the stations are required by law to provide equal access to candidates and to charge them the lowest unit rates, there are no laws limiting what they can charge outside groups for commercial time. Analysts project a sharp increase in spending by these groups for 2016.“There is nothing stopping stations from charging groups five to six times as much — or even 10 times as much” as they charge candidates, Ms. Wilner of Kantar said. “Nobody weeps for the poor billionaire that has to pay 10 times as much as the candidate.”But the influx of campaign dollars creates a delicate situation for the stations, which have to juggle their limited supply of commercial time. High demand for political ads in the Des Moines market, particularly in the weeks leading up to the caucus, can put a squeeze on inventory and push out local businesses, such as car dealerships, that are the bread-and-butter advertisers year round.“It is a balancing act,” Mr. Sather said. “We try to do our best.”Mike Schreurs, chief executive of Strategic America, an advertising agency in West Des Moines, said that it is common for businesses to see as many as one out of four commercial spots bumped from local TV during the peak political season. They also might have to pay at least a 30 percent increase in the rates. “It takes the inventory away from smaller retailers and advertisers, not including the fact that it creates something of a toxic environment,” he said.Already, more than 35,000 commercials adding up to more than $22.5 million in spending have aired or are scheduled to air on Iowa television stations through Feb. 2, the day after the Iowa caucuses, according to an analysis of Federal Communications Commission records by The Des Moines Register. On KCCI alone, viewers will see more than 62 ads a day in the eight days leading up to the Iowa caucuses. And at WHO, Hillary Rodham Clinton’s campaign has booked a single spot for $5,800 to air during prime time Monday night. A spot airing during another time the same week cost $60.Back in the spin room after the debate on Saturday night, KCCI anchors wrapped up more than four hours of related coverage. During the coming 78 days leading to the Iowa caucus, the journalists plan to return to the air to cover the twists and turns of the campaign. But, for the moment, Mr. Karlin, one of the anchors, reflected on the Des Moines station’s moment in the national spotlight.“It’s really a privilege for a television station like us to be part of a debate like this,” he said.",EMILY STEEL,"Over the last several years, a wave of consolidation has swept across the industry with station owners trying to put themselves in the path of more of political advertising dollars.","Iowa TV Gets Its Close-Up, Enjoying Outsize Influence",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/business/media/iowa-tv-gets-its-close-up-enjoying-outsize-influence.html,['campaign_finance'],"['Elizabeth Wilner', 'Donald Trump', 'Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Donald J.

"AMES, Iowa – The day after a debate in which Democratic presidential candidates tangled over the causes of Islamic State terrorism but not how to confront it, Hillary Rodham Clinton offered a more forward-looking view of American leadership in response to the threat.“We have to be rallying our partners and allies, pulling countries off the sidelines,” Mrs. Clinton said on Sunday. She called the Islamic State “the first Internet-fueled terrorist group,” which will require strong countermeasures to its propaganda and recruitment.Speaking at an indoor barbecue lunch hosted by several Iowa counties’ Democratic parties, Mrs. Clinton offered no specifics. But she suggested a more proactive approach than she had in the debate, when she dodged a question about whether the Obama administration had underestimated the Islamic State and seemed to take a fatalistic view of terrorism connected to chaos in the Middle East.  “Attacking Paris, the city of light, reminds us that there is no middle ground in going after these terrorists,’’ Mrs. Clinton said. She was notably alone in bringing up the Paris attacks. Former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland, who also spoke at the event, focused almost entirely on domestic issues. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was represented by a surrogate, the former Princeton professor Cornel West.     Mrs. Clinton implicitly pressed her claim as the most qualified Democratic candidate for commander in chief, highlighting terrorism at a moment that the campaigns of both parties seem likely to pivot to national security and American leadership in the world. Although many pundits scored Saturday’s debate a draw, with Mr. O’Malley having his best night yet and Mr. Sanders more focused in his responses, a focus group of undecided Democrats in Des Moines, where the debate took place, gave Mrs. Clinton a clear win.  All 33 likely caucus-goers in the group thought Mrs. Clinton would be the stronger commander in chief, said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic consultant who conducted the focus group.  “It was clear that Clinton’s answers on terrorism, and her improved answers on domestic issues, moved undecided Iowans in striking ways,’’ he said.       Mr. Kofinis identified one vulnerability: Mrs. Clinton’s ties to Wall Street, exemplified by an answer to a question about accepting donations from rich bankers that has been widely mocked. Mr. O’Malley echoed the critique on Sunday, dismissing her explanation that she has been flooded with Wall Street donations in gratitude for her help in rebuilding the New York financial district after the terrorist attacks of 2001. Mrs. Clinton “sadly invoked 9/11 to try to mask’’ her ties to Wall Street bankers, Mr. O’Malley said on Sunday.    The crowd of several hundred largely older Democrats did not respond strongly to Mr. O’Malley’s critiques of Mrs. Clinton, which  included sharper barbs than usual  about her record on guns and immigration.The crowd, which swarmed Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton after she spoke, seemed pragmatic with less than three months before the Iowa caucuses and as Mr. Sanders’s summer surge in the state appears to be ebbing.  “Personally, I like what Sanders and O’Malley have to say,’’ Glenda Eggerling, a retiree, said.  “But I think Hillary will appeal to more voters, and I would really like to see a Democrat in the White House, because I don’t like Republicans’ platforms.’’Sandra McJimsey, also a retiree, said, “I think Bernie has done a great service to the party,” but she declared herself “energized to vote for Hillary.’’Despite their embrace of Mrs. Clinton’s foreign policy experience, Iowa Democrats had no interest in committing ground troops to fight the Islamic State, as several Republican candidates have advocated, or in declaring war, as Jeb Bush suggested on Sunday.Chas Weber, a retiree who recently moved to Ames from Michigan, said the Paris attacks and confronting the Islamic State were “this week’s hot topic,’’ which he predicted would soon give way to something else.An independent who is candidate shopping, Mr. Weber plans to attend a rally for Donald J. Trump later in the week.  But he said he was no fan of Mr. Trump’s call to aggressively bomb the Islamic State and commit ground troops.  “He’s an extremist with no experience,’’ he said.

"Initially solemn, typically wonkish and monotonously polite to the moderators and one another, the three Democratic presidential candidates still managed to provide a few surprising moments during their second debate Saturday night.Hillary Rodham Clinton complimented George W. Bush and accused Bernie Sanders of impugning her integrity.Martin O’Malley called Clinton “Annie Oakley” on gun control and “weak tea” on big banks.Sanders founded yet another T-shirt line by announcing that “Wall Street’s business model is fraud,” CBS used Twitter in a way that did not look like old-media floundering, and Dwight D. Eisenhower continued his 2016 Greatest Hits Tour.A week after Donald Trump praised Ike for deporting more than a million Mexicans, Sanders offered him as a model of high tax rates for the rich: “I’m not much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,” he said.Most important, however, was the moment that did not occur: Though they were resolute in their condemnation of ISIS, none of the candidates went inflammatory or ballistic.Taking place just a day more than 120 people were killed in a series of terrorist attacks in Paris , the debate, which was held in Des Moines and aired on CBS, opened without the now-usual campaign-trail/reality-show pomp and pageantry. Instead, moderator John Dickerson, host of “Face the Nation,” solemnly reminded viewers that open debate is “a symbol of freedom.”Then, after a moment of silence, he began asking newly added questions about the U.S. response to ISIS and unrest in the Middle East.But those hoping for burning rhetoric, sweeping resolutions or even clear plans were probably disappointed.While many of the Republican presidential candidates have made strong statements in the wake of Friday’s horrific attacks — Donald Trump suggested that an armed French citizenry would have prevented the tragedy, Sen. Ted Cruz called for significant air power and many if not all want to close the U.S. to Syrian refugees — the Democratic nominees chose to tread more carefully.So carefully that it was difficult to know what any of them do in similar circumstance should she or he become president. Indeed, during the opening minutes of their second debate, Sanders, Clinton and O’Malley were more explicit in their arguments about what the terrorists should be called — extreme jihadists rather than Islamic extremists — than they were about their visions of an American response.To be fair, Dickerson, for reasons of his own, never asked the obvious question — “What do you think the U.S. should do next?” Instead, he called on each of them to critique President Obama’s, and Clinton’s, handling of terrorism in general and ISIS particular. This put Clinton immediately on the defensive and Sanders and O’Malley in the unenviable position of criticizing their party’s president one day after a horrifying international crisis.O'Malley called for more ""human intelligence"" and Sanders blamed the rise of terrorism on the Iraq war, which, he pointed out, Clinton had voted for. Clinton quickly reminded everyone that many acts of terrorism, including 9/11, had preceded the war, which she once again admitted was a mistake, and unity returned to the conversation.Early minutes were spent agreeing that the Middle East is complicated, the world is dangerous and the enemy is not Islam, a distinction Clinton thanked George W. Bush for making in the days following 9/11.Indeed, until the first commercial break and beyond, the three candidates spent so much time openly agreeing with one another, with minor caveats, that they seemed to have forgotten they were political rivals.That changed when the questions returned to the economy and everyone seemed to feel on firmer ground.As the front-runner, Clinton got the toughest questions and the brunt of the criticism, onstage and off. At one point, Sanders criticized Clinton’s reliance on “Wall Street donors” and all that implies. Clinton defended her impugned integrity in a strange and scattershot way by announcing that 60% of her donors were women and that she had stood by Wall Street, and the rest of New York, during and after 9/11.If Dickerson, who was otherwise strong on calling out contradictions and non-answers, let her get away with evoking 9/11 in a discussion of campaign donations, Twitter didn’t. A few minutes later, co-moderator CBS News congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes asked her to respond to one negative response, marking the first use of Twitter as a real-time participant of a debate.But even with a few mild barbs — O’Malley derided Clinton as having been “Annie Oakley” before changing her stance on gun control, or Sanders dismissed one of O’Malley’s references to his work as governor of Maryland by saying “Baltimore is not now one of the safest cities in America"" — the tenor of the remarks leaned more toward conversation than debate.So much so that Clinton felt comfortable enough to laud the similarities she shares with her rivals. “We have our differences,” she said. “But they pale compared with what’s happening on the Republican side.”“All of us support funding Planned Parenthood,” she continued. “All of us believe climate change is real. All of us want equal pay for equal work. They don't believe in any of that. So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.""Not surprisingly, neither Sanders nor O’Malley disagreed.",,"<p>Initially solemn, typically wonkish and monotonously polite to the moderators and one another, the three Democratic presidential candidates still managed to provide a few surprising moments during their second debate Saturday night.</p> <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton complimented George W.

"Are we heading back to the 1960s, when cities and campuses spiraled into chaos and conservatives won elections by demanding law and order? In a period that has seen riots over police conduct in Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore, attacks on police officers in New York and other cities, and now student protests, it sometimes feels that way.Last week, several Republican candidates sounded as if they were reviving the tough justice theme that helped Ronald Reagan and Richard M. Nixon rise to power almost half a century ago. Donald Trump derided university presidents who bow to student demands as “weak, ineffective people,” and said he wouldn't have quit if he had been in charge at the University of Missouri. Ben Carson warned that if society coddles students, “We will move much further toward anarchy than anybody can imagine.” And Chris Christie said it was all President Obama's fault: “This is a product of the president's own unwillingness and inability to bring people together.”In another flashback to the 1960s, Democrats lined up on the other side, signaling that their sympathies lay with the students. “It's time to address structural racism on college campuses,” Bernie Sanders tweeted. Hillary Rodham Clinton sent a similar message through an aide. And White House spokesman Josh Earnest lauded the Missouri students for their “commitment to fighting hate and intolerance.” Their success, he said, reinforced Obama's view “that a few people speaking up and speaking out can have a profound impact.”There was an unmistakable echo in that micro-debate of the argument after the 2014 unrest in Ferguson, where the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager prompted weeks of angry demonstrations; and the later debate over Black Lives Matter, the movement to curb law enforcement excesses. In all three cases, there has been an impulse toward polarization, reducing the question to: Which side are you on?A few Republicans, notably Christie and Ted Cruz, have charged that BLM is calling for the murder of police officers. (A few demonstrators have done so, but they've been disavowed by the movement's leaders.)“The president encourages this lawlessness,” Christie added last month. (The president has condemned that lawlessness several times, actually, even as he has also condemned excessive police violence.)On the other side, Sanders found himself shouted down by demonstrators when he wasn't emphatic enough in endorsing BLM. (He has made amends since.)The implicit message: You can declare that black lives matter, or that police lives matter — but you don't have the option of believing both those things.Except — and here's where things get interesting — most candidates do believe both those things. If you listen closely and dig beneath the sound bites, yo'll find that things have changed since the 20th century, after all.A recent poll of college students’ attitudes toward free speech (in general and on campus) is a mixed bag.The survey by McLaughlin & Associates for the William F. Buckley Jr. Program at Yale shows that 87% of respondents agreed with this statement: “There is educational value in listening to and...A recent poll of college students’ attitudes toward free speech (in general and on campus) is a mixed bag.The survey by McLaughlin & Associates for the William F. Buckley Jr. Program at Yale shows that 87% of respondents agreed with this statement: “There is educational value in listening to and...Among Republicans, I highlighted the more ferocious voices, but others have been more restrained. Even the ones I quoted, Trump, Carson and Christie, aren't campaigning principally on law and order. They've mostly answered questions thrown at them by reporters, whose job includes goading candidates into making headlines.Most of the Republican candidates have noticed that crime is down, prisons are overcrowded and the cost of incarcerating nonviolent criminals — mostly drug offenders — has become an undue burden. Several have endorsed various brands of criminal justice reform: Rand Paul, most notably, but also Cruz and Christie and Jeb Bush. And one or two have even spoken up to say, in effect, that BLM has a point — although they don't endorse the group's tactics.“This is a legitimate issue,” Marco Rubio said in August. “It is a fact that in the African American community around this country there has been, for a number of years now, a growing resentment toward the way law enforcement and the criminal justice system interacts with the community. It is particularly endemic among young African American males … [who] have a much higher chance of interacting with criminal justice than higher education. We do need to face this. It is a serious problem.”Rubio won't appreciate the comparison, but that wasn't too far from what Clinton said in April.“There is something profoundly wrong when African American men are still far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and sentenced to longer prison terms than are meted out to their white counterparts,” she said in April. It is also wrong, she added, when “brave police officers are attacked in the line of duty.”Despite those knee-jerk reactions to campus upheavals, most Republicans seem to have left the lock 'em up era behind. And so have Democrats; Clinton's position is a shift from the tough-on-crime stance that helped one Bill Clinton get elected in 1992. (Bill Clinton, for his part, was trying to distance himself from the allegedly soft-on-crime Democrats of the 1960s.)It's rare in an election year that candidates are resisting the temptation to polarize — but let's give credit where credit is due. Maybe, in this instance, Carson got it right. “We have people who get in their respective corners and demonize each other, but there's no conversation,” he said recently. “If you ask people to put on the record what their gripes are and what their solutions are, then perhaps they can see that maybe they are not so far apart.”doyle.mcmanus@latimes.comTwitter: @doylemcmanusFollow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook",,"<p>Are we heading back to the 1960s, when cities and campuses spiraled into chaos and conservatives won elections by demanding law and order?

"WASHINGTON — The tragedy in Paris is roiling American politics, bolstering the Republican right’s anti-immigration demands in the short run and perhaps ultimately enhancing Hillary Rodham Clinton and her credentials as the candidate with experience.Politicians from President Obama on down have expressed outrage at the attacks, for which the Islamic State claimed responsibility.Several leading Republicans immediately politicized the issue. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas blamed Mr. Obama and what he called a weak “photo-op” foreign policy, and one of the party’s presidential front-runners, Donald J. Trump, said the tragedy reinforced the need for “tougher” American leadership.“This will be exceptionally important” in shaping the presidential race, said Peter D. Hart, a prominent Democratic poll-taker, suggesting it was likely to help Mrs. Clinton, the only top-tier candidate in either party who has a background in national security.In a debate among Democratic candidates on Saturday, she opened by stating that the United States would be electing a new commander in chief.The attacks seem certain to heighten the importance of foreign policy in an election where it has not been prominent. In a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, only 8 percent of the public cited terrorism as the most important issue.The attacks were immediately seized upon as a reason for cracking down on immigration. “This will help the anti-immigration cause and hurt efforts to bring in Syrian refugees,” predicted Vin Weber, a leading Republican strategist and immigration advocate.Among Republicans, the speculation was about the consequences of the Paris attacks for Mr. Trump. In Iowa on Thursday, he let loose a particularly vicious tirade against some of his rivals.There was a growing sense within the Republican establishment that the “Trump rant” might be the incident that really derails his candidacy, even though he has not been affected by supposedly lethal political acts in the past. The terrorist episode could reverse any political slippage. Mr. Trump has largely set the agenda and dominated the dialogue on immigration; other candidates have followed.Both prominent Republicans and Democrats suggested that a renewed attention to terrorism could harden his core support, though an overall emphasis on foreign policy would not play to Mr. Trump’s strengths.Among the other leading contenders, the boyish-looking Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, 44, has most emphasized a hard line on national security.Yet, Mr. Hart predicts voters “won’t want the kid” in the White House. Mr. Cruz, though the same age, was seen as projecting more forcefulness than his rivals in his response to the attacks, though he may have overreached.Mr. Weber, one of the Republican wise men, said that with time, voters may look “for someone with more gravitas.” He said he hoped this would play to the strength of his candidate, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida.Mr. Bush, considered one of the more mature candidates in either party, has only derivative national security credentials because of his family, particularly his brother, former President George W. Bush. That may prove a mixed blessing for a candidate struggling to regain his footing.The reason Mr. Hart sees an advantage for Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, is that a greater focus on terrorism will cause voters to look even more for a “heavy and strong hand at the tiller.” This might minimize the problems she has among staunchly noninterventionist Democratic primary voters because she is more hawkish on foreign policy than the president she served. And it could help her in a general election, though Republicans constantly criticize the “Obama/Clinton” weakness on foreign policy.In the Democratic debate, Mrs. Clinton took the hardest line on national security: She insisted that the Islamic State “must be defeated,” not just contained, and stressed that she had advised Mr. Obama to approve the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.However this evolves, both Republicans and Democrats agree that Nov. 13 is likely to be an important marker in the selection of the 45th American president.",ALBERT R.

"War Room                         The Paris attacks have reawakened martial feelings absent since 9/11.            By Michael HirshNovember 14, 2015                GettyRemember the mood in America just after 9/11? The surge of super-patriotism (dare we say jingoism)? The pall of political correctness (you’re fired, Bill Maher). The phrases that so resonated: “Let’s roll.” “You’re either with us or against us.” “Bring ‘em on.” Something like that is taking hold in France right now after Friday night’s horror, one of the worst terrorist attacks on Western soil since that terrible day 14 years ago. You could see it in the grim visage of Francois Hollande, socialist-turned-avenger, when the French president declared, “This is an act of war,” pledged a “ruthless” response, and called in effect for a global counterattack against the Islamic State. The frighteningly coordinated attacks that left more than 120 people dead in the heart of one of the world’s most cosmopolitan and beloved cities were, Hollande said, “an act committed by a terrorist army, Daesh, against France, our values, who we are, a free country that speaks to the entire planet.”Story Continued BelowHollande is likely to get a great deal of such support. Because in one night of slaughter, the attacks in Paris have caused the tectonic plates of geopolitics to shift sharply rightward, and no one will be unaffected. The new axis of opinion in the U.S. and Western European countries is plainly going to be harsher, more interventionist and less tolerant of, well, tolerance. Americans were already beginning to lose their post-Iraq war squeamishness about intervening overseas: a November Quinnipiac University poll found that American voters, by a 54-38 percent margin, backed sending U.S. troops to fight the Islamic State in Iraq. It’s safe to assume we’re about to grow more even more interventionist in mood, and Obama, as is his wont, may well follow the public temper, stepping up the minimalist approach he’s taken to countering Islamic State in Iraq and Syria so far.Already in Washington a somewhat more subdued version of this martial mood —subdued only because it didn’t happen here this time—is hardening up the 2016 presidential race. Republicans suddenly possess a new attack line against Obama over his withdrawal from Iraq and reluctance to intervene more dramatically in Syria. Obama’s former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton--who is suddenly on the defensive about something other than Benghazi (though we’ll be hearing more about that too)—will feel compelled to remind everyone at Saturday night’s Democratic debate that she was more hawkish than the president on that particular point.The GOP presidential candidates, of course, immediately seized on Obama’s unfortunately timed declaration in an interview Thursday that “we have contained” the Islamic State. Donald Trump, never one for political niceties, tweeted: ""President Obama said 'ISIL continues to shrink' in an interview just hours before the horrible attack in Paris. He is just so bad! CHANGE.""Ted Cruz, meanwhile, made fun of Obama’s reluctance to blame Islam for repeated acts of terrorism, saying, ""We must immediately recognize that our enemy is not ‘violent extremism.’ It is the radical Islamism that has declared jihad against the West."" He also embraced his own brand of ruthlessness, suggesting it was time to stop worrying about bombing civilians, whom Islamic State radicals have been hiding behind in cities such as Mosul. The Islamic State, he said, “will not be deterred by targeted airstrikes with zero tolerance for civilian casualties, when the terrorists have such utter disregard for innocent life.” Marco Rubio, already building a reputation for himself as the GOP field’s chief hawk, called for “improv[ing] our defenses, destroy[ing] terrorist networks, and depriv[ing] them of the space from which to operate.”This new right-wing normal will also no doubt seal the fate of less hawkish candidates—in particular the already-fading Rand Paul, whom Rubio denounced at the last debate as a “committed isolationist” and who can no doubt hear the tolling of political oblivion even now.***The tenor of diplomacy will change as well, starting today in Vienna, where talks were already underway on whether the U.S., Europeans and Russians could find common ground against Islamic State at a time when they were still sharply divided over Moscow’s contention that Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad should be shored up; that common ground is far more visible than it was a day ago. Against the brazen brutality of the Islamic State, even the barrel-bombing Assad will become slightly more tolerable, at least on an interim basis (delighting Vladimir Putin). Old differences seemed forgotten as Secretary of State John Kerry appeared at a news conference on Saturday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and declared: “We are in absolute and total agreement that these kinds of attacks are the most vile, horrendous, outrageous, unacceptable acts on the planet.”Civil liberties, which made a comeback with the Snowden revelations of 2012, will also now fade once again as an international issue. France and Belgium were already discussing increasing their internet surveillance, long a fraught topic under European law; now they’ll talk a lot louder about it.Michael Hirsh is national editor for Politico Magazine.WHAT WORKSPolitics                    By                             Jason ZengerleThe Big Idea                    By                             POLITICO Magazine © 2015 POLITICO LLC",,The Paris attacks have reawakened martial feelings absent since 9/11.,"On Terror, We&#8217;re All Right-wingers Now",http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/11/on-terror-were-all-right-wingers-now-213358,['foreign policy/national security'],"['Rand Paul', 'John Kerry', 'Michael Hirsh', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Francois Hollande', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Donald Trump', 'Marco Rubio', 'Bill Maher', 'Jason Zengerle', 'Edward Snowden', 'Sergei Lavrov', 'Ted Cruz']",politico,0.9200056773482217,"[{'author_id': 32346, 'fullname': 'michael hirsh', 'primary_org': 'politico'}]",2015-11-14 21:02:49,"['GOP', 'Quinnipiac University']",ce82185674b7e06375be40131f60912f,2015-11-15 02:42:55.006483
"Seeking to shake up the Democratic race and loosen Hillary Rodham Clinton's front-runner status, rivals Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley repeatedly challenged the former secretary of State on Saturday night in a debate where they largely agreed on most issues.The session at Drake University was originally supposed to focus on the economy, but the terrorist attacks in Paris changed that. The deadly assault, which Islamic State extremists took responsibility for, set a somber tone; the debate opened with a moment of silence, the candidates standing on stage with their heads bowed, to mark the tragedy.The contest is about “choosing our next commander in chief,” Clinton pointedly stated in her opening remarks. “All of the other issues we want to deal with depend on our being secure and strong.”The candidates echoed one another in calling for a war against Islamic extremists, agreeing there was a need for better intelligence, a better use of the country's vast military resources and the need for a closer partnership with U.S. allies, especially in the Middle East.Sanders, the independent U.S. senator from Vermont, used the discussion to once more bring up Clinton's 2002 vote in favor of the Iraq war when she was a senator, which she has since called a mistake. Noting his opposition at the time when he was a member of the House, Sanders said the invasion “led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now. I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the modern history of the United States.”Hillary Rodham Clinton waves as Bernie Sanders, left, and Martin O'Malley prepare before a Democratic presidential primary debate, Saturday, Nov. 14, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa.Hillary Rodham Clinton waves as Bernie Sanders, left, and Martin O'Malley prepare before a Democratic presidential primary debate, Saturday, Nov. 14, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa.Clinton said the issue of terrorism was far more complicated, pointing out that the United States had been a target long before the invasion, including the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. “We've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing, and no place more so than in the Middle East,” she said.In light of the horror in Paris, Sanders was asked whether he still believed, as he had earlier stated, that global warming was the greatest threat to national security.“Absolutely,” Sanders replied, suggesting that “climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism” — with the fight over natural resources like water possibly leading to even greater international conflict.Asked by moderator John Dickerson of CBS News whether they would use the words “radical Islam” to describe the United States' enemy — as many Republicans do — all three Democrats balked.“Let's not fall into the trap of thinking all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here,” said former Maryland Gov. O'Malley, suggesting the vast majority of law-abiding Muslims are the “first line of defense” against radical elements.Strikingly, some of the testiest exchanges of the evening came on issues where the differences among the candidates were largely a matter of degree.Sanders and O'Malley insisted, for instance, on setting a $15 national minimum wage rather than the $12 that Clinton favors, and suggested her history of taking generous contributions from Wall Street undercut her promises to impose stiffer regulations. “Weak tea,” O'Malley said dismissively.Clinton repeatedly brushed aside the challenges, saying she shared the same broad goals but would pursue policies that were more pragmatic and more apt to achieve results.“I have nothing against the passion my two friends have here for reinstating Glass-Steagall,” she said, when the debate turned to a discussion of the Depression-era bank regulation. “I just don't think it gets the job done.”Clinton entered the evening in the strongest political position since announcing her candidacy in April, benefiting from an impressive performance at the Democrats' first debate last month and her marathon testimony before lawmakers investigating the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.Nothing she said or did seemed likely to diminish her commanding status.By contrast, Sanders has lost steam after drawing gargantuan crowds over the summer. He has stalled far behind Clinton in national polls, and has also lost ground in some early-voting states, including Iowa, which casts the first votes of the 2016 contest.Stepping onto the debate stage, the Vermonter found himself in something of a quandary of his own design. He has long disparaged negative campaigning, boasting he has never run an attack ad in his decades-long political career.He also seemed to conspicuously foreclose one line of attack on Clinton, her controversial use of a private server while secretary of State, declaring in last month's debate that the “American people were sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.” Aides have been pressing Sanders to assume a more combative stance, but asked Saturday night whether he was reconsidering his comment, Sanders emphatically said he was not. “I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email,” he said. “I am still sick and tired.”“What I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, or we have more people in jail than any other country, or we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality,” Sanders said. “We've gotten off of Hillary Clinton's emails, good. Let's go to major issues facing America.”“I agree completely,” Clinton said. “I couldn't have said it better myself.”But she bridled when Sanders attacked her over her fundraising on Wall Street, suggesting that bankers would not contribute so much money if they did not think they would get something in response. “Maybe they're dumb,” he said. “I don't think so.”Clinton responded that Sanders was trying to “impugn [her] integrity” and noted that two hedge-fund billionaires were already running advertisements against her in Iowa.The exchange led to a seeming Clinton stumble, when she referred to her work helping Wall Street recover from the Sept. 11 attacks. “I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York; that was good for the economy,” Clinton said.The negative reaction on social media was swift, including a Tweet from one critic who was incredulous that Clinton invoked the terrorist attacks in defending her relationship with Wall Street. When the comment was read to her onstage, Clinton said she was sorry if her remark — quickly seized upon by Republican opponents — was misconstrued.In another response that may echo later in the campaign, Clinton inadvertently raised the generational issue during a discussion of the protests sweeping college campuses. Republicans have repeatedly portrayed her as a has-been compared with some of their more youthful candidates.“I come from the '60s, a long time ago,” she said. “There was a lot of activism on campus. Civil rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism. And I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out. Obviously, I believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other.”O'Malley has struggled to be anything more than an afterthought in the Clinton-Sanders contest and he repeatedly took after both rivals.He cited his record as Maryland's chief executive, saying, for instance, that while all three support a higher minimum wage, in his state “it was not just a theory … we did it.”The stage was less crowded than at the Democrats' first debate last month in Las Vegas. Former Sens. Jim Webb of Virginia and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island both quit the contest after their poor showings.That opened up the two-hour program for a longer, deeper series of exchanges. But that didn't mean they broke a lot of new substantive ground. Much of the conversation touched on issues they had covered before.Clinton again attacked Sanders on guns, one of the few areas where she is to the left of the Vermont senator.“There are different records,” Clinton said. “I know that Sen. Sanders had a different vote than I did when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers. That was a terrible mistake. It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate legislators, not just in Washington but across the country.”Sanders cited his votes for certain gun controls and said he would reconsider the liability issue.O'Malley said Clinton had her own consistency problems, arguing she had repeatedly changed her position for political reasons. “There's a big difference between leading by polls and leading by principle,” he said.To the delight of the partisan crowd, all three candidates positioned themselves as aggressively pro-immigrant.“The fact of the matter is — and let's say it in our debate because you will never hear it from that immigrant-bashing carnival barker Donald Trump — the truth of the matter is net immigration from Mexico last year was zero,” O'Malley said in response to weighing immigration reform against the need for border security.“We've been focusing on border security to exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform,” he said. “Our symbol is the Statue of Liberty; it is not a barbed wire fence.”Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, drew one of the biggest laughs of the night from the university audience, during a discussion of taxes. All three candidates said they favored higher rates for well-off Americans to pay for such things as cheaper college tuition for students.“We haven't come up with an exact number yet,” Sanders said. “But it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90%.... I'm not a socialist compared to Eisenhower.”Barabak reported from San Francisco and Halper from Des Moines.

"Jeb Bush said the United States “should declare war” as it responds to the Paris attacks and the rise of ISIS generally.“You take it to them in Syria and Iraq,” Mr. Bush said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” when asked how the United States could expect to “defeat an ideology.”“You destroy ISIS,” he continued. “And then you build a coalition to replace this radical Islamic terrorist threat to our country and to Europe and to the region with something that is more peace-loving.”The host, Chuck Todd, asked Mr. Bush what he would tell an American public wary of foreign entanglements after wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. (Mr. Todd left unsaid the fact that those wars began under Mr. Bush’s brother.)“I tell the American public that a caliphate the size of Indiana garners strength each and every day if it’s not taken out,” Mr. Bush replied.Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, has long sought to establish himself as the adult in a raucous Republican field, and his supporters are hopeful that a greater focus on national security issues could provide an opening for a campaign that has badly struggled.On Sunday, Mr. Bush hinted at the shifting tenor of the race, with some prodding from Mr. Todd, arguing that “as we get closer to the primaries, people are going to want to know who can sit behind the big desk.”He was asked if he would trust Donald J. Trump or Ben Carson as commander-in-chief.“I don’t know,” Mr. Bush said. “The words that I hear them speaking give me some concern. “But he turned quickly to Hillary Rodham Clinton, seizing on comments she made during Saturday night’s Democratic debate. Mrs. Clinton said the fight against ISIS “cannot be an American fight,” before adding that “American leadership is essential.”“I’m more concerned about Hillary Clinton thinking that the United States doesn’t have a leadership role in this,” Mr. Bush said, after the question about his Republican rivals. “That’s my big concern.”",MATT FLEGENHEIMER,"Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, warned that the caliphate was gaining strength “every day” and insisted the United States must take the lead in fighting it in Syria and Iraq.","First Draft: ‘We Should Declare War’ in Fight Against Islamic State, Jeb Bush Says",http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/15/we-should-declare-war-in-fight-against-islamic-state-jeb-bush-says/,['foreign policy/national security'],"['Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Jeb Bush', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Chuck Todd', 'Donald J.
