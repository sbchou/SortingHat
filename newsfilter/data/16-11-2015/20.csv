"!--StartFragment-->Jeb Bush has bought his struggling presidential campaign more time, even as Marco Rubio threatens to siphon off the financing that is the lifeblood of his 2016 aspirations.The former Florida governor delivered a solid, issues-oriented performance Tuesday in the latest Republican debate, which calmed top Bush donors and bundlers who had become disenchanted with the direction of his campaign. Bush can't survive without the financial backing of his vast network of GOP insiders. Their support had wavered following Bush's disastrous showing in the previous debate 12 days earlier that included a bungled attempt to tear down Rubio.""Everyone in Jeb World admitted that the third debate was a tough one, but he did very well this week,"" Jay Zeidman, a well-connected Bush donor from Houston, told the Washington Examiner on Friday.

" (AP) â The Democratic presidential candidates are debating for the second time in the 2016 nomination contest, this time in Des Moines.The latest developments (all times local):___7:45 p.m.The Democratic candidates for president are gathering for the party's second debate of the 2016 campaign, a meeting that will take place in the shadow of the attacks in Paris.The campaigns have tangled with debate host CBS over the format of the debate in the hours before the debate.When CBS said on a conference call with the campaigns that it wanted to focus the opening statement and the first section of the debate on the Paris attacks, the campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders vigorously disagreed.That's according to a participant on the call, who spoke on condition of anonymity and was not authorized to speak publicly.Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver says the key issue is a proposal to shorten the opening statements from 90 seconds to 30 seconds in order to move quickly to questions in a debate unfolding a day after the Paris attacks.The Vermont senator's campaign says it successfully argued on behalf of the longer opening statements, which all three candidates will deliver.The debate will begin with a moment of silence in memory of the victims of the attacks.â By Ken Thomas.",,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — The Democratic presidential candidates are debating for the second time in the 2016 nomination contest, this time in Des Moines.",The Latest: Democratic 2016 candidates meet for 2nd debate,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-11-14-US--DEM%202016-Debate-The%20Latest/id-0e87a5d0fb4e4feca870115079ba2e96,['personality'],"['Ken Thomas', 'Bernie Sanders', 'Jeff Weaver']",ap,0.8332397720754736,"[{'author_id': 3398, 'fullname': 'ap', 'primary_org': 'huffpo'}]",2015-11-14 20:48:00,['DES MOINES'],b071740b6e3f766d43fa3f8cc8950695,2015-11-15 02:00:05.513360
"Democratic U.S. presidential candidates Senator Bernie Sanders (L), former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley pose on stage ahead of the second official 2016 U.S. Democratic presidential candidates debate in Des Moines, Iowa, November 14, 2015.   (REUTERS/Jim Young)Hillary Clinton was put on the defensive at the opening of Saturday night’s Democratic presidential debate over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability.The debate in Des Moines, Iowa, came in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which thrust the issues of national security and foreign policy back to the center of the 2016 campaign. The debate format was changed to focus anew on those issues.But, citing the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa, Clinton’s rivals criticized her Senate vote for use of force before the Iraq war and appeared to criticize her support for toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley said America’s role is not to roam the world “looking for new dictators to topple.”He said it is also important to understand “secondary and third consequences” that come after removing a “single dictator.” O’Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a “mess.”Clinton defended her support for toppling Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a “genocide” and America’s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support.She also said “it is imperative” that the U.S. do more to confront the “arc of instability” in the region. And to O’Malley’s critique, she said, “I don’t think you can paint with a broad brush,” and “This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.”Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, referenced Clinton’s support for use of force in Iraq and said the “disastrous invasion” led “to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.”Clinton again called her Iraq war vote a “mistake,” but disputed that the war is the only driver of modern terrorism.The candidates also condemned the Paris terror attacks.“Our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough,” Clinton said.She called for global “resolve” to “root out” the “radical jihadist ideology” that motivates groups like the Islamic State. Clinton, a former secretary of state, said she would coordinate efforts “against the scourge of terrorism.”“It cannot be contained. It must be defeated,” she said of ISIS.Sanders blasted ISIS as a “barbarous organization.”O’Malley called this the “new face” of terror threats.The attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said. In a primary race otherwise dominated by the economy, climate and front-runner Clinton’s personal record, the debate in Des Moines, Iowa, now is expected to focus heavily on security and foreign policy after debate host CBS News reworked the format.  It is an area where Clinton, as former secretary of state, enters with the thickest resume – but also one that could prove problematic, given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable and chaotic nations like Libya and Syria.Sanders, after appearing to give her a pass at the first debate over her personal email controversy, has in recent weeks shown a greater interest in criticizing her record. But his focus on issues like income inequality could be out of place in a discussion focused on global security challenges. Sanders’ campaign objected to some of the CBS News debate tweaks, sources said.Clinton also enters this debate – hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register – facing a narrower field than at their first encounter in October. Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O’Malley.Clinton is seen to have otherwise strengthened her hand since that debate, making it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and seeing one of her biggest potential political threats – a late bid by Vice President Biden – disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.Sanders remains Clinton’s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.Still, the FBI investigation over Clinton’s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding. ",,Hillary Clinton was put on the defensive at the opening of Saturday night’s Democratic presidential debate over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability. ,Clinton on defense over Middle East policies at Dem debate,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/TEOgoe910VE/,['foreign policy/national security'],"['Bernie Sanders', 'Muammar Qaddafi', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Martin O'Malley"""""," 'Jim Young']""",fox,0.9311865151561396,[],2015-11-15 02:02:16,"['Senate', 'Al Qaeda', 'FBI']",b06f7a0e9f9c60524f5011b3887f1e37,2015-11-15 03:00:12.671185
"AMES, Iowa (AP) â Fresh from the second Democratic presidential debate, Hillary Rodham Clinton suggested Sunday that Bernie Sanders would raise middle-class taxes and ""scrap"" President Barack Obama's health care law, in an escalating critique of the Vermont senator.Joined by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, at a fall barbecue, the front-runner said middle-class families ""need a raise, not a tax increase"" and she was the lone Democrat in the debate to commit to raising wages ""and not your taxes.""Without mentioning her main rival by name, Clinton said Democrats should work to build on Obama's health law and not suggest ""we scrap it and start all over again."" During the debate, Clinton questioned Sanders' 2013 health care legislation, saying it would dismantle the law and empower Republican governors like Terry Branstad of Iowa to administer the health care system in each state. Sanders envisions a ""single-payer"" system that would be run by the states under federal rules.Even as the field responded somberly to the deadly attacks in Paris, the debate Saturday night marked a feistier phase in the Democratic campaign. Helped by a strong autumn, Clinton has built a small lead in Iowa and is trying to stave off Sanders in the Feb. 1 presidential caucuses.Sanders put Clinton on the defensive in the debate when he said Wall Street had been the major contributor to her campaigns in order to get support in return.Clinton responded that Sanders was trying to ""impugn my integrity"" and said that as a New York senator, she helped New York City's financial hub rebuild after the Sept. 11 attacks. Her invoking of 9/11 received an incredulous response on social media and Republicans accused her of shamefully hiding behind the attacks to deflect attention from her ties to her wealthiest donors.Taking the stage in Ames, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley said Clinton brought up 9/11 to try to ""mask her proximity to Wall Street and the huge amount of contributions and the dollars she has received personally from the major banks of Wall Street.""""She doesn't have to mask it. It is what it is,"" O'Malley said. ""That is the sort of company, that is the sort economic advice that she would follow.""Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said following the debate that the senator's proposals would be paid for with higher taxes on the wealthy and large corporations. ""He's raising taxes to pay for relief for middle-income and working people,"" he said.He also said Sanders would build upon the health care law to provide universal coverage. ""It's not a question of ripping up Obamacare, it's really expanding on the promise of Obamacare,"" Weaver said.The barbecue inside a massive agriculture center featured another appearance by Bill Clinton, who briefly introduced his wife and joked that after watching the debates, ""I think I'm going to vote for Hillary.""___On Twitter, follow Ken Thomas: https://twitter.com/KThomasDC",,"AMES, Iowa (AP) — Fresh from the second Democratic presidential debate, Hillary Rodham Clinton suggested Sunday that Bernie Sanders would raise middle-class taxes and ""scrap"" President Barack Obama's health care law, in an escalating critique of the Vermont senator.","Clinton goes after Sanders on taxes, health care",http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-11-15-US--DEM%202016-Clinton/id-e642156bd9b549fb8161c27ced2fad72,['health'],"['Jeff Weaver', 'Martin O'Malley""""", 'Bill Clinton', 'Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Barack Obama', 'Ken Thomas', 'Bernie Sanders'," 'Terry Branstad']""",ap,0.535904016805291,"[{'author_id': 39392, 'fullname': 'ken thomas', 'primary_org': 'ap'}]",2015-11-15 16:27:00,['AMES'],339e5cfe47434f9efe0d01fa28b3f86f,2015-11-15 22:00:05.671043

(REUTERS/Jim Young)PreviousNextHillary Clinton faced tough criticism Saturday night from her Democratic rivals over everything from her Middle East policies to her swaying stance on gun control to her Wall Street ties, at a debate that saw both Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley step up their attacks on the party’s front-runner.The former secretary of state was put on the defensive almost immediately, as she was challenged by her rivals -- and the moderator -- over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability. Vermont Sen. Sanders ripped her support for “regime change.”  But while the Paris terror attacks the night before shifted the early presidential debate focus to national security, the candidates sparred aggressively in the latter half over domestic issues – especially financial industry reform and Clinton’s Wall Street support.Former Maryland Gov. O’Malley called her the “candidate of Wall Street.”Asked about her hefty Wall Street-backed speaking fees and donations, Clinton defended her independence in being able to pursue financial industry reform.But Sanders shot back, “Not good enough.”“Let's not be naive about it. Why …has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?” he said. “You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.”He and O’Malley, unlike Clinton, both want to re-instate a Depression-era banking law known as Glass-Steagall – and they both criticized Clinton’s Wall Street plans as not going far enough. O’Malley called it “weak tea.”In an eyebrow-raising moment, Clinton countered Sanders’ criticism of her Wall Street donations by saying that as New York senator, she helped “rebuild” Wall Street and downtown Manhattan after 9/11.Clinton was later asked about social media reaction claiming she had invoked 9/11 to justify financial industry donations; Clinton said she’s sorry that anyone had that “impression.”Meanwhile, she said she doesn’t think her rivals’ financial industry plans – particularly to reinstate the Depression-era law that separated investment and commercial banking – would get the job done.“I'm all about making sure we actually get results,” Clinton said.The debate in Des Moines, Iowa, came in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which thrust the issues of national security and foreign policy back to the center of the 2016 campaign. The format of the debate – hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register -- was changed to focus anew on those issues in the beginning.Clinton tried to highlight her deep experience in foreign policy issues from the outset.“This election is not only about electing a president. It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief,” she said.But, citing the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa, Clinton’s rivals soon turned to her record as U.S. senator and later as secretary of state to question her judgment in foreign policy matters.O’Malley appeared to criticize her support for toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.He said America’s role is not to roam the world “looking for new dictators to topple.” He said it is also important to understand “secondary and third consequences” that come after removing a “single dictator.” O’Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a “mess.”Clinton defended her support for ousting Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a “genocide” and America’s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support. And to O’Malley’s critique, she said, “I don’t think you can paint with a broad brush” in an “incredibly complicated region of the world.”Sanders, meanwhile, referenced Clinton’s Senate vote for the use of force in Iraq and said the “disastrous invasion” led “to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.” The senator also claimed that “climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.”Clinton again called her Iraq war vote a “mistake,” but disputed that the war is the only driver of modern terrorism.She and O’Malley briefly sparred over America’s role in fighting ISIS. After Clinton said it “cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential,” O’Malley said, “This actually is America’s fight,” though not “solely” America’s fight.Sanders staked out a different position in saying it is the nations in the region that “have to get their hands dirty.”“Those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort,” he said.The candidates declined to categorize the threat itself as “radical Islam.” Asked about that categorization, Clinton said only, “I don’t think we’re at war with Islam.”All the candidates on stage condemned the Paris terror attacks and vowed to take on the threat of terror.“It cannot be contained. It must be defeated,” Clinton said of ISIS, appearing to distance herself from President Obama, who hours before the Paris attacks claimed ISIS was “contained.”The attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said. It brought the issue of terrorism to the forefront of both party’s presidential primary races. Ostensibly, it is an area where Clinton enters with the thickest resume – but also one that could, as the debate showed, prove problematic given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable nations like Libya and Syria.While the tragedy hung over the debate, the candidates were able to tackle of range of domestic issues including wages and immigration.O’Malley landed virtually the only shot of the night against Republican candidate Donald Trump, a favorite target of the Democrats, by calling him an “immigrant-bashing carnival barker.” The Democratic candidates generally agree on the call for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the country.Sanders, meanwhile, continued to advocate for a $15 minimum wage.But the candidates were divided on gun control. While Clinton has tried in the past to cast Sanders as soft on the issue, O’Malley accused Clinton of being “on three sides of this.”“When you ran in 2000, you said we needed federal robust regulations, then in 2008 you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying we don't need those regulations ... and now you’re coming back around here,” he said.The debate was notable in that it saw Sanders and O’Malley taking a more aggressive tone against the front-runner, who seemed to have strengthened her hand since their initial debate.Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O’Malley. She also made it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and saw one of her biggest potential political threats – a late bid by Vice President Biden – disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.Sanders remains Clinton’s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.Still, the FBI investigation over Clinton’s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding. Sanders appeared to give her a pass on the email issue at the first debate by saying he was tired of hearing about the controversy.Sanders, though, stood by his comments at the second debate Saturday night: “I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email, I’m still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email. … Let’s go to the major issues facing America.” ",,,"DEMOCRATIC DEBATE  Clinton hit by rivals over Mideast, Wall Street ties",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/15/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate/,"['foreign policy/national security', 'immigration']","['Martin O'Malley""""", 'Jim Young', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Donald Trump', 'Muammar Qaddafi'," 'Bernie Sanders']""",fox,0.9973633621405877,[],2015-11-15 06:03:37,"['Senate', 'Al Qaeda', 'FBI']",e310bbfc28aa65b4735b170dc3b6246a,2015-11-15 07:00:04.156895

Alex Wong/Getty Images                    Hillary Clinton entered the second debate of the campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination with far less to prove than she had in the first, and, in the end, she probably achieved far less as well. But for the time being, at least, she may be able to afford it. The first debate, in October, corresponded with a time of stress for her candidacy, besieged by various legal and political investigators and drifting downward in voter-preference polls. But Clinton did so well and struck such a blend of competence and charm in the October debate on CNN that she was widely acknowledged to have rescued her fortunes — or at least strengthened her hand. This latest debate on CBS News and staged at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, was never likely to have as great an impact. The likely audience was limited. It was staged on a Saturday night, competing with various sports and entertainment programs. This weekend, in particular, it was overshadowed by the tragedy unfolding in Paris, where at least 129 people died in terrorist attacks Friday night. The group known as Islamic State claimed responsibility for the coordinated attacks by teams of gunmen and suicide bombers. The debaters observed a moment of silence for the victims in Paris and devoted the first quarter of the debate to discussing the attacks and the proper response from the U.S. and its allies. All agreed the U.S. had a major, leading role to play in battling the terrorists, but all also agreed that U.S. allies needed to respond with greater commitment as well. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont noted that the struggles in the Middle East amounted to ""a war for the soul of Islam,"" implying it was a contest beyond the power of the U.S. government to resolve. But Sanders also explicitly assigned responsibility for the current turmoil in the Middle East to the administration of George W. Bush, whose invasion of Iraq in 2003 was responsible for ""all this instability,"" he said. Sanders made the point that he had opposed the invasion on the Senate floor, where Clinton had voted in support. Clinton has since called that vote a mistake. But the most difficult part of that first segment of the debate for Clinton came when CBS News debate moderator John Dickerson asked whether her prescriptions for the fight against the group called Islamic State suffered for her association with President Obama, who has been downplaying, or underestimating, the strength of the group. As recently as this week, the president had said the group had been ""contained,"" at least in its territorial ambitions in Iraq and Syria. On this, Clinton distanced herself from the president somewhat, saying she had advised more involvement in the region after the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq — a shift she said was mandated by the agreement struck with Iraq by the last Bush administration. She had said she warned that ""extremist groups might fill the vacuum."" Sanders said several times that the Department of Defense budget was already $600 billion and that the U.S. should be hesitant to increase that greatly without knowing what it was expecting to accomplish with more military hardware. A self-described Democratic Socialist, Sanders also contrasted his reliance on small donors with the Clinton campaign's donations from the wealthy of Wall Street: ""Maybe they're stupid about what they're going to get [in return], but I don't think so."" Clinton then insisted on a chance to respond, because Sanders had ""impugned my integrity."" That drew an audible sound of anticipation from the crowd, which may not have expected even this degree of confrontation between the candidates after the harmony of the first debate. Clinton then said she had many thousands of donors, most of them not rich, and 60 percent of them women. Although not directly responsive to the Wall Street thrust from Sanders, Clinton's reference to gender prompted applause and cheers from the crowd. This was her best moment of the debate, according to people following the proceedings on social media such as Twitter. Clinton went on to suggest her contributions from Wall Street stemmed from appreciation for all she had done to help the Lower Manhattan financial industry recover from the terror attacks of September 2001. That rationale drew a decidedly mixed response from the audience in the hall and on social media, with many questioning whether it fully explained the generous contributions she still receives from the financial industry more than a dozen years later. .@HillaryClinton vehemently offers support for Wall Street as post-911 recovery effort.  Does that fly?— David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) November 15, 2015Sanders said Clinton's plan to increase regulation of the financial industry was ""not good enough,"" and he had corroborating support from third-place challenger Martin O'Malley, the former governor of Maryland, who called the Clinton plan ""weak tea."" The candidates revisited a divide on gun violence, with Sanders saying he was willing to reconsider his past opposition to legislation stripping gun manufacturers of their liability when their products were used in the commission of crimes. O'Malley sided with Clinton on this issue, only moments after favoring Sanders' point of view on banking regulation. But, in general, the candidates were largely in agreement on major issues. They agreed that President Obama had been right to offer a path to citizenship for young people brought to the U.S. illegally while still minor children. ""The symbol of America is the Statue of Liberty,"" said O'Malley, ""not a barbed-wire fence."" O'Malley also won cheers from the crowd for his reference to ""that immigrant-bashing carnival-barker Donald Trump,"" a reference to the candidate leading most polls among Republican candidates for president. All three candidates supported greater access to a college education, with Sanders saying all public universities and colleges should be tuition-free. Clinton said she did not think taxpayers should pay for Trump's children to go to college, as he is a billionaire. O'Malley noted that he had held the line on tuition increases at state schools when he was a governor. And neither Sanders nor O'Malley took the bait when asked whether Clinton's private e-mail server should have been used for any kind of government business. Sanders in particular refused the chance to criticize her on the issue, saying he was still ""tired of her emails,"" as he had said in the first debate. Dickerson then asked Clinton if there were ""other shoes to drop"" as multiple investigations proceed into her time in office and the activities of her aides. Clinton alluded to her 11 hours of testimony before a House investigative panel last month as an indication to the contrary. Overall, the debate did not seem likely to affect Clinton's standing in the primary field. Despite moments of vulnerability and dubious reaction to her defenses regarding Wall Street contributors, she remained the strong center of the cast on stage. She had 40 percent of the total speaking time, with 35 percent going to Sanders and 25 percent to O'Malley. But as she had arrived at this juncture of the campaign as not only the leader but an increasingly dominant leader, Clinton had little room to improve. Dickerson also invited favorable comparison to his predecessors in the role of debate moderator. His questions were crisp, to the point and frequently challenging — but without the argumentative tone that has brought criticism from participants in earlier debates on the Republican side.",,"Former Maryland Gov.

"Initially solemn, typically wonkish and monotonously polite to the moderators and one another, the three Democratic presidential candidates still managed to provide a few surprising moments during their second debate Saturday night.Hillary Rodham Clinton complimented George W. Bush and accused Bernie Sanders of impugning her integrity.Martin O’Malley called Clinton “Annie Oakley” on gun control and “weak tea” on big banks.Sanders founded yet another T-shirt line by announcing that “Wall Street’s business model is fraud,” CBS used Twitter in a way that did not look like old-media floundering, and Dwight D. Eisenhower continued his 2016 Greatest Hits Tour.A week after Donald Trump praised Ike for deporting more than a million Mexicans, Sanders offered him as a model of high tax rates for the rich: “I’m not much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,” he said.Most important, however, was the moment that did not occur: Though they were resolute in their condemnation of ISIS, none of the candidates went inflammatory or ballistic.Taking place just a day more than 120 people were killed in a series of terrorist attacks in Paris , the debate, which was held in Des Moines and aired on CBS, opened without the now-usual campaign-trail/reality-show pomp and pageantry. Instead, moderator John Dickerson, host of “Face the Nation,” solemnly reminded viewers that open debate is “a symbol of freedom.”Then, after a moment of silence, he began asking newly added questions about the U.S. response to ISIS and unrest in the Middle East.But those hoping for burning rhetoric, sweeping resolutions or even clear plans were probably disappointed.While many of the Republican presidential candidates have made strong statements in the wake of Friday’s horrific attacks — Donald Trump suggested that an armed French citizenry would have prevented the tragedy, Sen. Ted Cruz called for significant air power and many if not all want to close the U.S. to Syrian refugees — the Democratic nominees chose to tread more carefully.So carefully that it was difficult to know what any of them do in similar circumstance should she or he become president. Indeed, during the opening minutes of their second debate, Sanders, Clinton and O’Malley were more explicit in their arguments about what the terrorists should be called — extreme jihadists rather than Islamic extremists — than they were about their visions of an American response.To be fair, Dickerson, for reasons of his own, never asked the obvious question — “What do you think the U.S. should do next?” Instead, he called on each of them to critique President Obama’s, and Clinton’s, handling of terrorism in general and ISIS particular. This put Clinton immediately on the defensive and Sanders and O’Malley in the unenviable position of criticizing their party’s president one day after a horrifying international crisis.O'Malley called for more ""human intelligence"" and Sanders blamed the rise of terrorism on the Iraq war, which, he pointed out, Clinton had voted for. Clinton quickly reminded everyone that many acts of terrorism, including 9/11, had preceded the war, which she once again admitted was a mistake, and unity returned to the conversation.Early minutes were spent agreeing that the Middle East is complicated, the world is dangerous and the enemy is not Islam, a distinction Clinton thanked George W. Bush for making in the days following 9/11.Indeed, until the first commercial break and beyond, the three candidates spent so much time openly agreeing with one another, with minor caveats, that they seemed to have forgotten they were political rivals.That changed when the questions returned to the economy and everyone seemed to feel on firmer ground.As the front-runner, Clinton got the toughest questions and the brunt of the criticism, onstage and off. At one point, Sanders criticized Clinton’s reliance on “Wall Street donors” and all that implies. Clinton defended her impugned integrity in a strange and scattershot way by announcing that 60% of her donors were women and that she had stood by Wall Street, and the rest of New York, during and after 9/11.If Dickerson, who was otherwise strong on calling out contradictions and non-answers, let her get away with evoking 9/11 in a discussion of campaign donations, Twitter didn’t. A few minutes later, co-moderator CBS News congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes asked her to respond to one negative response, marking the first use of Twitter as a real-time participant of a debate.But even with a few mild barbs — O’Malley derided Clinton as having been “Annie Oakley” before changing her stance on gun control, or Sanders dismissed one of O’Malley’s references to his work as governor of Maryland by saying “Baltimore is not now one of the safest cities in America"" — the tenor of the remarks leaned more toward conversation than debate.So much so that Clinton felt comfortable enough to laud the similarities she shares with her rivals. “We have our differences,” she said. “But they pale compared with what’s happening on the Republican side.”“All of us support funding Planned Parenthood,” she continued. “All of us believe climate change is real. All of us want equal pay for equal work. They don't believe in any of that. So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.""Not surprisingly, neither Sanders nor O’Malley disagreed.",,"<p>Initially solemn, typically wonkish and monotonously polite to the moderators and one another, the three Democratic presidential candidates still managed to provide a few surprising moments during their second debate Saturday night.</p> <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton complimented George W.

"Republican presidential candidates have criticized Democratic White House hopeful Hillary Clinton for decliningÂ to use term such as âradical Islam” and “Islamic terrorism”Â to describe the extremists who have unleashed a string of terrorist attacks on Western targets recently.Asked at the second Democratic debate on Saturday night whether the U.S. was âat war with radical Islam,â Ms. Clinton drew a distinction between the worldâs 1.6 billion Muslims and those who commit acts of violent extremism.âI donât think weâre at war with Islam. I donât think weâre at war with all Muslims,â she said. âI think weâre at war with jihadists. We are at war with violent extremism. We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression, and yes, we are at war with those people, but I donât want us to be painting with too broad a brush.âShe recounted admiringly former president George W. Bushâs call forÂ tolerance in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.âIslam is peace,â Mr. Bush said in a speech at the Islamic Center of Washington, D.C. the week after the attacks.Mrs. Clinton’sÂ answer prompted reproach from Republicans who insisted she use the phrase, âradical Islam.âFormer Arkansas governor and Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee on Twitter mocked Democrats, writing âSay it with me: âIslamic Terrorism.ââ Carly Fiorina wrote on Twitter that unlike Hillary Clinton, she would use the phrase âIslamic terrorism.âYou’re all grown up now. You can do it. Three words. Ten syllables. Say it with me: “Radical Islamic terrorism.” #DemDebateâ Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) November 15, 2015We need a President who will see and speak and act on the truth…Hillary Clinton will not call this Islamic terrorism. I will.â Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) November 15, 2015On Sunday morning, Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who has put an aggressive foreign policy at the center of his presidential campaign, called the fight against terrorism âa clash of civilizationsâ and said he was baffled by Ms. Clintonâs reluctance to use the term âradical Islam.ââI donât understand it. That would be like saying we werenât at war with Nazis, because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but werenât violent themselves,â he said. âWe are at war with radical Islam, with an interpretation of Islam by a significant number of people around the world, who they believe now justifies them in killing those who donât agree with their ideology.âAnd on CNN on Sunday morning, Former Florida governor and Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said, âI know what Islamic terrorism is. This is not a question of religion. This is a political ideology that has co-opted a religion. And I think it’s more than acceptable just to call it for what it is and then organize an effort to destroy it.âHe also described the fight against terrorism as âa fight for Western civilization.âAbout 1% of the U.S. population are Muslims, according to the Pew Research Center.Â About 26% are evangelical Protestants, a group who hold considerably influence among the GOP primary electorate in the early nominating states of Iowa and South Carolina.______________________________________________________2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll StandingsPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.

"An unsettling yet telling split-screen changed the view of the presidential campaign Saturday night: three Democratic candidates who had come to Iowa to talk about domestic issues found their debate hijacked by a foreign policy crisis dominating the news from a world away.As metaphors for the last two presidencies go, the turnabout was apt: Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama came into office with domestic issues prime on their minds, only to have conflicts abroad hobble and frustrate their tenures.Foreign policy, and specifically her vote for the Iraq War, also frustrated Hillary Rodham Clinton in her unsuccessful run for president in 2008. Not even an ad that year asserting that she was most experienced to take the 3 a.m. crisis call—the implication being that Obama wasn’t—was enough to overcome Democrats' embrace of his early opposition to the war.As much as anything, Saturday night's debate in the shocked aftermath of the Paris terrorist attack offered Clinton an opportunity to argue anew that her experience is necessary—and her opponents' is insufficient--for any 3 a.m. call. That allowed her to eclipse her rivals on stage, although in doing so, she may have created vulnerabilities a Republican could exploit next fall.As a former senator and secretary of State, Clinton spoke with fluency about the contradictory puzzle and complicated players in the Middle East, and the tensions there that already have spilled into violence on the European continent. She recounted her experience helping downtown New York recover from the Sept. 11, 2001, attack (weirdly, however, it was in response to a criticism of her closeness with Wall Street donors).Seeking to shake up the Democratic race and loosen Hillary Rodham Clinton's front-runner status, rivals Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley repeatedly challenged the former secretary of State on Saturday night in a debate where they largely agreed on most issues.The session at Drake University...Seeking to shake up the Democratic race and loosen Hillary Rodham Clinton's front-runner status, rivals Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley repeatedly challenged the former secretary of State on Saturday night in a debate where they largely agreed on most issues.The session at Drake University...When asked to recount a crisis that had tested her, she dramatically retold the story of advising President Obama to go after Osama bin Laden in 2011 despite concerns by many in the administration that the mission could fail. And, she noted, she offered the advice without consulting anyone, even her husband, former President Bill Clinton.It was that question, more than any other, that demonstrated Clinton’s advantage once the focus turned to foreign policy. By contrast, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley recounted the daily tribulations of a mayor and state executive, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told of a veterans' bill, one in which he was not successful in achieving his initial goal and had to negotiate a compromise.Indeed, discomfort on the part of Sanders and O'Malley was palpable from the start. After a moment of silence for the victims in Paris, the candidates moved to opening statements. Speaking before Clinton, Sanders jumped quickly into his familiar arguments about a ""rigged economy,"" a ""corrupt campaign finance system"" and the need for millions of Americans to stand and say that ""enough is enough.""Speaking after Clinton, O’Malley averred that the Paris attacks showed the need for ""new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership."" But he did not offer any of the first two, and on the third, his mention that he worried about terrorism as a governor only underscored his lack of front-line international experience.Clinton went right to the point.""We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, the barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist, terrorist group,"" she said, adding pointedly: ""This election is not only about electing a president. It's also about choosing our next commander in chief.""Clinton did not offer many operational details, apart from working with American allies on a united anti-jihadist front. But neither did her opponents.The Democratic frontrunner undoubtedly would have received a rougher going-over had the debate been against a Republican free to oppose her actions as secretary of State from a perspective 180 degrees opposite hers (and all of the GOP candidates' views are.) Her weakest moment came in a muddled response to an obvious question about President Obama's failure—and hers--to anticipate the powerful rise of the Islamic State militants. That's a point Republicans are sure to hammer.Clinton seemed intent on carefully navigating her party's shoals. She mildly distanced herself from Obama’s ill-timed assertion—delivered just before the Paris attack—that the Islamic State was contained. ""It cannot be contained, it must be defeated,"" she said.But she immediately moved to calm the left: ""What the president has consistently said--which I agree with--is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS,"" she said, citing the U.S. forces training Arab and Kurdish militaries. ""But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential."" She mentioned the limits of American involvement twice.The Democratic counter to Clinton was far more difficult to make, giving the debate performances of Sanders and O'Malley the feel of a collection of pulled punches.Sanders has ridden a wave of support from the party's liberal left. Flaying Clinton for being insufficiently aggressive against the Islamic State and other terrorist groups would have inevitably risked a collision with the anti-interventionist views of his supporters, which by all evidence the senator ardently shares. O'Malley, with no clear path to the nomination besides his generational pitch, was effectively in the same fix.Neither candidate, for example, explicitly hit Clinton on one of the most significant events of her tenure as secretary of State, the loss of four Americans at the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya. Republicans have argued that attack would have been prevented by a more aggressive posture.The irony of terrorism and foreign policy overtaking a Democratic debate is that the party's candidates have largely avoided the subject this election cycle.Republicans have brawled over the level of aggression each would apply in the Mideast, with several candidates advocating no-fly zones that would put the country's military in direct conflict with Russian planes operating over Syria. Several also have advocated a sharp rise in American troops overseas.But for Democrats, the subject has been far more fraught. Obama came to office in the aftermath of Bush's intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan and vowed to disentangle America from both fights. He has since disappointed some of his followers by announcing that he would keep at least 5,500 troops in Afghanistan beyond the previously announced 2016 withdrawal. He also said recently that he would send special operations troops to Syria to assist rebels there --language that uncomfortably echoes the beginning of involvements in past military theaters.So for the Democratic candidates there had been no real primary season rationale for a focus on foreign policy. The first Democratic debate stuck to the candidates' nuanced differences on issues like economic policy, healthcare and criminal justice, and their agreements on matters such as changing immigration policy and raising the minimum wage.Then Paris exploded in violence.Whether terrorism will remain at the forefront of the campaign is impossible to predict, given that nearly a year remains before the election. But if it happens, more detail will be required from both the Democrats and Republicans seeking the White House.Ironically, as the candidates spoke to a country shaken by the Paris attack and wondering if it could happen here, one question was left unasked Saturday night: If France couldn't find a handful of terrorists in a country of 66 million people, how would the next president find them in a country of 320 million?cathleen.decker@latimes.comFor political news and analysis, follow me on Twitter: @cathleendecker .

" With the deadly terrorist attacks in Paris as a somber backdrop, three Democratic presidential candidates squared off in Des Moines, Ia., Saturday night in the party’s second 2016 debate.Sometimes the statements made by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley on foreign policy and domestic issues rang true; sometimes their remarks didn’t coincide with the facts. For instance:Sanders criticized Clinton for her support for the Iraq war, saying the was has led to the current instability in the region. Hillary Clinton voted for authorizing the war in Iraq in 2002, which she has since said she regrets. It became an obstacle for her 2008 presidential campaign. In 2006, she said, ""Obviously, if we knew then what we know now, there wouldn't have been a vote, and I certainly wouldn't have voted for it."" Clinton said that Americans spend more than anyone else in the world on prescription drugs. A PBS report last year found that “the United States spends almost $1,000 per person per year on pharmaceuticals. That’s around 40 percent more than the next highest spender, Canada, and more than twice as much as than countries like France and Germany spend.” Sanders aid that Americans spend more on health care than anyone else in the world. This appears to be true, according to a Commonwealth Fund report last year. “The United States health care system is the most expensive in the world, but this report and prior editions consistently show the U.S. under-performs relative to other countries on most dimensions of performance,"" it found. Sanders said climate change contributed to global terrorism and attributed the claim to the CIA. ""Climate change is directly related to the rise of global terrorism,"" the senator said. ""This is what the CIA says.""In a Department of Defense release last year, then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said climate change is a ""trend that will affect national security. Rising global temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, climbing sea levels and more extreme weather events will intensify the challenges of global instability, hunger, poverty and conflict."" O'Malley made a similar connection between climate change and terrorism last September. Politifact rated the claim as ""Mostly True."" It said the drought in Syria – which limited resources – was not the ""sole culprit,"" but rather ""one of many factors that led to the Syrian conflict."" The article stated that Syrian President Bashar Assad's ""recruitment of al Qaida members"" and Sunni Arab genocide are more ""direct"" and ""crystal clear"" causes.Vera Bergengruen, Tori Whitley Iana Kozelsky and David Goldstein contributed.",,"With the deadly terrorist attacks in Paris as a somber backdrop, three Democratic presidential candidates squared off in Des Moines, Ia., Saturday night in the party’s second 2016 debate.

"Senator Marco Rubio, arguing that the United States is “at war with radical Islam,” sharply criticized Hillary Rodham Clinton for declining to characterize the perpetrators of the Paris attacks in that way, invoking Nazi Germany to make his point.“That would be like saying we weren’t at war with Nazis, because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but weren’t violent themselves,” Mr. Rubio said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”At the Democratic debate on Saturday night, Mrs. Clinton said she was wary about “painting with too broad a brush” while describing Muslims and terror.“I don’t think we’re at war with all Muslims,” she said. “I think we’re at war with jihadists. We are at war with violent extremism. We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression.”Republican presidential candidates have repeatedly condemned Democrats like Mrs. Clinton for their reluctance to use the term “radical Islam” while describing how they would respond to the violence wrought by ISIS.Mr. Rubio, the Florida senator, also called on Sunday for the invocation of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which declares an attack on one member of NATO as an attack on all.He demurred when asked about the prospect of placing American troops on the ground.“I think it’s premature to say the exact numbers,” he said, though he called for an increase in the number of “special operators on the ground.”",MATT FLEGENHEIMER,"Attacking Mrs. Clinton, the Florida senator drew a parallel between members of the Nazi Party who did not commit acts of violence and Muslims who are not violent extremists.","First Draft: Invoking Nazis, Marco Rubio Hits Hillary Clinton for Not Saying U.S. at War With ‘Radical Islam’",http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/15/invoking-nazis-marco-rubio-hits-hillary-clinton-for-not-saying-u-s-at-war-with-radical-islam/,['foreign policy/national security'],"['Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Marco Rubio', 'Hillary Clinton']",nyt,0.6955656874739587,"[{'author_id': 358, 'fullname': 'matt flegenheimer', 'primary_org': 'nyt'}]",2015-11-15 15:56:02,['NATO'],16ad84a36862fa7f625bcbade71ca7be,2015-11-15 16:31:51.866074
" (AP) â With the country still reeling from deadly terrorist attacks in Paris, Hillary Rodham Clinton cast herself as America's strongest leader in a scary world, even as she found herself forced to defend her own role during the rise of the Islamic State militants.""This election is not only about electing a president, it's also about choosing our next commander in chief,"" Clinton said Saturday night in the Democrats' second debate of the presidential campaign. ""All of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.""Amid the backdrop of global anxiety, Clinton found herself fending off questions about not only her foreign policy record but her economic ties, with both Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley painting the former senator from New York as a lackey for Wall Street and corporate interests.""Let's not be naive about it,"" said Sanders, noting that Clinton collected millions in campaign donations from Wall Street bankers. ""They expect to get something. Everybody knows that.""The barbs marked a far more aggressive shift in a primary race that has so far been notable for its civility. Democrats have spent months boasting about the substantive tone of their contest, attempting to set up a favorable early contrast with the ""carnival barker"" insults of the crowded Republican primary.Clinton faced criticism of her national security record, when Sanders traced the current instability in the Middle East to the U.S. Senate's vote â including Clinton's â to authorize military action in Iraq in 2002. He said that U.S. invasion ""unraveled the region.""The former secretary of state fought back, saying terrorism has been erupting for decades, specifically mentioning the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. She said the recent unrest in Libya and other parts of the Middle East is symptomatic of an ""arc of instability from North Africa to Afghanistan.""She rejected the idea that she and the rest of the Obama administration underestimated the growing threat of the Islamic State.The back-and-forth revealed a foreign policy split within the Democratic Party, with Sanders playing to the anti-war activists who boosted then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama to victory in 2008.Sanders argued for a far more hands-off approach, advocating for Muslim countries to lead the fight and declaring that the war against Islamic State militants is about the ""soul of Islam.""Clinton has a history of advocating for more robust involvement across the globe â both as a presidential candidate eight years ago and as Obama's secretary of state. In recent weeks, she has called for a more aggressive U.S. role in the Syrian conflict, including a no-fly zone over the area, a move the Obama administration opposes. But she stood by her opposition to seeking a formal declaration of war against the Islamic State.Foreign relations is an area where Clinton, as a former secretary of state, is in the strongest position to talk about the attacks and the U.S. effort to dismantle the Islamic State group. But she is vulnerable, too, her tenure tied to that of Obama, who's struggled to contain the threat from Islamic militants in Syria and associated terror attacks across the globe.The candidates were meeting in the shadow of the Paris attacks that killed at least 129 and wounded at least 352 people. The debate began with a solemn tone, with a moment of silence followed by previously unplanned foreign policy questions.All the candidates denounced the attacks, the first time the Democratic field spoke about the incidents.They gave some fodder to their Republican critics, who coupled condemnation of the Paris attacks during the day with sharp criticism for Obama and his former secretary of state, Clinton.""We are at war with violent extremism, we are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression,"" said Clinton, arguing the U.S. is not at war with Islam or all Muslims. ""I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.""Sanders and O'Malley agreed with her sentiments, saying the term ""radical Islam"" used by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and other Republican presidential candidates, is unnecessarily offensive to American Muslims.Republicans immediately seized on the remarks. ""Yes, we are at war with radical Islamic terrorism,"" tweeted former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.The conversation later pivoted to economic issues, with the candidates tangling over how to pay for their plans to expand college affordability, family leave and prescription drug coverage. All three agreed that wealthy citizens and corporations should pay more in taxes to benefit the middle class.""I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,"" joked Sanders, saying the former president backed a 90 percent marginal tax rate.The three tangled over how high to increase the minimum wage, with Clinton backing a $12-per-hour federal floor while Sanders and O'Malley said $15 an hour â the rate being pushed by a campaign of fast-food workers and labor unions.While Clinton is wary of alienating Sanders backers whose support she'll need should she win the nomination, she drew a contrast with him on gun control. Highlighting a vote he took giving the gun industry immunity from lawsuits, she charged him with failing to push hard enough to regulate ownership.Since the party's first debate a month ago, Clinton has built a lead in the early voting states, an uptick that has come amid other signs the party is coalescing behind her. An Associated Press survey of superdelegates published Friday found that half of the Democratic insiders are publicly backing Clinton.Sanders may have inadvertently facilitated some of her progress in the first debate, when he seemed to dismiss the controversy over her use of a private email account and server by saying Americans are tired of hearing about her ""damn emails.""Saturday night, Sanders declined once again to attack:  ""I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email. I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's email,"" he said.""I agree completely,"" said Clinton, with a laugh.___Follow Lisa Lerer on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/llerer",,"WASHINGTON (AP) — With the country still reeling from deadly terrorist attacks in Paris, Hillary Rodham Clinton cast herself as America's strongest leader in a scary world, even as she found herself forced to defend her own role during the rise of the Islamic State militants.","Clinton, Sanders debate foreign policy after Paris attacks",http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-11-14-US--DEM%202016-Debate/id-838ac0452db545a59dfdb9f7a2186c7a,['foreign policy/national security'],"['Martin O'Malley""""", 'Jeb Bush', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Lisa Lerer', 'Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Marco Rubio', 'Barack Obama'," 'Bernie Sanders']""",ap,0.9415475997294712,"[{'author_id': 39735, 'fullname': 'lisa lerer', 'primary_org': 'ap'}]",2015-11-14 22:43:00,['Democratic Party'],2546a16b3e748218a88f38f68865cf82,2015-11-15 04:00:04.745793
"Democrats and Republicans, based on their recent presidential debates, are set to offer voters a stark choice in 2016 about how the economy should be managed, with both sides moving toward the outer flanks of their parties.In Saturday’s Democratic debate, candidates said they would seek to rein in Wall Street, raise taxes, increase the minimum wage and expand the federal government’s role in health care. Republicans, meanwhile, are competing to repeal regulations, cut taxes, keep the minimum wage as it stands and roll back President Barack Obama’s signature health-care overhaul.The parties right now “have polar opposite analyses of how the economy works and how it should work,” said Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser in the Obama administration. “It’s obvious but underappreciated how far apart they are on the fundamentals—wages, taxes, financial markets.”Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, sparred Saturday over how to pay for new federal investments in education, infrastructure and health care. Both called for raising taxes on the wealthy, although Mrs. Clinton pledged to do so without hitting families that earn less than $250,000 or increasing deficits, which would constrain new spending ambitions.Mr. Sanders wouldn’t say exactly how high tax rates should rise but noted the top tax rate had been 91% in the 1950s under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican. “I’m not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,” Mr. Sanders said.Republicans have put tax-cutting proposals at the heart of their economic policy agenda, and they have largely shied away from promises made by candidates four years ago to avoid running up budget deficits.The boldness of some proposals drew warnings from one candidate, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, at last week’s Republican presidential debate. “Hillary and the Democrats promise everything on the spending side. We’ve got to be responsible about what we propose on the tax side,” he said.Republicans at last week’s debate also dismissed efforts to boost the federal minimum wage, now at $7.25 an hour, as an ineffective way to raise incomes. Florida Sen.  Marco Rubio and businessman  Donald Trump said it would put U.S. workers at a disadvantage. “You’re going to make people more expensive than a machine,” Mr. Rubio said.Democrats on Saturday debated whether to target a federal minimum wage of $12 or $15 an hour. Mr. Sanders supports the higher threshold, an effort backed by labor unions. He brushed aside warnings issued recently by Alan Krueger, the Princeton University professor who served as Mr. Obama’s top economist, that a $15 minimum wage is an untested, risky level. His research contends minimum-wage increases haven’t decreased employment, and he supports raising wages to $12 an hour.“I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously,” said Mrs. Clinton, who also has endorsed the $12 floor.Mr. Sanders and Martin O’Malley, the third candidate at Saturday’s debate and a former Maryland governor, said they would shun anyone with Wall Street ties from top positions in their administrations, including figures such as  Robert Rubin and Larry Summers, who served as treasury secretaries for President  Bill Clinton.Some Democrats have faulted that approach. “The idea that you have to excommunicate anybody who ever worked in the financial sector is ridiculous,” said Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist Democratic think tank. “We need people who oversee the Federal Reserve system and have high posts at Treasury that have expertise in finance.”Both Republicans and Democrats have promised to crack down on Wall Street, but they disagree sharply over how to do it. Republicans generally have blamed government policies, from housing to Federal Reserve interest-rate decisions, for provoking the financial crisis. They say the Dodd-Frank Act in particular has restrained economic growth and should be repealed.Democrats quarreled Saturday over whether the regulatory overhaul had gone far enough by failing to reinstate a New Deal-era law that separated commercial and investment banking, known as the Glass-Steagall Act.The flare-up over banking laws reflected Mr. Sanders’s broader critique that Democrats and Republicans have given banks too much political power, a throwback to the “trust busting” of President Theodore Roosevelt more than a century ago. Why do big industries make “millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something,” he said in Saturday’s debate. “Everybody knows that.”Both parties did agree in the past week on one thing: the virtues of community banks. Republicans warned that too many were going out of business. Mr. Sanders said Saturday that they needed more support. “That’s the future of banking in America,” he said.Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com",,"Democrats and Republicans, based on their recent presidential debates, are set to offer voters a stark choice in 2016 about how the economy should be managed, with both sides moving toward the outer flanks of their parties.",Parties' Divide on Economy Widens,http://www.wsj.com/articles/parties-divide-on-the-economy-widens-1447633374,['economy'],"['Theodore Roosevelt', 'Martin O'Malley""""", 'Alan Krueger', 'Bill Clinton', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Dwight D.

(REUTERS/Jim Young)PreviousNextHillary Clinton faced tough criticism Saturday night from her Democratic rivals over everything from her Middle East policies to her swaying stance on gun control to her Wall Street ties, at a debate that saw both Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley step up their attacks on the party’s front-runner.The former secretary of state was put on the defensive almost immediately, as she was challenged by her rivals -- and the moderator -- over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability. Vermont Sen. Sanders ripped her support for “regime change.”  But while the Paris terror attacks the night before shifted the early presidential debate focus to national security, the candidates sparred aggressively in the latter half over domestic issues – especially financial industry reform and Clinton’s Wall Street support.Former Maryland Gov. O’Malley called her the “candidate of Wall Street.”Asked about her hefty Wall Street-backed speaking fees and donations, Clinton defended her independence in being able to pursue financial industry reform.But Sanders shot back, “Not good enough.”“Let's not be naive about it. Why …has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?” he said. “You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.”He and O’Malley, unlike Clinton, both want to re-instate a Depression-era banking law known as Glass-Steagall – and they both criticized Clinton’s Wall Street plans as not going far enough. O’Malley called it “weak tea.”In an eyebrow-raising moment, Clinton countered Sanders’ criticism of her Wall Street donations by saying that as New York senator, she helped “rebuild” Wall Street and downtown Manhattan after 9/11.Clinton was later asked about social media reaction claiming she had invoked 9/11 to justify financial industry donations; Clinton said she’s sorry that anyone had that “impression.”Meanwhile, she said she doesn’t think her rivals’ financial industry plans – particularly to reinstate the Depression-era law that separated investment and commercial banking – would get the job done.“I'm all about making sure we actually get results,” Clinton said.The debate in Des Moines, Iowa, came in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which thrust the issues of national security and foreign policy back to the center of the 2016 campaign. The format of the debate – hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register -- was changed to focus anew on those issues in the beginning.Clinton tried to highlight her deep experience in foreign policy issues from the outset.“This election is not only about electing a president. It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief,” she said.But, citing the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa, Clinton’s rivals soon turned to her record as U.S. senator and later as secretary of state to question her judgment in foreign policy matters.O’Malley appeared to criticize her support for toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.He said America’s role is not to roam the world “looking for new dictators to topple.” He said it is also important to understand “secondary and third consequences” that come after removing a “single dictator.” O’Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a “mess.”Clinton defended her support for ousting Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a “genocide” and America’s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support. And to O’Malley’s critique, she said, “I don’t think you can paint with a broad brush” in an “incredibly complicated region of the world.”Sanders, meanwhile, referenced Clinton’s Senate vote for the use of force in Iraq and said the “disastrous invasion” led “to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.” The senator also claimed that “climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.”Clinton again called her Iraq war vote a “mistake,” but disputed that the war is the only driver of modern terrorism.She and O’Malley briefly sparred over America’s role in fighting ISIS. After Clinton said it “cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential,” O’Malley said, “This actually is America’s fight,” though not “solely” America’s fight.Sanders staked out a different position in saying it is the nations in the region that “have to get their hands dirty.”“Those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort,” he said.The candidates declined to categorize the threat itself as “radical Islam.” Asked about that categorization, Clinton said only, “I don’t think we’re at war with Islam.”All the candidates on stage condemned the Paris terror attacks and vowed to take on the threat of terror.“It cannot be contained. It must be defeated,” Clinton said of ISIS, appearing to distance herself from President Obama, who hours before the Paris attacks claimed ISIS was “contained.”The attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said. It brought the issue of terrorism to the forefront of both party’s presidential primary races. Ostensibly, it is an area where Clinton enters with the thickest resume – but also one that could, as the debate showed, prove problematic given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable nations like Libya and Syria.While the tragedy hung over the debate, the candidates were able to tackle of range of domestic issues including wages and immigration.O’Malley landed virtually the only shot of the night against Republican candidate Donald Trump, a favorite target of the Democrats, by calling him an “immigrant-bashing carnival barker.” The Democratic candidates generally agree on the call for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the country.Sanders, meanwhile, continued to advocate for a $15 minimum wage.But the candidates were divided on gun control. While Clinton has tried in the past to cast Sanders as soft on the issue, O’Malley accused Clinton of being “on three sides of this.”“When you ran in 2000, you said we needed federal robust regulations, then in 2008 you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying we don't need those regulations ... and now you’re coming back around here,” he said.The debate was notable in that it saw Sanders and O’Malley taking a more aggressive tone against the front-runner, who seemed to have strengthened her hand since their initial debate.Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O’Malley. She also made it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and saw one of her biggest potential political threats – a late bid by Vice President Biden – disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.Sanders remains Clinton’s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.Still, the FBI investigation over Clinton’s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding. Sanders appeared to give her a pass on the email issue at the first debate by saying he was tired of hearing about the controversy.Sanders, though, stood by his comments at the second debate Saturday night: “I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email, I’m still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email. … Let’s go to the major issues facing America.” ",,"Hillary Clinton faced tough criticism Saturday night from her Democratic rivals over everything from her Middle East policies to her swaying stance on gun control to her Wall Street ties, at a debate that saw both Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley step up their attacks on the party’s front-runner.  ","Clinton hit by Dem rivals over Wall St. ties, Mideast policies at 2nd debate",http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/V8TEBB0dgZ8/,"['foreign policy/national security', 'immigration']","['Martin O'Malley""""", 'Jim Young', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Donald Trump', 'Muammar Qaddafi'," 'Bernie Sanders']""",fox,0.9974292038547423,[],2015-11-15 05:15:16,"['Senate', 'Al Qaeda', 'FBI']",29828bcd7ecc03e34848b99e5ee11039,2015-11-15 06:14:40.351600
"WASHINGTON The deadly attacks in Paris pushed terrorism and the Syrian refugee crisis to the center of the U.S presidential campaign on Sunday, as Republicans hammered Obama administration plans to take in more refugees as well as Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton's stance on Middle East policy.After officials said one of the Paris gunmen might have slipped into Europe among refugees fleeing Syria's war, more Republicans voiced their opposition to the 10,000 Syrian refugees the White House wants to admit in the coming year.""Bringing people into this country from that area of the world I think is a huge mistake,"" Republican candidate Ben Carson said on the ""Fox News Sunday"" program, echoing comments by fellow Republican contenders on Saturday.While the U.S. number is a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of refugees that Europe is prepared to take, the plan has become a main point of attack for candidates seeking to show a tougher stance on terrorism.The deadliest attack in Europe in a decade could end up reshaping the race to elect a U.S. president in 2016.Clinton, a former secretary of state under President Barack Obama, told a debate on Saturday in Iowa that she supported raising the refugee intake to 65,000, but only with a careful screening and vetting process.Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for Obama, defended the administration's vetting process as thorough and made a humanitarian appeal.""We're also dealing with people who've suffered the horrors of war, women and children, orphans. We can't just shut our doors to those people,"" he said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""Earlier this month, the administration announced plans to accelerate the process for Syrian refugees hoping to enter the United States with new screening outposts in Iraq and Lebanon. More on the Syrian refugee screening processThe events in Paris have highlighted a double-edged foreign policy problem for Clinton. As America's top diplomat from 2009 to 2013, she has international experience none of her rivals can match but can also be called to account for failings on her watch.Clinton's Democratic and Republican opponents said the administration had misjudged the Middle East and underestimated Islamic State, the militant group that claimed credit for bomb and gun attacks that killed at least 132 people in Paris on Friday.Republican presidential candidate Senator Lindsey Graham said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that if he were elected, the United States would be ""part of a world-wide force to destroy ISIL,"" another acronym for Islamic State.""Hillary Clinton,"" he added ""seems to be disconnected from what you need to do. She won’t embrace boots on the ground.""VETTING UNDER SCRUTINYFlorida Senator Marco Rubio, another Republican candidate, said on ABC's ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos"" that just one vetting oversight could jeopardize public safety. ""You can have a thousand people come in and 999 of them are just poor people fleeing oppression and violence, but one of them is an ISIS fighter. ... If that's the case, you have a problem,"" Rubio said.Fellow Republican contenders, Ohio Governor John Kasich and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, have been open to accepting more refugees, but they echoed Rubio's concerns about vetting. ""We can't be in a position of inviting the enemy in, and frankly we better be careful about looking at Americans that have traveled"" in the region, Kasich said on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.""Bush said on ""Meet the Press"" the United States had a special responsibility to help Syrian Christians, who he said had no place in their homeland.Ahead of the first Democratic nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 1, Clinton has opened a commanding lead over main party challenger Bernie Sanders, who argues the invasion of Iraq, which Clinton supported in a U.S. Senate vote in 2003, led to the rise of al Qaeda and Islamic State.For more on the 2016 U.S. presidential race and to learn about the undecided voters who determine elections, visit the Reuters website.

"Nov. 14, 2015: Hillary Rodham Clinton shakes hands with Martin O'Malley after a Democratic presidential primary debate in Des Moines, Iowa. (AP)Hillary Clinton invoked the 9/11 terror attacks as she defended herself against complaints about her Wall Street donations during Saturday night’s debate, a response that drew bipartisan criticism.The former New York senator made the reference after Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders repeatedly criticized her for taking money from the financial sector and questioned whether she had the independence to overhaul the industry.“I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked,” Clinton pointed out. “Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York.”Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus slammed Clinton for the comments after the debate in Des Moines ended.“[I]n a new low, Hillary Clinton shamefully hid behind the 9/11 terrorist attacks in a bizarre attempt to deflect attention from her ties to her wealthy donors,” he said in a statement.The backlash also surfaced during the CBS-hosted debate itself. Shortly after Clinton made the remarks, the moderators cited social media reaction, including a tweet saying she had invoked 9/11 to justify Wall Street donations.“Well, I'm sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild,” Clinton said.Sanders acknowledged she was the senator from New York at the time and did help rebuild. But he also said Wall Street has too much power.Earlier, he suggested Clinton would not be able to overhaul the industry given its support for her.“Let's not be naive about it. Why …has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?” he said. “You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.”Even Clinton’s former campaign manager, Patti Solis Doyle, questioned the 9/11 reference following the debate.“I do think that the 9/11 reference was probably better used when she was talking about terrorism. She was the senator when the 9/11 attacks happened. She was the senator when we needed to rebuild that city. And it would have been more powerful talking about terrorism,” she said on CNN.          ",,"Hillary Clinton invoked the 9/11 terror attacks as she defended herself against complaints about her Wall Street donations during Saturday night’s debate, a response that drew bipartisan criticism.","Clinton invokes 9/11 in countering criticism of Wall St. donations, takes heat",http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/vdZmq3POxBM/,"['campaign_finance', 'foreign policy/national security']","['Martin O'Malley""""", 'Patti Solis Doyle', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Reince Priebus'," 'Bernie Sanders']""",fox,0.7299152360001901,[],2015-11-15 05:45:07,['Republican National Committee'],15a5a21203942c704b394e703f0091ce,2015-11-15 07:00:17.338498

" “We will not solve our nation’s problems … by returning to [the] polarizing figures of our past.”This was a not so veiled attack against Hillary Clinton from Martin O’Malley on Saturday night at the second Democratic debate. It was uttered on a night when her opponents were more direct in their criticism but still did not appear to lay a glove on her.  Indeed, O’Malley’s words are poignant, but ultimately won’t make much of a difference. Hillary Clinton is 19 points up nationally and Saturday night’s debate was another example of why she is so far in front.Just as in the first debate, Clinton showed the depth of her experience in politics over the last 30 years. She has the deepest understanding of the issues – particularly foreign policy having been secretary of state – and is a sharp, quick debater.None of the candidates were willing to say that we’re at war with radical Islam. Everyone was watching for this and it seemed that they erred on the side of political correctness. Clinton continued to show herself to be a commanding force on the stage. This isn’t to say that she didn’t have struggles.She tripped up during an answer about Wall Street where she countered that her work to aid the 9/11 recovery while a New York senator made her a crusader against Wall Street. And her vote for the Iraq war haunted her again. These are points the GOP will seize upon and showed flashes of weakness.Saturday debate began with a series of questions on terrorism and how America can combat ISIS, especially in light of the heinous attacks in Paris on Friday night. We knew this would happen, as it should. And each of the candidates emphasized how important American leadership is in the fight against terrorism, something I agree with wholeheartedly.It was no surprise that Clinton was the most hawkish of the three candidates on stage. She talked of using airpower, training and equipping forces in the region and pushes our allies – especially Turkey and the Gulf States – to make up their minds about how much they’re going to help in this effort. Sanders and O’Malley had good rhetoric on the issue, but were vague and non-specific. And we also heard again that climate change is creating terrorism from Sanders – a claim that the Republicans will surely seize on.It must be noted that Clinton was trying to distance herself from Obama's statement that ISIS needs to be ""contained"" by saying they need to be ""defeated."" That being said, she did not declare war on ISIS. She did not forthrightly speak of the singular and unique role the U.S. must play in providing leadership, and sought to deflect attention from Sanders' efforts to link her with the rise of ISIS because of her support of the Iraq war by blaming George Bush.In short, it was a good and effective job for a Democratic primary audience, but all three candidates were on the defensive for much of the first part of the debate over the Middle East and the War on Terror. This will probably be a manageable challenge in the Democratic primary, but will almost certainly be a more serious challenge during the general election campaign. We will have to watch how this unfolds closely.Furthermore, none of the candidates were willing to say that we’re at war with radical Islam. Everyone was watching for this and it seemed that they erred on the side of political correctness.Clinton had the best rationale for not using the term by defending it in terms of not offending our Muslim allies, but coming on the day after the Paris attacks, I’m sure this will be an issue.There was more antagonism on Saturday night than we’ve seen before. Sanders went after Clinton for her close ties to Wall Street and on gun control. And Clinton returned the favor.O’Malley got in on the action to tout how far he went as Maryland governor to raise wages, control gun violence and work to combat climate change. He certainly did better than he has before, but I don’t think he made a strong case for an O’Malley presidency. As Sanders pointed out, it’s not like Baltimore is doing too well right now. And he’s right.The most important thing that voters will have seen at the Iowa debate this week is that a Clinton and a Sanders presidency would be very different.Sanders believes two things are of paramount importance: income inequality and climate change. His plans could push taxes on the rich upwards of 80 percent-- in a light moment he joked about Dwight Eisenhower levying a 90% tax -- and he’d bring back Glass-Steagall and break up the banks. Sanders supports a $15 minimum wage and free college tuition. And he brought the conversation on health care back to the idea of single payer, a favorite of the progressive left.These are all areas where you can see differences with Clinton. She only supports a $12 federal minimum wage and said it should be up to states/cities to raise it above that (this is also what Senate Democrats support). She wouldn’t break up the banks or bring back Glass-Steagall while at the same time arguing that her proposals go the furthest in reining in the banks.On health care, Clinton wants to build on ObamaCare and improve it, especially by focusing on the issue of prescription drug costs.It’s also important to note that all the candidates were allied on immigration – each supports comprehensive immigration plan and a pathway to citizenship.Martin O’Malley was the only candidate to say how many Syrian refugees he’d take in (65,000), but they all argued that it’s our humanitarian duty to take in refugees. This will also be a sticking point after the Paris attacks.All this is to say that Saturday night’s event was a well-moderated debate and all the candidates did well.It’s just that Clinton did that much better. She’s the only one on stage who looked presidential. And I believe everyone could see that. Douglas E. Schoen has served as a pollster for President Bill Clinton.

"DES MOINES, Iowa U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton came under heavy criticism in a debate on Saturday for her 2003 vote backing the U.S. invasion of Iraq, with rival Bernie Sanders linking it to regional chaos that aided the rise of Islamic State militants.Sanders and rival Martin O'Malley took a more aggressive tone with Clinton than in their first debate last month, also accusing her of being too cozy with Wall Street and unwilling to stand up to corporate interests.The day after a series of bomb and gun attacks that killed at least 129 people in Paris, Sanders criticized Clinton's vote authorizing the Iraq invasion and said it was ""one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the modern history of the United States.”""I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, unraveled the region immensely, and led to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS,"" said Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont.""I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now,"" he said.Clinton, who has frequently called the vote a mistake, said it should be placed in the historical context of years of terrorism before the invasion.“If we’re ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extremists, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq,” she said.""This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.  It's become more complicated. And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in,"" she said.  The Iraq exchange came early in the second debate for Democrats seeking their party's nomination for the November 2016 presidential election, which focused on foreign policy and ways to combat terrorism after the Paris attacks.The candidates and audience at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, observed a moment of silence at the beginning of the debate to honor those killed in France.Clinton, the former secretary of state, has far more foreign policy experience than either Sanders or O'Malley. But she was forced on the defensive early in the debate about her years of leading President Barack Obama's foreign policy team.Clinton struck a sharp contrast to Obama's comments in an interview aired on Friday that ISIS had been contained. ""We have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network. It cannot be contained, it must be defeated,"" she said.Republican presidential contenders have criticized Obama for what they say was an inadequate response to the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In the aftermath of the attacks, businessman Donald Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz called on the administration to reconsider plans to allow thousands of Syrian refugees to be resettled in the United States.The White House aims to increase to 10,000 the number of Syrian refugees accepted in the United States during fiscal year 2016, from less than 2,000 accepted in the previous year.Clinton has always been from the more hawkish wing of the Democratic Party. Her support for the 2003 Iraq invasion played a major role in her primary loss to Obama in the 2008 White House race.The foreign policy focus was a dramatic shift in emphasis in a Democratic presidential race that so far has been dominated by domestic economic issues such as income inequality, college affordability and family leave.The Democrats returned to that theme later in the debate, and Sanders criticized Clinton for her opposition to reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act, the 1933 law that established a firewall between investment and commercial banking. Its removal has been blamed by some for helping lead to the 2008 financial crisis.""Over her political career, Wall Street has been a major, the major donor to Hillary Clinton. Now maybe they’re dumb, but I don’t think so,"" said Sanders, who favors reinstatement of the act.Clinton accused Sanders of impugning her integrity and said reinstating the law was not enough to rein in corporate influence and reform Wall Street.""Reinstating Glass-Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough,"" she said.
