"DES MOINES, Iowa U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton was criticized in a debate on Saturday for her 2003 vote backing the U.S. invasion of Iraq, with rival Bernie Sanders linking it to regional chaos that aided the rise of Islamic State militants.The day after a series of deadly bomb and gun attacks that killed at least 129 people in Paris, Sanders said the invasion was ""one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the modern history of the United States.”""I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, unraveled the region immensely, and led to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS,"" said Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont.""I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now,"" he said.Clinton, who has frequently called the vote a mistake, said it should be placed in the historical context of years of terrorism before the invasion.“If we’re ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extremists, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq,” she said.The exchange came early in the second debate for Democrats seeking their party's nomination for the November 2016 presidential election, with the focus shifted to foreign policy and ways to combat terrorism after the Paris attacks.The candidates and audience at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, observed a moment of silence at the beginning of the debate to honor those killed in France.Clinton, the former secretary of state, has far more foreign policy experience than either Sanders or her other rival, former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley. But she was forced on the defensive early in the debate about her years of leading President Barack Obama's foreign policy team.Clinton struck a sharp contrast to Obama's comments in an interview aired on Friday that ISIS had been contained.""We have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network. It cannot be contained, it must be defeated,"" she said.Republican presidential contenders have criticized Obama for what they say was an inadequate response to the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In the aftermath of the attacks, businessman Donald Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz called on the administration to reconsider plans to allow thousands of Syrian refugees to be resettled in the United States.The White House aims to increase to 10,000 the number of Syrian refugees accepted in the United States during fiscal year 2016, from less than 2,000 accepted in the previous year.Clinton has always been from the more hawkish wing of the Democratic Party. Her support for the 2003 Iraq invasion played a major role in her primary loss to Obama in the 2008 White House race.The foreign policy focus was a dramatic shift in emphasis in a Democratic presidential race that so far has been dominated by domestic economic issues such as income inequality, college affordability and family leave.The Democrats returned to that theme later in the debate, and Sanders criticized Clinton for being too cozy with Wall Street and not being in favor of reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act, the 1933 law that established a firewall between investment and commercial banking.""Over her political career, Wall Street has been a major, the major donor to Hillary Clinton. Now maybe they’re dumb, but I don’t think so,"" said Sanders, who favors reinstatement of the act.Clinton accused Sanders of impugning her integrity and said reinstating the law was not enough to rein in corporate influence and reform Wall Street.""Reinstating Glass-Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough,"" she said. ""I go after all of Wall Street, not just the big banks.""With the political clock ticking to the first nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 1, Clinton has opened a commanding lead over Sanders, her prime challenger, in national and Iowa polls. O'Malley trails well behind, in single digits in most polls.

"There is plenty of anger swirling around the 2016 presidential campaign. Anger at Washington, disdain for Wall Street, disgust with career politicians. Anger is all the rage, and both parties clearly have candidates that are successfully riding the wave. Neither Bernie Sanders nor Donald Trump would be where he is without the substantial number of fed-up voters in their parties. Everyone can see that. It's obvious.But loathing doesn't account for the differences we are witnessing between the GOP and Democratic Party nomination fights. Fear does. Or the absence of fear. Although both sides are angry, Republicans are more angry at the Republican Party leadership than they are afraid of Democrats, while Democrats are more afraid of Republicans than they are angry at the Democratic Party leadership. That's why Trump and Ben Carson, extreme outsiders, are dominating on the right while Hillary Rodham Clinton, the consummate insider, is dominating on the left.This relationship isn't new: The extent to which fear of the other side tempers anger at one's own often determines the nominee.In 2004, when I ran Howard Dean's campaign for president, Democrats were seething at the Democratic establishment, which had voted with the GOP to invade Iraq. But this anger over time gave way to a very real fear that Bush would win reelection.Bernie Sanders' success on the campaign trail does not defy explanation in quite the way that Donald Trump's does — Sanders has not dominated the polls, for one thing — but it's improbable all the same. He is a 74-year-old grandfather with thick glasses and frequently disheveled white hair. And...Bernie Sanders' success on the campaign trail does not defy explanation in quite the way that Donald Trump's does — Sanders has not dominated the polls, for one thing — but it's improbable all the same. He is a 74-year-old grandfather with thick glasses and frequently disheveled white hair. And...As fear of Bush's victory rose, voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, who had been attracted to Howard Dean's progressive politics and willingness to take on the party leadership, moved to John Kerry. Venting, they realized, wasn't as important as nominating someone with a better chance to win.This year, fear within the Democratic Party of a GOP win is off the charts. The GOP has majorities in the House of Representative and the U.S. Senate. For Democrats, losing the presidency in 2016 would be catastrophic. With control of both the executive and legislative branches of government, the GOP would be able to roll back all of the accomplishments of the Obama administration and fill any number of Supreme Court vacancies, guaranteeing a rightward shift in the makeup of the court for a generation.Bernie Sanders can tap into the very real anger at Wall Street and Washington all he wants, but he's not going anywhere; the party rank and file isn't going to risk the 2016 election by nominating an untested democratic socialist. Fear has a way of making voters put ideological purity aside and rally around the most tested, most viable general election candidate: Hillary Rodham Clinton.The fact that many Republicans are probably snickering at those last few sentences helps explain the starkly different race for the GOP nomination. There is a complete absence of fear within the GOP rank and file right now. Having won the House and the Senate, having taken over most state legislatures, the party feels as if the wind is at its back. Are they sick of Barack Obama? Absolutely. Are they sick of Clinton? Certainly. But they don't fear either one of them. They're convinced that the country could not possibly want another four years with a Democrat in the White House.Any fear they had of Clinton was erased by months of pundits proclaiming her collapse, her fumbling response to the private server scandal and Sanders' surprising popularity in early primary states. GOP primary voters' opinion of her was so low they happily bought into the idea of her vulnerability, and still do.It's the absence of fear that is driving Jeb Bush into the ground and holding Marco Rubio, John Kasich and others from gaining any real traction. Why compromise for someone who calls illegal immigration “an act of love,” or someone who once supported a path to citizenship, if there is no way you can lose? Why not go with the guy who wants to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants, then let the “good ones” back in?Of course, there's still time for the GOP to get scared straight. As Clinton's strengths become more obvious, and they will, fear within the GOP will rise. Republican primary voters could abandon Trump and Carson for Rubio, Kasich, Christie or even Bush — just as Democratic primary voters abandoned Dean for Kerry in 2004.The establishment candidates just have to hope that fear will overcome loathing sooner rather than later.Joe Trippi is a Democratic strategist and media consultant who ran Howard Dean's campaign for president and was a media advisor to Gov.

""Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is."" ""I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild,"" she continued.

Why do — why, over her political career has Wall Street been a major — the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton? You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.Here is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street. It ain't complicated. You have six financial institutions today that have assets of 56%, equivalent to 56% of the GDP In America. They issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages.If Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, were alive today, you know what he'd say? ""Break them up."" Reestablish Glass-Steagall. And Teddy Roosevelt is right. That is the issue. Now I am the only candidate up here that doesn't have a super PAC. I am not asking Wall Street or the billionaires for money. I will break up these banks. Support community banks and credit unions. That's the future of banking in America.DICKERSON: Great follow up because you — and Secretary Clinton, you will get a chance to respond. You said they know what they're going to get. What are they going to get?SANDERS: I have never heard a candidate never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me. I'm going to be independent. Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? they expect to get something. Everybody knows that. Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate. We are relying on small campaign donors, 750,000 of them, 30 bucks a piece. That's who I'm indebted to.CLINTON: Well, John, wait a minute. Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impune my integrity. Let's be frank here.SANDERS: No, I have not. CLINTON: Oh, wait a minute, senator. You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small. And I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60%So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked. Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.So, you know, it's fine for you to say what yo're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal. Reinstating Glass-Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough.

" Hillary Clinton talked tough and played defense Saturday at the second Democratic presidential debate, as rivals questioned her record and plans to fight the Islamic State.A day after a terrorist attack in Paris, terrorism and foreign policy took center stage in the two-hour debate with questions from the moderator and criticisms from rivals often focusing on her record as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first four years in office.Clinton remains the Democrats’ clear front-runner, but the debate illustrated how she will have to answer for administration policy on terrorism and foreign policy. Clinton last month broke with the White House, urging a no-fly zone in Syria and doing more to help rebels there. But she can’t shed her ties to the administration, and Republicans are hitting her hard on her role.The debate also showed how Clinton retains considerable advantages. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, can’t match her foreign policy experience or command of world politics. Perhaps most important, neither is drawing sharp distinctions with her on anti-terrorist policies.Highlights:The three opened with a moment of silence for the victims in Paris, then talked about their approach to the Islamic State terror group.“It cannot be contained. It must be defeated,” Clinton said, a slight jab at Obama who said just before the Paris attacks that ISIS had been contained.“But it cannot be an American fight,”she added. “This cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.”Her two rivals were more assertive about U.S. leadership.“I would disagree with Secretary Clinton,” said O’Malley. “This actually is America’s fight. It cannot solely be America’s fight. ... America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.“Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of ... ISIS,” said Sanders.Republicans complain that Democrats won’t use the words Muslim or Islam in describing terrorists.Saturday, the Democratic candidates appeared to rally to the term Jihadi or Jihadist, which derive from the word for a holy war by Muslims.Clinton Saturday referred to a “radical jihadist ideology.” “I don’t think we’re at war with Islam,” she added. “I don’t think we’re at war with all Muslims.”O’Malley used the term “radical jihadis,” but also warned against labeling terrorists with the broad term of Muslim, saying that would unfairly brand the majority of American Muslims who are needed to help fight back violent extremism.Said Sanders: “I don’t think the term is what’s important.”EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIMO’Malley proposed allowing 65,000 Syrian refugees into the country, more than the 10,000 proposed by Obama, though he said they need “proper screening.” Clinton also argued for a higher number, adding “I said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine.”EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIMHillary Clinton: “I don’t think we’re at war with Islam, I don’t think we’re at war with all Muslims.”Bernie Sanders: “I’m not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,” referring to the 91 percent top income tax rate in the 1950s.Martin O’Malley: “You will never heard this from that immigrant-bashing carnival barker Donald Trump”EDITORS: STORY CAN END HEREClintonClinton had to defend her years as secretary of state. Moderator John Dickerson asked if the Obama administration underestimated the Islamic State threat. Clinton didn’t answer at first, then tried to tie the current crisis to President George W. Bush’s decision to end American involvement in Iraq. Each time she was challenged, Clinton would launch into detailed histories of the region’s turmoil and American involvement. Backers will praise her command of detail; opponents will contend she’s avoiding responsibility for being part of a team that didn’t take the Islamic threat seriously enough.Sanders He got off to a rocky start. He only briefly touched on the Paris terrorist attacks in his opening remarks before turning to his standard speech assailing income inequality and the corrosive nature of money in politics. Viewers then watched as Clinton and O’Malley devoted their entire opening statement to the attacks. Viewers may also have been puzzled when Sanders said that climate change is the country’s greatest threat and a contributor to the spread of terrorism. He also failed to gain traction out of his criticism that Clinton had voted for the Iraq War that he opposed.O’Malley O’Malley, who has languished in single digits in the polls, performed ably, holding his own with the former Secretary of State and U.S. senator on foreign and domestic policy, including health care and taxes. How would he pay for his policies? He explained. Can a former governor lead the U.S. in a time of global terror? Yes, he said. But he needed a breakthrough performance to attract new attention and enthusiasm to his campaign and his performance fell short.EDITORS: STORY CAN END HEREWall Street. The term came up often, as Sanders and O’Malley challenged Clinton over her ties to the financial industry. Clinton had a different take on those ties, recalling how, as a U.S. senator from New York, she fought to help rebuild a part of the city devastated by terrorist attacks.",,"Not ‘at war with all Muslims,’ Clinton saysSanders, O’Malley challenge Clinton views on Islamic StateClinton front-runner status likely to continue…Click to Continue »",Clinton on the defensive as debate turns to terrorism,http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article44966964.html,['foreign policy/national security'],"[u""Martin O'Malley"", 'John Dickerson', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Donald Trump', 'George W.

"Democratic U.S. presidential candidates Senator Bernie Sanders (L), former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley pose on stage ahead of the second official 2016 U.S. Democratic presidential candidates debate in Des Moines, Iowa, November 14, 2015.   (REUTERS/Jim Young)Hillary Clinton was put on the defensive at the opening of Saturday night’s Democratic presidential debate over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability.The debate in Des Moines, Iowa, came in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which thrust the issues of national security and foreign policy back to the center of the 2016 campaign. The debate format was changed to focus anew on those issues.But, citing the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa, Clinton’s rivals criticized her Senate vote for use of force before the Iraq war and appeared to criticize her support for toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley said America’s role is not to roam the world “looking for new dictators to topple.”He said it is also important to understand “secondary and third consequences” that come after removing a “single dictator.” O’Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a “mess.”Clinton defended her support for toppling Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a “genocide” and America’s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support.She also said “it is imperative” that the U.S. do more to confront the “arc of instability” in the region. And to O’Malley’s critique, she said, “I don’t think you can paint with a broad brush,” and “This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.”Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, referenced Clinton’s support for use of force in Iraq and said the “disastrous invasion” led “to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.”Clinton again called her Iraq war vote a “mistake,” but disputed that the war is the only driver of modern terrorism.The candidates also condemned the Paris terror attacks.“Our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough,” Clinton said.She called for global “resolve” to “root out” the “radical jihadist ideology” that motivates groups like the Islamic State. Clinton, a former secretary of state, said she would coordinate efforts “against the scourge of terrorism.”“It cannot be contained. It must be defeated,” she said of ISIS.Sanders blasted ISIS as a “barbarous organization.”O’Malley called this the “new face” of terror threats.The attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said. In a primary race otherwise dominated by the economy, climate and front-runner Clinton’s personal record, the debate in Des Moines, Iowa, now is expected to focus heavily on security and foreign policy after debate host CBS News reworked the format.  It is an area where Clinton, as former secretary of state, enters with the thickest resume – but also one that could prove problematic, given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable and chaotic nations like Libya and Syria.Sanders, after appearing to give her a pass at the first debate over her personal email controversy, has in recent weeks shown a greater interest in criticizing her record. But his focus on issues like income inequality could be out of place in a discussion focused on global security challenges. Sanders’ campaign objected to some of the CBS News debate tweaks, sources said.Clinton also enters this debate – hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register – facing a narrower field than at their first encounter in October. Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O’Malley.Clinton is seen to have otherwise strengthened her hand since that debate, making it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and seeing one of her biggest potential political threats – a late bid by Vice President Biden – disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.Sanders remains Clinton’s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.Still, the FBI investigation over Clinton’s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding. ",,,DEMOCRATIC DEBATE  2016 candidates condemn Paris attacks at opening,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/14/democratic-2016-candidates-face-off-for-2nd-debate/,['foreign policy/national security'],"['Bernie Sanders', 'Muammar Qaddafi', 'Hillary Clinton', u""Martin O'Malley"", 'Jim Young']",fox,0.9318134445268402,[],2015-11-15 02:32:43,"['Senate', 'Al Qaeda', 'FBI']",1e6c60a4b3334c751ae09ef925cc938d,2015-11-15 03:00:05.529453
"Donald Trump has dramatically escalated his attacks on his nearest rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Ben Carson. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll may explain why: the billionaire real estate magnate is bleeding support among avid church-goers and women to the retired neurosurgeon. While the unconstrained Trump has a comfortable double-digit lead over the soft-spoken Carson, the data points to a possible emerging threat to Trump's hopes of capturing the party's nomination for the November 2016 election. The poll of likely Republican primary voters also shows that Carson is drawing strong support from the rural Midwest, including Iowa, which holds the first Republican nominating contest on Feb. 1. Trump, in contrast, is drawing strong support in the northeast and southeast.That geographical divide is significant, analysts said, because Carson's dominance in more socially conservative states like Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska reflects how his story of personal redemption is resonating strongly with evangelical voters. They traditionally play an outsize role not just in the first nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 1, but in Nevada and South Carolina, which also hold nominating votes in February.""If Carson keeps his nose clean he could win those states and could catch lightning in a bottle,"" said Ford O'Connell, a Republican strategist not affiliated with either campaign.Trump, who has topped national polls of likely Republican primary voters for months, has until now enjoyed strong support among the key constituency of low-income, blue-collar, church-going voters, who have been attracted by his image as a straight-talking political outsider.But Carson's similar appeal as an outsider taking on the Republican establishment has undercut Trump's support in recent weeks, and Carson has surged to the top of a few recent national polls.Carson's growing support with women and blue collar voters may explain Trump's recent attacks on his rival, said O'Connell. Trump has highlighted media reports questioning elements of Carson's personal story, and on Thursday he called Carson ""pathological"" and likened him to a child molester.""OUTSIDER VOTE""""Trump is desperate to consolidate the 'outsider' vote. The blue collar vote is very, very key to Trump's success in that. He has tried everything to shake Carson off and it hasn't worked, so he has decided to go nuclear,"" said O'Connell, an advisor to Republican Senator John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign.To be sure, a separate rolling five-day Reuters/Ipsos poll shows Trump surging to 42 percent of likely Republican primary voters, up from 25 percent, since Nov. 6 while Carson was flat at 23 percent.The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the polling data. Barry Bennett, Carson’s campaign manager, said of Trump's heightened criticism of Carson: “It’s hard to explain his remarks but clearly he’s feeling some pressure and overreacting.”Bridget Miller, 43, from Stilwell, Kansas, said she had initially considered voting for Trump, but had switched to Carson. ""Carson is pro-life; he's pro-gun; he's saved baby's lives. He speaks to a lot of our values here,"" she said.Other likely Republican primary voters say they initially supported Trump but his latest criticism of Carson and his ""child molester"" comments only confirmed their belief that he is unsuited to the presidency.Janis Anderson, 54, from Fargo, North Dakota, said she had considered Donald Trump, but his latest comments about Carson were “ridiculous.”Trump still either leads or shares the lead among most geographical and demographic groups, including wealthy and middle-income voters, people with and without college degrees, the southeast, northeast, the Upper Midwest and the American West.But the story is different among lower-paid workers. In September, Carson had just over 14 percent of support among voters in households with an annual income of $50,000 or less, according to the broader Reuters/Ipsos data. By the end of October, that had jumped to over 23 percent support. Trump's support in the same group was flat at around 33 percent.Among likely female Republican primary voters, Carson has seen his support jump since September from about 19 to 27 percent - the highest of any Republican candidate - while Trump's has slipped from 30 percent to 25.Carson's support among regular churchgoers has also risen sharply, according to the Reuters/Ipsos survey, jumping 10 points between September and November to 32 percent, the highest of any Republican candidate. Trump's support with religious voters has slipped from 26 percent to 22 percent.""As the campaign has evolved over time, Trump has begun to wear a little bit thin, especially voters who want a softer, more gentlemanly approach to politics,"" said David Gergen, an adviser to four former U.S. presidents from both parties.

" (CNN)CNN Opinion asked a range of contributors for their take on the second Democratic presidential debate held at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. Who were the winner and loser? The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors.This debate was more difficult for Hillary Clinton than was expected. Though she had opportunities to highlight her extensive experience and leadership skills, she was still thrown on the defense in two pivotal areas. On foreign policy, in the aftermath of Paris, she was forced to defend the record of the Obama administration in Syria and saw how this issue -- foreign policy -- could be turned against her. This, more than the vote in Iraq, will be a challenge.Domestic policy also remained a concern as Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley hit harder in her ties to Wall Street and more centrist views on some economic issues. Clinton still exits from the debate as the most formidable candidate in the group and the one best positioned to defeat the GOP. O'Malley continues to struggle gaining any traction and Sanders still seems too left for the party.But the debate was a warning. It brought out some of the questions that Clinton will face in the coming months. In the coming weeks, she will need to provide stronger answers if she wants a smooth victory in the primaries and the general election. Winner: No clear winner.Loser: Martin O'Malley. Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of ""The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society"" and co-editor of a new book, ""Medicare and Medicaid at 50: America's Entitlement Programs in the Age of Affordable Care."" The good news for Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley was that they shared a victory in this debate by criticizing Hillary Clinton directly and to her face, pushing back against the notion that Clinton's nomination is inevitable. Not if Sanders and O'Malley have anything to say about it.When asked about the role of Wall Street, Sanders, who has criticized the influence of big-money donors in American politics, said Clinton's many backers from financial corporations are seeking to curry favor with her.""Maybe they're dumb, and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so,"" Sanders said of Clinton's Wall Street donors. ""Why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something, everybody knows it.""Clinton, clearly stung by the statement, pointed out that Sanders ""has basically used his answer to impugn my integrity."" At issue was a call by Sanders and O'Malley to tighten regulatory controls over banking institutions by reviving elements of the now-defunct Glass-Steagall Act.  Clinton dismissed her critics: ""My proposal is tougher, more comprehensive and more effective,"" she said. But O'Malley called her ideas ""weak tea"" and the cheers Sanders got by taking her on suggest a sizable portion of Democrats want the next president to control Wall Street rather than the other way around. The Sanders-O'Malley duo also scored points by pushing for a $15 minimum wage, considerably higher than the $12 Clinton advocates. The recent nationwide strikes and demonstrations in favor of a $15 minimum wage -- which translates into an annual full-time salary of $31,000 -- show that Sanders and O'Malley are riding a powerful grassroots wave. If Clinton sticks to her $12 proposal, she should expect more verbal slugfests with her opponents -- and a Democratic base that may jump off the Clinton bandwagon if she doesn't move in a more liberal direction.Errol Louis is the host of ""Inside City Hall,"" a nightly political show on NY1, a New York all-news channel. A day after ISIS terrorized Paris in multiple coordinated attacks with guns and suicide bombs, killing over 100 and injuring hundreds more, Democrat frontrunner Hillary Clinton left doubts she's up to the task to protect America. In opening questions on foreign policy during the CBS-moderated debate, Clinton danced around her lack of accomplishments as secretary of state under President Barack Obama. When asked about Obama's Syria policy, Clinton said she disagreed with Obama's strategy from the start and warned him if the United States didn't intervene in Syria, our enemies would fill the void.  Clinton said the ""Middle East is a complicated region"" and ""the arch of instability."" Americans don't vote for a president to tell them what they already know. Clinton's textbook responses to foreign policy questions were rote. More disturbing was she couldn't point to any accomplishments as secretary of state other than advising Obama on Osama bin Laden's capture. Libya, Syria, Egypt and Russia all fell apart under her tenure. If elected president, Clinton didn't convince voters she would do anything differently or make America safer, which brings us to terrorism.When asked if she would declare war against Islam like President Francois Hollande has, Clinton replied no. ""We're not at war with Islam. We're not at war with Muslims.""  Yet, that's just the problem. Islam is at war with America and the world and we need a president who will finally acknowledges this, not one who shrinks from this challenge. Obama hasn't. In an interview with ""Good Morning America"" that aired the day of the Paris attack, Obama said ISIS had been contained.Over the last four years since the civil war unraveled in Syria, ISIS has taken root there, training Muslims from around the world to be jihadists. France has a large population of Muslim nationals, many of whom have freely entered the country. America, like Germany and France, have welcomed thousands of Syrian refugees. It won't be long before what happened in Paris makes it's way to our homeland. During the second Democrat debate, Hillary Clinton revealed her biggest strength may be her biggest weakness -- her foreign policy experience.Crystal Wright is a conservative writer who runs the blog ConservativeBlackChick.com. She also is a principal at the Baker Wright Group, a communications and public relations firm. You can follow her @GOPBlackChick.On a very tough night to talk politics, it seemed all three candidates were a little off their game.Hillary Clinton was well-positioned coming in to look tough -- and presidential -- on terrorism. But she didn't anticipate Martin O'Malley lurching to her right. ""It is America's fight,"" he corrected her, ""but not solely America's fight."" With Bernie Sanders attacking from the left, she was suddenly stuck in the middle, playing defense. On the discussion regarding banks and campaign finance, however, Sanders should have had the natural upper hand, but he couldn't land a punch. Clinton won the issue in the room. Sanders also might be the first Democrat to acknowledge raising the minimum wage will have some negative repercussions, which I think will come back to haunt him.O'Malley had some blunders as well. He floated a frightening 70% tax rate on the wealthy, unprompted. He walked into a critique from Sanders on the safety of Baltimore, the city he ran as mayor. All told, they each had some unexpected highlights and some surprising misses. When Clinton loses on foreign policy but wins on the banks, you know it's a weird night.S.E. Cupp is the author of ""Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media's Attack on Christianity,"" co-author of ""Why Yo're Wrong About the Right"" and a columnist at the New York Daily News.  Two moments in tonight's debate clarified why Bernie Sanders won't assume the role of frontrunner any time soon.  In the first, Sanders reiterated his noble, but politically disastrous, appeal that we all stop talking about Hillary Clinton's (damn) emails.  It's the high road, for sure.  But by extricating her from a scandal that had bedeviled her campaign for months, Sanders has ceded the space needed for Clinton to take flight.The second moment illustrates the difficulty Sanders has faced in winning over African Americans.  When asked about Black Lives Matter, Sanders rattled off a bunch of standard statistics about incarceration and unemployment rates. Clinton, by contrast, acknowledged the profound pain that black mothers feel when they lose their children to violence, and she then paid tribute -- by name -- to some of the young men who have lost their lives to police violence.Winner: Hillary Clinton. She came across as shrewd, measured, and worldly.  Nothing about the debate tonight changed the fundamental dynamics of this race. Most improved: Martin O'Malley.  He spoke fluidly and forcefully about all manner of issues. He made a showing tonight; it just won't make much of a difference.Lastly, a note on format.  With just a handful of Democratic contenders left in the race for president, the conversation in tonight's debate sank reasonably deep into policy details. The kinds of zingers and gaffes that separate winners from losers on a stage of ten just don't count for nearly as much on a stage of three.  May the Republicans take notice and winnow their ranks soon.William Howell is the Sydney Stein professor in American politics at the University of Chicago. Once again, Democrats proved that they are the adults in this race by having a civilized, high-minded and respectful debate about the important issues facing our country.  They also demonstrated they are all better equipped to lead the nation going into the 21st century as we face unprecedented threats from abroad and an economy that needs continued Democratic leadership to fully recover and give middle class voters all the tools they need to succeed.There were fireworks as both Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley tried to take the fight to Hillary Clinton, specifically on her Iraq vote and her connections to Wall Street.  She swatted away the criticisms with ease, with facts, and demonstrated she is best suited to lead the country as president and commander in chief. On foreign policy, her knowledge of the issues, her grasp of the nuances involved in global diplomacy and her determination to implement unparalleled American leadership to defeat ISIS and radical extremist jihadists in the Middle East, put her head and shoulders above the rest, both in the Democratic field as well as all Republicans vying for the presidency. On economic and domestic issues, Clinton underscored differences with Sanders and O'Malley, again showing important nuances on positions such as the minimum wage, college affordability and gun control, showing her grasp of details and the ""weeds"" of these complex issues.  She showed her policies would put middle class families first while ensuring our economy can absorb them without disruption. O'Malley had a great debate, showing his passionate progressive positions, at times taking the critique to both of his opponents, but mostly agreeing with them on key issues.  While his resume is impressive and he has many accomplishments to show as Maryland governor, unfortunately, he was not able to have a sufficient breakout moment that will enable him to climb out of the single digits in the polls. Sanders continued to show his passionate commitment to liberal positions, focusing on climate change and income inequality, both of which are tremendously important to the progressive base.  But his knowledge of foreign policy and issues going on in the Middle East came up wanting and did not inspire broad-based trust needed to be elected as commander In chief.As an issue that is front and center, immigration brought out the best in all of the Democratic candidates -- an easy feat given the contrast with the ridiculous, unworkable, unjust and unelectable positions that are held by most Republicans. Importantly, Clinton was the first one to contrast all the Democrats with the Republicans and was the only one to defend President Obama's record.  A brilliant and important move to excite and mobilize the Democratic base.Overall, Clinton outshined her Democratic opponents, showing her proposals would pay for the opportunities and the level playing field that would help create more good paying jobs and expand economic growth for those who have been left behind.  And both Sanders and O'Malley took a definitive back seat to Clinton when it came to foreign policy, defense of the homeland and what it takes to confront the challenges we face, tragically demonstrated by last night's Paris attacks.

"GREENVILLE, S.C.–Sen. Ted Cruz brought his presidential campaign to an evangelical bastion here Saturday, travelling to a Christian college to hold a religious liberty rally that was shadowed by anxiety about the terrorist attacks in Paris.Mr. Cruz opened the rally at Bob Jones University with a moment of silence for the victims of the attacks and called for a decisive response to the Islamic militants who claimed responsibility.“This is an evil that will not quietly slip away,” Mr. Cruz said in his opening prayer. “We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism. This evil will no longer walk the face of the earth.”The focus of the rally, however, was the threat to religious freedom that many conservatives see in the U.S., an issue that is central to the Cruz campaign effort to win over evangelical voters. He is reaching out to people who believe their right to act on their religious beliefs is threatened by government actions supporting such social changes as the legalization of gay marriage and limits on public religious worship.At the rally, similar one Mr. Cruz held in Iowa in August, he shared the stage with Christians who think their religious rights were violated, such as Joe Kennedy– a high school football coach in Washington state who was placed on leave recently for kneeling in silent prayer on the field after games.“What kind of country have we become when kneeling in prayer is regarded as an act of civil disobedience,” Mr. Cruzsaid. “These threats are real and they are growing each and every day.”Mr. Cruz’s staff estimated that 2,500 people attended the rally at Bob Jones, a college that has a stirred controversy in the past for its treatment of blacks and gays. The school’s ban on interracial dating sparked criticism of George W. Bush when he campaigned here during the 2000 presidential campaign. That ban subsequently ended, and the college is reemerging as a destination for GOP presidential candidates seeking evangelical support.One of Mr. Cruz’s leading rivals for support of evangelical voters, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, appeared on the campus Friday for a town hall meeting with South Carolina GOP Sen. Tim Scott.The two presidential candidates provided the community with a study in contrast: Mr. Cruz gave a fiery, emotional speech that filled an auditorium; Mr. Carson was more measured and low key.For some in the audience, the violence in Paris led them to focus more acutely on the candidates’ ability to lead in a world crisis and prosecute a war on terrorism. For Janessa Fortner, a Greenville Republican who is inclined to support businessman Donald Trump, those developments raised new reservations in her mind about the low key Mr. Carson.“He’s not going to strike fear in ISIS,” Mrs. Fortner said. “Who would you want handling what happened last night?’’______________________________________________________2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll StandingsPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.

"Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, a New America fellow and author of ""The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN)Until now, Donald Trump has defied all the expectations. Most of the political experts predicted he would be one of the media-fueled candidates who have emerged in last few primary seasons, propped up by intense coverage and then deflated when reporters turned their attention to another candidate. The Donald has proven to be a much more durable candidate than they expected, maintaining a strong position in national polls as well as in local polling in key primary states such as New Hampshire. He has demonstrated tremendous savvy in keeping the media's attention for a sustained period of time, which is not a total surprise given his deep experience on ""The Apprentice"" as well as the dynamics of what I have called the click-bait primary, where incendiary statements are more likely to win attention than to receive widespread rebuke. But the Republican campaign is starting to enter a new phase where there are a number of questions about how Trump will fare. Now that the early phase of the competition will soon wind down -- a free-for-all primarily revolving around televised debates -- Trump will have to prove his chops if he is to win in Iowa, New Hampshire and the primaries that follow. The most pertinent question has to do with grass-roots organization. In less than three months, the voting will actually begin. When it comes to the caucuses and primaries, old-fashioned retail politics still matters. As Barack Obama proved in 2008, the winner of these contests needs to put together a formidable grass-roots organization to mobilize and bring out the vote.In a few states like Iowa, Trump's campaign has given indications that it understand this. It has brought on some talented figures and started to put together a campaign. In Iowa, Trump scored a success by hiring Chuck Laudner, the grass-roots campaign operative who put together Rick Santorum's surprise victory there in 2012, to handle his operations. But it is not yet clear whether Trump is willing to devote the money or can devote the kind of day-to-day appearances that the campaign will require, and how well-organized his strategic voter mobilization plan will be. Tim Fernholz reported, for instance, that Trump had not even purchased some of the basic voter information databases that are prerequisites for victory. Trump has made a point of saying he is self-funding his campaign, trying to draw a contrast with his rivals. While it is true he used some of his money, donations are still funding a lot of his campaign, and it's not clear how much of his fortune he is willing to commit to this effort, particularly if his odds of winning start to diminish.  Soon Trump will also have to contend with an actual establishment candidate. The leaders of the Republican Party are starting to coalesce around a main candidate, very likely Sen. Marco Rubio. Trump has thrived in part because the GOP did not yet have a central candidate upon whom to shower its resources and energy. The divisions and uncertainty that have resulted from Jeb Bush's poor run have opened up room in the campaign for some of the ""outsiders"" who have gained support. If party leaders settle on Rubio, or Bush somehow engineers a miraculous comeback, the pressure against outsiders such as Trump will intensify. The party leaders will do much more, through their candidate, to unload blistering political and personal attacks on opponents within the party. Most recently, The Wall Street Journal, a scion of the Republican establishment, published a scathing editorial about how little Trump seemed to know about what was in the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal.  When Trump responded by calling the editors ""dummies"" through a tweet, the paper stood by its comments. If Trump is able to transition to the next phase with his standing in the polls intact, the media still have a lot of exposing to do. Everyone who has followed him since he made a splash on the national scene in 1980s New York as a ""greed is good"" real estate mogul knows there is a long record to explore.Despite all the attention he has received thus far, the scrutiny has been relatively contained. Ironically, the fame with which he entered into the contest has diminished the incentive of some reporters to dig more deeply into his life. It is a contrast with candidates such as Ben Carson about whom the media didn't really know much. That made reporters more curious to figure it out. With Trump, and the assumption we know everything there is about him, there has not been as much investigation as we might expect. But if he remains a serious candidate, more scrutiny will focus on his failed business ventures and his rocky marriages. There are a number of important issues that have barely made it onto the radar. For example, a handful of reports have surfaced on how little Trump has given to charity over the years, a measure for the values of a wealthy person who has not been in public service, and the ways in which he has greatly exaggerated and misconstrued the money that he has donated.The Associated Press produced a scathing report in August showing how he has overstated his contributions, how they are small compared with others of his income status, and that they advance his personal interests. This record would not sit well with some voters, who are seeking a populist voice, especially from a billionaire candidate who is now insisting that the wages of workers are too high. His recent attacks on Carson, such as comparing what he called the neurosurgeon's ""pathological temper"" to the sickness of a ""child molester"" have offered a reminder as to just how nasty the thin-skinned businessman can become against his opponents.There are also questions about Trump himself. Thus far he has clearly enjoyed the ride. Yet it is not evident how he will feel as the campaign slog really gets going, with the brutal hours that it requires, and if he starts to fall from his plateau. It is not clear how passionate Trump is about the job and the kind of commitment winning a presidential race requires. He has already made some comments about his willingness to quit if he is not doing well. In October, he told ""Meet the Press"": ""I'm not a masochist. And if I was dropping in the polls, where I saw that I wasn't going to win, why would I continue?"" He gives off a different sentiment than some of the other candidates, such as Rubio, who are clearly willing to invest everything they have for as long as they are still viable. For those who have always doubted whether this is about promoting his brand name as opposed to promoting a vision for the White House, there are doubts about whether he might just be willing to fire himself if this process turned unpleasant. The brutal terrorist attacks in Paris this weekend are also a stark reminder of the immense security challenges that the United States and the world faces. These are serious times that call for extraordinary leaders. In this context, Trump's yelling and insults, combined with questions about whether he would really be up for this job, are likely to become bigger liabilities among voters.It is clear Trump has the potential to survive over the long run, and the state of the Republican Party might give him room to make it much further than anyone suspected.

"An unsettling yet telling split-screen changed the view of the presidential campaign Saturday night: three Democratic candidates who had come to Iowa to talk about domestic issues found their debate hijacked by a foreign policy crisis dominating the news from a world away.As metaphors for the last two presidencies go, the turnabout was apt: Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama came into office with domestic issues prime on their minds, only to have conflicts abroad hobble and frustrate their tenures.Foreign policy, and specifically her vote for the Iraq War, also frustrated Hillary Rodham Clinton in her unsuccessful run for president in 2008. Not even an ad that year asserting that she was most experienced to take the 3 a.m. crisis call—the implication being that Obama wasn’t—was enough to overcome Democrats' embrace of his early opposition to the war.As much as anything, Saturday night's debate in the shocked aftermath of the Paris terrorist attack offered Clinton an opportunity to argue anew that her experience is necessary—and her opponents' is insufficient--for any 3 a.m. call. That allowed her to eclipse her rivals on stage, although in doing so, she may have created vulnerabilities a Republican could exploit next fall.As a former senator and secretary of State, Clinton spoke with fluency about the contradictory puzzle and complicated players in the Middle East, and the tensions there that already have spilled into violence on the European continent. She recounted her experience helping downtown New York recover from the Sept. 11, 2001, attack (weirdly, however, it was in response to a criticism of her closeness with Wall Street donors).Seeking to shake up the Democratic race and loosen Hillary Rodham Clinton's front-runner status, rivals Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley repeatedly challenged the former secretary of State on Saturday night in a debate where they largely agreed on most issues.The session at Drake University...Seeking to shake up the Democratic race and loosen Hillary Rodham Clinton's front-runner status, rivals Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley repeatedly challenged the former secretary of State on Saturday night in a debate where they largely agreed on most issues.The session at Drake University...When asked to recount a crisis that had tested her, she dramatically retold the story of advising President Obama to go after Osama bin Laden in 2011 despite concerns by many in the administration that the mission could fail. And, she noted, she offered the advice without consulting anyone, even her husband, former President Bill Clinton.It was that question, more than any other, that demonstrated Clinton’s advantage once the focus turned to foreign policy. By contrast, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley recounted the daily tribulations of a mayor and state executive, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told of a veterans' bill, one in which he was not successful in achieving his initial goal and had to negotiate a compromise.Indeed, discomfort on the part of Sanders and O'Malley was palpable from the start. After a moment of silence for the victims in Paris, the candidates moved to opening statements. Speaking before Clinton, Sanders jumped quickly into his familiar arguments about a ""rigged economy,"" a ""corrupt campaign finance system"" and the need for millions of Americans to stand and say that ""enough is enough.""Speaking after Clinton, O’Malley averred that the Paris attacks showed the need for ""new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership."" But he did not offer any of the first two, and on the third, his mention that he worried about terrorism as a governor only underscored his lack of front-line international experience.Clinton went right to the point.""We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, the barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist, terrorist group,"" she said, adding pointedly: ""This election is not only about electing a president. It's also about choosing our next commander in chief.""Clinton did not offer many operational details, apart from working with American allies on a united anti-jihadist front. But neither did her opponents.The Democratic frontrunner undoubtedly would have received a rougher going-over had the debate been against a Republican free to oppose her actions as secretary of State from a perspective 180 degrees opposite hers (and all of the GOP candidates' views are.) Her weakest moment came in a muddled response to an obvious question about President Obama's failure—and hers--to anticipate the powerful rise of the Islamic State militants. That's a point Republicans are sure to hammer.Clinton seemed intent on carefully navigating her party's shoals. She mildly distanced herself from Obama’s ill-timed assertion—delivered just before the Paris attack—that the Islamic State was contained. ""It cannot be contained, it must be defeated,"" she said.But she immediately moved to calm the left: ""What the president has consistently said--which I agree with--is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS,"" she said, citing the U.S. forces training Arab and Kurdish militaries. ""But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential."" She mentioned the limits of American involvement twice.The Democratic counter to Clinton was far more difficult to make, giving the debate performances of Sanders and O'Malley the feel of a collection of pulled punches.Sanders has ridden a wave of support from the party's liberal left. Flaying Clinton for being insufficiently aggressive against the Islamic State and other terrorist groups would have inevitably risked a collision with the anti-interventionist views of his supporters, which by all evidence the senator ardently shares. O'Malley, with no clear path to the nomination besides his generational pitch, was effectively in the same fix.Neither candidate, for example, explicitly hit Clinton on one of the most significant events of her tenure as secretary of State, the loss of four Americans at the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya. Republicans have argued that attack would have been prevented by a more aggressive posture.The irony of terrorism and foreign policy overtaking a Democratic debate is that the party's candidates have largely avoided the subject this election cycle.Republicans have brawled over the level of aggression each would apply in the Mideast, with several candidates advocating no-fly zones that would put the country's military in direct conflict with Russian planes operating over Syria. Several also have advocated a sharp rise in American troops overseas.But for Democrats, the subject has been far more fraught. Obama came to office in the aftermath of Bush's intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan and vowed to disentangle America from both fights. He has since disappointed some of his followers by announcing that he would keep at least 5,500 troops in Afghanistan beyond the previously announced 2016 withdrawal. He also said recently that he would send special operations troops to Syria to assist rebels there --language that uncomfortably echoes the beginning of involvements in past military theaters.So for the Democratic candidates there had been no real primary season rationale for a focus on foreign policy. The first Democratic debate stuck to the candidates' nuanced differences on issues like economic policy, healthcare and criminal justice, and their agreements on matters such as changing immigration policy and raising the minimum wage.Then Paris exploded in violence.Whether terrorism will remain at the forefront of the campaign is impossible to predict, given that nearly a year remains before the election. But if it happens, more detail will be required from both the Democrats and Republicans seeking the White House.Ironically, as the candidates spoke to a country shaken by the Paris attack and wondering if it could happen here, one question was left unasked Saturday night: If France couldn't find a handful of terrorists in a country of 66 million people, how would the next president find them in a country of 320 million?cathleen.decker@latimes.comFor political news and analysis, follow me on Twitter: @cathleendecker .

"Republican presidential candidates have criticized Democratic White House hopeful Hillary Clinton for decliningÂ to use term such as âradical Islam” and “Islamic terrorism”Â to describe the extremists who have unleashed a string of terrorist attacks on Western targets recently.Asked at the second Democratic debate on Saturday night whether the U.S. was âat war with radical Islam,â Ms. Clinton drew a distinction between the worldâs 1.6 billion Muslims and those who commit acts of violent extremism.âI donât think weâre at war with Islam. I donât think weâre at war with all Muslims,â she said. âI think weâre at war with jihadists. We are at war with violent extremism. We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression, and yes, we are at war with those people, but I donât want us to be painting with too broad a brush.âShe recounted admiringly former president George W. Bushâs call forÂ tolerance in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.âIslam is peace,â Mr. Bush said in a speech at the Islamic Center of Washington, D.C. the week after the attacks.Mrs. Clinton’sÂ answer prompted reproach from Republicans who insisted she use the phrase, âradical Islam.âFormer Arkansas governor and Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee on Twitter mocked Democrats, writing âSay it with me: âIslamic Terrorism.ââ Carly Fiorina wrote on Twitter that unlike Hillary Clinton, she would use the phrase âIslamic terrorism.âYou’re all grown up now. You can do it. Three words. Ten syllables. Say it with me: “Radical Islamic terrorism.” #DemDebateâ Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) November 15, 2015We need a President who will see and speak and act on the truth…Hillary Clinton will not call this Islamic terrorism. I will.â Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) November 15, 2015On Sunday morning, Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who has put an aggressive foreign policy at the center of his presidential campaign, called the fight against terrorism âa clash of civilizationsâ and said he was baffled by Ms. Clintonâs reluctance to use the term âradical Islam.ââI donât understand it. That would be like saying we werenât at war with Nazis, because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but werenât violent themselves,â he said. âWe are at war with radical Islam, with an interpretation of Islam by a significant number of people around the world, who they believe now justifies them in killing those who donât agree with their ideology.âAnd on CNN on Sunday morning, Former Florida governor and Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said, âI know what Islamic terrorism is. This is not a question of religion. This is a political ideology that has co-opted a religion. And I think it’s more than acceptable just to call it for what it is and then organize an effort to destroy it.âHe also described the fight against terrorism as âa fight for Western civilization.âAbout 1% of the U.S. population are Muslims, according to the Pew Research Center.Â About 26% are evangelical Protestants, a group who hold considerably influence among the GOP primary electorate in the early nominating states of Iowa and South Carolina.______________________________________________________2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll StandingsPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.

"A women takes a photo while standing on the stage for Saturday night's Democratic presidential debate between Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt,, Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, Friday, Nov. 13, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)The Democratic presidential candidates faced off for their second debate Saturday night, with the issues of terrorism and national security thrust back into the spotlight in the wake of the deadly Paris attacks.All three candidates have weighed in on the tragedy, condemning the attacks for which the Islamic State has claimed responsibility. The attacks across multiple locations in the city killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said.  In a primary race otherwise dominated by the economy, climate and front-runner Hillary Clinton’s personal record, the debate in Des Moines, Iowa, now is expected to focus heavily on security and foreign policy after debate host CBS News reworked the format.   It is an area where Clinton, as former secretary of state, enters with the thickest resume – but also one that could prove problematic, given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable and chaotic nations like Libya and Syria.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, after appearing to give her a pass at the first debate over her personal email controversy, has in recent weeks shown a greater interest in criticizing her record. But his focus on issues like income inequality could be out of place in a discussion focused on global security challenges.Clinton also enters this debate – hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register – facing a narrower field than at their first encounter in October. Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley.Clinton is seen to have otherwise strengthened her hand since that debate, making it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and seeing one of her biggest potential political threats – a late bid by Vice President Biden – disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.Sanders remains Clinton’s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.Still, the FBI investigation over Clinton’s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding.",,"The Democratic presidential candidates faced off for their second debate Saturday night, with the issues of terrorism and national security thrust back into the spotlight in the wake of the deadly Paris attacks.",Democratic 2016 candidates face off for 2nd debate,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/TEOgoe910VE/,['foreign policy/national security'],"['Bernie Sanders', 'Charlie Neibergall', 'Hillary Clinton', u""Martin O'Malley"", 'Hillary Rodham Clinton']",fox,0.8547615578685663,[],2015-11-15 02:02:16,['FBI'],16cb890d4d44df5c90d0eef0d397081f,2015-11-15 02:15:49.625467
"Republican candidates for president called on the Obama administration to tighten border controls amid reports that one of the suicide bombers who carried outÂ Fridayâs attacks in Paris may have entered Europe as a Syrian migrant.Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee said President Barack Obama should âclose our borders.ââIf a left-wing politically-correct country like France will close its borders, it’s time for us to put a moratorium on people coming here from countries where there are ISIS or al Qaeda ties,â he told CNN on Saturday.Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, another GOP presidential candidate, said the difficulty of running background checks on Syrian refugees should preclude further migration from Syria into the U.S.âYou canât pick up the phone and call Syria, and thatâs one of the reasons why I said we wonât be able to take more refugees,â he said on ABC on Sunday.He added: âYou can have 1,000 people come in, and 999 of them are just poor people fleeing oppression and violence, but one of them is an ISIS fighter. If thatâs the case, you have a problem, and there is no way to vet that out.âThe news that one of the bombers may have entered Europe amidst the flood of Middle Eastern refugees has galvanized opponents of Chancellor Angela Merkelâs open-door policy, with critics saying migrants represented a grave security threat.Jeb Bush, whose support for legal status for undocumented immigrants in the U.S. puts him at odds with the mainstream of the Republican Party, said the U.S. had the capacity to screen refugees based on their religion.âWe do that all the time. We do that,â he said on CNN on Sunday. âIt takes almost a year for a refugee to be processed into the United States.”He called for the U.S. to take a âlimited numberâ and to prioritize Christians who are fleeing religiously motivated persecution in Syria.The U.S. is preparing to admit at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next year, a six-fold increase from the number currently in the country, the White House announced in September.Ben Rhodes, deputy national security advisor to President Obama, said the administration had no intention of changing its refugee policy and said it had extensive screening procedures already in place for all Syrian refugees entering the U.S.âThere’s a very careful vetting process that includes our intelligence community, our national Counterterrorism Center, the Department of Homeland Security,â he said on NBC on Sunday.âWe need to sort out how to focus on the terrorists that we need to keep out of the country. But I think we do need to do our part to take those refugees who are in need.â______________________________________________________2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll StandingsPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.

"(Updates with comments from candidates)By John Whitesides and Amanda BeckerDES MOINES, Iowa Nov 14 U.S. Democraticpresidential front-runner Hillary Clinton was criticized in adebate on Saturday for her 2003 vote backing the U.S. invasionof Iraq, with rival Bernie Sanders linking it to regional chaosthat aided the rise of Islamic State militants.The day after a series of deadly bomb and gun attacks thatkilled at least 129 people in Paris, Sanders said the invasionwas ""one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the modernhistory of the United States.""""I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq,something that I strongly opposed, unraveled the regionimmensely, and led to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS,"" saidSanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont.""I don't think any sensible person would disagree that theinvasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we areseeing right now,"" he said.Clinton, who has frequently called the vote a mistake, saidit should be placed in the historical context of years ofterrorism before the invasion.""If we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed byjihadi extremists, we need to understand it and realize that ithas antecedents to what happened in Iraq,"" she said.The exchange came early in the second debate for Democratsseeking their party's nomination for the November 2016presidential election, with the focus shifted to foreign policyand ways to combat terrorism after the Paris attacks.The candidates and audience at Drake University in DesMoines, Iowa, observed a moment of silence at the beginning ofthe debate to honor those killed in France.Clinton, the former secretary of state, has far more foreignpolicy experience than either Sanders or her other rival, formerMaryland Governor Martin O'Malley. But she was forced on thedefensive early in the debate about her years of leadingPresident Barack Obama's foreign policy team.Clinton struck a sharp contrast to Obama's comments in aninterview aired on Friday that ISIS had been contained.""We have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of aninternational terror network. It cannot be contained, it must bedefeated,"" she said.Republican presidential contenders have criticized Obama forwhat they say was an inadequate response to the rise of IslamicState in Iraq and Syria. In the aftermath of the attacks,businessman Donald Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz called on theadministration to reconsider plans to allow thousands of Syrianrefugees to be resettled in the United States.The White House aims to increase to 10,000 the number ofSyrian refugees accepted in the United States during fiscal year2016, from less than 2,000 accepted in the previous year.Clinton has always been from the more hawkish wing of theDemocratic Party. Her support for the 2003 Iraq invasion playeda major role in her primary loss to Obama in the 2008 WhiteHouse race.The foreign policy focus was a dramatic shift in emphasis ina Democratic presidential race that so far has been dominated bydomestic economic issues such as income inequality, collegeaffordability and family leave.The Democrats returned to that theme later in the debate,and Sanders criticized Clinton for being too cozy with WallStreet and not being in favor of reinstating the Glass-SteagallAct, the 1933 law that established a firewall between investmentand commercial banking.""Over her political career, Wall Street has been a major,the major donor to Hillary Clinton. Now maybe they're dumb, butI don't think so,"" said Sanders, who favors reinstatement of theact.Clinton accused Sanders of impugning her integrity and saidreinstating the law was not enough to rein in corporateinfluence and reform Wall Street.""Reinstating Glass-Steagall is a part of what very wellcould help, but it is nowhere near enough,"" she said. ""I goafter all of Wall Street, not just the big banks.""With the political clock ticking to the first nominatingcontest in Iowa on Feb. 1, Clinton has opened a commanding leadover Sanders, her prime challenger, in national and Iowa polls.O'Malley trails well behind, in single digits in most polls.

"AMES, Iowa A top aide to U.S. Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton said on Sunday that criticism of her remarks in Saturday's debate regarding 9/11 and Wall Street campaign contributions would not resonate with average voters.“They were attacking her for being too close to Wall Street,” Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri said of a tense exchange among Clinton, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, her chief rival for the Democratic nomination, and former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley at the party's debate in Iowa.“The point she was making, is that as a senator, she did things for Wall Street, particularly after 9/11, but she also spoke out as a senator and now when she thought they were going too far,” Palmieri told reporters.Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for the 2016 election, was asked during the debate about contributions she had received from the financial industry and whether it would affect her plans to regulate it.Sanders said Clinton’s response was “not good enough.”“Now, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something. Everybody knows that,” Sanders said.Clinton said Sanders had impugned her integrity.“I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked,” Clinton said. “Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan, where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.”Clinton’s answer drew immediate criticism from Republican operatives and on social media. Moderators cited a response posted on Twitter when asking Clinton a follow-up question.“I don’t think that this is something that caucus-goers in Iowa or voters are going to focus on,” Palmieri said of the state that in February holds the first party nominating contest.“It’s pretty clear where she stands on issues, and donations don’t play a role in how she’s going to come down on that issue.”For more on the 2016 U.S. presidential race and to learn about the undecided voters who determine elections, visit the Reuters website.

"As Donald Trump and other Republicans talked tough on illegal immigration during last week's presidential debate, an exasperated Jeb Bush noted that Hillary Clinton's campaign aides were, right then, exchanging high-fives.He might have added: And Republican leaders in many states, like California, were once again despairing.From the beginning of the summer of Trump, many Republicans here hoped he would disappear quickly, to limit damage to the party's image. Summer turned to fall, and Trump still dominates the presidential campaign. And so does the subject of illegal immigration, posing a mighty threat.How mighty could be seen in a USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll published last week. It demonstrated again what California sees in every election: The party's positions on immigration and other issues, like gay marriage, have cost Republicans a generation of good will and support. Here, the poll reminded, Republicans are limited mostly to older and white voters, religious voters and residents of inland California.The current brouhaha over illegal immigration is important because new voters will carry their views of the political parties with them for a very long time.""The experiences people have when they enter the political system do stay with them,"" said Jon Cohen, vice president of survey research for SurveyMonkey, the firm that conducted the poll. Political views ""can shift … but those initial moments are important and do frame how they see things.""Republican difficulties can be seen in three key areas.Young and minority votersThere's substantial overlap in the membership of these groups, and in their reasons for siding with Democrats and the party's candidates.According to the poll, 36% of voters ages 18 to 29 strongly approve of President Obama. Another 40% approve of him more mildly, meaning three-quarters of young California voters are on Obama's side. Asked whether the country was headed in the right direction, 40% said it was — not a majority but six points above the percentage for California voters overall.Asked whether immigrants strengthened or weakened American society, 7 in 10 of the 18- to 29-year-olds said they represented a strength. (Among those age 65 and older, a slight majority felt the same way.)Views among Latino, African American and Asian voters were similar. All told, three-quarters of black voters, almost two-thirds of Latino voters and 70% of Asian voters supported President Obama. By strong majorities, all said immigration was positive for the country. Latino and Asian voters were about as positive about the direction of the country as were young voters.Those voters receive a contrary message from the Republican candidates for president. To hear them, the country is falling apart, President Obama is an abject failure and immigration is a threat. (The USC Dornsife/Times poll did not test views on the president's healthcare plan, but polls taken since the measure passed showed that it is broadly popular among minority voters. The GOP presidential candidates regularly scorn it and pledge to repeal it.)Interestingly, young Republicans are not that different in some ways from their elders — their presidential selections were quite similar — but they, too, have more moderate positions on immigration, gay marriage and other cultural issues.The state's coastal-inland splitThe traditional California fight is between north and south. The political split is between west and east, coastal and inland.Take the Obama support rating: Along the coast, 61% supported him. Inland, only 44% did. Two of the most conservative areas of the state, the Central Valley and Inland Empire, had only a 46% and 34% support rating for him, respectively. In both places, strong opposition was by far the dominant view.Here's the problem: The Central Valley represents 19% of the state's voters, and the Inland Empire another 10%. The two largest Democratic areas, Los Angeles County and the Bay Area, make up 44% of the state's voters.Even inland, demography is cutting into Republican unanimity. A majority of voters in the Central Valley said that immigrants strengthen this country, and 43% of Inland Empire voters agreed. (Growing Latino voting strength everywhere in the state has pushed many inland Republican members of Congress to support changes in immigration policy opposed by their leaders.)Religion, or lack thereofReligion has long been a dividing line in politics — the more common attendance at services, the greater the likelihood of political conservatism. It was true in the new poll as well.About half of Republican candidate Ben Carson's supporters said they attend church at least once a week, the highest percentage for any candidate. Only 20% of Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton's supporters reported that they attend services at least once a week.The problem for Republicans? There aren't enough Californians who are that religious.In California, 28% said they attend services at least once a week, and 44% said they attend seldom or never. Nationally, 35% were actively religious, while 38% seldom or never attended services.Republicans might be tempted to write off California, but their problem is that trends that started here are spreading. In presidential elections, Nevada and New Mexico have become regularly Democratic and Colorado has turned into a toss-up state because of California-style demographic changes.There would appear to be two solutions: a rapid influx of inland church-goers moving into the state, or a shift by the candidates toward moderation. At this early point of the presidential contest, the odds of the former seem greater than the odds of the latter.cathleen.decker@latimes.comTwitter: @cathleendecker For more on politics, go to www.latimes.com/decker and www.latimes.com/politics.",,"<p>As Donald Trump and other Republicans talked tough on illegal immigration during last week's presidential debate, an exasperated Jeb Bush noted that Hillary Clinton's campaign aides were, right then, exchanging high-fives.</p> <p>He might have added: And Republican leaders in many states, like California,...</p>",Three key areas that give Republicans trouble in California,http://www.latimes.com/la-me-pol-ca-california-politics-poll-20151115-story.html,['immigration'],"['Donald Trump', 'Rodham Clinton', 'Jeb Bush', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Ben Carson']",latimes,0.9969839217021564,"[{'author_id': 41997, 'fullname': 'cathleen decker', 'primary_org': 'latimes'}]",2015-11-15 08:05:00,"['GOP', 'Congress', 'Los Angeles County']",5bf4d8ad78d9540c95882d1c5942fa1e,2015-11-15 08:26:25.829957
