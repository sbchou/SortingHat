"DES MOINES, Iowa U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton was criticized in a debate on Saturday for her 2003 vote backing the U.S. invasion of Iraq, with rival Bernie Sanders linking it to regional chaos that aided the rise of Islamic State militants.The day after a series of deadly bomb and gun attacks that killed at least 129 people in Paris, Sanders said the invasion was ""one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the modern history of the United States.”""I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, unraveled the region immensely, and led to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS,"" said Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont.""I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now,"" he said.Clinton, who has frequently called the vote a mistake, said it should be placed in the historical context of years of terrorism before the invasion.“If we’re ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extremists, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq,” she said.The exchange came early in the second debate for Democrats seeking their party's nomination for the November 2016 presidential election, with the focus shifted to foreign policy and ways to combat terrorism after the Paris attacks.The candidates and audience at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, observed a moment of silence at the beginning of the debate to honor those killed in France.Clinton, the former secretary of state, has far more foreign policy experience than either Sanders or her other rival, former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley. But she was forced on the defensive early in the debate about her years of leading President Barack Obama's foreign policy team.Clinton struck a sharp contrast to Obama's comments in an interview aired on Friday that ISIS had been contained.""We have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network. It cannot be contained, it must be defeated,"" she said.Republican presidential contenders have criticized Obama for what they say was an inadequate response to the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In the aftermath of the attacks, businessman Donald Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz called on the administration to reconsider plans to allow thousands of Syrian refugees to be resettled in the United States.The White House aims to increase to 10,000 the number of Syrian refugees accepted in the United States during fiscal year 2016, from less than 2,000 accepted in the previous year.Clinton has always been from the more hawkish wing of the Democratic Party. Her support for the 2003 Iraq invasion played a major role in her primary loss to Obama in the 2008 White House race.The foreign policy focus was a dramatic shift in emphasis in a Democratic presidential race that so far has been dominated by domestic economic issues such as income inequality, college affordability and family leave.The Democrats returned to that theme later in the debate, and Sanders criticized Clinton for being too cozy with Wall Street and not being in favor of reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act, the 1933 law that established a firewall between investment and commercial banking.""Over her political career, Wall Street has been a major, the major donor to Hillary Clinton. Now maybe they’re dumb, but I don’t think so,"" said Sanders, who favors reinstatement of the act.Clinton accused Sanders of impugning her integrity and said reinstating the law was not enough to rein in corporate influence and reform Wall Street.""Reinstating Glass-Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough,"" she said. ""I go after all of Wall Street, not just the big banks.""With the political clock ticking to the first nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 1, Clinton has opened a commanding lead over Sanders, her prime challenger, in national and Iowa polls. O'Malley trails well behind, in single digits in most polls.

Martin O'Malley, Friday, Nov. 13, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)The Democratic presidential candidates faced off for their second debate Saturday night, with the issues of terrorism and national security thrust back into the spotlight in the wake of the deadly Paris attacks.All three candidates have weighed in on the tragedy, condemning the attacks for which the Islamic State has claimed responsibility. The attacks across multiple locations in the city killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said.  In a primary race otherwise dominated by the economy, climate and front-runner Hillary Clinton’s personal record, the debate in Des Moines, Iowa, now is expected to focus heavily on security and foreign policy after debate host CBS News reworked the format.   It is an area where Clinton, as former secretary of state, enters with the thickest resume – but also one that could prove problematic, given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable and chaotic nations like Libya and Syria.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, after appearing to give her a pass at the first debate over her personal email controversy, has in recent weeks shown a greater interest in criticizing her record. But his focus on issues like income inequality could be out of place in a discussion focused on global security challenges.Clinton also enters this debate – hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register – facing a narrower field than at their first encounter in October. Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley.Clinton is seen to have otherwise strengthened her hand since that debate, making it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and seeing one of her biggest potential political threats – a late bid by Vice President Biden – disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.Sanders remains Clinton’s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke. But nationally and in Iowa, she continues to lead him by double digits in the polls.Still, the FBI investigation over Clinton’s use of a personal email and server while secretary of state looms over her bid, with the probe said to be expanding.",,"The Democratic presidential candidates faced off for their second debate Saturday night, with the issues of terrorism and national security thrust back into the spotlight in the wake of the deadly Paris attacks.",Democratic 2016 candidates face off for 2nd debate,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/TEOgoe910VE/,['foreign policy/national security'],"['Bernie Sanders', 'Charlie Neibergall', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Martin O'Malley"""""," 'Hillary Rodham Clinton']""",fox,0.8547615578685663,[],2015-11-15 02:02:16,['FBI'],16cb890d4d44df5c90d0eef0d397081f,2015-11-15 02:15:49.625467
" Hillary Clinton talked tough and played defense Saturday at the second Democratic presidential debate, as rivals questioned her record and plans to fight the Islamic State.A day after a terrorist attack in Paris, terrorism and foreign policy took center stage in the two-hour debate with questions from the moderator and criticisms from rivals often focusing on her record as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first four years in office.Clinton remains the Democrats’ clear front-runner, but the debate illustrated how she will have to answer for administration policy on terrorism and foreign policy. Clinton last month broke with the White House, urging a no-fly zone in Syria and doing more to help rebels there. But she can’t shed her ties to the administration, and Republicans are hitting her hard on her role.The debate also showed how Clinton retains considerable advantages. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, can’t match her foreign policy experience or command of world politics. Perhaps most important, neither is drawing sharp distinctions with her on anti-terrorist policies.Highlights:The three opened with a moment of silence for the victims in Paris, then talked about their approach to the Islamic State terror group.“It cannot be contained. It must be defeated,” Clinton said, a slight jab at Obama who said just before the Paris attacks that ISIS had been contained.“But it cannot be an American fight,”she added. “This cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.”Her two rivals were more assertive about U.S. leadership.“I would disagree with Secretary Clinton,” said O’Malley. “This actually is America’s fight. It cannot solely be America’s fight. ... America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.“Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of ... ISIS,” said Sanders.Republicans complain that Democrats won’t use the words Muslim or Islam in describing terrorists.Saturday, the Democratic candidates appeared to rally to the term Jihadi or Jihadist, which derive from the word for a holy war by Muslims.Clinton Saturday referred to a “radical jihadist ideology.” “I don’t think we’re at war with Islam,” she added. “I don’t think we’re at war with all Muslims.”O’Malley used the term “radical jihadis,” but also warned against labeling terrorists with the broad term of Muslim, saying that would unfairly brand the majority of American Muslims who are needed to help fight back violent extremism.Said Sanders: “I don’t think the term is what’s important.”EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIMO’Malley proposed allowing 65,000 Syrian refugees into the country, more than the 10,000 proposed by Obama, though he said they need “proper screening.” Clinton also argued for a higher number, adding “I said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine.”EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIMHillary Clinton: “I don’t think we’re at war with Islam, I don’t think we’re at war with all Muslims.”Bernie Sanders: “I’m not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,” referring to the 91 percent top income tax rate in the 1950s.Martin O’Malley: “You will never heard this from that immigrant-bashing carnival barker Donald Trump”EDITORS: STORY CAN END HEREClintonClinton had to defend her years as secretary of state. Moderator John Dickerson asked if the Obama administration underestimated the Islamic State threat. Clinton didn’t answer at first, then tried to tie the current crisis to President George W. Bush’s decision to end American involvement in Iraq. Each time she was challenged, Clinton would launch into detailed histories of the region’s turmoil and American involvement. Backers will praise her command of detail; opponents will contend she’s avoiding responsibility for being part of a team that didn’t take the Islamic threat seriously enough.Sanders He got off to a rocky start. He only briefly touched on the Paris terrorist attacks in his opening remarks before turning to his standard speech assailing income inequality and the corrosive nature of money in politics. Viewers then watched as Clinton and O’Malley devoted their entire opening statement to the attacks. Viewers may also have been puzzled when Sanders said that climate change is the country’s greatest threat and a contributor to the spread of terrorism. He also failed to gain traction out of his criticism that Clinton had voted for the Iraq War that he opposed.O’Malley O’Malley, who has languished in single digits in the polls, performed ably, holding his own with the former Secretary of State and U.S. senator on foreign and domestic policy, including health care and taxes. How would he pay for his policies? He explained. Can a former governor lead the U.S. in a time of global terror? Yes, he said. But he needed a breakthrough performance to attract new attention and enthusiasm to his campaign and his performance fell short.EDITORS: STORY CAN END HEREWall Street. The term came up often, as Sanders and O’Malley challenged Clinton over her ties to the financial industry. Clinton had a different take on those ties, recalling how, as a U.S. senator from New York, she fought to help rebuild a part of the city devastated by terrorist attacks.",,"Not ‘at war with all Muslims,’ Clinton saysSanders, O’Malley challenge Clinton views on Islamic StateClinton front-runner status likely to continue…Click to Continue »",Clinton on the defensive as debate turns to terrorism,http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article44966964.html,['foreign policy/national security'],"['Martin O'Malley""""", 'John Dickerson', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Donald Trump', 'George W.

"AMES, Iowa A top aide to U.S. Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton said on Sunday that criticism of her remarks in Saturday's debate regarding 9/11 and Wall Street campaign contributions would not resonate with average voters.“They were attacking her for being too close to Wall Street,” Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri said of a tense exchange among Clinton, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, her chief rival for the Democratic nomination, and former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley at the party's debate in Iowa.“The point she was making, is that as a senator, she did things for Wall Street, particularly after 9/11, but she also spoke out as a senator and now when she thought they were going too far,” Palmieri told reporters.Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for the 2016 election, was asked during the debate about contributions she had received from the financial industry and whether it would affect her plans to regulate it.Sanders said Clinton’s response was “not good enough.”“Now, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something. Everybody knows that,” Sanders said.Clinton said Sanders had impugned her integrity.“I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked,” Clinton said. “Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan, where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.”Clinton’s answer drew immediate criticism from Republican operatives and on social media. Moderators cited a response posted on Twitter when asking Clinton a follow-up question.“I don’t think that this is something that caucus-goers in Iowa or voters are going to focus on,” Palmieri said of the state that in February holds the first party nominating contest.“It’s pretty clear where she stands on issues, and donations don’t play a role in how she’s going to come down on that issue.”For more on the 2016 U.S. presidential race and to learn about the undecided voters who determine elections, visit the Reuters website.

"Jeb Bush said the United States “should declare war” as it responds to the Paris attacks and the rise of ISIS generally.“You take it to them in Syria and Iraq,” Mr. Bush said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” when asked how the United States could expect to “defeat an ideology.”“You destroy ISIS,” he continued. “And then you build a coalition to replace this radical Islamic terrorist threat to our country and to Europe and to the region with something that is more peace-loving.”The host, Chuck Todd, asked Mr. Bush what he would tell an American public wary of foreign entanglements after wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. (Mr. Todd left unsaid the fact that those wars began under Mr. Bush’s brother.)“I tell the American public that a caliphate the size of Indiana garners strength each and every day if it’s not taken out,” Mr. Bush replied.Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, has long sought to establish himself as the adult in a raucous Republican field, and his supporters are hopeful that a greater focus on national security issues could provide an opening for a campaign that has badly struggled.On Sunday, Mr. Bush hinted at the shifting tenor of the race, with some prodding from Mr. Todd, arguing that “as we get closer to the primaries, people are going to want to know who can sit behind the big desk.”He was asked if he would trust Donald J. Trump or Ben Carson as commander-in-chief.“I don’t know,” Mr. Bush said. “The words that I hear them speaking give me some concern. “But he turned quickly to Hillary Rodham Clinton, seizing on comments she made during Saturday night’s Democratic debate. Mrs. Clinton said the fight against ISIS “cannot be an American fight,” before adding that “American leadership is essential.”“I’m more concerned about Hillary Clinton thinking that the United States doesn’t have a leadership role in this,” Mr. Bush said, after the question about his Republican rivals. “That’s my big concern.”",MATT FLEGENHEIMER,"Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, warned that the caliphate was gaining strength “every day” and insisted the United States must take the lead in fighting it in Syria and Iraq.","First Draft: ‘We Should Declare War’ in Fight Against Islamic State, Jeb Bush Says",http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/15/we-should-declare-war-in-fight-against-islamic-state-jeb-bush-says/,['foreign policy/national security'],"['Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Jeb Bush', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Chuck Todd', 'Donald J.

" (CNN)CNN Opinion asked a range of contributors for their take on the second Democratic presidential debate held at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. Who were the winner and loser? The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors.This debate was more difficult for Hillary Clinton than was expected. Though she had opportunities to highlight her extensive experience and leadership skills, she was still thrown on the defense in two pivotal areas. On foreign policy, in the aftermath of Paris, she was forced to defend the record of the Obama administration in Syria and saw how this issue -- foreign policy -- could be turned against her. This, more than the vote in Iraq, will be a challenge.Domestic policy also remained a concern as Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley hit harder in her ties to Wall Street and more centrist views on some economic issues. Clinton still exits from the debate as the most formidable candidate in the group and the one best positioned to defeat the GOP. O'Malley continues to struggle gaining any traction and Sanders still seems too left for the party.But the debate was a warning. It brought out some of the questions that Clinton will face in the coming months. In the coming weeks, she will need to provide stronger answers if she wants a smooth victory in the primaries and the general election. Winner: No clear winner.Loser: Martin O'Malley. Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of ""The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society"" and co-editor of a new book, ""Medicare and Medicaid at 50: America's Entitlement Programs in the Age of Affordable Care."" The good news for Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley was that they shared a victory in this debate by criticizing Hillary Clinton directly and to her face, pushing back against the notion that Clinton's nomination is inevitable. Not if Sanders and O'Malley have anything to say about it.When asked about the role of Wall Street, Sanders, who has criticized the influence of big-money donors in American politics, said Clinton's many backers from financial corporations are seeking to curry favor with her.""Maybe they're dumb, and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so,"" Sanders said of Clinton's Wall Street donors. ""Why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something, everybody knows it.""Clinton, clearly stung by the statement, pointed out that Sanders ""has basically used his answer to impugn my integrity."" At issue was a call by Sanders and O'Malley to tighten regulatory controls over banking institutions by reviving elements of the now-defunct Glass-Steagall Act.  Clinton dismissed her critics: ""My proposal is tougher, more comprehensive and more effective,"" she said. But O'Malley called her ideas ""weak tea"" and the cheers Sanders got by taking her on suggest a sizable portion of Democrats want the next president to control Wall Street rather than the other way around. The Sanders-O'Malley duo also scored points by pushing for a $15 minimum wage, considerably higher than the $12 Clinton advocates. The recent nationwide strikes and demonstrations in favor of a $15 minimum wage -- which translates into an annual full-time salary of $31,000 -- show that Sanders and O'Malley are riding a powerful grassroots wave. If Clinton sticks to her $12 proposal, she should expect more verbal slugfests with her opponents -- and a Democratic base that may jump off the Clinton bandwagon if she doesn't move in a more liberal direction.Errol Louis is the host of ""Inside City Hall,"" a nightly political show on NY1, a New York all-news channel. A day after ISIS terrorized Paris in multiple coordinated attacks with guns and suicide bombs, killing over 100 and injuring hundreds more, Democrat frontrunner Hillary Clinton left doubts she's up to the task to protect America. In opening questions on foreign policy during the CBS-moderated debate, Clinton danced around her lack of accomplishments as secretary of state under President Barack Obama. When asked about Obama's Syria policy, Clinton said she disagreed with Obama's strategy from the start and warned him if the United States didn't intervene in Syria, our enemies would fill the void.  Clinton said the ""Middle East is a complicated region"" and ""the arch of instability."" Americans don't vote for a president to tell them what they already know. Clinton's textbook responses to foreign policy questions were rote. More disturbing was she couldn't point to any accomplishments as secretary of state other than advising Obama on Osama bin Laden's capture. Libya, Syria, Egypt and Russia all fell apart under her tenure. If elected president, Clinton didn't convince voters she would do anything differently or make America safer, which brings us to terrorism.When asked if she would declare war against Islam like President Francois Hollande has, Clinton replied no. ""We're not at war with Islam. We're not at war with Muslims.""  Yet, that's just the problem. Islam is at war with America and the world and we need a president who will finally acknowledges this, not one who shrinks from this challenge. Obama hasn't. In an interview with ""Good Morning America"" that aired the day of the Paris attack, Obama said ISIS had been contained.Over the last four years since the civil war unraveled in Syria, ISIS has taken root there, training Muslims from around the world to be jihadists. France has a large population of Muslim nationals, many of whom have freely entered the country. America, like Germany and France, have welcomed thousands of Syrian refugees. It won't be long before what happened in Paris makes it's way to our homeland. During the second Democrat debate, Hillary Clinton revealed her biggest strength may be her biggest weakness -- her foreign policy experience.Crystal Wright is a conservative writer who runs the blog ConservativeBlackChick.com. She also is a principal at the Baker Wright Group, a communications and public relations firm. You can follow her @GOPBlackChick.On a very tough night to talk politics, it seemed all three candidates were a little off their game.Hillary Clinton was well-positioned coming in to look tough -- and presidential -- on terrorism. But she didn't anticipate Martin O'Malley lurching to her right. ""It is America's fight,"" he corrected her, ""but not solely America's fight."" With Bernie Sanders attacking from the left, she was suddenly stuck in the middle, playing defense. On the discussion regarding banks and campaign finance, however, Sanders should have had the natural upper hand, but he couldn't land a punch. Clinton won the issue in the room. Sanders also might be the first Democrat to acknowledge raising the minimum wage will have some negative repercussions, which I think will come back to haunt him.O'Malley had some blunders as well. He floated a frightening 70% tax rate on the wealthy, unprompted. He walked into a critique from Sanders on the safety of Baltimore, the city he ran as mayor. All told, they each had some unexpected highlights and some surprising misses. When Clinton loses on foreign policy but wins on the banks, you know it's a weird night.S.E. Cupp is the author of ""Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media's Attack on Christianity,"" co-author of ""Why Yo're Wrong About the Right"" and a columnist at the New York Daily News.  Two moments in tonight's debate clarified why Bernie Sanders won't assume the role of frontrunner any time soon.  In the first, Sanders reiterated his noble, but politically disastrous, appeal that we all stop talking about Hillary Clinton's (damn) emails.  It's the high road, for sure.  But by extricating her from a scandal that had bedeviled her campaign for months, Sanders has ceded the space needed for Clinton to take flight.The second moment illustrates the difficulty Sanders has faced in winning over African Americans.  When asked about Black Lives Matter, Sanders rattled off a bunch of standard statistics about incarceration and unemployment rates. Clinton, by contrast, acknowledged the profound pain that black mothers feel when they lose their children to violence, and she then paid tribute -- by name -- to some of the young men who have lost their lives to police violence.Winner: Hillary Clinton. She came across as shrewd, measured, and worldly.  Nothing about the debate tonight changed the fundamental dynamics of this race. Most improved: Martin O'Malley.  He spoke fluidly and forcefully about all manner of issues. He made a showing tonight; it just won't make much of a difference.Lastly, a note on format.  With just a handful of Democratic contenders left in the race for president, the conversation in tonight's debate sank reasonably deep into policy details. The kinds of zingers and gaffes that separate winners from losers on a stage of ten just don't count for nearly as much on a stage of three.  May the Republicans take notice and winnow their ranks soon.William Howell is the Sydney Stein professor in American politics at the University of Chicago. Once again, Democrats proved that they are the adults in this race by having a civilized, high-minded and respectful debate about the important issues facing our country.  They also demonstrated they are all better equipped to lead the nation going into the 21st century as we face unprecedented threats from abroad and an economy that needs continued Democratic leadership to fully recover and give middle class voters all the tools they need to succeed.There were fireworks as both Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley tried to take the fight to Hillary Clinton, specifically on her Iraq vote and her connections to Wall Street.  She swatted away the criticisms with ease, with facts, and demonstrated she is best suited to lead the country as president and commander in chief. On foreign policy, her knowledge of the issues, her grasp of the nuances involved in global diplomacy and her determination to implement unparalleled American leadership to defeat ISIS and radical extremist jihadists in the Middle East, put her head and shoulders above the rest, both in the Democratic field as well as all Republicans vying for the presidency. On economic and domestic issues, Clinton underscored differences with Sanders and O'Malley, again showing important nuances on positions such as the minimum wage, college affordability and gun control, showing her grasp of details and the ""weeds"" of these complex issues.  She showed her policies would put middle class families first while ensuring our economy can absorb them without disruption. O'Malley had a great debate, showing his passionate progressive positions, at times taking the critique to both of his opponents, but mostly agreeing with them on key issues.  While his resume is impressive and he has many accomplishments to show as Maryland governor, unfortunately, he was not able to have a sufficient breakout moment that will enable him to climb out of the single digits in the polls. Sanders continued to show his passionate commitment to liberal positions, focusing on climate change and income inequality, both of which are tremendously important to the progressive base.  But his knowledge of foreign policy and issues going on in the Middle East came up wanting and did not inspire broad-based trust needed to be elected as commander In chief.As an issue that is front and center, immigration brought out the best in all of the Democratic candidates -- an easy feat given the contrast with the ridiculous, unworkable, unjust and unelectable positions that are held by most Republicans. Importantly, Clinton was the first one to contrast all the Democrats with the Republicans and was the only one to defend President Obama's record.  A brilliant and important move to excite and mobilize the Democratic base.Overall, Clinton outshined her Democratic opponents, showing her proposals would pay for the opportunities and the level playing field that would help create more good paying jobs and expand economic growth for those who have been left behind.  And both Sanders and O'Malley took a definitive back seat to Clinton when it came to foreign policy, defense of the homeland and what it takes to confront the challenges we face, tragically demonstrated by last night's Paris attacks.

Marco Rubio said U.S. allies should invoke the collective defense clause of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in response to terrorist attacks in Paris.“This is clearly an act of war and an attack on one of our NATO allies, and we should invoke Article 5 of the NATO agreement, and bring everyone together to put together a coalition to confront this challenge,” Mr. Rubio said Sunday morning on ABC.French president Francois Hollande called the attacks “an act of war” and cited Islamic State as responsible.Former Florida governor and GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush stopped short calling for an Article 5 declaration, which is the formal recognition that an attack on one NATO member represents an attack on them all, and sets the groundwork for collective military action.“I think the president should convene the North Atlantic Council to discuss that,” Mr. Bush said Sunday morning on CNN. “If that’s what the French want, then, our longest and strongest and most loyal ally over our entire history, we should certainly consider it.”The only time the collective defense provision was invoked came after the Sept. 11 terror attacks in the U.S.Later, on NBC, Mr. Bush said: “This is a threat to western civilization and we should consider it that way.”The U.S. and France already work together in operations in Iraq and Syria, sharing intelligence and coordinating airstrikes.Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser to President Barack Obama, agreed with Mr. Hollande that the attacks in Paris were an act of war. He said the U.S. wants “to continue to intensify that coordination” with France.While France hasn’t invoked Article 5, NATO’s secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said members are ready to assist.______________________________________________________2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll StandingsPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.

"There is plenty of anger swirling around the 2016 presidential campaign. Anger at Washington, disdain for Wall Street, disgust with career politicians. Anger is all the rage, and both parties clearly have candidates that are successfully riding the wave. Neither Bernie Sanders nor Donald Trump would be where he is without the substantial number of fed-up voters in their parties. Everyone can see that. It's obvious.But loathing doesn't account for the differences we are witnessing between the GOP and Democratic Party nomination fights. Fear does. Or the absence of fear. Although both sides are angry, Republicans are more angry at the Republican Party leadership than they are afraid of Democrats, while Democrats are more afraid of Republicans than they are angry at the Democratic Party leadership. That's why Trump and Ben Carson, extreme outsiders, are dominating on the right while Hillary Rodham Clinton, the consummate insider, is dominating on the left.This relationship isn't new: The extent to which fear of the other side tempers anger at one's own often determines the nominee.In 2004, when I ran Howard Dean's campaign for president, Democrats were seething at the Democratic establishment, which had voted with the GOP to invade Iraq. But this anger over time gave way to a very real fear that Bush would win reelection.Bernie Sanders' success on the campaign trail does not defy explanation in quite the way that Donald Trump's does — Sanders has not dominated the polls, for one thing — but it's improbable all the same. He is a 74-year-old grandfather with thick glasses and frequently disheveled white hair. And...Bernie Sanders' success on the campaign trail does not defy explanation in quite the way that Donald Trump's does — Sanders has not dominated the polls, for one thing — but it's improbable all the same. He is a 74-year-old grandfather with thick glasses and frequently disheveled white hair. And...As fear of Bush's victory rose, voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, who had been attracted to Howard Dean's progressive politics and willingness to take on the party leadership, moved to John Kerry. Venting, they realized, wasn't as important as nominating someone with a better chance to win.This year, fear within the Democratic Party of a GOP win is off the charts. The GOP has majorities in the House of Representative and the U.S. Senate. For Democrats, losing the presidency in 2016 would be catastrophic. With control of both the executive and legislative branches of government, the GOP would be able to roll back all of the accomplishments of the Obama administration and fill any number of Supreme Court vacancies, guaranteeing a rightward shift in the makeup of the court for a generation.Bernie Sanders can tap into the very real anger at Wall Street and Washington all he wants, but he's not going anywhere; the party rank and file isn't going to risk the 2016 election by nominating an untested democratic socialist. Fear has a way of making voters put ideological purity aside and rally around the most tested, most viable general election candidate: Hillary Rodham Clinton.The fact that many Republicans are probably snickering at those last few sentences helps explain the starkly different race for the GOP nomination. There is a complete absence of fear within the GOP rank and file right now. Having won the House and the Senate, having taken over most state legislatures, the party feels as if the wind is at its back. Are they sick of Barack Obama? Absolutely. Are they sick of Clinton? Certainly. But they don't fear either one of them. They're convinced that the country could not possibly want another four years with a Democrat in the White House.Any fear they had of Clinton was erased by months of pundits proclaiming her collapse, her fumbling response to the private server scandal and Sanders' surprising popularity in early primary states. GOP primary voters' opinion of her was so low they happily bought into the idea of her vulnerability, and still do.It's the absence of fear that is driving Jeb Bush into the ground and holding Marco Rubio, John Kasich and others from gaining any real traction. Why compromise for someone who calls illegal immigration “an act of love,” or someone who once supported a path to citizenship, if there is no way you can lose? Why not go with the guy who wants to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants, then let the “good ones” back in?Of course, there's still time for the GOP to get scared straight. As Clinton's strengths become more obvious, and they will, fear within the GOP will rise. Republican primary voters could abandon Trump and Carson for Rubio, Kasich, Christie or even Bush — just as Democratic primary voters abandoned Dean for Kerry in 2004.The establishment candidates just have to hope that fear will overcome loathing sooner rather than later.Joe Trippi is a Democratic strategist and media consultant who ran Howard Dean's campaign for president and was a media advisor to Gov.

"War Room                         The Paris attacks have reawakened martial feelings absent since 9/11.            By Michael HirshNovember 14, 2015                GettyRemember the mood in America just after 9/11? The surge of super-patriotism (dare we say jingoism)? The pall of political correctness (you’re fired, Bill Maher). The phrases that so resonated: “Let’s roll.” “You’re either with us or against us.” “Bring ‘em on.” Something like that is taking hold in France right now after Friday night’s horror, one of the worst terrorist attacks on Western soil since that terrible day 14 years ago. You could see it in the grim visage of Francois Hollande, socialist-turned-avenger, when the French president declared, “This is an act of war,” pledged a “ruthless” response, and called in effect for a global counterattack against the Islamic State. The frighteningly coordinated attacks that left more than 120 people dead in the heart of one of the world’s most cosmopolitan and beloved cities were, Hollande said, “an act committed by a terrorist army, Daesh, against France, our values, who we are, a free country that speaks to the entire planet.”Story Continued BelowHollande is likely to get a great deal of such support. Because in one night of slaughter, the attacks in Paris have caused the tectonic plates of geopolitics to shift sharply rightward, and no one will be unaffected. The new axis of opinion in the U.S. and Western European countries is plainly going to be harsher, more interventionist and less tolerant of, well, tolerance. Americans were already beginning to lose their post-Iraq war squeamishness about intervening overseas: a November Quinnipiac University poll found that American voters, by a 54-38 percent margin, backed sending U.S. troops to fight the Islamic State in Iraq. It’s safe to assume we’re about to grow more even more interventionist in mood, and Obama, as is his wont, may well follow the public temper, stepping up the minimalist approach he’s taken to countering Islamic State in Iraq and Syria so far.Already in Washington a somewhat more subdued version of this martial mood —subdued only because it didn’t happen here this time—is hardening up the 2016 presidential race. Republicans suddenly possess a new attack line against Obama over his withdrawal from Iraq and reluctance to intervene more dramatically in Syria. Obama’s former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton--who is suddenly on the defensive about something other than Benghazi (though we’ll be hearing more about that too)—will feel compelled to remind everyone at Saturday night’s Democratic debate that she was more hawkish than the president on that particular point.The GOP presidential candidates, of course, immediately seized on Obama’s unfortunately timed declaration in an interview Thursday that “we have contained” the Islamic State. Donald Trump, never one for political niceties, tweeted: ""President Obama said 'ISIL continues to shrink' in an interview just hours before the horrible attack in Paris. He is just so bad! CHANGE.""Ted Cruz, meanwhile, made fun of Obama’s reluctance to blame Islam for repeated acts of terrorism, saying, ""We must immediately recognize that our enemy is not ‘violent extremism.’ It is the radical Islamism that has declared jihad against the West."" He also embraced his own brand of ruthlessness, suggesting it was time to stop worrying about bombing civilians, whom Islamic State radicals have been hiding behind in cities such as Mosul. The Islamic State, he said, “will not be deterred by targeted airstrikes with zero tolerance for civilian casualties, when the terrorists have such utter disregard for innocent life.” Marco Rubio, already building a reputation for himself as the GOP field’s chief hawk, called for “improv[ing] our defenses, destroy[ing] terrorist networks, and depriv[ing] them of the space from which to operate.”This new right-wing normal will also no doubt seal the fate of less hawkish candidates—in particular the already-fading Rand Paul, whom Rubio denounced at the last debate as a “committed isolationist” and who can no doubt hear the tolling of political oblivion even now.***The tenor of diplomacy will change as well, starting today in Vienna, where talks were already underway on whether the U.S., Europeans and Russians could find common ground against Islamic State at a time when they were still sharply divided over Moscow’s contention that Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad should be shored up; that common ground is far more visible than it was a day ago. Against the brazen brutality of the Islamic State, even the barrel-bombing Assad will become slightly more tolerable, at least on an interim basis (delighting Vladimir Putin). Old differences seemed forgotten as Secretary of State John Kerry appeared at a news conference on Saturday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and declared: “We are in absolute and total agreement that these kinds of attacks are the most vile, horrendous, outrageous, unacceptable acts on the planet.”Civil liberties, which made a comeback with the Snowden revelations of 2012, will also now fade once again as an international issue. France and Belgium were already discussing increasing their internet surveillance, long a fraught topic under European law; now they’ll talk a lot louder about it.Michael Hirsh is national editor for Politico Magazine.WHAT WORKSPolitics                    By                             Jason ZengerleThe Big Idea                    By                             POLITICO Magazine © 2015 POLITICO LLC",,The Paris attacks have reawakened martial feelings absent since 9/11.,"On Terror, We&#8217;re All Right-wingers Now",http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/11/on-terror-were-all-right-wingers-now-213358,['foreign policy/national security'],"['Rand Paul', 'John Kerry', 'Michael Hirsh', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Francois Hollande', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Donald Trump', 'Marco Rubio', 'Bill Maher', 'Jason Zengerle', 'Edward Snowden', 'Sergei Lavrov', 'Ted Cruz']",politico,0.9200056773482217,"[{'author_id': 32346, 'fullname': 'michael hirsh', 'primary_org': 'politico'}]",2015-11-14 21:02:49,"['GOP', 'Quinnipiac University']",ce82185674b7e06375be40131f60912f,2015-11-15 02:42:55.006483
"As Donald Trump and other Republicans talked tough on illegal immigration during last week's presidential debate, an exasperated Jeb Bush noted that Hillary Clinton's campaign aides were, right then, exchanging high-fives.He might have added: And Republican leaders in many states, like California, were once again despairing.From the beginning of the summer of Trump, many Republicans here hoped he would disappear quickly, to limit damage to the party's image. Summer turned to fall, and Trump still dominates the presidential campaign. And so does the subject of illegal immigration, posing a mighty threat.How mighty could be seen in a USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll published last week. It demonstrated again what California sees in every election: The party's positions on immigration and other issues, like gay marriage, have cost Republicans a generation of good will and support. Here, the poll reminded, Republicans are limited mostly to older and white voters, religious voters and residents of inland California.The current brouhaha over illegal immigration is important because new voters will carry their views of the political parties with them for a very long time.""The experiences people have when they enter the political system do stay with them,"" said Jon Cohen, vice president of survey research for SurveyMonkey, the firm that conducted the poll. Political views ""can shift … but those initial moments are important and do frame how they see things.""Republican difficulties can be seen in three key areas.Young and minority votersThere's substantial overlap in the membership of these groups, and in their reasons for siding with Democrats and the party's candidates.According to the poll, 36% of voters ages 18 to 29 strongly approve of President Obama. Another 40% approve of him more mildly, meaning three-quarters of young California voters are on Obama's side. Asked whether the country was headed in the right direction, 40% said it was — not a majority but six points above the percentage for California voters overall.Asked whether immigrants strengthened or weakened American society, 7 in 10 of the 18- to 29-year-olds said they represented a strength. (Among those age 65 and older, a slight majority felt the same way.)Views among Latino, African American and Asian voters were similar. All told, three-quarters of black voters, almost two-thirds of Latino voters and 70% of Asian voters supported President Obama. By strong majorities, all said immigration was positive for the country. Latino and Asian voters were about as positive about the direction of the country as were young voters.Those voters receive a contrary message from the Republican candidates for president. To hear them, the country is falling apart, President Obama is an abject failure and immigration is a threat. (The USC Dornsife/Times poll did not test views on the president's healthcare plan, but polls taken since the measure passed showed that it is broadly popular among minority voters. The GOP presidential candidates regularly scorn it and pledge to repeal it.)Interestingly, young Republicans are not that different in some ways from their elders — their presidential selections were quite similar — but they, too, have more moderate positions on immigration, gay marriage and other cultural issues.The state's coastal-inland splitThe traditional California fight is between north and south. The political split is between west and east, coastal and inland.Take the Obama support rating: Along the coast, 61% supported him. Inland, only 44% did. Two of the most conservative areas of the state, the Central Valley and Inland Empire, had only a 46% and 34% support rating for him, respectively. In both places, strong opposition was by far the dominant view.Here's the problem: The Central Valley represents 19% of the state's voters, and the Inland Empire another 10%. The two largest Democratic areas, Los Angeles County and the Bay Area, make up 44% of the state's voters.Even inland, demography is cutting into Republican unanimity. A majority of voters in the Central Valley said that immigrants strengthen this country, and 43% of Inland Empire voters agreed. (Growing Latino voting strength everywhere in the state has pushed many inland Republican members of Congress to support changes in immigration policy opposed by their leaders.)Religion, or lack thereofReligion has long been a dividing line in politics — the more common attendance at services, the greater the likelihood of political conservatism. It was true in the new poll as well.About half of Republican candidate Ben Carson's supporters said they attend church at least once a week, the highest percentage for any candidate. Only 20% of Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton's supporters reported that they attend services at least once a week.The problem for Republicans? There aren't enough Californians who are that religious.In California, 28% said they attend services at least once a week, and 44% said they attend seldom or never. Nationally, 35% were actively religious, while 38% seldom or never attended services.Republicans might be tempted to write off California, but their problem is that trends that started here are spreading. In presidential elections, Nevada and New Mexico have become regularly Democratic and Colorado has turned into a toss-up state because of California-style demographic changes.There would appear to be two solutions: a rapid influx of inland church-goers moving into the state, or a shift by the candidates toward moderation. At this early point of the presidential contest, the odds of the former seem greater than the odds of the latter.cathleen.decker@latimes.comTwitter: @cathleendecker For more on politics, go to www.latimes.com/decker and www.latimes.com/politics.",,"<p>As Donald Trump and other Republicans talked tough on illegal immigration during last week's presidential debate, an exasperated Jeb Bush noted that Hillary Clinton's campaign aides were, right then, exchanging high-fives.</p> <p>He might have added: And Republican leaders in many states, like California,...</p>",Three key areas that give Republicans trouble in California,http://www.latimes.com/la-me-pol-ca-california-politics-poll-20151115-story.html,['immigration'],"['Donald Trump', 'Rodham Clinton', 'Jeb Bush', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Ben Carson']",latimes,0.9969839217021564,"[{'author_id': 41997, 'fullname': 'cathleen decker', 'primary_org': 'latimes'}]",2015-11-15 08:05:00,"['GOP', 'Congress', 'Los Angeles County']",5bf4d8ad78d9540c95882d1c5942fa1e,2015-11-15 08:26:25.829957
"Here’s the latest:• What is the status of the investigation?The French authorities have released no information since a news conference by the Paris prosecutor on Saturday, and no updates are scheduled for Sunday.The death toll holds at 129, but the number of critically wounded — nearly 100 — signaled that figure was certain to grow.Investigators were hunting down information about the first of the suspects to be publicly identified, Ismaël Omar Mostefaï, 29, a French citizen who was one of three hostage takers at the Bataclan concert hall.In the eastern Paris suburb of Montreuil, the authorities found three Kalashnikov rifles in an abandoned vehicle, a sign that some of the attackers may have escaped.The authorities in Belgium made seven arrests that left open the possibility that the plot had roots there.Fundamental questions remain: How did the terrorists, who acted in three synchronized teams, pull off the deadliest terrorist attack in Western Europe since 2004?And did they receive direction from Islamic State leaders in Iraq and Syria, who until now had never taken responsibility for such a large-scale attack in the West?• What’s happening in Paris?Paris is still by and large shuttered, even for a Sunday, and France remains under a state of emergency.Museums and other cultural centers are closed for a second day. A star-crossed movie opening about a terrorist attack in France was canceled.But small crowds congregated at the Place de la République — as they did after the Charlie Hebdo massacre in January — to show solidarity on Saturday, ignoring government advice to stay home. And French flags are appearing in Parisian apartment windows.The archbishop of Paris officiates at a Mass at the Cathedral of Notre-Dame today. And schools are to reopen on Monday.• What about elsewhere?From Vatican City to Seoul, law enforcement authorities are on heightened alert.Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari of Iraq said his country’s intelligence services obtained information indicating that, besides France, the United States and Iran were among countries being targeted for attack.• What’s next for policy makers?As France deals with the aftermath in Paris, global attention turns to policy and politics. President Obama and other world leaders are in Turkey for a Group of 20 summit meeting today, where the terrorist attacks are already a focus.Migration is, too, because one of the assailants entered the European Union through Greece with other refugees last month and then passed through Serbia, where he sought asylum.That is sure to complicate the vexing problem of how to handle the unceasing flow of people from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere in Europe. Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, said today that Europe should not react by rejecting refugees.European Union justice and interior ministers will hold a special meeting on the Paris attacks Friday.• How is Paris playing in the U.S. presidential campaign?Candidates for the Democratic nomination, in their debate Saturday night in Des Moines, agreed that America is determined to fight terrorism, dedicated to responsibilities to refugees and devoted to diplomacy.But Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont sought to tie the rise of the Islamic State to Hillary Rodham Clinton’s vote as a senator to authorize the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.By contrast, leading Republicans like Donald J. Trump, Ben Carson and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas called on the Obama administration to halt plans to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees next year.Although they broadly agreed that the Paris attacks should be the catalyst for a new military strategy against the Islamic State, most of the Republicans were still tentative about committing more American ground troops to that effort.• Who were the victims?Little seemed to tie the dead at the six attack sites, except that they were out having fun. And that was the point for the Islamic State militant group, which said that it struck France’s symbols of “perversity.”“Bars, a concert, a great game,” Bernard-Henri Lévy, a French author and philosopher, wrote on Twitter. “This is the French art of living together that has been targeted.”Several foreigners, including people from Belgium, Britain, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United States, were killed in the attacks.An American student from California State University in Long Beach, Nohemi Gonzalez, 23, also died in the Paris attacks. She was spending a semester at the Strate School of Design in Paris.Valentin Ribet, a 26-year-old lawyer, was killed at the Bataclan concert hall during a sold-out show by the American rock band Eagles of Death Metal.Guillaume B. Decherf, 43, a critic at a French cultural magazine and a father of two, was killed as well. Three employees from Universal Music France also died, as did Nick Alexander, a British citizen who sold merchandise for the band, and Aurélie De Peretti, 33.“Yesterday, the victims weren’t journalists or famous. They were civilians,” Maxim Ferron, manager of a Paris tea shop, said on Saturday.You can sign up here to get the regular weekday Morning Briefing delivered to your inbox.

"Democratic U.S. presidential candidates Senator Bernie Sanders (L), former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley pose on stage ahead of the second official 2016 U.S. Democratic presidential candidates debate in Des Moines, Iowa, November 14, 2015.   (REUTERS/Jim Young)Hillary Clinton was put on the defensive at the opening of Saturday night’s Democratic presidential debate over military interventions she backed in countries now gripped by instability.The debate in Des Moines, Iowa, came in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which thrust the issues of national security and foreign policy back to the center of the 2016 campaign. The debate format was changed to focus anew on those issues.But, citing the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa, Clinton’s rivals criticized her Senate vote for use of force before the Iraq war and appeared to criticize her support for toppling Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley said America’s role is not to roam the world “looking for new dictators to topple.”He said it is also important to understand “secondary and third consequences” that come after removing a “single dictator.” O’Malley called Libya, Syria and other countries in the region a “mess.”Clinton defended her support for toppling Qaddafi, saying he was threatening a “genocide” and America’s European and Arab allies asked for U.S. support.She also said “it is imperative” that the U.S. do more to confront the “arc of instability” in the region. And to O’Malley’s critique, she said, “I don’t think you can paint with a broad brush,” and “This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.”Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, referenced Clinton’s support for use of force in Iraq and said the “disastrous invasion” led “to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS.”Clinton again called her Iraq war vote a “mistake,” but disputed that the war is the only driver of modern terrorism.The candidates also condemned the Paris terror attacks.“Our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough,” Clinton said.She called for global “resolve” to “root out” the “radical jihadist ideology” that motivates groups like the Islamic State. Clinton, a former secretary of state, said she would coordinate efforts “against the scourge of terrorism.”“It cannot be contained. It must be defeated,” she said of ISIS.Sanders blasted ISIS as a “barbarous organization.”O’Malley called this the “new face” of terror threats.The attacks across multiple locations in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded hundreds, officials said. In a primary race otherwise dominated by the economy, climate and front-runner Clinton’s personal record, the debate in Des Moines, Iowa, now is expected to focus heavily on security and foreign policy after debate host CBS News reworked the format.  It is an area where Clinton, as former secretary of state, enters with the thickest resume – but also one that could prove problematic, given her involvement shaping the policies in increasingly unstable and chaotic nations like Libya and Syria.Sanders, after appearing to give her a pass at the first debate over her personal email controversy, has in recent weeks shown a greater interest in criticizing her record. But his focus on issues like income inequality could be out of place in a discussion focused on global security challenges. Sanders’ campaign objected to some of the CBS News debate tweaks, sources said.Clinton also enters this debate – hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV and The Des Moines Register – facing a narrower field than at their first encounter in October. Since that debate, two candidates have dropped out, leaving only Sanders and O’Malley.Clinton is seen to have otherwise strengthened her hand since that debate, making it through a lengthy hearing before the Benghazi congressional committee and seeing one of her biggest potential political threats – a late bid by Vice President Biden – disappear as the vice president announced he would not run.Sanders remains Clinton’s biggest challenge, and has stirred an enthusiasm in the Democratic base that Clinton has struggled to evoke.

"The fight against global terrorism will take center stage Saturday night when Democrats gather in Iowa to debate after the gruesome attacks in Paris that laid bare the kinds of threats the next American president will face.A month after the Democratic presidential candidates clashed on gun control and financial regulations in their first debate, which focused largely on domestic and economic issues, they are expected to face more questions on foreign policy and national security. Hours after the deadly attacks, CBS News, a co-host of the event, said it would refocus the debate to give candidates an opportunity to discuss how they would respond to such an international crisis.Despite the tragic nature of the events, the new backdrop represents an opportunity for Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former secretary of state, to shine at a moment when her two remaining rivals, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Martin O’Malley — neither of whom has much foreign policy experience — will be under pressure to blunt her momentum.Since Mrs. Clinton’s crisp debate performance in October, her poll numbers have surged, she weathered hours of congressional questioning about her handling of the Benghazi attacks, and three of her rivals for the nomination have dropped out.“It will be interesting to see if Secretary Clinton can keep doing what she’s been doing,” said Brad Anderson, who was President Obama’s 2012 state director in Iowa. “Her steadiness is why you’re seeing her poll numbers continue to increase, especially when you look at what’s happening on the other side of the aisle.”A New York Times/CBS News survey released this week showed Mrs. Clinton continuing to dominate the race, with more than half of Democratic primary voters backing her and 62 percent thinking she is the candidate who can bring about change in Washington. The shift in the debate’s emphasis to foreign affairs should allow Mrs. Clinton to highlight her deep experience on the international stage, providing an opportunity to extend her advantage.For Mrs. Clinton’s opponents, the debate presents a chance to tell voters otherwise, and her Senate votes and handling of international crises as a senator and a diplomat could come under scrutiny.Still, the event is not expected to resemble the free-for-all atmosphere that has marked Republican debates, which have featured sharp exchanges and personal attacks. While the Republican primary contest is a crowded affair, the Democrats will have considerably more time to make their cases and delve into more detailed policy arguments on Saturday with just three candidates on the stage. Since the last debate, Lincoln Chafee, the former governor of Rhode Island, and former Senator Jim Webb of Virginia have dropped out of the race. Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard professor who was running as a Democrat but was not included in the last debate, also stopped his campaign.Mr. Sanders will get another opportunity to take a harder line against Mrs. Clinton, after he dismissed the controversy surrounding her use of a private email server as secretary of state and largely avoided attacking her directly in their first face-off. He has been preparing sharper lines against Mrs. Clinton on issues like trade, gun control and her emails, and his advisers say he has been studying her record more closely since their October meeting.Democratic strategists say the debate will also be a significant moment for Mr. O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, whose poll numbers lag in the low single digits. Facing Mrs. Clinton’s star power and the grass-roots support behind Mr. Sanders, Mr. O’Malley needs to find a way to capture some of the spotlight.“It’s the play that he has left in his playbook right now, to come out swinging and let people know he’s not just this nice guy and that he can be tough,” said Kevin Geiken, a Democratic political consultant for Bluprint Strategies.Still, it will be a challenge to rattle Mrs. Clinton, who has lurched to the left on issues like trade and the environment while showing a deft ability to repel criticism of her 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq war and her warm relationship with Wall Street.One area on the domestic front that is likely to come up is the issue of criminal justice reform, which the three candidates have been struggling to address after continuing tension between the police and African-Americans.DeRay Mckesson, a leader of the Black Lives Matter movement, said he had a good sense of the plans from Mr. Sanders and Mr. O’Malley, but had not heard a comprehensive proposal on the issue of criminal justice from Mrs. Clinton, despite her meetings with the group.“She’s been eking it out literally one speech at a time,” Mr. McKesson said. “With Hillary, I only have a surface-level understanding. The debate is a chance to learn what she really thinks about the core issues.”But voters will only learn if they tune in. Some political enthusiasts have complained that because of its Saturday night time slot, the two-hour debate, which will be hosted by CBS News and The Des Moines Register and begin at 9 p.m. Eastern time, may not have the audience of previous events that have drawn millions of viewers.Mr. Anderson, the Iowa strategist, noted that the candidates would convene at the same time that the undefeated Iowa Hawkeyes take on the Minnesota Golden Gophers in college football.“The majority of Iowans will be planning their day around that football game,” he said.",ALAN RAPPEPORT,The fight against global terrorism will take center stage after attacks in Paris that laid bare the kinds of threats the next American president will face.,Democratic Debate Has an Unplanned Theme: Terrorism,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/us/politics/democratic-debate-cbs.html,['racial issues'],"['Timothy Anderson', 'Lawrence Lessig', 'Martin O'Malley""""", 'Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Jim Webb', 'Brad Anderson', 'Bernie Sanders'," 'Lincoln Chafee']""",nyt,0.9148687153485446,"[{'author_id': 8381, 'fullname': 'alan rappeport', 'primary_org': 'nyt'}]",2015-11-15 00:33:01,['Senate'],b770967da0ca9ceede7aa3742385563f,2015-11-15 01:00:52.953328

"AMES, Iowa – The day after a debate in which Democratic presidential candidates tangled over the causes of Islamic State terrorism but not how to confront it, Hillary Rodham Clinton offered a more forward-looking view of American leadership in response to the threat.“We have to be rallying our partners and allies, pulling countries off the sidelines,” Mrs. Clinton said on Sunday. She called the Islamic State “the first Internet-fueled terrorist group,” which will require strong countermeasures to its propaganda and recruitment.Speaking at an indoor barbecue lunch hosted by several Iowa counties’ Democratic parties, Mrs. Clinton offered no specifics. But she suggested a more proactive approach than she had in the debate, when she dodged a question about whether the Obama administration had underestimated the Islamic State and seemed to take a fatalistic view of terrorism connected to chaos in the Middle East.  “Attacking Paris, the city of light, reminds us that there is no middle ground in going after these terrorists,’’ Mrs. Clinton said. She was notably alone in bringing up the Paris attacks. Former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland, who also spoke at the event, focused almost entirely on domestic issues. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was represented by a surrogate, the former Princeton professor Cornel West.     Mrs. Clinton implicitly pressed her claim as the most qualified Democratic candidate for commander in chief, highlighting terrorism at a moment that the campaigns of both parties seem likely to pivot to national security and American leadership in the world. Although many pundits scored Saturday’s debate a draw, with Mr. O’Malley having his best night yet and Mr. Sanders more focused in his responses, a focus group of undecided Democrats in Des Moines, where the debate took place, gave Mrs. Clinton a clear win.  All 33 likely caucus-goers in the group thought Mrs. Clinton would be the stronger commander in chief, said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic consultant who conducted the focus group.  “It was clear that Clinton’s answers on terrorism, and her improved answers on domestic issues, moved undecided Iowans in striking ways,’’ he said.       Mr. Kofinis identified one vulnerability: Mrs. Clinton’s ties to Wall Street, exemplified by an answer to a question about accepting donations from rich bankers that has been widely mocked. Mr. O’Malley echoed the critique on Sunday, dismissing her explanation that she has been flooded with Wall Street donations in gratitude for her help in rebuilding the New York financial district after the terrorist attacks of 2001. Mrs. Clinton “sadly invoked 9/11 to try to mask’’ her ties to Wall Street bankers, Mr. O’Malley said on Sunday.    The crowd of several hundred largely older Democrats did not respond strongly to Mr. O’Malley’s critiques of Mrs. Clinton, which  included sharper barbs than usual  about her record on guns and immigration.The crowd, which swarmed Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton after she spoke, seemed pragmatic with less than three months before the Iowa caucuses and as Mr. Sanders’s summer surge in the state appears to be ebbing.  “Personally, I like what Sanders and O’Malley have to say,’’ Glenda Eggerling, a retiree, said.  “But I think Hillary will appeal to more voters, and I would really like to see a Democrat in the White House, because I don’t like Republicans’ platforms.’’Sandra McJimsey, also a retiree, said, “I think Bernie has done a great service to the party,” but she declared herself “energized to vote for Hillary.’’Despite their embrace of Mrs. Clinton’s foreign policy experience, Iowa Democrats had no interest in committing ground troops to fight the Islamic State, as several Republican candidates have advocated, or in declaring war, as Jeb Bush suggested on Sunday.Chas Weber, a retiree who recently moved to Ames from Michigan, said the Paris attacks and confronting the Islamic State were “this week’s hot topic,’’ which he predicted would soon give way to something else.An independent who is candidate shopping, Mr. Weber plans to attend a rally for Donald J. Trump later in the week.  But he said he was no fan of Mr. Trump’s call to aggressively bomb the Islamic State and commit ground troops.  “He’s an extremist with no experience,’’ he said.

"WashingtonThe Democratic candidates for president gathered in Des Moines, Iowa, for their second debate Saturday, and CNN's Reality Check team spent the night putting their statements and assertions to the test.The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN selected key statements and rated them: True; Mostly True; True, but Misleading; False; or It's Complicated.Previous CNN Reality Check coverage of the Democratic and Republican candidates can be found here. This story will be updated throughout the night.Reality Check: Sanders on vets with PTSDBy Debra Goldschmidt, CNN HealthVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said, ""When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war, the 500,000 who came home with PTSD and traumatic brain injury.""Roughly 2.6 million veterans served in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs says 11% to 20% of military members who served in Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from PTSD.According to a Veteran Affairs independent study on traumatic brain injury, self-reported data found 15% of troops who were engaged in active combat in Afghanistan and Iraq ""may have suffered"" a mild traumatic brain injury. This falls in line with a report from the Brain Trauma Foundation, which found between 10% to 20% of Iraq veterans suffer from some level of traumatic brain disorder.Verdict: TrueReality Check: O'Malley on net immigration from MexicoBy Sonam Vashi, CNNFormer Gov. Martin O'Malley said, ""The truth of the matter is net immigration from Mexico last year was zero."" He then challenged viewers to fact-check him, and we couldn't resist.According to the Pew Research Center, net migration from Mexico probably reached zero in 2010, and more Mexicans have left the United States than arrived since then.Additionally, the actual number of Mexicans living in the United States consistently declined throughout 2014. The U.S. Border Patrol also reported that in the 2014 fiscal year, the number of Mexicans apprehended along the border decreased 14% when compared to the 2013 fiscal year.The information we have suggests that the net immigration rate is negative -- which is actually not zero -- but it is close, and probably still supports O'Malley's point.Verdict: Mostly true",,,Democratic debate: CNN's Reality Check team inspects the claims,http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/14/politics/democratic-debate-fact-check/index.html,['immigration'],"['Bernie Sanders', 'Martin O'Malley""""]""",cnn,0.5480945459848154,"[{'author_id': 45638, 'fullname': 'cnn's reality check team"""""," 'primary_org': 'cnn'}]""",2015-11-15 04:09:39,"['U.S. Border Patrol', 'Pew Research Center']",5f763ceb49f12a5e357faeff8b4407dd,2015-11-15 04:16:08.650830

Why do — why, over her political career has Wall Street been a major — the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton? You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.Here is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street. It ain't complicated. You have six financial institutions today that have assets of 56%, equivalent to 56% of the GDP In America. They issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages.If Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, were alive today, you know what he'd say? ""Break them up."" Reestablish Glass-Steagall. And Teddy Roosevelt is right. That is the issue. Now I am the only candidate up here that doesn't have a super PAC. I am not asking Wall Street or the billionaires for money. I will break up these banks. Support community banks and credit unions. That's the future of banking in America.DICKERSON: Great follow up because you — and Secretary Clinton, you will get a chance to respond. You said they know what they're going to get. What are they going to get?SANDERS: I have never heard a candidate never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me. I'm going to be independent. Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? they expect to get something. Everybody knows that. Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate. We are relying on small campaign donors, 750,000 of them, 30 bucks a piece. That's who I'm indebted to.CLINTON: Well, John, wait a minute. Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impune my integrity. Let's be frank here.SANDERS: No, I have not. CLINTON: Oh, wait a minute, senator. You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small. And I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60%So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked. Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.So, you know, it's fine for you to say what yo're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal. Reinstating Glass-Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough.
