Chris Christie had to leave an Amtrak \u201cquiet\u201d car for talking on his cellphone Sunday morning, shortly after boarding a north-bound train from Washington, D.C.\nA fellow passenger told the website Gawker that Christie boarded the 9:55 a.m. train at the last minute and had a loud discussion with his two-man security detail about\u00a0seating, then had an \u201cintense\u201d talk on his cellphone before being approached by a conductor.\nThe conductor purportedly asked Christie, known for his bombastic manner, to either concluded the call or move to a talking-permissible car.\nCampaign official Samantha Smith acknowledged the incident but said Christie mistakenly sat in the no-talking car \u201con a very full train\u201d and apologized for the mistake and inconveniencing fellow passengers\n\u201cAfter breaking the cardinal rule of the quiet car, the governor promptly left once he realized the serious nature of his mistake and enjoyed the rest of his time on the train from the cafe car,\u201d Smith said in a statement. \u201cSincere apologies to all the patrons of the quiet car that were offended.\u201d\nShe also said Christie wasn't asked to leave and referred FoxNews.com to a Twitter feed of a purported female passenger who said the conductor only pointed out to Christie that he was in a quiet car.\u00a0\n\nThe passenger also told Gawker that Christie was drinking a McDonald\u2019s strawberry smoothie and kept repeating into his phone: \u201cThis is frickin\u2019 ridiculous\u201d and \u201cseriously?\u201d\nAmtrak conductors generally urge passengers to maintain a \"library-like atmosphere\" in the quiet car. It's not uncommon for conductors to ask noisier passengers to change cars.\nThe Republican presidential hopeful had appeared on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" earlier in the morning.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0\n\u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Christie asked to leave Amtrak 'quiet' car for phone call, campaign apologizes", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/25/christie-asked-to-leave-amtrak-quiet-car-for-phone-call-campaign-say-mistake/", "topics": ["environment/energy", "budget/taxation", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Chris Christie", "Samantha Smith"], "orgs": ["Amtrak"], "election_confidence": 0.5469079708753891, "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-10-25 22:05:39", "org": "fox", "article_id": "76ec376cd52f131b7768ce88234a1838", "date_access": "2015-10-25 21:30:08.586276"}
