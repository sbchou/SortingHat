Paul Ryan got added support Sunday from a key part of the chamber\u2019s Republican conference when the leader of the House Freedom Caucus said he was the \u201cright guy\u201d to be the next speaker.\n\u201cWe think Paul has the kind of vision and is the kind of messenger our party needs to accomplish the things we told the voters we\u2019re going to accomplish,\u201d group Chairman Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\nRyan, House Ways and Means Committee chairman and 2012 vice presidential candidate, was recruited by Capitol Hill Republicans to become the next House speaker.\nRyan agreed to run for the post after talking last week with members of the Freedom Caucus -- part of the chamber\u2019s most conservative wing, which largely forced House Speaker John Boehner to resign in late-September.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t quite get the endorsement threshold we have in our group, but a super majority of our members said we think Paul Ryan is the right guy at the right time to lead our conference,\u201d Jordan also said Sunday.\nThe small-but-powerful wing continuously disagreed with Boehner and members of the leadership team, accusing them of not digging in hard enough on spending cuts, repealing ObamaCare and other important conservative issues.\n\nRyan in talking with the caucus members reportedly agreed to address their concerns including committee leadership assignments and legislation from rank-and-file members not getting more consideration.\nThe speaker vote is expected later this week.\n\u201cWe have a commitment from Paul to work on changing the rules and we may even get a change before the vote this coming Wednesday and Thursday,\u201d Jordan said.\nRyan was recruited after a couple of wild weeks after Boehner\u2019s resignation. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the second-in-command, dropped out of the race after suggesting the House Select Committee on Benghazi was responsible for damaging the campaign of Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton. And South Carolina GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy, chairman of the Benghazi committee, was mentioned for the job, but he quickly and emphatically declined.\nRyan needs 218 votes from the chamber\u2019s 434 members, including 246 Republicans.\nHe has made clear he doesn't want to squeak by in the vote. Last week, he got support from the Republican Study Committee and the Tuesday Group, two key groups that should help him get enough votes.", "byline": "", "description": "Wisconsin GOP Rep.
