But, you know, I am soft-spoken. I do have a tendency to be relaxed,\u201d Carson said in an interview aired Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press.\u201d \nStory Continued Below\nCarson was responding to Trump\u2019s renewed line of attack, repeated in Iowa, that Carson is \u201csuper low energy\u201d as he pulled ahead there last week in a pair of key polls.\n\"You know, everybody has their own personality. And if he'd like to do that, that's fine. That's not who I am,\" the retired neurosurgeon said of Trump. \"I don't get into the mud pit. And I'm not going to be talking about people. I will tell you in terms of energy I'm not sure that there's anybody else running who's spent 18 or 20 hours intently operating on somebody.\"\nIn the interview aired Sunday, Carson also defended his controversial comments about how gun control allowed the Nazis to carry out the Holocaust. \n\u201cIn the last several weeks, I've heard from many people in the Jewish community, including rabbis, who said, \u2018You're spot on. You are exactly right,\u2019\u201d Carson said. \u201cI think it is generally agreed that it's much more difficult to dominate people who are armed than people who are not armed.\n\"You know,\" he added, \"some people will try to take that and, you know, make it into an anti-Jewish thing, which is foolishness.\u201d\nOn abortion, Carson said he \u201cwould love\u201d to see Roe v. Wade overturned, and abortion should be illegal even in cases of rape or incest. \nThere should be room to discuss abortion in cases where the mother\u2019s life is in danger, he added, though \u201cin the ideal situation, the mother should not believe that the baby is her enemy and should not be looking to terminate the baby.\u201d\nAnd on Syria, Carson said he would talk with Russia without capitulating to them. \nRussian President Vladimr Putin \"has expansionist ideals,\u201d Carson said. \u201cWhen he came into Syria, he said he was coming there to fight ISIS. But was he really? ... It was the anti-Assad forces that he was there to fight. So, you know, we have to look at that. And I think we have to oppose him.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Carson: I&#8217;m not super low energy, just soft-spoken", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/ben-carson-trump-energy-215137", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Katy O'Donnell", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Rachael Bade", "Henry C.
