{"body": " Ben Carson, suddenly in the political spotlight as he surges into the lead in Iowa polls, Sunday defended his more controversial statements and his low key style.\n\u201cI will tell you, in terms of energy, I'm not sure that there's anybody else running who has spent 18 or 20 hours intently operating on somebody,\u201d the retired neurosurgeon told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\nHe recalled a time when he was more aggressive.\n\"As a teenager, I would go after people with rocks, and bricks, and baseball bats, and hammers. And, of course, many people know the story when I was 14 and I tried to stab someone,\" Carson said.\n\"You know, fortunately, you know, my life has been been changed,\" he added. \"And I'm a very different person now.\u201d\nCarson has opened up wide leads among Republicans in Iowa in polls released last week by Quinnipiac University and Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register. He and real estate mogul Donald Trump will be at center stage Wednesday when Republicans debate in Boulder, Colorado.\nTrump criticized Carson Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\u201cI think Ben Carson is a very low energy person. Actually I think Ben Carson is lower energy than Jeb (Bush), if you want to know the truth,\u201d Trump said.\nTrump insisted Carson\u2019s SuperPAC, the 2016 Committee, is a big reason he\u2019s doing well in Iowa. \u201cHe's got people all over Iowa from his PAC, and they are running - Ben doesn't even go to Iowa that much. And he's doing well in Iowa? And so I think that SuperPACs are a real problem in terms of our country, and I'm talking about Ben,\u201d Trump said.\nTrump also discussed his comment about Carson\u2019s religion; he is a Seventh Day Adventist. On Saturday, Trump told a Jacksonville, Florida audience \u201cI just don\u2019t know\u201d about Seventh Day Adventists.\n\u201cI know nothing about it really. I\u2019m a Presbyterian and I had mentioned that, and I did say I don\u2019t know about it, and in fact those are my exact word, so I just really don\u2019t know about the Seventh-Day Adventists, and that\u2019s what I said,\u201d Trump said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d never say bad about any religion,\u201d Trump said, though he would not apologize to Carson. \u201cI would certainly give an apology if I said something bad about it, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d\nCarson has also come under fire for controversial comments. In 2013, He called Obamacare \u201cthe worst thing to happen in this nation since slavery.\u201d Last year he compared the U.S. to Nazi Germany, saying a lot of Americans \u201cdo not feel free to express themselves.\u201d\nIn September he said he would not advocated that the nation put a Muslim in charge, and after a gunman went on a killing rampage at an Oregon college earlier this month, Carson said, \u201cwould not just stand there\u201d and let him shoot.\nCarson and his supporters have urged listening beyond the sound bite to what he has to say.\n\"As people get to know me, they know that I'm not a hateful, pathological person like some people try to make me out to be,\u201d Carson said Sunday. \u201cAnd that will be self-evident. So I don't really worry about that.\" \nCarson has strong appeal to evangelical voters, a sizable bloc in Iowa. He said Sunday he\u2019d like to see tough laws against abortion.\n\"I'm a reasonable person and if people can come up with a reasonable explanation of why they would like to kill a baby, I'll listen,\" he said.\nDavid Lightman: 202-383-6101, @lightmandavid", "byline": "", "description": "Trump: Carson is \u2018low energy\u2019\nCarson fights back, quietly\nCarson leading in two Iowa polls\n\u2026\nClick to Continue \u00bb", "title": "Carson, now in spotlight, defends his gentle style", "url": "http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article41382390.html", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "David Lightman", "Ben Carson"], "orgs": ["PAC", "Des Moines Register", "Quinnipiac University"], "election_confidence": 0.9779734469037571, "authors": [{"author_id": 33909, "fullname": "david lightman", "primary_org": "mcclatchy"}], "date_written": "2015-10-25 17:13:02", "org": "mcclatchy", "article_id": "c15688b819d1d1138d162cea15f6114e", "date_access": "2015-10-25 16:31:11.657117"}
