Close to an hour after the other candidates and most of the attendees had cleared out of the Hy-Vee Center in downtown Des Moines, Bill and Hillary Clinton were still schmoozing with a small group of lingering fans.\nStory Continued Below\nAnd while Hillary Clinton ignored reporters and focused on the Iowans there to meet her, Bill Clinton proved once again there\u2019s no subject he doesn\u2019t want to expound on\u2014 and that he can\u2019t resist chatting with reporters.\nAfter posing for a string of selfies, he engaged reporters who asked him how the iPhone has changed his interactions with voters. While people used to approach politicians with a question, he said, now they simply hold out their phones for a picture.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dominant force that\u2019s allowed to interrupt conversations,\u201d he said, \u201cI think, on balance, it\u2019s been a great thing for people.\u201d\nBut he admitted that if iPhones had been around when he was governor of Arkansas, \u201cI might never have lived to run for President. I spent my time doing uber retail politics.\u201d\nThe former president, making his first official appearance on the campaign trail for his wife over the weekend, also waxed philosophical about the art of the selfie. \u201cIt has democratized picture-taking and record-keeping \u2014 and that\u2019s good,\u201d he said.\nClinton said he even requests his own selfies sometimes. \n\u201cI\u2019ve been with people who are taking selfies with me, and I thought they were interesting looking people, total strangers, but I thought it was an interesting setting,\u201d he said of when he has requested his own copy. He didn\u2019t answer when a reporter asked him what, in his view, constituted an interesting looking person.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s a dominant force that\u2019s allowed to interrupt conversations.\u201d", "title": "Bill Clinton is fond of selfies", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/hillary-bill-clinton-selfies-schmoozing-215148", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Katy O'Donnell", "Arthur Allen", "Rachael Bade", "Henry C.
