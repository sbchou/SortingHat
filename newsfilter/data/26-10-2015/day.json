[{"body": " (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump mocked former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in his own state on Saturday, saying recent campaign cuts show he's not ready to be president.\n\"Here's a guy who wants to run our country, and he can't even run his own campaign. And you know what? He's cutting back big,\" Trump told a raucous crowd of thousands gathered along the riverfront of one of Florida's most conservative cities.\nThe comment came the day after the Bush campaign said it was cutting payroll by 40 percent by trimming staff and requiring an across the board pay cut for those remaining.\nTrump said Bush, the son and brother for former presidents, is \"losing badly and embarrassing his family.\"\n\"Bush has no money. He's cutting. He's meeting today with mommy and daddy and they're working on their campaign,\" Trump said.\nHe chastised Bush for paying his finance director more than $1 million and said that if campaign staffers were willing to work for lower pay, he should have made that deal when the campaign started.\n\"You don't wait till you're failing,\" he said.\nBy contrast, Trump said he's only spent about $2 million on his campaign and he's leading in polls.\n\"So, I've put up less money than anybody else and I'm No. 1,\" he said. \"Wouldn't it be better if we had a country that would spend the least and be No. 1? Think about it.\"\nThe Bush campaign responded by saying people are getting tired of Trump.\n\"Donald Trump needs a new schtick. Launching absurd attacks at his opponents to distract from his lack of ideas and liberal record is beginning to wear thin with voters. Donald Trump is increasingly showing each day that he is not a serious enough person to be commander in chief and lead the world's most powerful military,\" Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said in an email.\nIf people are tiring of him, it didn't show Saturday. An overflow crowd gathered at a downtown open-air mall for his visit. Brandon Chance, 25, wore a T-shirt with an artistic rendition of Trump pointing that said \"Washington, D.C. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 You're Fired.\" Chance said one of the reasons he likes Trump is that he's never held political office and is paying for his own campaign.\n\"He's not relying on people to work him like a puppet,\" Chance said. \"Politicians just B.S. everybody. They feed everybody a line. Politicians just lie.\"\nBush wasn't the only rival Trump targeted during a speech that lasted about an hour and 20 minutes. Florida's junior senator, Marco Rubio, and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson also took hits.\n\"You've got Rubio doing poorly, and he sweats like a dog,\" Trump said. \"You've got Carson. I don't know what the hell's going on there. I don't get it.\"\nIt was the second straight day Trump campaigned in Florida, where he leads in recent polls \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a point he took joy in letting the crowd know.\n\"Trump is No. 1. Rubio, waaaaay back,\" Trump said. \"You're talking about a guy who's sweating, now he's really sweating.\"\nHe also said Rubio is disloyal because he is challenging Bush for the nomination after saying for years that Bush was his political mentor.\n\"Everybody said he'd never run. Even I thought, he'll never run because Bush was his mentor.\" Trump said. \"Those two guys are fighting like crazy, and I'm laughing watching them fight.\"\nA spokesman for Carson, Doug Watts, said in an email: \"We love and respect Mr. Trump.\"\nThe Rubio's campaign didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.", "byline": "", "description": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla.

{"body": " (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Bernie Sanders sharpened the contrast with Hillary Rodham Clinton on a bevy of liberal causes on Saturday, casting himself as a principled progressive before thousands of Iowa Democrats in an appearance that could set the tone for the leadoff presidential caucuses in February.\nSanders, the independent Vermont senator, never mentioned Clinton by name at the high-profile fundraising dinner but implicitly criticized her delayed opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Keystone XL pipeline as well as her vote in favor of the Iraq war and passage of the Defense of Marriage Act during her husband's administration.\n\"I promise you tonight as your president I will govern based on principle not poll numbers,\" Sanders said, eliciting roars from his supporters.\nClinton did not respond in kind, making the case that she would be best equipped to take on the Republicans. \"I hear Donald Trump when he says we have to make America great again,\" Clinton said. \"America is great \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we just have to make it fair and just.\"\nClinton and Sanders sit atop a Democratic presidential field that was effectively pared down to two after Vice President Joe Biden announced this week he would not seek the nomination.\nClinton made a direct appeal to Biden's supporters, saying that the vice president has been at Obama's side every step of the way. \"He has fought passionately for middle-class families and middle-class values,\" she said.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who trails both by a wide margin, reached for a breakout performance at the dinner, presenting himself as a fresh face in the party, who got things done in his home state.\n\"We cannot move beyond today's gridlocked politics by returning to the divisions of our past,\" O'Malley said. \"I'm not about that.\"\nThe speech marked a more aggressive turn by Sanders, who struggled at times to scrutinize Clinton's record during their first debate in Las Vegas earlier this month.\nIn that encounter, Clinton offered a full-throated rebuke of Sanders' record on gun control, noting his opposition to the 1993 Brady Bill and his backing of a 2005 law that shields gun manufacturers, distributors and dealers from most liability lawsuits.\nThis time, Clinton only made a passing reference to Sanders on gun control, saying, \"I won't be silent\" on the issue.\nSanders, meanwhile, pointedly assailed the passage of the Defense of Marriage Act during Bill Clinton's administration, saying, \"some are trying to rewrite history by saying they voted for one anti-gay law to stop something worse. That's not the case.\" Hillary Clinton said in an interview with MSNBC on Friday that the law was signed as a \"defensive action.\"\nSanders vowed \"not to abandon any segment of American society whether you're gay or black or Latino or poor or working class \u00e2\u0080\u0094 just because it is politically expedient at a given time.\"\nClinton placed third in Iowa in 2008 and has since built a formidable organization to power her to victory here.\nEight years ago, Obama suggested Clinton was motivated by polls and triangulation while the then-New York senator countered that \"change is just a word\" unless you have the strength and experience to lead.\nThis time, Clinton presented herself as Obama's heir, warning Republicans would seek to slash taxes for the wealthy and repeal President Barack Obama's health care law.\n\"I'm running as a proud Democrat,\" the former secretary of state said to a large cheering section that waved blue neon sticks. \"We need to defend the progress we've made under President Obama and build on it until the recovery is secure.\"\nBut Republicans insisted Saturday that today's Hillary Clinton is the same one who ran eight years ago.\n\"The Hillary Clinton of 2015 is no different than the Hillary Clinton from 2007, who at the time refused to be straightforward with Iowans,\" said Republican National Committee spokesman Fred Brown. \"Things haven't changed.\"\nOne hundred days remain before Iowans nominate their presidential candidates, and the state Democratic party's annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner drew a raucous crowd of more than 6,600 activists in what traditionally serves as a kickoff to the Iowa caucuses.\nIt capped a daylong pageant of political activities: Former President Bill Clinton headlined his first rally of the campaign, introducing pop singer Katy Perry at a free concert for Clinton's faithful. Sanders led cheering supporters across a Des Moines bridge in a march that included chants of \"Hey, hey, ho, ho, the oligarchy has to go!\"\nClinton's campaign has been on an upswing this month. She received a boost from Biden's decision not to run, then put together a grinding, competent appearance before a Republican-led congressional committee probing the deadly 2012 attacks on diplomatic outposts in Benghazi, Libya.\nTwo lesser-known rivals, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee, abandoned the race following Clinton's strong performance on Oct. 13 in the first primary debate.\nThe dinner, called the \"J-J,\" was an important showcase for Sanders, a Vermont independent who has drawn large crowds with his calls for a \"political revolution\" but trails Clinton in national polls.\nPlaying the role of underdog, Sanders drew a comparison with Obama. \"I think we are going to prove the pundits wrong again.

{"body": " (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Republican U.S. Sen. David Vitter survived challenges Saturday from two GOP rivals who called his years-old prostitution scandal a stain on Louisiana, reaching a runoff against Democratic state Rep. John Bel Edwards in the governor's race.\nThe Nov. 21 runoff will decide who follows Republican presidential hopeful Gov. Bobby Jindal into office, the winner inheriting leadership of a state mired in financial problems that both candidates blame on the term-limited governor. Jindal is now waging a long-shot campaign for the presidential nomination.\nWhile Edwards always seemed assured of a runoff spot, Vitter bested two other major Republicans to secure his position on the November ballot, eclipsing Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle and Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne.\nAnd the race was tighter than Vitter had hoped, with Edwards taking 40 percent of the primary vote and Vitter advancing with 23 percent, according to unofficial returns.\nMonths ago, Vitter was atop the polls, flush with millions in campaign cash and running like an incumbent. But amid continued talk of his 2007 prostitution scandal and a drumbeat of criticism about his attack-heavy campaign tactics, Vitter's negatives spiked among voters. One PAC has been running an \"Anybody But Vitter\" campaign.\nVitter, however, maintained a strong conservative base that propelled him into the runoff.\nThe two runoff contenders immediately took swipes at each other, suggesting the themes voters can expect next.\nSpeaking to supporters, Vitter struck at Edwards for his support of President Barack Obama and criticized him as a liberal who is out of step with Louisiana: \"Voting for John Bel Edwards would be the same as voting to make Barack Obama governor of Louisiana.\"\nEdwards told his backers that Vitter would continue the policies of Jindal, whose approval ratings are even lower than Obama's in the conservative state.\n\"We cannot afford a third Jindal term. That is what David Vitter offers you,\" Edwards said.\nFour statewide incumbents, all Republicans, cruised to re-election in their races: Secretary of State Tom Schedler, Treasurer John Kennedy, Insurance Commissioner Jim Donelon and Agriculture Commissioner Mike Strain. GOP Attorney General Buddy Caldwell will continue to fight to hang onto his seat in the November runoff, with strong competition from Republican former congressman Jeff Landry.\nWith Dardenne making a failed bid for governor, the lieutenant governor's race headed to a runoff between Republican Billy Nungesser, former president of Plaquemines Parish, and Democrat Kip Holden, mayor of Baton Rouge.\nA runoff is held if no candidate tops 50 percent of the vote.\nAn Ivy League-educated Rhodes Scholar from the New Orleans suburbs, Vitter returned to a campaign style that has worked for him in previous races. He ran on conservative values and described himself as a political outsider.\nHe and a super PAC supporting him attacked his GOP competitors as tax-and-spend liberals, suggested Dardenne wasted tax dollars in office and criticized Angelle for resigning as state natural resources secretary only days after a massive sinkhole opened on his watch.\n\"Baton Rouge is broken and dysfunctional, and there are no adult leaders there taking on the big challenges,\" Vitter said in one of only two TV debates he attended.\nWith few policy differences, the race largely came down to personalities \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and a referendum of sorts on whether Vitter's eight-year-old prostitution scandal still resonated with voters. The senator apologized in 2007 for a \"very serious sin\" after he was linked through phone records to Washington's \"D.C. Madam.\"\n\"We are better than this. We can avoid the disappointment, the embarrassment, the ridicule, the shame,\" Dardenne, a former state lawmaker from Baton Rouge, said in an ad that ran on Election Day.\nDardenne ran a campaign suggesting he would be a reform governor who would \"make Louisiana proud.\" Angelle, a French-speaking native of Breaux Bridge with a thick Cajun accent, positioned himself as the conservative candidate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 without a prostitution scandal.\nVitter has dodged talk of the scandal, suggesting he and the voters have moved on.\nWhile his three GOP opponents struck at each other, Edwards saved most of his criticism for Jindal, whom Edwards blamed for causing state finances to crater.\n\"I stood up to Bobby Jindal and his disastrous policies,\" Edwards, a state House Democratic leader from Tangipahoa Parish, said in his campaign.\nEdwards campaigned as a conservative Democrat. He's pro-gun and anti-abortion, and comes from a family of sheriffs. He also has a West Point degree and military background.\nAt least $21 million has been spent so far by candidates and super PACs on the race.\nThe men largely shared similar positions on repairing Louisiana's financial crisis and balancing the budget. They supported a rewrite of the state's tax structure to scale back spending on tax breaks and a lessening of budget protections that leave colleges at most risk for cuts.", "byline": "", "description": "BATON ROUGE, La.

{"body": " (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Republican U.S. Sen. David Vitter survived challenges Saturday from two GOP rivals who called his years-old prostitution scandal a stain on Louisiana, reaching a runoff against Democratic state Rep. John Bel Edwards in the governor's race.\nThe Nov. 21 runoff will decide who follows Republican presidential hopeful Gov. Bobby Jindal into office, the winner inheriting leadership of a state mired in financial problems that both candidates blame on the term-limited governor. Jindal is now waging a long-shot campaign for the presidential nomination.\nWhile Edwards always seemed assured of a runoff spot, Vitter bested two other major Republicans to secure his position on the November ballot, eclipsing Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle and Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne.\nAnd the race was tighter than Vitter had hoped, with Edwards taking 40 percent of the primary vote and Vitter advancing with 23 percent, according to unofficial returns.\nMonths ago, Vitter was atop the polls, flush with millions in campaign cash and running like an incumbent. But amid continued talk of his 2007 prostitution scandal and a drumbeat of criticism about his attack-heavy campaign tactics, Vitter's negatives spiked among voters. One PAC has been running an \"Anybody But Vitter\" campaign.\nVitter, however, maintained a strong conservative base that propelled him into the runoff.\nThe two runoff contenders immediately took swipes at each other, suggesting the themes voters can expect next.\nSpeaking to supporters, Vitter struck at Edwards for his support of President Barack Obama and criticized him as a liberal who is out of step with Louisiana: \"Voting for John Bel Edwards would be the same as voting to make Barack Obama governor of Louisiana.\"\nEdwards told his backers that Vitter would continue the policies of Jindal, whose approval ratings are even lower than Obama's in the conservative state.\n\"We cannot afford a third Jindal term. That is what David Vitter offers you,\" Edwards said.\nFour statewide incumbents, all Republicans, cruised to re-election in their races: Secretary of State Tom Schedler, Treasurer John Kennedy, Insurance Commissioner Jim Donelon and Agriculture Commissioner Mike Strain. GOP Attorney General Buddy Caldwell will continue to fight to hang onto his seat in the November runoff, with strong competition from Republican former congressman Jeff Landry.\nWith Dardenne making a failed bid for governor, the lieutenant governor's race headed to a runoff between Republican Billy Nungesser, former president of Plaquemines Parish, and Democrat Kip Holden, mayor of Baton Rouge.\nA runoff is held if no candidate tops 50 percent of the vote.\nAn Ivy League-educated Rhodes Scholar from the New Orleans suburbs, Vitter returned to a campaign style that has worked for him in previous races. He ran on conservative values and described himself as a political outsider.\nHe and a super PAC supporting him attacked his GOP competitors as tax-and-spend liberals, suggested Dardenne wasted tax dollars in office and criticized Angelle for resigning as state natural resources secretary only days after a massive sinkhole opened on his watch.\n\"Baton Rouge is broken and dysfunctional, and there are no adult leaders there taking on the big challenges,\" Vitter said in one of only two TV debates he attended.\nWith few policy differences, the race largely came down to personalities \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and a referendum of sorts on whether Vitter's eight-year-old prostitution scandal still resonated with voters. The senator apologized in 2007 for a \"very serious sin\" after he was linked through phone records to Washington's \"D.C. Madam.\"\n\"We are better than this. We can avoid the disappointment, the embarrassment, the ridicule, the shame,\" Dardenne, a former state lawmaker from Baton Rouge, said in an ad that ran on Election Day.\nDardenne ran a campaign suggesting he would be a reform governor who would \"make Louisiana proud.\" Angelle, a French-speaking native of Breaux Bridge with a thick Cajun accent, positioned himself as the conservative candidate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 without a prostitution scandal.\nVitter has dodged talk of the scandal, suggesting he and the voters have moved on.\nWhile his three GOP opponents struck at each other, Edwards saved most of his criticism for Jindal, whom Edwards blamed for causing state finances to crater.\n\"I stood up to Bobby Jindal and his disastrous policies,\" Edwards, a state House Democratic leader from Tangipahoa Parish, said in his campaign.\nEdwards campaigned as a conservative Democrat. He's pro-gun and anti-abortion, and comes from a family of sheriffs. He also has a West Point degree and military background.\nAt least $21 million has been spent so far by candidates and super PACs on the race.\nThe men largely shared similar positions on repairing Louisiana's financial crisis and balancing the budget. They supported a rewrite of the state's tax structure to scale back spending on tax breaks and a lessening of budget protections that leave colleges at most risk for cuts.", "byline": "", "description": "BATON ROUGE, La.

And you know what? He's cutting back big,\" Trump told a raucous crowd of thousands gathered along the riverfront of one of Florida's most conservative cities.\nThe comment came the day after the Bush campaign said it was cutting payroll by 40 percent by trimming staff and requiring an across the board pay cut for those remaining.\nTrump said Bush, the son and brother for former presidents, is \"losing badly and embarrassing his family.\"\n\"Bush has no money. He's cutting. He's meeting today with mommy and daddy and they're working on their campaign,\" Trump said.\nHe chastised Bush for paying his finance director more than $1 million and said that if campaign staffers were willing to work for lower pay, he should have made that deal when the campaign started.\n\"You don't wait till you're failing,\" he said.\nBy contrast, Trump said he's only spent about $2 million on his campaign and he's leading in polls.\n\"So, I've put up less money than anybody else and I'm No. 1,\" he said. \"Wouldn't it be better if we had a country that would spend the least and be No. 1? Think about it.\"\nThe Bush campaign responded by saying people are getting tired of Trump.\n\"Donald Trump needs a new schtick. Launching absurd attacks at his opponents to distract from his lack of ideas and liberal record is beginning to wear thin with voters. Donald Trump is increasingly showing each day that he is not a serious enough person to be commander in chief and lead the world's most powerful military,\" Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said in an email.\nIf people are tiring of him, it didn't show Saturday. An overflow crowd gathered at a downtown open-air mall for his visit. Brandon Chance, 25, wore a T-shirt with an artistic rendition of Trump pointing that said \"Washington, D.C. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 You're Fired.\" Chance said one of the reasons he likes Trump is that he's never held political office and is paying for his own campaign.\n\"He's not relying on people to work him like a puppet,\" Chance said. \"Politicians just B.S. everybody. They feed everybody a line. Politicians just lie.\"\nBush wasn't the only rival Trump targeted during a speech that lasted about an hour and 20 minutes. Florida's junior senator, Marco Rubio, and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson also took hits.\n\"You've got Rubio doing poorly, and he sweats like a dog,\" Trump said. \"You've got Carson. I don't know what the hell's going on there. I don't get it.\"\nIt was the second straight day Trump campaigned in Florida, where he leads in recent polls \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a point he took joy in letting the crowd know.\n\"Trump is No. 1. Rubio, waaaaay back,\" Trump said. \"You're talking about a guy who's sweating, now he's really sweating.\"\nHe also said Rubio is disloyal because he is challenging Bush for the nomination after saying for years that Bush was his political mentor.\n\"Everybody said he'd never run.

David Vitter survived challenges Saturday from two GOP rivals who called his years-old prostitution scandal a stain on Louisiana, reaching a runoff against Democratic state Rep. John Bel Edwards in the governor's race.\nThe Nov. 21 runoff will decide who follows Republican presidential hopeful Gov. Bobby Jindal into office, the winner inheriting leadership of a state mired in financial problems that both candidates blame on the term-limited governor. Jindal is now waging a long-shot campaign for the presidential nomination.\nWhile Edwards always seemed assured of a runoff spot, Vitter bested two other major Republicans to secure his position on the November ballot, eclipsing Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle and Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne.\nAnd the race was tighter than Vitter had hoped, with Edwards taking 40 percent of the primary vote and Vitter advancing with 23 percent, according to unofficial returns.\nMonths ago, Vitter was atop the polls, flush with millions in campaign cash and running like an incumbent. But amid continued talk of his 2007 prostitution scandal and a drumbeat of criticism about his attack-heavy campaign tactics, Vitter's negatives spiked among voters. One PAC has been running an \"Anybody But Vitter\" campaign.\nVitter, however, maintained a strong conservative base that propelled him into the runoff.\nThe two runoff contenders immediately took swipes at each other, suggesting the themes voters can expect next.\nSpeaking to supporters, Vitter struck at Edwards for his support of President Barack Obama and criticized him as a liberal who is out of step with Louisiana: \"Voting for John Bel Edwards would be the same as voting to make Barack Obama governor of Louisiana.\"\nEdwards told his backers that Vitter would continue the policies of Jindal, whose approval ratings are even lower than Obama's in the conservative state.\n\"We cannot afford a third Jindal term. That is what David Vitter offers you,\" Edwards said.\nFour statewide incumbents, all Republicans, cruised to re-election in their races: Secretary of State Tom Schedler, Treasurer John Kennedy, Insurance Commissioner Jim Donelon and Agriculture Commissioner Mike Strain. GOP Attorney General Buddy Caldwell will continue to fight to hang onto his seat in the November runoff, with strong competition from Republican former congressman Jeff Landry.\nWith Dardenne making a failed bid for governor, the lieutenant governor's race headed to a runoff between Republican Billy Nungesser, former president of Plaquemines Parish, and Democrat Kip Holden, mayor of Baton Rouge.\nA runoff is held if no candidate tops 50 percent of the vote.\nAn Ivy League-educated Rhodes Scholar from the New Orleans suburbs, Vitter returned to a campaign style that has worked for him in previous races. He ran on conservative values and described himself as a political outsider.\nHe and a super PAC supporting him attacked his GOP competitors as tax-and-spend liberals, suggested Dardenne wasted tax dollars in office and criticized Angelle for resigning as state natural resources secretary only days after a massive sinkhole opened on his watch.\n\"Baton Rouge is broken and dysfunctional, and there are no adult leaders there taking on the big challenges,\" Vitter said in one of only two TV debates he attended.\nWith few policy differences, the race largely came down to personalities \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and a referendum of sorts on whether Vitter's eight-year-old prostitution scandal still resonated with voters. The senator apologized in 2007 for a \"very serious sin\" after he was linked through phone records to Washington's \"D.C. Madam.\"\n\"We are better than this.

Bernie Sanders, rallied thousands of cheering supporters before marching across a bridge spanning the Des Moines River, telling them: \"This country belongs to all of us, not just wealthy campaign donors.\"\nOne hundred days remain before Iowa's leadoff presidential caucuses, and the afternoon events were designed to generate enthusiasm before the state Democratic party's annual Jefferson-Jackson fundraising dinner.\n\"She's my firework,\" Perry told Clinton's supporters, wearing a white strapless gown adorned with a Clinton campaign logo and a flowing American flag cape at a free concert.\nBill Clinton told the rally that during the last few weeks the nation has \"learned a lot about Hillary, what she's for, why she's running and what kind of president she would be.\" With tongue in cheek, he complained that he was tired of women having a \"stranglehold\" on the position of first spouse and hoped to break that White House gender barrier.\nMore than 6,000 activists were expected at the dinner, which traditionally serves as a kickoff to the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses.\nClinton and Sanders sit atop a Democratic presidential field that has effectively pared down to a two-person race for the nomination after Vice President Joe Biden announced this week he would not seek the White House.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley hoped for a breakout performance at the dinner, which catapulted President Barack Obama in the fall of 2007 and led to his surprising victory in the caucuses.\nIn the hours before the fundraiser, Iowa's capitol city was full of pageantry as supporters of the three campaigns poured into Des Moines wearing T-shirts and waving signs. Some Clinton enthusiasts painted their cars to show support for the former secretary of state, and her team dispatched young loyalists along street corners to wave signs at passing cars.\nBill Clinton headlined his first campaign rally at the pre-dinner concert featuring Perry, a Clinton backer whose hit song, \"Roar,\" is an anthem at Hillary Clinton events. The former president has raised money for his wife's campaign, but the rally was his first big splash during the race.\nPerry got into the act much earlier, recording a wake-up phone message for Clinton's organizers. \"Wake-y Wake-y eggs and bakey. It's Katy Perry here,\" the pop singer said in the call. \"I know it's early, but you know what they say, the early bird gets the votes.\" At the free concert, she performed her hits \"Roar,\" and \"Firework,\" along with a rendition of \"America the Beautiful.\"\nThe dinner caps a key stretch for Hillary Clinton, who received a boost from Biden's decision not to run on Wednesday and then put together a grinding, competent appearance on Thursday before a Republican-led congressional committee probing the deadly 2012 attacks on diplomatic outposts in Benghazi, Libya.\nTwo lesser-known rivals, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee, abandoned the race following Clinton's strong performance on Oct. 13 in the first primary debate.\nThe dinner, called the \"J-J,\" is an important showcase for Sanders, a Vermont independent who has drawn large crowds with his calls for a \"political revolution\" to address the gap between the wealthy and the poor.\nClinton placed third in Iowa in 2008 and has since vowed to build a formidable organization to power her to victory here. She has sought to present herself as the heir to Obama's legacy, while Sanders offers an anti-establishment message and often notes the large numbers of Democrats who stayed home in the 2014 midterm elections.\nO'Malley, who has trailed Clinton and Sanders in polls by wide margins, is a member of a Celtic Irish band and broke out his guitar to perform a cover of Johnny Cash's song, \"I've Been Everywhere\" at a pre-dinner event on Saturday. The ex-governor has campaigned extensively in Iowa and knows the process firsthand: He got his start here as a young field organizer for Sen. Gary Hart's presidential campaign in 1984.\nA recent Iowa poll by Bloomberg Politics and The Des Moines Register found Clinton with a slight lead in the state over Sanders, with the two candidates the choice of 9 in 10 voters.

{"body": "BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Republican U.S. Sen. David Vitter survived challenges Saturday from two GOP rivals who called his years-old prostitution scandal a stain on Louisiana, reaching a runoff against Democratic state Rep. John Bel Edwards in the governor's race.\nThe Nov. 21 runoff will decide who follows Republican presidential hopeful Gov. Bobby Jindal into office, the winner inheriting leadership of a state mired in financial problems that both candidates blame on the term-limited governor. Jindal is now waging a long-shot campaign for the presidential nomination.\nWhile Edwards always seemed assured of a runoff spot, Vitter bested two other major Republicans to secure his position on the November ballot, Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle and Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne.\nAnd the race was tighter than Vitter had hoped.\nMonths ago, Vitter was atop the polls, flush with millions in campaign cash and running like an incumbent.  But amid continued talk of his 2007 prostitution scandal and a drumbeat of criticism about his attack-heavy campaign tactics, Vitter's negatives spiked among voters. One PAC has been running an \"Anybody But Vitter\" campaign.\nVitter, however, maintained a strong conservative base that carried him into the runoff.\nSix other statewide races \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including competitive races for lieutenant governor and attorney general \u00e2\u0080\u0094 were also on the ballot, along with four constitutional amendments, state legislative seats and local elections.\nA race advances to a runoff if no candidate tops 50 percent of the vote.\nAn Ivy League-educated Rhodes Scholar from the New Orleans suburbs, Vitter returned to a campaign style that has worked for him in previous races. He ran on conservative values and described himself as a political outsider.\nHe and a super PAC supporting him attacked his GOP competitors as tax-and-spend liberals, suggested Dardenne wasted tax dollars in office and criticized Angelle for resigning as state natural resources secretary only days after a massive sinkhole opened on his watch.\n\"Baton Rouge is broken and dysfunctional, and there are no adult leaders there taking on the big challenges,\" Vitter said in one of only two TV debates he attended.\nWith few policy differences, the race largely came down to personalities \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and a referendum of sorts on whether Vitter's eight-year-old prostitution scandal still resonated with voters. The senator apologized in 2007 for a \"very serious sin\" after he was linked through phone records to Washington's \"D.C. Madam.\"\n\"We are better than this. We can avoid the disappointment, the embarrassment, the ridicule, the shame,\" Dardenne, a former state lawmaker from Baton Rouge, said in an ad that ran on Election Day.\nDardenne ran a campaign suggesting he would be a reform governor who would \"make Louisiana proud.\" Angelle, a French-speaking native of Breaux Bridge with a thick Cajun accent, positioned himself as the conservative candidate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 without a prostitution scandal.\nVitter has dodged talk of the scandal, suggesting he and the voters have moved on.\nWhile his three GOP opponents struck at each other, Edwards saved most of his criticism for Jindal, who Edwards blamed for causing state finances to crater. Edwards, a state House Democratic leader from Tangipahoa Parish, said his rivals each represent a Jindal third term.\n\"I stood up to Bobby Jindal and his disastrous policies,\" Edwards said in his campaign.\nEdwards campaigned as a conservative Democrat. He's pro-gun and anti-abortion, and comes from a family of sheriffs. He also has a West Point degree and military background.\nAt least $21 million has been spent so far by candidates and super PACs on the race.\nThe men largely shared similar positions on repairing Louisiana's financial crisis and balancing the budget. They supported a rewrite of the state's tax structure to scale back spending on tax breaks and a lessening of budget protections that leave colleges at most risk for cuts.\nThe most striking disagreements were on the Common Core education standards and the minimum wage. All but Dardenne opposed Common Core, and all but Edwards opposed raising the state's minimum wage.", "byline": "", "description": "BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 Republican U.S. Sen.

And I am ready and eager to be our speaker,\" Ryan wrote in the letter.In a closed-door meeting with the Republican conference on Tuesday, Ryan said he would only run for speaker if he had the support of all the separate factions within the party. On Wednesday evening, a \"supermajority\" of the conservative House Freedom Caucus said they would back Ryan's bid.Current Speaker of the House John Boehner has set speaker elections for Oct. 28.Here's Ryan's full letter:\nDear Colleague:Over the past few days, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about our country, and it\u2019s clear to me that we\u2019re in a very serious moment. Working families continue to fall behind, and they are losing faith in the American Idea: the belief that if you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead. At the same time, a weaker America has led to a more dangerous world. Our friends and rivals alike wonder whether we will pull ourselves out of this stupor.Instead of rising to the occasion, Washington is falling short\u2014including the House of Representatives. We are not solving the country\u2019s problems; we are only adding to them.But now, we have an opportunity to turn the page, to start with a clean slate, and to rebuild what has been lost. We can make the House a more open and inclusive body\u2014one where every member can contribute to the legislative process. We can rally House Republicans around a bold agenda that will tackle the country\u2019s problems head on. And we can show the country what a commonsense conservative agenda looks like.That\u2019s why I\u2019m actually excited for this moment. I\u2019ve spoken with many of you over the past few days, and I can sense the hunger in our conference to get to work. I know many of you want to show the country how to fix our tax code, how to rebuild our military, how to strengthen the safety net, and how to lift people out of poverty. I know you\u2019re willing to work hard and get it done, and I think this moment is ripe for real reform.That\u2019s because, whatever our differences, we\u2019re all conservatives. We were elected to defend the constitution. We share the same principles. We all believe America is the land of opportunity\u2014the place where you should be able to go as far as your talents and hard work will take you. We all believe in empowering every person to realize his or her potential. And we have the know-how to apply these principles to the problems of today.I never thought I\u2019d be speaker. But I pledged to you that if I could be a unifying figure, then I would serve\u2014I would go all in. After talking with so many of you, and hearing your words of encouragement, I believe we are ready to move forward as a one, united team. And I am ready and eager to be our speaker.This is just the beginning of our work. There is a long road ahead.

{"body": "Des Moines, Iowa (CNN)Hillary Clinton came to Iowa to exorcise the ghost of a campaign past.\nBack where her last \"inevitable\" march to the White House began to unravel, she was out to prove she learns from history and is not doomed to repeat it, and told voters who rejected her last time that when she's knocked down, she just gets back up.\nAt the state Democratic Party's big Jefferson-Jackson dinner -- often a defining moment in the Iowa caucus race -- Clinton enlisted pop diva Katy Perry, dazzling in a white ballgown and Star-Spangled cape, to draw a pre-event crowd. She rolled out \"explainer-in-chief\" Bill Clinton for the first time this cycle, and packed Des Moines with young volunteers wearing \"fighting for her\" T-shirts ready to take names and addresses of potential caucus voters.\nOne hundred days before Iowa becomes the first state to cast votes for the next president, Clinton left nothing to chance, because she knows the price of failure.\nHer show of preparation was a clear sign she is determined not to be out-organized in a caucuses her aides often derided during her last campaign but which dealt her a blow from which she would never recover.\nClinton made her political longevity an asset, presented herself as a fighter and subtly told Iowa voters she'd learned from past mistakes. She also showed she knew her audience by taking swipes at Iowa's Republican governor, Terry Branstad.\n\"I have been at this effort to change and reform our country a long time and I haven't won every battle,\" Clinton said. \"I have learned from each one, and I have learned how to stand my ground and find common ground.\"\n\"I am just getting warmed up. I am listening to you, I am fighting for you, and with your support, Iowa, I am going to deliver.\"\nEight years ago, Clinton rode into the fabled dinner \"JJ dinner\" -- a mix between a political convention and a deafening student pep rally -- as a front-runner, convinced her mantra of experience and competence was paving the way to the Oval Office.\nBut in the fading light of that Iowa fall evening, her strategy was quickly exposed, as Barack and Michelle Obama danced in the streets on the way to the event venue, revealing for the first time the pent-up political energy, organizational muscle and potent brew of hope and change that would turn the campaign on its head.\nHours later, Obama trumped her wooden, uninspiring speech at the dinner. His adviser, David Axelrod, later described her effort as having all the spontaneity of a \"Politburo\" meeting.\n\nThis time, her speech was more compact and polished than the awkward call and response routine she used in 2007 when she roared she would \"turn up the heat\" on Republicans. \nIn 2015, Clinton aligned herself tightly with Obama, bemoaned the GOP's \"failed\" policies on the economy and vowed to safeguard progress under the current administration.\n\"I am running as a proud Democrat,\" Clinton said in an apparent jab at her top rival, Bernie Sanders, who over a long career has identified himself as an independent.\nBut while Clinton's speech pleased her own supporters, who chanted \"I'm with her\" and waved blue light sticks in the darkened venue -- another sign of slick campaign organizing -- inspirational rhetoric has never been her strength.\nBut what she lacked in uplifting eloquence, she made up for in policy in her conversational address, which was apparently designed to please as many different Democratic micro-constituencies as possible. \nShe touched on heath care, education, climate change, women's rights, gay rights, Wall Street regulation, immigration reform, restoring campaign finance measures, voting rights, racial issues and gun violence.\nIt hardly matched the promise of a \"nation healed, a world repaired, an America that believes again\" from Obama at the same dinner in 2007. But that may not matter so much to Democrats any more.\nEight years on, many Obama veterans -- who radiated quiet contempt for the Clintons and their red meat, Republican-bashing back then -- now see the former secretary of state as the best chance to secure the president's legacy.\nWith exquisite timing, David Plouffe, the organizational wizard who did more than anyone else to rout Clinton in Iowa in 2008, declared he was fully behind her now, though would never have believed seven years ago he would be.\n\"Here's what I, and so many of my fellow Obama campaign veterans, have learned about Hillary: She doesn't quit. And there were times I wish she had!\" Plouffe wrote on Medium. \"But you have to deeply admire that strength and persistence.\"\nTom Harkin, a sage of Iowa politics who served the state in the U.S. Senate for 30 years, is convinced Clinton 2016 is unrecognizable from Clinton 2008.\n\"She's doing what she needs to do in Iowa every day; She's organizing; She has a great ground game in Iowa, unlike 2008,\" Harkin said in an interview. \n\"Right now it's about rounding up delegates and holding their hands and making sure they get to the caucus.\"\nHarkin, like many Democrats in her campaign and outside, believes Clinton has turned a corner after an error-addled summer and is capitalizing on strong performances in the CNN Democratic debate and in a Capitol Hill hearing on Thursday on Benghazi.\n\"I think she's erased any doubts that may have been out there about her abilities -- her ability to stand up and undergo withering fire if you will and come out looking like a winner,\" Harkin said.\n\nBut Clinton did not have it all her own way on Saturday night.\nJust as in 2008, she is facing a pied piper of a rival, who is seeking to fire up young idealist voters and coming at her from her left on national security, and who also vows to build a grassroots army to buckle the Clinton political machine.\nThat man -- Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders -- learned his own lessons from Obama's approach in 2007. \nHe held a dueling rally to Clinton's on Saturday afternoon and even sent a light plane, bearing a streamer \"Feel the Bern\" high over Clinton's party.\nThousands of Sanders supporters at the \"JJ dinner,\" pounding out their refrain of \"Bernie, Bernie,\" showed the Clinton campaign is right to be taking no chances in Iowa. The former secretary of state led Sanders only seven points in the latest Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Iowa caucus poll this week.\nHis speech included his most explicit swipes against Clinton so far -- on Iraq, gay rights and what he sees as her belated opposition to the Keystone XL Pipeline and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact.\nHe implicitly suggesting she made decisions based on poll numbers and not principle and in his speech, which preceded hers, jabbed her over her defeat here in 2008.\n\"By the way, about eight years ago, all of the political experts talked about how another Democratic candidate for president just couldn't win, he was unelectable -- remember that guy -- what's his name? Oh, it's President Obama,\" Sanders said. \"Well Iowa, I think we're going to prove the pundits wrong again. I believe we will make history.\"\nShould Sanders make good on that promise -- and then capitalize on his strong position in New Hampshire -- he could revive all the old doubts about her qualities as a candidate and undermine her campaign.\nBut Clinton has one clear advantage over 2007 -- Sanders is no Obama.\nWhereas Obama was by the time of the Iowa dinner already viewed as a once-in-a-generation talent with historic potential, Sanders is a 74-year-old self-declared democratic socialist promising a \"revolution.\" He seems to lack the broader appeal among ethnically diverse voters of Obama, or even Clinton.\nSanders performed strongly at the dinner, striking themes on Wall Street and economic inequality that have delighted liberals all year.\nBut his address, like Clinton's, lacked the almost supernatural lift that Obama achieved to transcend the same event eight years ago.\nSo if the Jefferson-Jackson dinner changes the race this time around, it seems just as likely that it will be to solidify the position of the strengthening front-runner as to elevate the campaign of her upstart challenger.\nCNN's Maeve Reston contributed to this report.", "byline": "", "description": "Hillary Clinton came to Iowa to exorcise the ghost of a campaign past.", "title": "Clinton seeks to exorcise Iowa ghosts", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/25/politics/iowa-democrats-jefferson-jackson-dinner/index.html", "topics": ["economy"], "people": ["Tom Harkin", "Bill Clinton", "Katy Perry", "Maeve Reston", "Hillary Clinton", "Michelle Obama", "Barack Obama", "Bernie Sanders", "David Axelrod", "David Plouffe", "Terry Branstad"], "orgs": ["Democratic Party", "U.S. Senate", "GOP", "Keystone XL Pipeline", "Oval Office"], "election_confidence": 0.9277893683153534, "authors": [{"author_id": 2324, "fullname": "stephen collinson", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-10-25 05:57:51", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "1eb494ef4dcf945ea29686c43f87b374", "date_access": "2015-10-25 05:31:19.302923"},

{"body": " (CNN)Donald Trump believes he will \"absolutely\" be a force for bipartisanship, but in an interview this weekend neither Republicans nor Democrats escaped a barrage of attacks from the GOP presidential candidate.\nTrump flung criticism at politicians spanning the spectrum from presidential primary opponents Jeb Bush and Ben Carson to the Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and the man he hopes to succeed, President Barack Obama, in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper that aired Sunday on \"State of the Union.\" \nAnd he lamented the House Select Committee on Benghazi's questioning of Clinton, a hearing he called \"very partisan\" that \"hurts both parties\" and \"hurts the country.\"\n\"The level of hatred between Republicans and Democrats was unbelievable. The level of -- I've never seen anything like it,\" Trump said. \"I'm going to unify. This country is totally divided. Barack Obama has divided this country unbelievably.  And it's all, it's all hatred, what can I tell you. I've never seen anything like it...I've gotten along with Democrats and I've gotten along with Republicans. And I said, that's a good thing.\"\nTapper asked Trump if his presidency would result in an era of bipartisanship.\n\"I absolutely think so,\" he said, adding, \"I will be a great unifier for our country.\"\nWhile Clinton has taken flak for what she's described as a tongue-in-cheek statement that the enemies she's most proud of having are Republicans, Trump said he doesn't consider Clinton an enemy -- simply, \"an opponent.\"\nStill, for all the talk of bipartisanship and unity, Trump did not pull punches as he vigorously took on his opponents.\nTrump hit Bush, the former governor of Florida, and Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, with the same line of attack -- one he has frequently used against Bush, but has only just begun using against Carson, whose reserved and calm tone strongly contrasts with Trump's brash appeal.\n\"(Bush is) a low-energy person. By the way, Ben Carson is a very low-energy person. We need high-energy people,\" Trump told Tapper. \"I think Ben Carson is a very low-energy person. Actually, I think Ben Carson is lower energy than Jeb, if you want to know the truth. We need strong energy.\"\nRELATED: Trump's dipping poll numbers in Iowa\nTrump also knocked both Bush and Carson for the support they receive from super PACs, groups that can take in unlimited amounts of money.\nThe developer dinged super PACs as a \"big fat scam\" and a \"disaster\" in the \"State of the Union\" interview, a line of criticism that he brought out more arduously than ever this weekend, just days after the super PAC backing his candidacy shuttered its operation after the group's ties to the campaign drew scrutiny last week.\nBut Trump suggested that he may turn his sights away from Bush and toward Carson.\nThat's because Carson is now the man to beat in Iowa, stealing first place from Trump (who was relegated to second place) in two polls released Thursday and Friday.\n\"The thing with Ben is he's got a very good PAC, and he's got people running his PAC, and in my opinion, he's got people all over Iowa from his PAC, and they are running -- Ben doesn't even go to Iowa that much. And he's doing well in Iowa?\" Trump said. \"I did talk about Jeb because I thought Jeb was going to be the front-runner. Obviously, he's no longer the front-runner. I probably won't talk about him so much anymore.\"\nIn a previously released segment of this interview, Trump also knocked Carson for his stances on immigration and questioned his capabilities as a negotiator.\nTrump tied in his \"low-energy\" attacks with what he dubbed the \"medieval times\" that the world is currently living in -- saying that as ISIS beheads people, the U.S. needs a strong leader.\nBut as to whether he would approve a special forces operation to rescue hostages being held by ISIS -- similar to the one that resulted in the death of an American soldier this week-- Trump demurred.\n\"I think I might, but I'd have to look at the situation,\" Trump said.\nPushed further to explain what the Trump doctrine would be in such situations, Trump explained that it \"is very simple.\"\n\"It's strength.

{"body": "Washington (CNN)Marco Rubio is sure Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic presidential nominee. And he says Donald Trump isn't ready to be commander-in-chief. \nThe Florida senator who is emerging as an establishment favorite for the Republican 2016 nomination criticized both Clinton and Trump in a wide-ranging interview with CNN's Jamie Gangel. \nHe ripped Trump for not addressing important issues \"in a serious way.\"\n\"To this point in the campaign, he has not proven an understanding of these issues or the preparation necessary to be the commander-in-chief of the most powerful military force in the world,\" Rubio said. \nHe also said Clinton winning the Democratic nomination over rivals Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is a foregone conclusion. \n\"Well, she'll be the Democratic nominee, someone who comes from a political dynasty and that, in and of itself, is going to bring fundraising capabilities and so forth,\" Rubio said. \nHe lambasted her performance in a Thursday hearing in front of the House Benghazi committee, where a Clinton email showed she'd told her family right after the 2012 attacks resulting in the deaths of four Americans that they were the work of terrorists, and not a reaction to an anti-Islam video.\n\"She lied about Benghazi,\" Rubio said. \"I think it's just a little bit more insight into her unwillingness oftentimes to speak truth, in this case for political reasons.\"\nRELATED: Rubio says Trump's immigration plan 'borders on absurd'\nIn the interview, Rubio also demonstrated his love for 1990s-era hip-hop -- particularly West Coast rappers like Tupac Shakur. \nHe said lately he's a fan of electronic dance music, as well as artists who have crossed traditional lines of genre. \n\"In many ways it's real genius and it's a 21st-century ability to take music and use it in a way that motivates people. Some of it is blended with other sounds that are sampled from recordings that others have had in the past, and you see traditional artists being brought in and their voices used in an electronic sound track,\" he said. \nHe credited Tiesto and other DJs, and he said he listens to artists who have blended hip hop, rap, R&B and electronic dance music. He credited Canadians Drake and The Weeknd for doing that.\nRubio said some of his favorite music isn't quite suitable for children, though, because of the lyrics. \n\"You don't want kids at a young age exposed to lyrics that somehow glamorize a lifestyle that's art, it's not reality,\" Rubio said. \n\"So one of the issues with the '90s hip hop music is that it had lyrics that were offensive. What it actually was were people who were living in those circumstances expressing what their life was like. In the West Coast case, for example, in South Central L.A. And so it gave insight into the lives that they were living.\n\"But if you heard the lyrics purely without understanding that, you may think that it's glamorizing that lifestyle. To some extent it was, and so there's a difference between a 44-year-old man listening to that and a 16-year-old listening to that and not understanding the difference between artistic expression and reality.\"\nAs for his favorite movies, Rubio -- \"like any guy in America,\" he admitted -- said he loves both Godfathers I and II. \"And No. 3, I can do without.\" \n", "byline": "", "description": "Marco Rubio is sure Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic presidential nominee.

{"body": "Washington (CNN)If the weekend news shows were any indication, the next Republican debate in a few days is going to be a doozy.\nIn a flurry of appearances on Sunday political talk shows, Donald Trump let it be known that he's ready to take off the gloves and hammer Ben Carson. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio was increasingly willing to hit fellow Republicans. And, on the Democratic side, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders indicated he's not going to let Hillary Clinton set her campaign in cruise control, even after two strong weeks. \nHere's a look at three themes that will reverberate through this week: \n\nAccording to Trump, Carson is \"very weak on immigration,\" \"cannot do with trade like I do\" on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and has \"super low energy\" levels -- lower, in fact, than Jeb Bush. \nThe attacks -- many coming in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union\" -- signal that Trump has been stung by new polls that show Carson has seized the front-runner's mantle in the first state to cast votes in the presidential nominating contest. \nTrump like to call himself a \"counter-puncher,\" but he's attacked Carson even while the retired neurosurgeon has largely stayed away from initiating clashes of his own. \nRELATED: Trump blasts Carson, says he lacks energy to be president\nThe aggressive approach suggests Trump is ready to draw the typically more reserved Carson out of his shell when Republicans meet Wednesday in Colorado for the their third debate, this one hosted by CNBC. \n\"He can't do with a lot of things like I do, so we'll just have to see what happens,\" Trump said of Carson.\nCarson, meanwhile, told NBC's Chuck Todd on \"Meet the Press\" that he has dropped his angry teenage past, one in which he was violent. \n\"I do have a tendency to be relaxed,\" he said. \"I wasn't always like that. There was a time when I was, you know, very volatile. But, you know, I changed.\"\nTrump and Carson are also exchanging shots over religion after Trump told a crowd in Iowa, of Carson's faith: \"I mean, Seventh-day Adventist, I don't know about. I just don't know about.\" \n\nAs he settles in the top tier of Republican presidential candidates, Rubio, the Florida senator, is increasingly willing to slam his primary rivals. \nHe hit Trump on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" saying the real estate mogul is unfit to become commander-in-chief due to his limited foreign policy expertise. \n\"To this point in the campaign, he has not proven an understanding of these issues or the preparation necessary to be the commander-in-chief of the most powerful military force in the world,\" Rubio said. \nAmong the biggest questions of the GOP nominating process thus far has been whether Rubio can eventually overtake Bush as the favorite of moderate and moneyed \"establishment\" members of the party eager for an alternative to political newcomers and outsiders like Trump, Carson and Carly Fiorina. \nRubio has also begun taking aim at Clinton, the Democrat who he says is certain to be that party's nominee. \nLook for Rubio to come on strong in the debate this week.\n\nIt was a big two-week string of victories for Clinton: A funny and well-received appearance on \"Saturday Night Live,\" a widely praised showing in the first Democratic presidential debate, a decision by Vice President Joe Biden to stay out of the 2016 race, and an escape from an 11-hour hearing on Benghazi without being hit by any new bombshells. \nBut with the more solid ground she finds her campaign on now comes a bigger target she'll wear. \nWith Biden staying out of the race and long-shots Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee dropping their longshot campaigns, Clinton now faces a much narrower competition against Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. \nRELATED: Sanders says he is not 'shouting' at Hillary Clinton\nSanders showed new willingness to go after Clinton on Sunday, saying on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that both Bill and Hillary Clinton supported a measure -- the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as between one man and one woman -- that was \"homophobic.\" It was the latest in his efforts to cast Clinton as a late comer to liberal causes he has supported for decades. \nHe said the law, since struck down by the Supreme Court, was pushed by GOP lawmakers -- and \"many of them, I'm sorry to say, were homophobic.\"\n\"I think everybody at the time knew that it was simply homophobic legislation,\" Sanders said.\n\"That legislation was anti-gay legislation. It was playing off the fears of a lot of Americans,\" he added. \"Now the good news -- as Hillary Clinton just indicated -- the culture has changed radically. ... We have come a long, long way since that vote in 1996.\"\n", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Weekend attacks point to feisty upcoming GOP debate", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/25/politics/sunday-shows-donald-trump-ben-carson-republican-debate/index.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Joe Biden", "Martin O'Malley", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Donald Trump", "Chuck Todd", "Marco Rubio", "Jim Webb", "Jake Tapper", "Bernie Sanders", "Carly Fiorina", "Ben Carson", "Lincoln Chafee"], "orgs": ["CNBC", "GOP", "Defense of Marriage Act", "Supreme Court"], "election_confidence": 0.999759767521412, "authors": [{"author_id": 2529, "fullname": "eric bradner", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-10-25 21:45:26", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "abb0667a9ab5b46a8d3eacb21062a0e4", "date_access": "2015-10-25 21:02:26.227578"},

Doesn't require a lot of jumping up and down and screaming, but it does require a lot of concentration.\" \nHis comments came the day after Trump told a rally in Miami that Carson has even less energy than Jeb Bush, who he has repeatedly called a \"low-energy\" candidate. \n\"Ben Carson is super low energy, right? He's super low,\" Trump said. \"Super low energy. We need tremendous energy. We need tremendous energy.\" \nTrump previously had warned Carson that he would start attacking him if he started passing him in the polls.

Martin O'Malley, who trails both by a wide margin, reached for a breakout performance at the dinner, presenting himself as a fresh face in the party, who got things done in his home state.\n\"We cannot move beyond today's gridlocked politics by returning to the divisions of our past,\" O'Malley said. \"I'm not about that.\"\nThe speech marked a more aggressive turn by Sanders, who struggled at times to scrutinize Clinton's record during their first debate in Las Vegas earlier this month.\nIn that encounter, Clinton offered a full-throated rebuke of Sanders' record on gun control, noting his opposition to the 1993 Brady Bill and his backing of a 2005 law that shields gun manufacturers, distributors and dealers from most liability lawsuits.\nThis time, Clinton only made a passing reference to Sanders on gun control, saying, \"I won't be silent\" on the issue.\nSanders, meanwhile, pointedly assailed the passage of the Defense of Marriage Act during Bill Clinton's administration, saying, \"some are trying to rewrite history by saying they voted for one anti-gay law to stop something worse. That's not the case.\" Hillary Clinton said in an interview with MSNBC on Friday that the law was signed as a \"defensive action.\"\nSanders vowed \"not to abandon any segment of American society whether you're gay or black or Latino or poor or working class \u2014 just because it is politically expedient at a given time.\"\nClinton placed third in Iowa in 2008 and has since built a formidable organization to power her to victory here.\nEight years ago, Obama suggested Clinton was motivated by polls and triangulation while the then-New York senator countered that \"change is just a word\" unless you have the strength and experience to lead.\nThis time, Clinton presented herself as Obama's heir, warning Republicans would seek to slash taxes for the wealthy and repeal President Barack Obama's health care law.\n\"I'm running as a proud Democrat,\" the former secretary of state said to a large cheering section that waved blue neon sticks. \"We need to defend the progress we've made under President Obama and build on it until the recovery is secure.\"\nBut Republicans insisted Saturday that today's Hillary Clinton is the same one who ran eight years ago.\n\"The Hillary Clinton of 2015 is no different than the Hillary Clinton from 2007, who at the time refused to be straightforward with Iowans,\" said Republican National Committee spokesman Fred Brown. \"Things haven't changed.\"\nOne hundred days remain before Iowans nominate their presidential candidates, and the state Democratic party's annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner drew a raucous crowd of more than 6,600 activists in what traditionally serves as a kickoff to the Iowa caucuses.\nIt capped a daylong pageant of political activities: Former President Bill Clinton headlined his first rally of the campaign, introducing pop singer Katy Perry at a free concert for Clinton's faithful.

By comparison, 6 in 10 say the same for retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who, like Trump, has tapped into the powerful wave of antiestablishment anger defining the early phases of the 2016 contest.\n\"It's the lifelong establishment politicians on both sides that rub me the wrong way,\" said registered Republican Joe Selig, a 60-year-old carpenter from Vallejo, California. \"I think Trump is more electable. He's strong. We need strength these days.\"\nTrump and Carson are considered among the least electable general election candidates by the Republican Party's professionals, those who are in the business of helping candidates run campaigns and win elections.\nExperienced political strategists note that winning a general election and winning the Republican nomination are often very different tasks. The GOP's most conservative voters \u2014 a group that is older and whiter than the nation as a whole \u2014 wield extraordinary influence in picking the nominee. Independents, moderate voters and minorities are far more important in general elections that draw many more people to the polls.\nWhile Trump and Carson are popular in primary election polls, both have used divisive rhetoric in recent months that alienated some minorities. Trump called Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals during his announcement speech; while Carson said he would not support a Muslim presidential candidate.\n\n\"Republicans think (Democrat) Hillary (Rodham Clinton) is weaker than she is. They are wrong,\" said GOP operative Katie Packer, who was deputy campaign manager for 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney. \"They think we don't need to win more women or more Hispanics to win. They're wrong.\"\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who has embraced a welcoming tone with Hispanics, tops the field of experienced political leaders on the question of electability, running about even with Carson and slightly behind Trump.\nSix in 10 Republicans say Bush could win the general election and 54 percent say the same about Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. There's a drop-off among the rest of the GOP's 2016 crowded class. None of the other candidates is viewed as electable in a general election by more than half of Republican voters.\nCarson and Trump are the candidates most likely to receive positive ratings from Republican voters, with 65 percent saying they have a favorable opinion of Carson and 58 percent saying the same of Trump. Republicans are somewhat less excited about Bush, with 48 percent giving him a favorable rating.\n\"If he weren't a Bush, I wouldn't even know his name,\" said Republican Leslie Millican, a 34-year-old housewife from Magnolia, Arkansas. \"I like the other Bushes. Something about (Jeb Bush) \u2014 he ain't grown on me yet.\"\nTrump and Bush have the highest negative ratings within their own party: 37 percent of Republican voters say they have an unfavorable opinion of Bush and 36 percent say the same of Trump.\nTheir negatives are even more pronounced among the broader electorate. The AP-GfK poll found Trump is viewed unfavorably by 57 percent of those surveyed, the highest negatives of any Republican candidate. Bush is next with unfavorable ratings from 48 percent of all respondents.\nOverall, all but one GOP candidate is viewed more unfavorably than favorably by all those questioned. Carson is the exception, drawing about equally positive and negative views. He remains unknown by a significant portion of the electorate.\nAmong Republican voters, all the candidates except New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie have a net positive rating. Carson tops the list, followed by Rubio, former technology executive Carly Fiorina and then Trump.\nThe poll also found a sharp difference between the political parties over experience.\nBy an overwhelming 77 percent to 22 percent margin, Republican registered voters and leaners say they prefer an outsider candidate who will change how things are done, rather than someone with experience in Washington who can get things done. They prefer someone with private sector leadership experience over experience holding elected office, 76 percent to 22 percent.\nTrump, Carson and Fiorina are the only Republican candidates who have never held elective office. Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, is a former first lady, secretary of state and senator.\nPerhaps that helps explain why Democrats prefer experience over outsider status, 67 percent to 32 percent, and experience in office over private sector experience 66 percent to 33 percent.\nRepublican strategist John Feehery says Trump is considered electable now only because he hasn't yet been the subject of a multimillion dollar negative ad campaign, which will happen should he maintain his lead in the polls.\n\"Right now, he serves a valuable purpose as a front-runner, especially for the Democrats,\" Feehery said. \"They would love him to be our nominee.\"", "byline": "", "description": "Republican voters view Donald Trump as their strongest general election candidate, according to an Associated Press-GfK poll that highlights the sharp contrast between the party's voters and its top professionals regarding the billionaire businessman's ultimate political strength.", "title": "AP-GfK Poll: Republicans view Donald Trump as most electable", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/AQM7KdYdMyE/", "topics": ["immigration", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Rodham Clinton", "Mitt Romney", "Chris Christie", "Jeb Bush", "Katie Packer", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "John Feehery", "Carly Fiorina", "Ben Carson"], "orgs": ["GfK", "GOP", "Republican Party"], "election_confidence": 0.9999107823766167, "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-10-26 01:59:37", "org": "fox", "article_id": "dc563b4469780525dea57cbb9c018baf", "date_access": "2015-10-26 01:30:36.345479"},

I'm not afraid of Fox News, and they don't influence how I make my policy decisions.\"\nSoon after, all 11 supervisors voted to pass a resolution affirming that San Francisco, which first declared itself a \"City of Refuge\" in 1989, shall remain so.\nSan Francisco's sanctuary policies have drawn harsh criticism since Kate Steinle, 32, was shot and killed on a tourist-friendly waterfront walkway here last summer.\nJuan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, now charged with her murder, is a five-time deportee who had been brought here in March from a federal prison in Southern California on a 2-decade-old marijuana-related bench warrant. But prosecutors declined to charge him, and the Sheriff's Department released him without honoring a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that he be detained beyond his release date so he could be picked up and placed yet again in deportation proceedings.\nThe supervisors' resolution rejected cooperation with ICE's new Priority Enforcement Program, which largely moves away from the so-called detainer requests and instead asks local authorities to simply notify ICE before a release occurs. Supervisors allowed an exception to the rule if an inmate has been convicted of a violent felony in the last seven years and is being held to answer by a magistrate on a comparable charge.\nSan Francisco's vote came just hours after the failure of a bill in Washington by U.S. Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) to cut federal funding to municipalities that don't cooperate fully with immigration authorities. The legislation included a provision, known as Kate's Law, that would have increased criminal sentences for immigrants who repeatedly enter the U.S. illegally.\nGOP presidential candidate Donald Trump lashed out at San Francisco in the days after Steinle's death, and the city and its sanctuary policies \u2014 shared by more than 300 other jurisdictions nationwide \u2014 became fodder for conservative newscasters and bloggers.\nSan Francisco's initial sanctuary policy came in response to a wave of undocumented immigrants fleeing war-torn countries in Central America. It was followed in 2013 by the \"Due Process for All\" ordinance, signed with fanfare by Mayor Ed Lee, which limited the Sheriff's Department's discretion to honor ICE requests to detain inmates beyond their release dates for pickup. It laid out the same exceptions that supervisors affirmed Tuesday.\nThat law \u2014 and tensions between ICE and hundreds of local jurisdictions \u2014 stems from the Priority Enforcement Program's predecessor, Secure Communities. Under it, all fingerprints taken at the time of booking are shared with immigration authorities.\nThe program, implemented as a means to focus deportation efforts on convicted felons, was widely criticized for ensnaring many minor offenders and those never charged with any crime, including some domestic violence victims.\nHundreds of cities and counties \u2014 and a number of states \u2014 rebuffed the program as a threat to public safety, since undocumented immigrants were wary of coming forward to police as victims or witnesses to crimes.\nICE this summer largely abandoned the detainer requests, acknowledging that several federal courts have deemed them unconstitutional. In addition to moving largely to requests for notification, the Priority Enforcement Program narrowed the conditions under which it will seek out inmates held in local custody.\nSan Francisco remains wary but disagreements do exist over the community's policy.\nThe mayor and Supervisor Mark Farrell are among those who believe that despite its sanctuary city status, San Francisco should give individual law enforcement officers discretion to notify ICE of potential deportees when they deem it appropriate.\nThe city's 1989 ordinance allows for that discretion. And a 1996 federal statute states that no jurisdiction can \"prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from [ICE] information regarding the citizenship or immigration status \u2026 of any individual.\"\nSteinle's family has sued San Francisco over a policy enacted by Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi in March that requires all communication with ICE to be cleared with him or his legal department, saying it violates federal statutes.\nBoth Mayor Lee and Farrell have said Lopez-Sanchez's previous crimes should have prompted someone to \"pick up the phone\" and turn him over. But Farrell's resolution asking the sheriff to rescind his policy was tabled by a 6-5 vote Tuesday.\nNoting in a statement that he believes in the Sanctuary City policy, Farrell said he was \"deeply disappointed\" in the rejection of his measure.\nleora.romney@latimes.com", "byline": "", "description": "<p>In an emotional hearing here, Supervisor Malia Cohen took an unapologetic stand on behalf of her city's sanctuary policies, giving the brush-off to conservative Republicans and commentators nationwide who placed San Francisco in their crosshairs in the months since an undocumented immigrant was...</p>", "title": "In face of criticism, S.F. supervisor reaffirms city's sanctuary policies", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/la-me-sf-sanctuary-20151026-story.html", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Kate Steinle", "Ross Mirkarimi", "Donald Trump", "David Vitter", "Juan Francisco Lopez", "Ed Lee"], "orgs": ["S.F.", "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement"], "election_confidence": 0.6220564312504671, "authors": [{"author_id": 40424, "fullname": "lee romney", "primary_org": "latimes"}], "date_written": "2015-10-26 01:20:00", "org": "latimes", "article_id": "71efadd5f36626a571ed5c47a4c10b24", "date_access": "2015-10-26 00:30:08.696812"},

More than 100 supporters scattered across the heart of Des Moines, Iowa's largest city, early Saturday in a show of force. Other volunteers prepped for the all-important \u201csign war\u201d that takes place around and inside the HyVee Hall, where the dinner is served. Campaigns compete to paper the area with signs of support, a small achievement that nonetheless is an early barometer of volunteer strength.\nSince Hillary Rodham Clinton announced her bid for the White House, she has steadily slipped from inevitable nominee to flawed and vulnerable front-runner amid campaign mishaps and voters' Clinton fatigue \u2013 and her rivals anticipated that it all would accelerate in recent days.\nBut in yet another...\nSince Hillary Rodham Clinton announced her bid for the White House, she has steadily slipped from inevitable nominee to flawed and vulnerable front-runner amid campaign mishaps and voters' Clinton fatigue \u2013 and her rivals anticipated that it all would accelerate in recent days.\nBut in yet another...\nTo ensure it would draw a substantial number of supporters, the campaign brought in two of its biggest weapons --\u00a0pop star Katy Perry and former President Bill Clinton --\u00a0for its pre-dinner rally.\nThat\u2019s not to say there weren\u2019t signs of the obstacles that remain in Hillary Clinton's\u00a0pursuit of the nomination. One hovered overhead on Saturday -- a banner in support of Vermont Sen.

{"body": "California so far has only three congressional contests without incumbents, and at least two \u2014 perhaps all three \u2014 appear likely to stay in Democratic hands next year.\nIn two of the races, Democrats with significant war chests are vying to succeed Reps. Janice Hahn (D-San Pedro) and Loretta Sanchez (D-Santa Ana), who are running for other offices next year. The candidates are aided by the party's registration advantage in those districts and the usual boost in its voter turnout at the polls for presidential elections.\nIn a coastal district to the north, where Rep. Lois Capps (D-Santa Barbara) has announced she will retire, the battle is less lopsided.\n\"The Hahn and Sanchez seats are likely to remain in Democratic hands,\" said John J. Pitney Jr., a Claremont McKenna College political scientist and a former staffer for House Republicans. \"The Capps seat leans Democratic, but could be within reach for Republicans if everything goes right for them.\"\nAbout a half-dozen potential candidates for each seat have emerged; some have set up campaign organizations and have been raising money for months. Congressional seats have no term limits and typically don't turn over often, so they tend to draw lots of would-be successors when an incumbent decides to step aside.\n\"It's a prestigious job, Washington is a pretty nice place to live, and you can land an extremely lucrative job as a lobbyist or on a corporate board when you retire,\" said Fred Smoller, an associate professor of political science at Chapman University.\nEven the hyperpartisanship that has increasingly snarled Congress in recent years doesn't appear to have dimmed interest in the open seats. Primary battles are expected to be fierce in all three districts. The outcomes are uncertain due to California's system of sending only the top two vote getters, regardless of party, to the general election.\nThe primary system, put into full use for the first time in 2012, has sometimes pitted two members of the same party against each other in the fall.\nThat year, it also delivered an Inland Empire congressional district that Democrats expected to win into Republican hands because a large number of contenders from the favored party split the primary vote. Two GOP candidates advanced to November. (Democrats recaptured the seat in 2014.)\nJohn Shallman, a Democratic consultant and the only one so far with a candidate in all three races, won't rule out the possibility of a Republican on the fall ballot in even the most solidly Democratic district.\n\"The likelihood is low\" that either of the little-known, underfunded Republicans running in Hahn's 44th Congressional District could get past the primary, Shallman said. But he added that there is \"no guarantee\" in an election year with many yet-unknown factors.\n\"Right now the race is June, and anyone who looks beyond June is being foolish,\" Shallman said.\nAlthough six people so far are running to succeed Hahn, most analysts see the race as a contest between state Sen. Isadore Hall (D-Compton), Shallman's client, and attorney Nanette Barragan, a Democrat who recently gave up a seat on the Hermosa Beach City Council and moved back into the district where she was raised.\nThe largely working-class district stretches from the port communities of Los Angeles north through Carson, Compton and Willowbrook to South Gate and Lynwood. Latinos are 48% of registered voters, African Americans 25%, according to the California Target Book, which tracks political contests. Democrats outnumber Republicans 62%-11%.\nHall, an African American, has sewn up endorsements from many civic leaders, including Hahn, and a host of Latino officials. He has raised $560,000; Barragan, who got a later start, has collected nearly $282,000.\nShallman said he would emphasize Hall's long record in office, starting with the Compton school board and moving to the City Council before winning a crowded race for the state Assembly in 2008.\nHall's campaign recently took a swipe at Barragan in an online ad showing her, as a council candidate in the upscale beach town two years ago, talking about her dream to own a house in Hermosa Beach and her love for her adopted community.\n\"Hall never left the district,\" Shallman said.\nMichael Trujillo, Barragan's campaign manager, said his candidate embodies an inspiring success story. Raised in a blue-collar family in the Carson area by Mexican immigrant parents, she worked her way through college and law school and was able to buy a home.\nNow, Trujillo said, she wants to \"run on her roots and help others in her community.\"\nHe said Hall's record in various offices \u2014 as well as many of the \"special interest\" donors to his campaigns \u2014 will provide fodder for a campaign against him.\nOthers running are Democrats Marcus Musante, an attorney, and William Orton, a novelist; and Republicans Christopher Castillo, a political consultant, and Omar Navarro, a small-business owner. None appears to have raised significant money.\nIn the race to succeed Sanchez, five Democrats have stepped up. It is unclear whether the sole Republican, Irvine City Councilwoman Lynn Schott, intends to stay in after raising a small amount of money.\nShallman, who is running the campaign for former state Sen. Lou Correa, said he fully expects at least one Republican on the primary ballot, despite the 46th District's registration edge for Democrats: 47%-28%.\nOther Democrats in the race include former state Sen. Joe Dunn, Anaheim City Councilman Jordan Brandman and Garden Grove Mayor Bao Nguyen. Correa, with almost $174,000, and Dunn, with just more than $131,000, are the top fundraisers to date.\nCapps' district, once derided as the \"ribbon of shame\" because of its blatantly gerrymandered boundaries, was redrawn in 2011 into a politically balanced \"swing district\" that could be won by a candidate of either major party.\nRegistration now is nearly even \u2014 37% Democratic, 34% Republican \u2014 with more than 23% of voters unaffiliated.\nSanta Barbara County Supervisor Salud Carbajal, a Democrat, has raised the most money by far \u2014 more than $1 million by the end of the latest reporting period \u2014 and is endorsed by Capps.\nSanta Barbara Mayor Helene Schneider, a Democrat, is Shallman's client. Another Democrat is San Luis Obispo farmer William Ostrander.\nOn the Republican side are state Assemblyman K.H. \"Katcho\" Achadjian of San Luis Obispo and businessman/rancher Justin Fareed, who ran in 2014 and is the second-highest fundraiser to date, reporting more than $430,000.\nIn the primaries for all three seats, political scientist Pitney said, \"money and name identification will make a big difference.\"\njean.merl@latimes.com\nTwitter: @jeanmerl", "byline": "", "description": "<p>California so far has only three congressional contests without incumbents, and at least two \u2014 perhaps all three \u2014 appear likely to stay in Democratic hands next year.</p> <p>In two of the races, Democrats with significant war chests are vying to succeed Reps.

He and real estate mogul Donald Trump will be at center stage Wednesday when Republicans debate in Boulder, Colorado.\nTrump criticized Carson Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\u201cI think Ben Carson is a very low energy person. Actually I think Ben Carson is lower energy than Jeb (Bush), if you want to know the truth,\u201d Trump said.\nTrump insisted Carson\u2019s SuperPAC, the 2016 Committee, is a big reason he\u2019s doing well in Iowa. \u201cHe's got people all over Iowa from his PAC, and they are running - Ben doesn't even go to Iowa that much. And he's doing well in Iowa? And so I think that SuperPACs are a real problem in terms of our country, and I'm talking about Ben,\u201d Trump said.\nTrump also discussed his comment about Carson\u2019s religion; he is a Seventh Day Adventist. On Saturday, Trump told a Jacksonville, Florida audience \u201cI just don\u2019t know\u201d about Seventh Day Adventists.\n\u201cI know nothing about it really. I\u2019m a Presbyterian and I had mentioned that, and I did say I don\u2019t know about it, and in fact those are my exact word, so I just really don\u2019t know about the Seventh-Day Adventists, and that\u2019s what I said,\u201d Trump said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d never say bad about any religion,\u201d Trump said, though he would not apologize to Carson. \u201cI would certainly give an apology if I said something bad about it, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d\nCarson has also come under fire for controversial comments. In 2013, He called Obamacare \u201cthe worst thing to happen in this nation since slavery.\u201d Last year he compared the U.S. to Nazi Germany, saying a lot of Americans \u201cdo not feel free to express themselves.\u201d\nIn September he said he would not advocated that the nation put a Muslim in charge, and after a gunman went on a killing rampage at an Oregon college earlier this month, Carson said, \u201cwould not just stand there\u201d and let him shoot.\nCarson and his supporters have urged listening beyond the sound bite to what he has to say.\n\"As people get to know me, they know that I'm not a hateful, pathological person like some people try to make me out to be,\u201d Carson said Sunday. \u201cAnd that will be self-evident. So I don't really worry about that.\" \nCarson has strong appeal to evangelical voters, a sizable bloc in Iowa. He said Sunday he\u2019d like to see tough laws against abortion.\n\"I'm a reasonable person and if people can come up with a reasonable explanation of why they would like to kill a baby, I'll listen,\" he said.\nDavid Lightman: 202-383-6101, @lightmandavid", "byline": "", "description": "Trump: Carson is \u2018low energy\u2019\nCarson fights back, quietly\nCarson leading in two Iowa polls\n\u2026\nClick to Continue \u00bb", "title": "Carson, now in spotlight, defends his gentle style", "url": "http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article41382390.html", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "David Lightman", "Ben Carson"], "orgs": ["PAC", "Des Moines Register", "Quinnipiac University"], "election_confidence": 0.9779734469037571, "authors": [{"author_id": 33909, "fullname": "david lightman", "primary_org": "mcclatchy"}], "date_written": "2015-10-25 17:13:02", "org": "mcclatchy", "article_id": "c15688b819d1d1138d162cea15f6114e", "date_access": "2015-10-25 16:31:11.657117"},

Eight months before Reagan announced, a Nevada senator created the Reagan for President Committee, which started organizing in all 50 states and had 365 members including 27 members of Congress. Clinton formed an exploratory committee in August 1991. In April 1987, almost six months away from an official announcement, Bush's chief of staff told The New York Times the then-vice president was fundraising and campaigning in key states. Biden, who had the same vice-residential launching pad as the elder Bush, made few visible attempts to begin a 2016 campaign during Obama's second term. Though his supporters and old friends launched an unorganized shadow campaign, Biden himself hired no staff and had yet to start fundraising, though he did speak to interest groups, fanning speculation that he was keeping the door open. On top of that, Biden faced a Democratic field that got an early start. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, who officially launched their campaigns in April and May, respectively \u2014 576 and 532 days before the election. But for Clinton and Bush, other primary challengers in their fields also started late bids. Kansas Sen. Bob Dole and Pat Robinson announced in November and October of 1987. Three Clinton challengers \u2014 California Gov. Jerry Brown, Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin and Nebraska Gov. Bob Kerrey \u2014 announced in September and October of 1991. Over time, the official launch dates of candidates who won the Democratic or Republican nominations don't seem to show a clear pattern. Carter announced in December 1974, nearly 700 days before the 1976 election. For 1980, 1988 and 1992, the winners all announced less than 400 days from the election, but from 1996 onward the announcements came earlier. Almost all eventual nominees for both parties made official starts in the spring and early summer, between 500 and 650 days before that first Tuesday in November.\n", "byline": "", "description": "Few successful recent nominees have announced their candidacy as recently as Biden could have this week.", "title": "How Late Is Too Late To Run For President?", "url": "http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/10/25/451250792/how-late-is-too-late-to-run-for-president", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Tom Harkin", "Jerry Brown", "Bill Clinton", "Jill Biden", "Joe Biden", "Hillary Clinton", "Bob Kerrey", "Brendan Boyle", "Jacquelyn Martin", "Bernie Sanders", "Bob Dole", "Ronald Reagan"], "orgs": ["Congress"], "election_confidence": 0.8974887408668666, "authors": [{"author_id": 43026, "fullname": "ally mutnick", "primary_org": "npr"}], "date_written": "2015-10-25 14:30:43", "org": "npr", "article_id": "6d05d86541255801e7388189681d4d82", "date_access": "2015-10-25 13:31:02.300925"},

So, insulting both in a single tweet is a pretty serious offense for a presidential candidate. Serious enough, it seems, to get Donald Trump to concede the closest thing to an apology that he has issued since he entered the presidential race. The initial tweet came Thursday. It's since been deleted, but @realDonaldTrump retweeted a supporter who wrote: \"#BenCarson is now leading in the #polls in #Iowa. Too much #Monsanto in the #corn creates issues in the brain? #Trump #GOP.\" (Monsanto is the agriculture giant that sells engineered seeds to farmers across the country.) Within hours, Trump had deleted this tweet, and posted an explanation that didn't exactly mirror President Harry Truman's \"the buck stops here\" style of leadership: \nThe young intern who accidentally did a Retweet apologizes.\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2015\n\n\n\nThe plot thickened Friday, when a Trump intern told the International Business Times that, hey, interns don't have access to Trump's Twitter account and its 4.7 million followers. \"From my understanding and what I've been informed of by superiors is that Mr. Trump's tweets and Twitter responses are done by him personally,\" Garrison Groeschke, a Fordham University student, told the outlet. That jives with the multiple profiles that have been written about Trump and his unorthodox, aggressive approach to the social media platform. Here's what the New York Times reported earlier this year:  \"He usually dictates messages to his assistant during the day and types them himself at home or on the golf course, from which he has sent more than 100, according to geographic data embedded in his tweets. The most frequently used words in his tweets: 'great' (more than 700 times), 'winner' or 'winners' (43), and 'loser' or 'losers' (34). In all, he has sent more than 28,000 tweets \u2014 the rough equivalent of 12 a day.\"  Last month, Mother Jones conducted a thorough study into how often Trump himself is sending tweets, and how often staffers are doing the posting. The whole episode underscores one question that these articles haven't addressed, though \u2014 just how the heck Trump retweets his supporters. Retweets from fans and voters constitute a large chunk of Trump's Twitter output. But Trump's retweets all take a strange form. Instead of simply reposting the supporters' tweets, as Twitter's software now automatically does when a user hits the \"retweet\" button, Trump writes the messages from his own account, but within question marks. The style mirrors outdated, earlier Twitter software, which would take the tweet you wanted to post, add quotation marks, and insert \"RT\" in front of it. This has many people wondering whether Trump has simply never bothered to update his phone. Another explanation is that Trump is copying tweets, pasting them into his own message field, and adding quotation marks. That's what Sen. Rand Paul's chief digital strategist, Vincent Harris, seems to think: \nTrump's Monsanto tweet wasn't push of retweet button, it was longer copy/ paste process showing political carelessness that will b downfall\u2014 Vincent Harris (@VincentHarris) October 22, 2015\n\n\n\nA Twitter spokesman, noting many people have been asking this question, floated another possibility: that Trump may be using a third-party software platform like Tweetbot or Hootsuite. But many of the tweets in question say they're coming from Twitter's android app. NPR asked Trump's campaign for an explanation of how it retweets supporters. We have not heard back from them.

{"body": "AMES, Iowa \u2014  Donald J. Trump, who is rarely at a loss for words, admitted \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on\u201d when confronted by Ben Carson\u2019s surge past him in early-voting Iowa, where Mr. Trump had led the Republican presidential field for months.\n\nMr. Trump has derided Mr. Carson for lacking the vigor and fortitude to be president, but voters here are drawn to the retired neurosurgeon\u2019s low-pitched manner.\n\n\u201cThat smile and his soft voice makes people very comforted,\u201d said Miriam Greenfield, a farmer in Jewell, Iowa.\n\nIn an election season that has confounded party leaders and experts, the rise of Mr. Carson is another unexpected twist. His supporters cite Mr. Carson\u2019s character, not his positions, as the main reason they back him. And they say his low-key approach is precisely what would tame Washington\u2019s bitter partisanship, rather than Mr. Trump\u2019s swagger.\n\n\u201cHe is kind when he speaks, and he doesn\u2019t have an agenda to set himself up as wonderful,\u201d said Donna Christensen, a retiree in Ames.\n\nWhat is more, Mr. Carson\u2019s provocative comments on topics like abortion and slavery, which pundits and commentators regularly denounce, seem only to deepen the enthusiasm his evangelical base feels for him. He has connected with Republican women here, who prefer him to Mr. Trump. And he has built momentum far off the radar of the political establishment, which was unimpressed with his debate performances and his lack of governing experience. He conducts personal chats on Facebook and visits medical clinics and churches rather than the usual political stops.\n\nIn a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics released on Friday, not only was Mr. Carson the top choice among Republicans, with 28 percent, but he was also described by those surveyed as the most presidential candidate, the most pragmatic and the one they would trust most with a finger on the nuclear button.\n\nAnd unlike some other candidates popular with the party\u2019s evangelical base, Mr. Carson has built a muscular financial base through grass-roots outreach. His $20.8 million raised over the summer, most in small donations, was more than the total of any other Republican candidate. On Friday, he released his first television ad in the four early nominating states.\n\nOn Facebook, Mr. Carson answers nightly questions for his 4.3 million \u201cfriends,\u201d covering personal topics (his ailing mother is \u201cdoing much better\u201d), policies like a recent suggestion he would end Medicare (he denied it), and the campaign (the debates are \u201cjust a boxing match\u201d).\n\nBook sales are another below-the-radar means of cultivating support. He is on a 26-day book tour, notably wending through Iowa, Florida and South Carolina, that critics derided as a campaign vacation. But Mr. Carson attracts buyers by the hundreds, who exchange a few words with him as they stop for a signature.\n\nJason Walke, a trial lawyer in Des Moines, said that neither Mr. Trump nor another fiery outsider, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, \u201chas a snowball\u2019s chance of changing things in Washington the way Ben Carson does.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe someone as mild-mannered and gentlemanly as Ben Carson is just about the only kind of person that could,\u201d said Mr. Walke, who heard Mr. Carson speak to a modest crowd on the lawn of a fraternity house at Iowa State University on Saturday.\n\nSimilar views surfaced in a focus group of Republicans last week in Indiana: Many criticized Mr. Trump as divisive while praising Mr. Carson as \u201cwise\u201d and a \u201cgentleman.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump is rough; Carson is reassuring,\u201d said Peter D. Hart, who led the focus group. \u201cAnd the unknown elements of Carson are calming, and the known elements of Trump are disturbing.\u201d\n\nMr. Carson\u2019s events have a distinct feel. Voters approach him with something close to reverence, and he appears gracious and unhurried when interacting with them one on one. On Saturday, his wife, Candy, a Yale-trained classical violinist, sang an a cappella version of the national anthem on the lawn of the fraternity house.\n\nMr. Carson swept past Mr. Trump in two polls of Iowa Republicans last week despite rarely visiting the state. Now, he is promising to return at least twice monthly leading up to the Feb. 1 caucuses. \u201cThe key thing for me is I don\u2019t sit down and strategize like politicians because I\u2019m not a politician,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a politician. I think we need some authenticity. We need some honesty in our country right now.\u201d\n\nStatements he has made on the unsuitability of a Muslim to be president and the link between Nazis, gun control and the Holocaust, and his likening of President Obama\u2019s health care law to slavery, which appalled some critics, have not dimmed Mr. Carson\u2019s support. On the contrary, 57 percent of Republicans in the Register poll rated as \u201cvery attractive\u201d his comparison of the health care law to slavery. Seventy-three percent said his opposition to a Muslim as president made him more attractive.\n\nOn Sunday, he again invoked slavery, this time comparing it to abortion as he called for a ban on the procedure even in cases of rape and incest.\n\nMr. Carson\u2019s rise in Iowa is driven by his consolidation of evangelical voters, who represent close to 60 percent of Republican caucus-goers, a trend that could carry him strongly into later voting states in the South with similar demographics.\n\n\u201cPeople are very attracted to Ben Carson\u2019s bedside demeanor,\u201d said Bob Vander Plaats, a leader of the Christian right in Iowa.\n\nTraditionally, a single anti-establishment candidate has emerged from the state, finishing in the top two or three, around whom conservative Republicans rally. Mr. Carson, Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz are all vying for the role.\n\nIn two surveys last week, Mr. Carson led Mr. Trump soundly by eight and nine percentage points. A third survey by CBS News released Sunday showed the two tied in the state, but Mr. Trump held a robust lead in two other early voting states, New Hampshire and South Carolina.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand Iowa because frankly, I just left and we had tremendous crowds and tremendous enthusiasm,\u201d Mr. Trump told CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday. \u201cFrankly, even to be tied, I\u2019m a little surprised.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump appeals to a somewhat different demographic from Mr. Carson\u2019s: working-class voters with high school educations, for whom social issues and religious beliefs are less important. The rally he described, which drew thousands, was in the Democratic-leaning eastern side of the state, where he has done most of his campaigning.\n\nMany of those drawn to Mr. Carson and Mr. Trump have not participated in Iowa\u2019s caucus system before, making them more difficult to organize. The two are undertaking among the most aggressive efforts by any of the 15 Republicans running to encourage caucus participation.\n\nMuch of Mr. Carson\u2019s organizing is done by a \u201csuper PAC,\u201d which stationed volunteers at the Books-A-Million store in Ames, where he appeared Saturday. They buttonholed customers, collecting email addresses and phone numbers. The super PAC, known as the 2016 Committee, began training supporters about how to caucus recently.\n\n\u201cPeople that are following Ben, a lot of them support him but have never caucused and they need to know what to do,\u201d said Rita Davenport, a county chairwoman for the super PAC working the bookstore crowd.\n\n\u201cWe have the resources to go into each community and do these types of things,\u201d she said. \u201cThe campaign would be stretched far too thin to even think about going to each of these small towns and doing caucus training.\u201d\n\nDarren Westercamp, who emerged from the store with a signed Carson book, said he became curious about the candidate when he visited his father, a retired farmer, and noticed a Carson sticker on his vehicle.\n\n\u201cI grew up in a family that did not have stickers on their vehicles,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I saw that, I said I need to listen to this man.\u201d", "byline": "TRIP GABRIEL", "description": "The candidate\u2019s gentle demeanor has resonated with supporters as some recent polls show him now in the lead in the early-voting state of Iowa.", "title": "Calm Manner Has Ben Carson Rising in Polls", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/us/politics/calm-manner-has-ben-carson-rising-in-polls.html", "topics": ["abortion", "guns"], "people": ["Peter D.

{"body": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Presidential candidates proclaim that there has never been an election as important as this one.\n\n\u201cThe challenges we face now are direr than any time in our modern history,\u201d said Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democratic candidate.\n\n\u201cThis is not a typical election,\u201d said Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a Republican candidate. \u201cI think the stakes have never been higher.\u201d\n\nSure, no candidate is going to say this election is no big deal. But more important or more dire than 1932, in the midst of the Great Depression? Or 1940, on the verge of World War II? Or 1980 or 2008? In fact, the stakes for the two American political parties could be that great.\n\nConsider the likely ramifications of a 2016 defeat for Democrats or Republicans.\n\nIf the Democrats were to lose the presidency, it would be a near certainty that the party would not regain control of the Senate or the House of Representatives, where Republicans already enjoy comfortable margins. Republicans could control in excess of half the governorships and state legislatures in 2017.\n\nAnd Republican appointees are a majority on the Supreme Court, after a couple 5-to-4 liberal decisions on the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage, would probably tilt conservative again.\n\nSuch a scenario would make Republicans even more powerful than when they held all the levers of power from 2003 until 2007: Then, they didn\u2019t control as much on the state level, and in Congress there still were moderate to liberal party lawmakers, such as Arlen Specter and Lincoln Chafee, who often voted with Democrats. (Both subsequently became Democrats.) The Democrats, who consider themselves the governing party, would be in their weakest position since the 1920s.\n\nMoreover, they would be strikingly short of younger fresh faces \u2014 who is the party\u2019s equivalent of the 45-year-old Paul Ryan? In the Senate, Harry Reid, 75, is retiring and is likely to be replace as Democratic leader by Chuck Schumer, who will be 66 in January 2017. In the House, Nancy Pelosi, for more than a decade a powerhouse leader, is 75; the No. 2 Democrat, Steny Hoyer, is 76.\n\nThe party would struggle to find a way to highlight up-and-comers: senators such as Michael Bennet of Colorado, 50, and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, 48, or the likely next Maryland senator, whether Chris Van Hollen, 56, or Donna Edwards, 57. For the House, there is Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III of Massachusetts, 35, or promising candidates such as 44-year-old Lon Johnson, former state party chairman, running in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula.\n\nThe consequences of a loss would be even more cataclysmic for the Republicans, threatening a party split. It would be the sixth of the past seven elections in which Republicans have lost the popular vote. That has never happened before.\n\nThere are bitter schisms within the party. Mr. Ryan is likely to succeed John A. Boehner this week as House speaker, but there is already betting on how long his honeymoon with rival factions within the party will last. That, along with a divisive presidential contest, foreshadows a blood bath if the party loses next year.\n\nIf an establishment Republican \u2014 Jeb Bush, John Kasich or Marco Rubio \u2014 were to win the nomination and lose the election, the right wing would explode. It is an article of faith among the movement that the establishment needs to be decimated before the party can rebuild. A defeat with an establishment candidate would ignite those passions.\n\nIf one of the outsider candidates \u2014 Donald J. Trump, Ben Carson or Mr. Cruz \u2014 were to lead the ticket and was routed by a Democrat, the establishment would contemplate ways to diminish the role of those they consider the \u201cnuts\u201d in the party.\n\nUnlike with the Democrats, the Republicans do have some younger figures angling for leadership: Mr. Ryan, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio. But none transcend these fissures.\n\nAnd in the unlikely event that Mr. Trump were to win? Republicans and Democrats would both have some serious questions to ask themselves.", "byline": "ALBERT R.

{"body": " DES MOINES \u2014 Appearing at his first rally of the campaign on behalf of his wife, Bill Clinton exhorted the crowd to rise above the deeply partisan tone of this election cycle and said that Hillary Rodham Clinton had shown voters her truest self in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s still got the best friends that she had in grade school,\u201d said Mr. Clinton, whose wife has seen a decrease in the number of voters who view her as \u201chonest and trustworthy\u201d in polls after a summer spent fending off questions about her use of a private email server while she was the secretary of state.\n\nSomeone who can make that boast about their friends is by \u201cdefinition a trustworthy, reliable good person unless they had a toy theft gang going\u201d as a child, Mr. Clinton said.\n\nThe last month has been \u201cinteresting\u201d for his family, Mr. Clinton said, citing the first birthday of his granddaughter, Charlotte, and his 40th wedding anniversary with Mrs. Clinton.\n\nBut over the past few weeks of the campaign the country has finally gotten to see the person he met decades ago, Mr. Clinton said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the person I got to see again, without all those barnacles, in the debate and in those 11 hours of testimony,\u201d said Mr. Clinton, referring to her marathon testimony before the House committee investigating the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nEarlier, Mr. Clinton said that \u201cthe\u00a0American people in the last six weeks have learned a lot about Hillary \u2014 what she\u2019s for, why she\u2019s running, and what kind of president she\u2019d be.\u201d They also learned from Saturday Night Live that she\u2019s \u201ca pretty good bartender, too.\u201d\n\nHe said that he had received gushing emails from their friends praising her testimony. He wrote back, \u201cI think I\u2019ll vote for her.\u201d\n\nMr. Clinton\u2019s aides have long said that he does not use email.\n\nHis wife\u2019s policy goals in the campaign are crucial, Mr. Clinton said, using one of his signature phrases in describing them as a \u201cbig deal.\u201d\n\nMr. Clinton largely kept to a short speech, with his love of the stage threatening to take over only occasionally. Several times he promised to say \u201cone more thing,\u201d before remarking on just one more thing.\n\nMr. Clinton also decried the tenor of the debate in the Republican race, sounding the type of aspirational note that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. urged Democrats to engage in when he announced he would not seek the presidency himself last week.\n\n\u201cIf you want an end to negative politics, you have to stop rewarding it,\u201d Mr. Clinton told the rally. He denounced negative ads cut in \u201cdark rooms.\u201d And he suggested that ending wage stagnation was crucially important. The Democratic debate focused on issues, he said, while the Republicans have devolved into tearing each other apart.\n\nMr. Clinton said that America\u2019s political leaders had to \u201cstop running each other down and start building everybody up.\u201d By contrast, Mrs. Clinton used her remarks to laud President Obama\u2019s accomplishments and warn about what she called Republican efforts to \u201crip it away.\u201d\n\nOverhead, a plane flew with a sign trailing behind that\u00a0read, \u201cRevolution starts here! Feel the Bern!\u201d It was a reference to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has emerged as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s main rival in the Democratic contest.\n\nMr. Clinton also briefly found himself negotiating with a heckler who jumped on the stage in support of animal rights.\n\nAs the man continued yelling, Mr. Clinton genially continued talking, and the crowd booed to drown the man\u00a0out.\n\nBut after several moments, Mr. Clinton turned to the man and asked, \u201cWe got it. Will you please quit now?\u201d The man was soon escorted from the stage.\n\nThe former president turned back to the crowd and said, \u201cAt least that guy is for something.

Good news: Winds dropped rapidly, little serious damage was reported and Patricia shrank back into a mere tropical depression.\n\n_______\n\n3. In the presidential race, the Democratic field narrowed as Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee dropped out and Joe Biden announced he would definitely not run. Hillary Rodham Clinton withstood a marathon day before the House Benghazi panel and exchanged battling speeches with Bernie Sanders at Saturday night\u2019s Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Iowa. Monday is her 68th birthday.\n\n_______\n\n4. The Republican side was also in motion, ahead of Wednesday\u2019s third debate. The betting rose on Marco Rubio, above, as Jeb Bush slashed campaign spending. And support from conservative Christians helped push Ben Carson ahead of Donald Trump in Iowa polls \u2014 which Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter account mocked with an ill-advised retweet of a disparaging joke: \u201cToo much #Monsanto in the #corn creates issues in the brain?\u201d\n\n_______\n\n5. The auto industry suffered casualties, too. Tesla\u2019s stock dropped after Consumer Reports ceased recommending its Model S luxury electric car because of owner complaints. Management failures became clearer at Volkswagen, now down by a third of its value due to an emissions scandal. U.S. regulators said more Takata airbag problems could further widen the country\u2019s largest recall. On the upside, Ferrari stock (RACE on the ticker) closed its debut week at $56.38, giving the company a market value of nearly $11 billion.\n\n_______\n\n6. A surge in stock price after Amazon\u2019s strong earnings report pushed Jeff Bezos, above left, ahead of the Koch brothers and into third place on the list of richest Americans, behind Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.

{"body": "DES MOINES \u2014  She began her campaign with small-town round tables, not big-city rallies. She pleads for Iowans to caucus for her at the end of her events. And long after the Democratic Jefferson-Jackson dinner ended here late Saturday, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bill Clinton were still shaking people\u2019s hands, as if to send a signal that they had learned a painful lesson about not taking Iowa for granted.\n\nNearly eight years after Mrs. Clinton was humbled by a third-place finish in Iowa, she has gone to great lengths to demonstrate her commitment to winning the state that first propelled Barack Obama to the presidency. But in a campaign that seems to be testing every long-held assumption about the electorate, Mrs. Clinton is facing a stiff challenge from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont that is again showcasing her difficulties with liberal activists in a state where she and her husband do not have deep ties.\n\nShe lacks the enthusiasm that Mr. Sanders enjoys. If he is able to turn out his backers from the progressive wing of the party and augment them with liberal independents new to the caucus process, he could be a threat to defeat her. Even some of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters here are reluctant to project much confidence, believing that the populist fervor gripping the left makes it dangerous to dismiss Mr. Sanders as a mere protest candidate.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think we have a clue,\u201d said Representative Dave Loebsack, an Iowa Democrat and Clinton backer. \u201cThis year, not just on the Republican side but over all, there\u2019s so much instability among the electorate.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Sanders has his own challenges here, and, for now, Mrs. Clinton leads him in Iowa polls. With Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. not seeking the Democratic nomination, she will most likely receive an additional boost from Democrats who were still considering supporting the vice president. Mr. Biden\u2019s decision, along with her sure-footed performances at the first Democratic debate and before the congressional panel investigating the 2012 attack on the United States mission in Benghazi, Libya, has lifted Mrs. Clinton\u2019s spirits.\n\nHer sense of assuredness was on display at the party dinner Saturday, the same gathering where eight years ago, Mr. Obama gave the best speech of the night and soon after vaulted ahead of her and the rest of the field.\n\nMrs. Clinton, after directly engaging Mr. Sanders at the debate this month, only obliquely referred to him. At what is the highest-profile event on the Iowa political calendar before the caucuses, she reprised her stump speech targeting Republicans. Hers was the address, her advisers said afterward, of a candidate they believe has hit her stride.\n\nYet success has a way of breeding trouble for Mrs. Clinton, and as some of her supporters eyed the Sanders supporters streaming into the convention center where the dinner was held, they warned her not to let confidence slip into complacency.\n\n\u201cThis is not a slam dunk for her,\u201d said former Senator Tom Harkin, who served Iowa in Congress for 40 years, stating flatly that Mr. Sanders could win. \u201cHe\u2019s got this enthusiasm like Obama did,\u201d Mr. Harkin said. \u201cThe Hillary forces better not sit back.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders\u2019s backers boast that he is poised to deliver an upset because Mrs. Clinton has again misread the electorate. \u201cEstablishment politicians don\u2019t always see the anti-establishment things staring them in the face,\u201d said Erin Rial of Fort Dodge, who was captivated by Mr. Sanders early on.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s allies argue that this time they are better prepared. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, Robby Mook, sent a message about how invested she is in a state she considered pulling out of in the 2008 campaign. Mr. Mook, an evangelist for grass-roots organizing, showed up for the Jefferson-Jackson festivities, emphasizing the importance of building an infrastructure. Attendees at a pre-dinner rally featuring Mrs. Clinton and the pop singer Katy Perry were required to provide their contact information before gaining admittance.\n\nMany activists here noted a distinct difference from 2008. Bill Stammerman, a longtime Democrat in the Des Moines suburbs of Dallas County, recalled an out-of-state organizer from that campaign who did not relate well.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to run this campaign like it was in New York City and everything else, the big time,\u201d said Mr. Stammerman, a Clinton supporter then and now. \u201cI said, no, you don\u2019t do that in Iowa. In Iowa, you talk to small-town people and small-town newspapers and small groups.\u201d This campaign, Mr. Stammerman said, \u201cis more down to earth.\u201d\n\nThe dinner Saturday illustrated the distinct voting blocs represented by Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton \u2014 and illuminated Mr. Sanders\u2019s limitations. His progressive followers are driven by his appeals to address income inequality and other class inequities, and are especially stirred by his attacks on what he portrays as a corrupt political system manipulated by the wealthy. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s backers are traditional Democrats, many of them women inspired by the prospect of the first female president.\n\nThe competing chants filling the hall captured their differences. Mr. Sanders backers bellowed: \u201cYou can\u2019t buy us! You can\u2019t buy us!\u201d and \u201cHey, hey, ho, ho \u2014 the oligarchy has got to go.\u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters preferred a more straightforward \u201cI\u2019m with her! I\u2019m with her!\u201d\n\nBut Democrats got a reminder that Mr. Sanders, an independent and self-described democratic socialist, is not a member of their party. As Mrs. Clinton began her remarks well into the evening, hundreds of his supporters left the building to catch waiting buses or attend parties. It offended the polite sensibilities of some Iowans, and was a reminder of why he may find it difficult to appeal to the sort of mainline party activists who have backed the eventual Democratic nominee in all the contested caucuses here since 2000.\n\n\u201cAre the Sanders folks going to walk out on the Democrats if he\u2019s not the nominee?\u201d John Deeth, a liberal blogger from Iowa City, pointedly asked on his way out of the dinner.\n\nUnlike Mrs. Clinton and Martin O\u2019Malley, the other Democratic presidential candidate at the dinner, Mr. Sanders offered no homage, or mention at all, of Mr. Biden, a well-liked figure in the party. And he delivered a speech that he could have given in any state, making little attempt to highlight Iowa issues. Mrs. Clinton, conversely, paid homage to Iowa Democrats by name and attacked Iowa Republicans on health care.\n\nMr. Sanders signaled on Saturday night that he was prepared to fight. He is said to have hired a pollster for the first time this campaign, and repeatedly struck notes about areas where Mrs. Clinton has changed positions. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers are girding for a better-prepared version of Mr. Sanders in the next debate.\n\nBut while Mr. Sanders did use his remarks to portray the Clintons as inconsistent progressives, he could not bring himself to confront her directly the way she confronted him in their debate this month. Nor did he raise the issue of gun control, which Mrs. Clinton and Mr. O\u2019Malley discussed and which polls show could hurt Mr. Sanders in Iowa. (Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Iowa brochure now includes \u201cActing on Gun Violence\u201d as one of four issue priorities.)\n\nA Clinton triumph in Iowa could hasten the end of the Democratic primary season. Even if Mr. Sanders won in New Hampshire, the Clinton forces would seek to frame that victory as an anomaly resulting from his hailing from a neighboring state and New Hampshire\u2019s traditional affection for insurgents.\n\nThe political dynamic that has elevated Iowa, the state that haunted Mrs. Clinton\u2019s White House ambitions eight years ago, could now pave her way to the nomination. The difference now, say Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters, is that \u201cshe\u2019s not running against Obama,\u201d as Iowa\u2019s attorney general, Tom Miller, put it. \u201cThat was a magical campaign eight years ago.\u201d", "byline": "JONATHAN MARTIN and MAGGIE HABERMAN", "description": "Hillary Rodham Clinton has gone to great lengths to prevent Senator Bernie Sanders from undermining her campaign the way another senator, Barack Obama, did in the state in 2008.", "title": "Political Memo: Democratic Dinner Drives Home Hillary Clinton\u2019s Focus on Iowa", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/us/politics/democratic-dinner-drives-home-hillary-clintons-focus-on-iowa.html", "topics": ["guns"], "people": ["Tom Miller", "Tom Harkin", "Martin O'Malley", "Dave Loebsack", "Bill Clinton", "Katy Perry", "Hillary Clinton", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Barack Obama", "John Deeth", "Bernie Sanders", "Joseph R.

Trump from his monthslong polling advantage there, a development that has prompted Mr. Trump to attack Mr. Carson, one of the few Republican candidates he had so far largely ignored.\n\nAppearing on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Mr. Trump attacked Mr. Carson on immigration and called him \u201ca very low energy person,\u201d but he seemed perplexed at how the soft-spoken doctor had seized the lead in Iowa.\n\n\u201cBen doesn\u2019t even go to Iowa that much,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Trump brought up Mr. Carson\u2019s Seventh-day Adventist faith, which could prompt some concerns among Iowa\u2019s evangelicals, at a rally in Florida, but insisted in an interview Sunday that he was not attempting to attack Mr. Carson over his faith.\n\nAsked on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d why he had raised Mr. Carson\u2019s religion, Mr. Trump refused to apologize or offer an explanation for his comments.\n\n\u201cBecause I just said, I don\u2019t know about it,\u201d said Mr. Trump, repeating the phrase he used Saturday. \u201cI said nothing about it. I would never say bad. I\u2019d never say bad about any religion.\u201d ", "byline": "JONATHAN MARTIN", "description": "The Republican presidential candidate said abortion should be outlawed even in cases of rape and incest, comparing abortion with slavery.", "title": "First Draft: Ben Carson Calls for Ban on Abortion in All Circumstances", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/10/25/ben-carson-calls-for-ban-on-abortion-in-all-circumstances/", "topics": ["abortion", "immigration"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Donald J.

{"body": "\nHistory Dept.\n\n                        The GOP front-runner praises the conservative icon now, but in 1987 Trump blasted Reagan and his team.\nOctober 25, 2015\n\n                Getty\nIn 2016, there are 14 Republican presidential candidates for whom Ronald Reagan is both the benchmark for conservative values and the lodestar of conservative ideas. There\u2019s also one who wrote, in the second to last year of Reagan\u2019s presidency, that he had been \u201cso smooth, so effective a performer\u201d that \u201conly now, seven years later, are people beginning to question whether there\u2019s anything beneath that smile.\u201d\nThe gadfly was Donald Trump, writing in his book The Art of the Deal. But it wasn\u2019t just a glancing blow; to promote the book, Trump launched a political campaign that tore into Reagan\u2019s record, including his willingness to stand up to the Soviet Union. Advised by the notorious Roger Stone, a Nixon-era GOP trickster, in 1987 Trump purchased full-page ads in Trump took out full-page ads in The New York Times, Boston Globe and Washington Post blasting Reagan and his team.\nStory Continued Below\nIn the text, which was addressed \u201cTo the American people,\u201d Donald Trump declared, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with America\u2019s Foreign Defense Policy that a little backbone can\u2019t cure.\u201d The problem was America\u2019s leading role in defending democracy, which had been fulfilled by Republicans and Democrats all the way back to FDR. Foreshadowing his 2015 argument that would have Mexico pay for an American built border wall, Trump then said that the United States should present its allies with a bill for defense services rendered. \nThe ads, which cost more than $90,000, came after Trump had visited the Soviet Union and met with Mikhail Gorbachev. (A few years earlier, Trump had offered himself as a replacement for Reagan\u2019s nuclear arms control negotiators, whom he considered too soft.) Trump followed his letter to America with a trip to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where voters were eyeing the candidates in the 1988 primary. There he spoke to the Rotary Club, which met Yoken\u2019s restaurant where the sign out front featured a spouting whale and the slogan, \u201cThar she blows!\u201d In his talk Trump sounded some of the same themes he offers today, except for the fact that the bad guys who were laughing at the United States were the Japanese and not the Mexicans or Chinese.\n\u201cWe\u2019re being ripped off and decimated by many foreign nations who are supposedly our allies,\u201d said Trump. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we have a share of their money? I don\u2019t mean you demand it. But I tell you what, folks, we can ask in such a way that they\u2019re going to give it to us\u2014if the right person\u2019s asking. \u2026 The Japanese, when they negotiate with us, they have long faces. But when the negotiations are over, it is my belief\u2014I\u2019ve never seen this\u2014they laugh like hell.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s 1987 pseudo-campaign generated invaluable amounts of free publicity and contributed greatly to the sales of The Art of the Deal, which appeared on shelves a few weeks after Trump spoke in Portsmouth. The experience reinforced what Trump already knew about manipulating the press corps, which then, as now, found him irresistible. (Audiences loved him too. One woman in New Hampshire told a reporter that Trump reeked of the \u201caphrodisiac\u201d of power.) In the pages of the book he defends his practice of hype, calling it \u201ctruthful hyperbole\u201d and he hinted at his future practice of outrageous rhetoric noting that the press \u201clove[s] stories about extreme.\u201d\nAlthough he barely touched on politics in The Art of the Deal, when he did Trump was an equal opportunity critic. He criticized Reagan; but he also wrote that Democrat Jimmy Carter \u201ccouldn\u2019t do the job\u201d of president. \nAfter The Art of the Deal went into paperback in 1988, Trump contemplated challenging Ed Koch in the race for mayor of New York City. Stone was again consulted along with Republican National Committee chairman Lee Atwater. Atwater was as rough as they came. He once explained, with shocking candor, how political race-bating had evolved since the 1950s. \u201cBy 1968 you can\u2019t say \u2018nigger\u2019\u2014that hurts you, backfires,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you say stuff like, uh, \u2018forced busing, states\u2019 rights,\u2019 and all that stuff, and you\u2019re getting so abstract. Now, you\u2019re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you\u2019re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites. \u2026 \u201cWe want to cut this,\u201d is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than \u2018Nigger, nigger.\u2019\u201d\nTrump, who had also considered running for governor of New York, decided not to try to become mayor. \nThroughout the 1990s Trump was occupied with rebuilding a fortune he had lost which his Trump Shuttle airline failed and two of his Atlantic City casinos went bankrupt. When this work was finished he and he had another book to sell, he left the GOP in 1999 in order to flirt with the Reform Party. Catnip for the media, he appeared on Meet the Press, Fox News Sunday and Face the Nation. His outrageousness then was comparable to his outrageousness now. He said of opponent Pat Buchannan, \u201cHe\u2019s a Hitler lover; I guess he\u2019s an anti-Semite. He doesn\u2019t like the blacks, he doesn\u2019t like the gays.\u201d He said that his ideal running mate would be Oprah Winfrey because \u201cshe\u2019s popular, she\u2019s brilliant, she\u2019s a wonderful woman.\u201d\nThen, as now, Trump believed that Americans wanted an outsider who would offer more political pizzaz than the likes of John McCain, Al Gore and the first George Bush whom he described as \u201cout of touch.\u201d Among his sons, though, Trump found something to admire in Jeb. \u201cHe\u2019s exactly the kind of political leader this country needs now and will very much need in the future.\u201d \nHe also offered some words of advice, and even comfort, to outgoing president Bill Clinton. He wrote that Clinton should have refused to answer all questions about the Monica Lewinsky affair and declared that Americans didn\u2019t really care about Clinton\u2019s sexual escapades. He also described a \u201cconservative columnist, married, who was particularly rough on Clinton in this regard. He also brought his girlfriend to my resorts for the weekend.\u201d And while he wrote that he disagreed with First Lady Hillary Clinton\u2019s health care reform specifics he added, \u201cNo one can deny her good intentions.\u201d He also called her, \u201csmart and resilient.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s campaign book, The America We Deserve, was offered as a souvenir for purchase to those who paid to attend the how-to-succeed speeches Trump made in the run-up to the party convention. Much of the book was taken-up with a recapitulation of his life experience, which, he would insist, proved him ready to become leader of the free world. Trump argued in terms that would be familiar today. He said any president should be a great negotiator who can make deals. \u201cThe dealmaker is cunning, secretive, focused and never settles for less than he wants,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since America had a president like that.\u201d\nAmong the few policy nuggets in the book were some with a truly liberal tone. Trump wanted a ban on assault weapons and waiting periods for gun purchasers. He also favored a national health care system. \u201cWe must have universal healthcare,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cDoctors might be paid less than they are now, as is the case in Canada, but they would be able to treat more patients because of the reduction in their paperwork. \u2026 The Canadian plan also helps Canadians live longer and healthier than Americans. There are fewer medical lawsuits, less loss of labor to sickness, and lower costs to companies paying for the medical care of their employee. \u2026 We need, as a nation, to reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing.\u201d\nIn that same book, Trump also proposed a one-time net-worth tax on the richest Americans (those worth more than $10 million) in order to reduce the federal debt. \u201cBy imposing a one-time 14.25 percent net-worth tax on the richest individuals and trusts, we can put America on sound financial footing for the next century,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe plan would cost me $700 million personally in the short term, but it would be worth it.\u201d\nThe Trump for President 2000 campaign featured his claim that \u201cthe only difference between me and the other candidates is that I\u2019m more honest and my women are more beautiful.\u201d He also complained of politicians who cited their humble origins. He mocked them for saying, in effect, \u201cElect me, I\u2019m a loser.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s Reform Party bid ended with a whimper as he withdrew complaining that the people in the party were too hardcore right wing for his tastes. Never a fan of George W. Bush, Trump actually registered as a Democrat in 2001. (He then returned to the GOP, and was listed on New York registration rolls as a Republican in 2009.) On October 5, 2010, Trump called in to MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d show to say he was \u201cabsolutely thinking about\u201d running for president in 2012. This time he didn\u2019t have a book to sell but his TV show, The Apprentice, was on the air. He followed up with Fox News, with a pitch that the audience could have heard from Trump in 1987. \u201cWe have no common sense. We have no common sense. And we\u2019re losing this country. Mark my words, if we keep going this way, we\u2019re losing this country. It will no longer be great. It\u2019s not respected to anywhere near what it used to be.\u201d\nAlmost 40 years have passed since Donald Trump first began talking about how leaders in other countries have been outsmarting America and the nation was foundering due to poor leadership and a lack of backbone. His prescription for what ails the country has always been the same: a great big dose of Donald Trump, proven so effective when it comes to the construction of his own popularity and fortune. \nHis upcoming book, Crippled America, is not likely to offer anything different; but in publishing it Trump will surely reap a profit in cash and attention. Readers who get him to sign their books should profit, too. A copy of The America We Deserve, signed by Trump in gold-colored ink, is offered today on eBay for $400.\nWhat Works\n\n                    By \n                            T.R.

That phrase echoed Obama\u2019s \u201cFired up! Ready to go!\u201d call-and-response chant that tore through the room then -- and shocked a less organized, less fired-up Clinton campaign that was based on experience and competence.\nStory Continued Below\nOn Saturday, the sting of the 2008 J-J Dinner -- and Clinton\u2019s determination to capture some of the energy that became a feature of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 insurgency -- was at the forefront of the campaign\u2019s planning. Hours before the dinner, the campaign announced an endorsement from David Plouffe, Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign manager. \u201cTo be honest, during the most intense days of the 2008 primary, I would never have imagined writing this,\u201d Plouffe wrote. \u201cAnd I doubt Team Clinton felt any differently about me \u2026 She\u2019s the right person to protect President Obama\u2019s legacy on health care and so much else.\u201d\nThe campaign also seemed to have learned its lesson about being out-organized. More than 100 volunteers and staffers, at points joined by campaign manager Robby Mook, started marching in the streets of downtown Des Moines before 7 a.m. on a chilly fall Saturday. The campaign headquarters in Des Moines was filled by the afternoon with hundreds of volunteers attending a training session, dressed in royal-blue T-shirts that read \u201cI\u2019m Fighting for Her.\u201d The campaign also brought out the big dog for his first official appearance on the trail: Former President Bill Clinton gave a 15-minute speech Saturday afternoon, appearing to relish being back on the campaign trail and in the spotlight.\n\"The American people in the last six weeks have learned a lot about Hillary \u2014 what she\u2019s for, why she\u2019s running, and what kind of president she\u2019d be,\" he told a large crowd that had lined up and waited for an hour-and-a-half for a short set performed by Perry. \"If they watched 'Saturday Night Live,' they know she\u2019s a pretty good bartender, too.\"\n\n\n\n            By \nAnnie Karni\n             and \nGlenn Thrush\n\nThe dinner also marks a critical moment for Sanders, who needs to show he can maintain the enthusiasm that buoyed him all summer even as Clinton grows in strength after the one-two punch of her debate performance and her testimony Thursday in front of the House Benghazi Committee. At Clinton\u2019s rally, a single-engine plane flying a banner \u201cRevolution Starts Now: FEEL THE BERN,\u201d flew over the modest stage set up in front of the Hy-Vee Hall, a sign of the challenge Clinton still faces, even as she benefits from the boost of a ten-day winning streak.\nSanders\u2019 campaign also planned a rally before the dinner, with alumni of the band Guster getting the crowd amped up. \u201cOur allotted 1,950 seats will all be full,\u201d said Robert Becker, Iowa State director for the Sanders campaign. \u201cBernie will address the rally, and then we\u2019ll march across the Des Moines River. We\u2019re going to be a diverse and rowdy bunch.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Her campaign rolls out Bill Clinton and Katy Perry to capture the energy that electrified Barack Obama's campaign eight years ago.", "title": "Hillary Clinton gears up for Iowa&apos;s Jefferson-Jackson dinner", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/clinton-iowa-215133", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "campaign_finance", "surveillance/privacy"], "people": ["Katy O'Donnell", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Eliza Collins", "Katy Perry", "Rachael Bade", "Helena Bottemiller Evich", "Henry C.

David Vitter's image rating tanking among the state's voters, compared to the popular Rep. John Bel Edwards. | AP Photo\n\n            By \nKevin Robillard\n\n10/24/15 11:59 PM EDT\nDavid Vitter barely survived months of attacks \u2014 including explicit references to his 2007 prostitution scandal \u2014 to outlast two other Republicans in Saturday's Louisiana gubernatorial primary and earn a spot in a runoff election next month.\nBut now the toughest test yet looms for Vitter: What was once expected to be an easy race against the lone major Democratic candidate has the scandal-marred second-term senator again fighting for his political life.\nStory Continued Below\nState Rep. John Bel Edwards \u2014 who finished first in Saturday's open primary with 40 percent of the vote, according to The Associated Press \u2014 starts the month-long sprint to the runoff ahead of Vitter in the polls. Louisiana is an unlikely pick-up opportunity for Democrats \u2014 a party that doesn't control a governorship or state legislative chamber in the Deep South after decades of dominance.\nDemocrats believe Edwards, a West Point graduate and former Army Ranger who opposes abortion rights and supports gun rights, is the perfect candidate to tack on Vitter, even if the latter is a long-time conservative juggernaut with plentiful financial backing. But even an ideal Democrat and a flawed Republican might not be enough to win in a state President Barack Obama lost by 16 percentage points in 2012 and then-Sen. Mary Landrieu, who comes from a legendary Louisiana political family, lost by 12 percentage points a runoff last year. \nEdwards projected confidence in the Nov. 21 runoff during his victory speech Saturday night.\n\"We're going to kick their butts,\" he predicted, before shifting to emphasize his own honesty and question Vitter: \"David Vitter wouldn't last five minutes at West Point.\"\nAmong those Edwards still needs to convince of his viability is the Democratic Governors' Association, which has yet to spend money on television ads in the contest and isn't committing to do so during the run-off. The DGA is sending Scott Arcenaux, a Louisiana native who was previously executive director of the Florida Democratic Party, to assist Edwards' campaign.\n\"John Bel Edwards has proudly served our nation and the state of Louisiana with integrity,\" DGA Executive Director Elisabeth Pearson said, adding: \"The primary results were a clear repudiation of David Vitter\u2019s tired Washington politics. Louisiana voters know that they just can\u2019t trust David Vitter. That\u2019s why more than 70 percent of them rejected his campaign today.\"\nVitter \u2014 who finished second with only 23 percent, three percentage points ahead of Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle, the third-place finisher \u2014 is deeply wounded, in part driven by attacks from rivals within his own party. Just this week, Angelle and Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne reignited talk of his 2007 prostitution scandal, and a Republican sheriff arrested a private investigator working for Vitter's campaign and accused him of spying. \nPolls have shown Vitter's image rating tanking among the state's voters, compared to the popular Edwards. But while Vitter had focused his primary campaign on his GOP rivals, the Republican Governors Association revved up its attacks on Edwards, spending $1 million in the final weeks on TV ads that call Edwards an \"Obama liberal\" and features audio of Edwards saying \"I supported the president\" four different times. \nThe RGA formally endorsed Vitter on Saturday night.\n\"As a dedicated leader for Louisiana, David Vitter has been committed to making government work better for the people by cutting wasteful spending and fighting back against President Obama\u2019s executive overreach,\" Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, the RGA chairman, said in a statement. \"His record of reform shows that he knows what it takes to solve Louisiana\u2019s most pressing issues.\"\nEdwards' ads rarely mention his party affiliation and instead emphasize his most conservative policy positions. One ad features Edwards and his wife discussing their decision to keep her pregnancy after a diagnosis of spinal bfida in the womb. Their daughter, Samantha, is now in graduate school and engaged, the ad says. \n\"John Bel never flinched,\" Edwards' wife Donna says in the spot. \"He just said, 'No, we're gonna love this baby no matter what.'\"\nAnother ad highlights Edwards' military background, with a trio of his West Point colleagues discussing why Edwards was chosen to be on a committee enforcing the school's legendary honor code. \n\"John Bel Edwards doesn't just talk about his values, he lives them every day,\" one of his classmates says, providing a not-so-subtle contrast to Vitter. \nVitter used most of his firepower in the primary targeting GOP Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne and Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle, but he did attack Edwards \u2014 who has held elected office for eight years and is in the seventh generation of his family to hold elected office in the state \u2014 as part of the status quo in Baton Rouge during debates. Vitter, who has prided himself on being an outsider since he led the charge for term limits in the state in the 1990s, could recycle some of his critiques of Angelle and Dardenne's use of perks for elected officials in attacking Edwards. \nBased on Vitter's speech to supporters Saturday night, the senator plans on tying Edwards to President Barack Obama and Washington Democrats.\n\"Let\u2019s be very clear: John Bel Edwards is not a casual supporter of Barack Obama. He\u2019s a true believer,\" Vitter said. \"Voting for John Bel Edwards is the same as voting for Barack Obama as governor of Louisiana.\"\nDespite that message, Vitter may not have the benefit of a unified GOP. Vitter has clearly alienated supporters of both Dardenne and Angelle. Dardenne, in particlular, has repeatedly attack Vitter's integrity. Neither Dardenne nor Angelle endorsed Vitter during their concession speeches on Saturday night. \n\"He's cheated, he lied and now he's been caught spying,\" Dardenne said in a web video his campaign posted Saturday, adding: \"We can avoid the disappointment, the embarrassment, the ridicule, the shame.\"\nTerm-limited Gov. Bobby Jindal's poor approval ratings have Democrats planning to link Vitter to the outgoing governor \u2014 despite a personal feud that dates back to when Jindal, who had succeeded Vitter in the House after his Senate promotion, less-than-enthusiastically defended Vitter from calls to resign after the prostitution allegations.\nEdwards has been a major critic of Jindal's policies, particularly cuts to higher education and health care. And since easily winning a second term in 2011, Jindal's popularity in the state has plummeted \u2014 especially after launching his long-shot presidential campaign. \n\"With eight years of Bobby Jindal \u2014 and his numbers are in the tank below even the president \u2014 what the governor does is on the front of people's minds,\" said state Sen. Karen Carter-Peterson, the chair of the state Democratic Party. \"The Republican Party has been tarnished by Jindal's failures and Vitter's scandal.\" \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Vitter barely makes Louisiana governor runoff", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/vitter-louisiana-governors-race-215135", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Mary Landrieu", "Katy O'Donnell", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Eliza Collins", "Bill Haslam", "Katy Perry", "Rachael Bade", "Helena Bottemiller Evich", "Henry C.

Look at Iraq. Iraq used to be no terrorists. [Hussein] would kill the terrorists immediately, which is like now it's the Harvard of terrorism,\" he said. \"If you look at Iraq from years ago, I'm not saying he was a nice guy, he was a horrible guy, but it was a lot better than it is right now.

It is possible to win a party\u2019s nomination without winning the earliest states, if the candidates who do win seem unelectable: That\u2019s how Bill Clinton won in 1992, and Rubio\u2019s candidacy has certain obvious similarities to Clinton\u2019s.\u201d http://nyti.ms/205WgvS\nDEEP DIVE \u2013 RICK PERLSTEIN in the Washington Spectator, \u201cSlow Burn: Bernie Sanders Ignites a Populist Movement: \u201cConservatives drawn to a socialist senator.\u201d http://bit.ly/1kAxSCm\nBONUS GREAT WEEKEND READS, curated by Daniel Lippman:\n--\u201cOut of The Darkness,\u201d by ACLU\u2019s Noa Yachot on Medium: \u201cHow two psychologists teamed up with the CIA to devise a torture program and experiment on human beings.\u201d http://bit.ly/1KuRfBu\n--\u201cTears and Terror: The Disturbing Final Years of Mickey Rooney,\u201d by The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Gary Baum and Scott Feinberg: \u201cHe was one of Hollywood's greatest actors, someone whose estate could have been worth hundreds of millions when he died in summer 2014.

He just said it in the wrong place.\nThe New Jersey governor was kicked out of Amtrak\u2019s \u201cquiet car\u201d for reportedly screaming (or, at least, talking loudly) on the phone during a return ride to New Jersey from Washington on an Acela Express. He later apologized for breaking the transit company\u2019s \u201ccardinal rule.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\nAccording to Christie\u2019s spokesperson Sam Smith, the GOP presidential candidate who appeared on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d prior to his departure, took a seat in the quiet car by accident during his morning travels. \n\"On a very full train this morning, the Governor accidentally took a seat in Amtrak's notorious quiet car,\" Smith said.\n\"After breaking the cardinal rule of the quiet car, the Governor promptly left once he realized the serious nature of his mistake and enjoyed the rest of his time on the train from the cafe car. Sincere apologies to all the patrons of the quiet car that were offended.\"\nAmtrak\u2019s passenger guidelines urge riders to use quiet voices to help maintain a \u201clibrary like atmosphere\u201d in that particular car. \nThe story was initially reported on Gawker, where someone claiming to be a nearby passenger said the governor was yelling a lot.\nChristie continues to lag in early voting state polls, coming in 12th in a recent Iowa poll by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics. \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The New Jersey governor is kicked out of Amtrak\u2019s \u201cquiet car\u201d for making noise.", "title": "Chris Christie too loud for Amtrak", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/chris-christie-amtrak-2016-quiet-car-215145", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Katy O'Donnell", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Rachael Bade", "Henry C.

Goldman\n\n\n                                            By \nTodd S. Purdum\n\nSenate Republicans\u2019 carefully-laid plans to use a powerful fast-track tool to send an Obamacare repeal to President Barack Obama is running into fresh resistance, with new opposition from high-profile conservatives and bubbling concerns from moderates. \nFor months, the GOP-led Congress has planned to use the procedural maneuver known as \u201creconciliation\u201d to finally shepherd a major Obamacare repeal bill to the president\u2019s desk. The fast-track process ensures Democrats in the Senate can\u2019t filibuster the legislation and foil yet another attempt to gut the law. \nStory Continued Below\nBut three conservative members of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s conference \u2014 Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah \u2014 have already vowed to vote against the current reconciliation package that repeals major parts of Obamacare, arguing it doesn\u2019t go far enough. If those votes don\u2019t budge, McConnell can\u2019t afford to lose any more votes from his 54-member ranks. \nMeanwhile, a provision in the reconciliation bill that defunds Planned Parenthood for one year could cause some heartburn for moderates who don\u2019t support stripping money from the women\u2019s health group. The group has come under significant Capitol Hill scrutiny, particularly from Republicans, over whether the organization profited from sales of fetal tissue. \n\n\n\n            By \n                    Nancy Cook\n             and \nRachana Pradhan\n\n\u201cIt is a mistake to do anything less than a full Obamacare repeal on reconciliation,\u201d Cruz, who is vying for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, told Politico in a brief interview. \u201cThat\u2019s what Republicans promised the voters we would do, and that\u2019s exactly what we should do.\u201d \nFrom the other ideological end of the GOP spectrum, Maine Sen. Susan Collins said she was concerned that the reconciliation bill defunded Planned Parenthood. Still, she said: \u201cI would look at the whole bill.\u201d \nAnother moderate Republican, Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, has voted against measures to defund the women\u2019s health group, and would likely come under criticism in his uphill reelection bid in the blue state if he switched course on Planned Parenthood on reconciliation. He referred a reporter to a spokeswoman, who declined to comment. \nAlaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski is a third Senate Republican who has voiced objections in the past to broadly defunding Planned Parenthood. A Murkowski spokeswoman said it was premature to comment on the reconciliation package. \nWith a 240-189 vote on Friday, the House passed the reconciliation bill repealing key elements of Obamacare, including the individual and employer mandates as well as two taxes in the health care law \u2013 the Cadillac tax on pricey benefit plans and a tax on medical devices. The bill now goes to the Senate, where leaders have not indicated when senators will take up the legislation. \nBut Senate conservatives, as well as activist groups off the Hill, are prodding Republican lawmakers to do more to rip apart Obamacare. Lee said significant portions of the health care law could be addressed through reconciliation, but those provisions are not included in the current version. For example, Lee would like the measure to roll back provisions such as Medicaid expansion and subsidies provided to millions of consumers who purchase health care coverage through the Obamacare exchanges. \n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to be using reconciliation at all, we ought to use it to repeal as much of Obamacare, as much as we can,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIf we\u2019re not going to do that \u2026 we ought not to use it.\u201d \nThe Utah senator joined Cruz and Rubio \u2014 who like Cruz is a 2016 presidential contender \u2014 to issue a statement last week that said the trio of conservatives would vote against the reconciliation bill unless it\u2019s changed to repeal as much of Obamacare that is allowed under Senate rules. \nThat group didn\u2019t include Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is also running for the GOP presidential nomination and would likely feel pressure to align with Cruz and Rubio in making more conservative demands on gutting the health care law. \n\u201cIf it\u2019s repealing Obamacare, I\u2019ll be a yes,\u201d Paul told Politico. When asked whether the partial repeal in the House package is problematic for him, Paul responded: \u201cI\u2019m for repealing the whole thing. I don\u2019t know exactly what will come forward yet.\u201d \nPaul, along with Cruz, voted against the Senate Republican budget earlier this year that helped set up the fast-track procedures. \nThe reconciliation push is largely a political exercise, since Obama will veto any legislation that shreds key elements of his signature domestic policy achievement. But Republicans want to put the president in a position that forces him to take out his veto pen on an Obamacare repeal \u2014 a position that unifies the GOP, more than five years after the controversial law was enacted. \n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\nThe Senate is working with a narrower margin of error than in the House, where just seven House GOP lawmakers opposed the reconciliation package on Friday. And some of those Republicans are moderate members who have previously opposed their party\u2019s attempts to strip funding from Planned Parenthood. \nThe limited dissension from House Republicans, some aides said, also showed some waning influence of the feisty outside group Heritage Action, which lobbied GOP lawmakers to oppose the package because it didn\u2019t go far enough to dismantle the health care law. \n\u201cThe only thing that\u2019s changed since the budget debate is that the House ignored Heritage Action\u2019s attempt to get members to vote against Obamacare repeal and for Planned Parenthood funding,\u201d one senior Republican aide said. \u201cEven the Freedom Caucus thought that was a ridiculous demand.\u201d \nHeritage Action, like the three conservative Senate Republicans who have vowed to oppose the reconciliation bill as written, are pushing GOP lawmakers to go much bigger and more fully repeal Obamacare under the fast-track budget procedure. \nBut the Senate is limited by special procedural rules that precisely define what can actually be done under reconciliation. The chamber\u2019s parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, would have the final word on what would be allowed under the so-called Byrd rule, named after the late Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.). \n\nCongress\n\n            By \nShane Goldmacher\n             and \nAnna Palmer\n\nEarlier this year, MacDonough privately hinted to Senate Republican aides that a full repeal of the health care law would not be allowed under the Byrd rule. But, when asked about the parliamentarian\u2019s role in the reconciliation fight, Cruz said last week that \u201cat the end of the day, the Senate parliamentarian is an employee of the Senate\u201d and stressed that all Republicans campaigned on Obamacare repeal. \nBut McConnell will allow amendments to the House reconciliation package, and conservatives are sure to offer changes to shape the Obamacare measure more to their liking. There has also been speculation on the Hill that the Planned Parenthood provisions might be subject to the Byrd rule. \nRegardless, Democrats are likely to use the health care package \u2014 particularly its measures stripping funding from Planned Parenthood \u2014 as a political cudgel against Senate Republicans up for reelection in blue and purple states in 2016. \n\u201cVulnerable Republican senators who have already voted repeatedly to defund Planned Parenthood are desperate to erase their records of reducing access to women\u2019s health care,\u201d said Sadie Weiner, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \u201cBut voters in 2016 will know without a doubt that these senators are more interested in scoring political points than in supporting women\u2019s health care.\u201d \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "McConnell is having a hard time getting a simple-majority bill through the Senate.", "title": "Obamacare repeal hits resistance from conservatives", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/obamacare-repeal-senate-mcconnell-215147", "topics": ["trade", "surveillance/privacy"], "people": ["Katy O'Donnell", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Lisa Murkowski", "Arthur Allen", "Rachael Bade", "Henry C.

Bernie Sanders on Sunday challenged Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton\u2019s characterization of why her husband, former President Bill Clinton, signed the Defense of Marriage Act, which denied federal recognition of gay marriages.\nHillary Clinton said on Friday she supported the 1996 legislation as a defensive measure to prevent an even stricter amendment to the Constitution doing the same thing. And Sanders took issue with that, saying it was a \u201chomophobic\u201d and politically expedient law.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cI think the evidence is very, very clear that that legislation was anti-gay legislation,\u201d he said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cIt was playing off the fears of a lot of Americans.\u201d\nIn a Friday appearance on \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show\u201d on MSNBC, Hillary Clinton said there was enough momentum in 1996 to amend the Constitution. DOMA, she said, was \u201ca line that was drawn to prevent going further.\u201d\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\nSanders, an independent senator from Vermont who is running for president as a Democrat, voted against the bill when he was a member of the House \u2014 which he said was \u201cnot an easy vote\u201d because of the political atmosphere at the time.\n\u201cI thought then \u2014 and I think now \u2014 that people have the right to love those folks that they want to love and get married because of their sexual orientation,\u201d Sanders said.\nSince then, though, he said, \u201cWe have become a far less discriminatory society,\u201d and \u201cwe should be very, very proud \u2026 We\u2019ve come a long way.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Sanders: Hillary&apos;s wrong on gay marriage law", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-gay-marriage-215139", "topics": ["personality", "surveillance/privacy", "lgbt issues", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Katy O'Donnell", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Bill Clinton", "Rachael Bade", "Henry C.

But, you know, I am soft-spoken. I do have a tendency to be relaxed,\u201d Carson said in an interview aired Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press.\u201d \nStory Continued Below\nCarson was responding to Trump\u2019s renewed line of attack, repeated in Iowa, that Carson is \u201csuper low energy\u201d as he pulled ahead there last week in a pair of key polls.\n\"You know, everybody has their own personality. And if he'd like to do that, that's fine. That's not who I am,\" the retired neurosurgeon said of Trump. \"I don't get into the mud pit. And I'm not going to be talking about people. I will tell you in terms of energy I'm not sure that there's anybody else running who's spent 18 or 20 hours intently operating on somebody.\"\nIn the interview aired Sunday, Carson also defended his controversial comments about how gun control allowed the Nazis to carry out the Holocaust. \n\u201cIn the last several weeks, I've heard from many people in the Jewish community, including rabbis, who said, \u2018You're spot on. You are exactly right,\u2019\u201d Carson said. \u201cI think it is generally agreed that it's much more difficult to dominate people who are armed than people who are not armed.\n\"You know,\" he added, \"some people will try to take that and, you know, make it into an anti-Jewish thing, which is foolishness.\u201d\nOn abortion, Carson said he \u201cwould love\u201d to see Roe v. Wade overturned, and abortion should be illegal even in cases of rape or incest. \nThere should be room to discuss abortion in cases where the mother\u2019s life is in danger, he added, though \u201cin the ideal situation, the mother should not believe that the baby is her enemy and should not be looking to terminate the baby.\u201d\nAnd on Syria, Carson said he would talk with Russia without capitulating to them. \nRussian President Vladimr Putin \"has expansionist ideals,\u201d Carson said. \u201cWhen he came into Syria, he said he was coming there to fight ISIS. But was he really? ... It was the anti-Assad forces that he was there to fight. So, you know, we have to look at that. And I think we have to oppose him.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Carson: I&#8217;m not super low energy, just soft-spoken", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/ben-carson-trump-energy-215137", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Katy O'Donnell", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Rachael Bade", "Henry C.

{"body": "\nHistory Dept.\n\n                        Why would we consider trying it again?\n\n            By \n                    Claudio Saunt\n\nOctober 25, 2015\n\n                The Granger Collection, New York\nDonald Trump says that he would deport all undocumented immigrants in the United States, an estimated 11 million people. American cities and counties in the Southwest and Midwest tried to expel Mexican-Americans once before in the 1930s, with traumatic results for the families affected. But perhaps an even more illuminating comparison is with the mass deportation that the United States sponsored a hundred years earlier, in the 1830s. \nIn that decade, the federal government uprooted some 80,000 Native Americans from their homes and forced them west of the Mississippi, into what is now Oklahoma. It was a humanitarian disaster and remains one of the most shameful episodes in the country\u2019s history. Though few if any Americans are proud of the Trail of Tears, as the Cherokees call their harrowing expulsion from the Southeast and deadly journey westward, politicians are now seriously proposing a similar policy toward undocumented immigrants. \u201cI think it\u2019s worth discussing,\u201d stated Ben Carson, Trump\u2019s closest rival for the Republican presidential nomination.\nStory Continued Below\nThere are some obvious differences between undocumented immigrants today and native peoples in the early 1830s. For one, American Indians had been living in what is now the United States since \u201ctime immemorial,\u201d as many people observed in the era, whereas undocumented immigrants are recent arrivals. \nBut there are many similarities too. Just as Indians were a reviled minority, so too undocumented immigrants are victims of vicious racism. Just as Indians occupied a legal netherworld\u2014neither fully sovereign nor accorded the rights of U.S. citizens\u2014so too undocumented immigrants find themselves living in similarly nebulous conditions, subject to unchecked administrative rulings and often left in jail without judicial recourse. Just as state governments passed laws to drive Indians off their lands, so have they done with undocumented immigrants. (Alas, my home state of Georgia led the way in both the 1820s and the 2010s.) \nThe similarities and differences could be debated at length, but undocumented immigrants undeniably face the same threat as Indians in the early 19th century: state-administered deportation. In the 1830s, the United States oversaw the forced emigration of about 0.6 percent of the population within its borders. As a proportion of the current U.S. population, Donald Trump proposes to deport six times as many individuals. \nNearly 200 years ago the results were disastrous. Officials were hired with no knowledge of indigenous languages and no experience with the people who spoke them. Francis Armstrong, who was appointed to deport the Choctaws, for example, was said to be a \u201cpet\u201d of President Andrew Jackson and was \u201centirely ignorant of the actual state of things\u201d in the Choctaw Nation. Benjamin Currey, in charge of Cherokee deportation, managed to alienate the Cherokees almost instantly with his foul temper. After watching a party of starving and ill-clothed Choctaw migrants pass by his house in Lake Providence, Louisiana, one retired army officer condemned the \u201cunprincipled\u201d emigration agents who sought to profit from the miseries of the victims.\nThe liquidation of property, real and personal, invited corruption. Government agents bought the possessions that emigrants were forced to leave behind\u2014pots and pans, livestock, and even violins\u2014at a steep discount. They colluded with business partners to purchase the most valuable land at a pittance. And, while some earnestly made the best effort they could to ensure the health of displaced families, others neglected to feed the emigrants, left them stranded in frigid temperatures and failed to provide basic medical care. When the deportees arrived in the trans-Mississippi West, they had no means of subsistence. Some starved to death.\nModern air travel eliminates some of these difficulties, but not all of them. Undocumented immigrants would still be pressed to liquidate their possessions overnight. They would be forced to leave behind family members. And, like native peoples in the 1830s, they would face uncertain and even dangerous conditions when they reach their destinations.\nIndian Removal was at the time the single-most contentious issue the nation had ever faced, as measured by the hundreds of petitions\u2014nearly all of them in protest\u2014that flooded Congress. Petitions arrived from small towns and major cities, stretching from Maine to Ohio. Most were a page or two, but a few, when unfurled, reached 10 feet in length and contained the signatures of hundreds of men and women. \nWith one or two exceptions, the petitions voiced a powerful opposition to the forced emigration of native peoples. They addressed the particulars of the matter\u2014broken treaties and the imperious claims of state governments\u2014but they also spoke to a deep-seated belief about the young republic that is relevant to today\u2019s debate about undocumented immigrants. The United States, they insisted, stood for \u201cjustice and the rights of mankind.\u201d It did not disregard \u201cthe cries of the oppressed and the sufferings of the helpless.\u201d \nRecalling their own ancestors who had fled from oppressive governments in Europe, petitioners called for justice to be done to the native peoples who long ago had welcomed European immigrants. They condemned state laws that persecuted Native Americans and questioned the ability of the government to remove so many people safely. More generally, they called on Congress to prevent \u201cour national character from being disgraced, by the perpetration of an atrocious outrage.\u201d \nThe Indian Removal Act passed the House of Representatives in May 1830 by a mere five votes out of 199 cast. The public debate over the policy led anti-slavery activists such as William Lloyd Garrison to recognize the folly and immorality of mass deportation and encouraged them to turn against contemporaneous efforts to deport free and enslaved African-Americans to Africa. The deportation of Indians, recognized one group of residents from Lexington, New York, would \u201cstamp our national character with indelible infamy.\u201d They were right. Politicians and their supporters should take note. We shouldn\u2019t make the same mistake twice. \nWhat Works\n\n                    By \n                            T.R.

In March, he said through a spokesman that he has only sent two email messages in his life, back when he was in the White House.\nClinton was in mid-campaign form, enjoying the spotlight during his first foray onto the campaign trail. \n\"The American people in the last six weeks have learned a lot about Hillary \u2014 what she\u2019s for, why she\u2019s running, and what kind of president she\u2019d be,\" he said. \"If they watched Saturday Night Live, they know she\u2019s a pretty good bartender, too.\"\n\n\n\n            By \nAnna Palmer\n\nReferring to the recent Democratic debate, he said, \"I was proud to be a Democrat because I watched five hours of the Republicans debate. [On our side] every disagreement they had was over an issue. that\u2019s politics at its best. Nobody insulted anyone else. no one was out there to get people to stop thinking.\"\nAbout 15 minutes into his speech, some of the crowd cheered when he said he was almost finished. While Clinton was on stage, a plane flying a banner \u201cRevolution Starts Now: FEEL THE BERN,\u201d flew over the modest stage set up in front of the Hy-Vee Hall, a sign of the challenge she still faces in the face of the best stretch of her campaign.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Bill Clinton rallies Iowa crowd with talk of emails", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/clinton-des-moines-iowa-215132", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Katy O'Donnell", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Katy Perry", "Rachael Bade", "Helena Bottemiller Evich", "Henry C.

Goldman\n\n\n                                            By \nTodd S. Purdum\n\nPaul Ryan has been abundantly clear: As speaker of the House, he won\u2019t spend all of his time jetting across the country to keep the National Republican Congressional Committee flush.\nBut far from being concerned, top GOP moneymen believe the Wisconsin Republican will be a major boon financially for the party. The national network he\u2019s amassed as a vice presidential candidate and from coordinating the national party's spending in presidential elections give him advantages that even the highly prolific John Boehner didn\u2019t enjoy.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cHe has really strong numbers among the conservative community across the board, and across the country. He has deep developed strong relationships with some of our best supporters around the country,\u201d said National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.). \"Frankly, I don\u2019t know more than maybe one or two other members that have that level of relationships.\u201d\n\"He\u2019s kind of a fresh new product on the market, if you will, and he will be enormously helpful and successful,\" Walden added.\n\n\n\n            By \nAdam Sneed\n\nThere's no question Ryan has big shoes to fill. Boehner has raised $300 million for the NRCC since 2009. There was grumbling and some fear in the House Republican Conference when Ryan said he wanted to be with his family on the weekends, which Boehner often spent on the road raising cash. The speakership is \"not a 9-to-5 job,\" Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kansas), a Ryan critic, said this week.\nBut party officials are already plotting creative ways to compensate for Ryan's demand for family time. Boehner held a lot of fundraisers on the golf course. Ryan isn\u2019t a golfer. So instead of a five-hour event playing golf, allies say, Ryan can hold two events in the same time and can bring in five times as much money by attracting many more donors. Associates also say he is unusually efficient with his time, even tending to donors on drives between events.\nAs Ryan nears the speakership, his political operation is beginning to take shape.\nAs Ways and Means chairman, Ryan had dual agreements with the NRCC and Republican National Committee, whereby he gave them each a day or two during Congressional recesses where they could send him around the country for events. Ryan has told the RNC that he will no longer do regular events for them, and instead will focus solely on the NRCC. \nDuring a private meeting in which he announced his candidacy, Ryan also told the House Republican Conference that he would focus solely on raising money for the NRCC . \nRyan was prolific for the RNC during the 2012 cycle. Even before he became the vice presidential nominee, he raised $23 million for the party.\n\n\n\n            By \nKevin Robillard\n\nWhile Ryan\u2019s departure will certainly be a hit for the RNC, Sean Spicer, a spokesman for the committee, said Ryan\u2019s fundraising heft will help the broader GOP \u201cfamily\u201d of committees.\n\u201cPaul Ryan has been an unbelievable fundraiser and supporter of the RNC and the party writ large,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cIf he becomes speaker, it would be a huge help to have him at the NRCC.\u201d\nTop NRCC officials agree. Despite his desire to go home on weekends, many top officials think Ryan can be as prodigious as Boehner. He\u2019s already a top surrogate for the NRCC. He has contributed $2.7 million to the party committee since 2011 \u2013 not counting events he has held for candidates and colleagues, according to a source familiar with the committee\u2019s fundraising.\n\"He is in high demand,\" said Walden, \"because he can articulate the issues, he gives a great vision discussion about the future of the party and where we can go. And he\u2019s very likable. And so, we\u2019ve helped him manage that demand ... at the NRCC to maximize his time because it\u2019s so valuable.\u201d\nRyan still has a lot of work to do. As his staff prepares for the enormity of the speakership, they also have to build a political operation. Boehner had his own political staff, dubbed \"Team Boehner,\" that had office space at the NRCC and worked closely with the committee in scheduling events and Boehner\u2019s travel. Ryan can go that route, or he could hand over his political operation to the committee itself. \nBoehner's operation was massive. He traveled for an entire month every summer, in addition to holding events throughout the year. \n\nCongress\n\n            By \nJohn Bresnahan\n             and \nJake Sherman\n\nBoehner and Ryan also have different styles and demeanors. Boehner is a back-slapping political animal, while Ryan is an affable policy wonk.\n\"Donors tend to be as attracted to the personality as much as they are to the office,\u201d said Dan Senor, a close Ryan confidant who works with billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Singer in New York. \u201cThe donor community likes spending time with Paul because he's a very smart guy and he's very thoughtful and he's not just buried in process but he can also talk about policy and a governing agenda.\u201d\nSenor added that while he understands the concerns about Ryan's family time cutting into fundraising time, \"when he is out fundraising he is very efficient and he accomplishes a lot.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "His cash network will more than compensate for weekends at home, allies say.", "title": "GOP moneymen: Ryan a fundraising juggernaut", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/paul-ryan-fundraising-house-speaker-215116", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Katy O'Donnell", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Sean Spicer", "Rachael Bade", "Henry C.

Close to an hour after the other candidates and most of the attendees had cleared out of the Hy-Vee Center in downtown Des Moines, Bill and Hillary Clinton were still schmoozing with a small group of lingering fans.\nStory Continued Below\nAnd while Hillary Clinton ignored reporters and focused on the Iowans there to meet her, Bill Clinton proved once again there\u2019s no subject he doesn\u2019t want to expound on\u2014 and that he can\u2019t resist chatting with reporters.\nAfter posing for a string of selfies, he engaged reporters who asked him how the iPhone has changed his interactions with voters. While people used to approach politicians with a question, he said, now they simply hold out their phones for a picture.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dominant force that\u2019s allowed to interrupt conversations,\u201d he said, \u201cI think, on balance, it\u2019s been a great thing for people.\u201d\nBut he admitted that if iPhones had been around when he was governor of Arkansas, \u201cI might never have lived to run for President. I spent my time doing uber retail politics.\u201d\nThe former president, making his first official appearance on the campaign trail for his wife over the weekend, also waxed philosophical about the art of the selfie. \u201cIt has democratized picture-taking and record-keeping \u2014 and that\u2019s good,\u201d he said.\nClinton said he even requests his own selfies sometimes. \n\u201cI\u2019ve been with people who are taking selfies with me, and I thought they were interesting looking people, total strangers, but I thought it was an interesting setting,\u201d he said of when he has requested his own copy.

{"body": "DES MOINES, Iowa U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders contrasted his record with that of Hillary Clinton on key issues, including his early support for same-sex marriages and consistent opposition to the Iraq war, during a Democratic fundraising dinner in Iowa on Saturday.\nThe annual dinner in the early-voting state has become a bellwether of Democratic support, and it was the first time that Sanders, Clinton and former Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley have appeared on the same stage since the first Democratic debate on Oct. 13.\nWhile the debate was a largely genial affair in which the candidates complimented one another and disagreed on policy specifics, Sanders used the Jefferson-Jackson dinner, attended by more than 6,000 Democrats, to highlight differences with front-runner Clinton, without mentioning her by name.\nThe U.S. senator from Vermont, who calls himself a democratic socialist, has gained on Clinton in recent polls.\nSanders spoke first and reminded the crowd of his early support for same-sex marriage, his vote against the U.S. war in Iraq, his criticism of trade pacts and called opposing the Keystone XL pipeline to bring Canadian oil to the Gulf of Mexico a \u201cno brainer.\u201d\nEach point was a nod to previous positions taken by Clinton or her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who appeared for the first time on the campaign trail in Iowa on Saturday.\nBill Clinton signed a 1996 law, which has since been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, that prevented same-sex couples from receiving federal spousal benefits. \nHillary Clinton, as a U.S. senator from New York, voted to invade Iraq, but says based on what she knows now that was a mistake.\nClinton recently opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact negotiated by the Obama administration and the Keystone pipeline, which is under review by the U.S. State Department. Both processes began when Clinton held the top post at the diplomatic agency.\nA victory in Iowa, which holds the first party-nominating contest on Feb. 1, can set the tone of a presidential campaign. President Barack Obama delivered a breakout performance at the 2007 Jefferson-Jackson dinner as a relatively unknown U.S. senator from Illinois. He went on to win the state.\n\u201cAbout eight years ago all of the political experts talked about how another Democratic candidate for president just couldn\u2019t win, he was unelectable,\u201d Sanders said on Saturday. \u201cRemember that guy? What was his name? Oh, it\u2019s President Obama.\u201d\n\u201cWell Iowa, I think we are going to prove the pundits wrong again,\u201d Sanders added, drawing some of his strongest applause of the night.\n\n (Reporting By Amanda Becker; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)", "byline": "", "description": "DES MOINES, Iowa (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders contrasted his record with that of Hillary Clinton on key issues, including his early support for same-sex marriages and consistent opposition to the Iraq war, during a Democratic fundraising dinner in Iowa on Saturday.", "title": "Sanders contrasts his record with Clinton's at Iowa dinner", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/3r6KXK0Rmzg/story01.htm", "topics": ["trade", "lgbt issues"], "people": ["Martin O'Malley", "Bill Clinton", "Hillary Clinton", "Barack Obama", "Bernie Sanders", "Amanda Becker"], "orgs": ["U.S. Supreme Court", "Keystone XL", "U.S. State Department", "DES MOINES"], "election_confidence": 0.680135787050688, "authors": [{"author_id": 33388, "fullname": "amanda becker", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-10-25 06:41:21", "org": "reuters", "article_id": "049152503cdddf8d858d4e3ce3bb4dde", "date_access": "2015-10-25 06:08:20.302310"},

{"body": "DES MOINES, Iowa U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders contrasted his record with that of Hillary Clinton on key issues, including his early support for same-sex marriages and consistent opposition to the Iraq war, during a Democratic fundraising dinner in Iowa on Saturday.\nThe annual dinner in the early-voting state has become a bellwether of Democratic support, and it was the first time that Sanders, Clinton and former Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley have appeared on the same stage since the first Democratic debate on Oct. 13.\nWhile the debate was a largely genial affair in which the candidates complimented one another and disagreed on policy specifics, Sanders used the Jefferson-Jackson dinner, attended by more than 6,000 Democrats, to highlight differences with front-runner Clinton, without mentioning her by name.\nThe U.S. senator from Vermont, who calls himself a democratic socialist, has gained on Clinton in recent polls.\nSanders spoke first and reminded the crowd of his early support for same-sex marriage, his vote against the U.S. war in Iraq, his criticism of trade pacts and called opposing the Keystone XL pipeline to bring Canadian oil to the Gulf of Mexico a \u201cno brainer.\u201d\nEach point was a nod to previous positions taken by Clinton or her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who appeared for the first time on the campaign trail in Iowa on Saturday.\nBill Clinton signed a 1996 law, which has since been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, that prevented same-sex couples from receiving federal spousal benefits. \nHillary Clinton, as a U.S. senator from New York, voted to invade Iraq, but says based on what she knows now that was a mistake.\nClinton recently opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact negotiated by the Obama administration and the Keystone pipeline, which is under review by the U.S. State Department. Both processes began when Clinton held the top post at the diplomatic agency.\nA victory in Iowa, which holds the first party-nominating contest on Feb. 1, can set the tone of a presidential campaign. President Barack Obama delivered a breakout performance at the 2007 Jefferson-Jackson dinner as a relatively unknown U.S. senator from Illinois. He went on to win the state.\n\u201cAbout eight years ago all of the political experts talked about how another Democratic candidate for president just couldn\u2019t win, he was unelectable,\u201d Sanders said on Saturday. \u201cRemember that guy? What was his name? Oh, it\u2019s President Obama.\u201d\n\u201cWell Iowa, I think we are going to prove the pundits wrong again,\u201d Sanders added, drawing some of his strongest applause of the night.\n\n (Reporting By Amanda Becker; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)", "byline": "", "description": "DES MOINES, Iowa (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders contrasted his record with that of Hillary Clinton on key issues, including his early support for same-sex marriages and consistent opposition to the Iraq war, during a Democratic fundraising dinner in Iowa on Saturday.", "title": "Sanders contrasts his record with Clinton's at Iowa dinner", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/u07Zezqz1_8/story01.htm", "topics": ["trade", "lgbt issues"], "people": ["Martin O'Malley", "Bill Clinton", "Hillary Clinton", "Barack Obama", "Bernie Sanders", "Amanda Becker"], "orgs": ["U.S. Supreme Court", "Keystone XL", "U.S. State Department", "DES MOINES"], "election_confidence": 0.680135787050688, "authors": [{"author_id": 33388, "fullname": "amanda becker", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-10-25 06:41:21", "org": "reuters", "article_id": "15d828edfc31391dff6c4e8555de6a90", "date_access": "2015-10-25 06:10:51.165569"},

{"body": "NEW ORLEANS Louisiana voters headed to the polls on Saturday to choose a successor to Governor Bobby Jindal, but experts and surveys suggest the race may go to a runoff after a faltering campaign by early favorite Republican U.S. Senator David Vitter.\nThe contest, dubbed a \"jungle primary\" with candidates from all parties on the same ballot, has generated little interest from the electorate, making it unlikely the primary vote will result in an outright victor, analysts said. \nIf no candidate garners at least 50 percent of the vote on Saturday, the top two finishers will meet in a runoff on Nov. 21.\nVitter has mounted a front-runner's campaign, even as he dropped in the polls. The two-term U.S. senator, dogged by a 2007 prostitution scandal, participated in only two of eight gubernatorial debates and shunned the media.\nSome polls in October showed Democrat John Bel Edwards, the minority leader in the state House, beating Vitter in a head-to-head match-up.\nEven so, University of New Orleans political science professor Ed Chervenak said the Democrat would face an uphill battle to win the governorship in the deeply Republican state.\nLight early-voting numbers have led most pollsters to forecast low overall turnout, which tends to favor Republicans in Louisiana. Chervenak said he had not noticed a strong effort by the Democrats to get out the vote in Orleans Parish, one of a few strongly Democratic areas of the state.\nEdwards' campaign focused on his military\u00a0service and time as a cadet at West Point. In speeches and campaign commercials, he vowed: \"I will never embarrass you.\"\nVitter admitted in 2007 to \"a very serious sin\" after disclosures that his phone number had appeared on the list of clients of so-called \"D.C. Madam\" Deborah Jeane Palfrey's escort agency.\n\"The straight-arrow image (Edwards) has been able to project has been very effective,\" said G. Pearson Cross, a political science professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.\nTwo other Republicans have trailed in the polls. \nScott Angelle serves in an elected post on the state's utility regulatory board. He formally switched parties from Democrat to Republican in 2010.\nKnown for his folksy charm, Lieutenant Governor Jay Dardenne has won statewide races three times, including two terms in his current post and a stint as secretary of state.\nJindal's approval rating plunged during the waning years of his second term, a factor that has likely depressed the enthusiasm for Republican candidates, Chervenak said. \nThe outgoing governor is seeking the 2016 Republican nomination for the White House, but poll numbers for his candidacy have stagnated in the low single digits.\n\n (Writing by Colleen Jenkins; Editing by Richard Balmforth and Cynthia Osterman)", "byline": "", "description": "NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Louisiana voters headed to the polls on Saturday to choose a successor to Governor Bobby Jindal, but experts and surveys suggest the race may go to a runoff after a faltering campaign by early favorite Republican U.S. Senator David Vitter.", "title": "Runoff expected as Louisiana votes for governor", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/MostRead/~3/nWzda_yVCYQ/story01.htm", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "immigration"], "people": ["Bobby Jindal", "David Vitter", "Jay Dardenne", "Scott Angelle", "Cynthia Osterman"], "orgs": [], "election_confidence": 0.6888089654218901, "authors": [{"author_id": 40581, "fullname": "andy grimm", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-10-24 20:14:37", "org": "reuters", "article_id": "2c691e1d0b38db2142e724d17e7fdfa4", "date_access": "2015-10-25 05:05:26.570906"},
{"body": "NEW YORK U.S. presidential candidate Ben Carson may be the farthest Republican voters can get from the party's establishment: A retired neurosurgeon with a penchant for inflammatory comments who has never held, much less run, for elected office.\nWhile many of his rivals are concentrating on hiring staff and renting offices in key states like New Hampshire and Iowa, Carson is pursuing a more unorthodox campaign, sometimes less visible to the naked eye, that has fueled his rise to the top of the polls. He is just behind Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican 2016 presidential nomination.\nHelping Carson position himself as the answer to Americans' frustration with Washington gridlock is Barry Bennett, 52, a Washington insider, who is running a decidedly non-traditional campaign to build his client's brand.\nUnder Bennett's guidance, the campaign enables supporters to connect with Carson with unusual intimacy: they can get emailed or texted questions personally answered; or huddle on his Facebook page every day; and donors can even have their children's names posted on the campaign's bus. \nCarson\u2019s campaign relies heavily on the Internet to get his message across, more so than the campaigns of his 13 rivals. The campaign\u2019s Facebook page has more than 4 million followers, while Carson\u2019s Instagram account has 127,000. \nOne popular Facebook feature shows fans holding handwritten explanations of their support for Carson. Bennett says urging supporters to take more of those photos was his idea to drive voter engagement.   \nStarting this month, the campaign began using a computer program that lets one staffer answer up to 9,000 questions per day. Supporters will be able to text or email Carson a question and get an individual response. The program uses an algorithm that groups together questions that may look unique but are actually similar enough to elicit a single answer. Bennett says using the program was also his idea.\nIn an interview at Carson's campaign headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia, Bennett saw no contradiction in a long-time Washington political operative helping a candidate whose main selling point is that he has never worked in Washington. \n\"We both believe Washington needs to be turned upside down,\" he said.\nHe also said he has no problems with some of Carson's more controversial statements. Carson has faced sharp criticism for comments suggesting the Holocaust could have been diminished if Jews had been armed, and that victims of a recent mass shooting in Oregon should have fought harder against the gunman.\n\"He doesn't speak in a way that Washington politicians are trained to speak, so to some people that sounds crazy but to me and most of America that sounds refreshing,\" Bennett said.\nIndeed polls show that Carson has not been hurt at all by the comments. In fact, he may even have grown stronger.\n\nAN INSIDER'S STORY\nBennett, who has worked for 30 years as a political operative for hire, has also helped to mastermind a data-collection operation that has enabled Carson to tap into an army of small donors and out-raise his rivals.\nAs of Friday, Carson had raised more than $37 million, from 725,000 donors, with the average donation size at $51, according to a tally provided by Bennett. His nearest Republican fund-raising rivals, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, had each raised about $25 million by the end of September, according to Federal Election Commission filings. \nBennett's career began when, as a student, he started doing data entry for President Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign. After  working in the Ohio state legislature, Bennett moved to Washington, where he worked for the Republican National Committee and Ohio Senator Rob Portman and founded a media analysis firm. In short, he became a Washington insider. \n\"Who with a 202 (Washington) area code on their cell phone would even think of working for Carson?\" said New Hampshire Republican strategist Dave Carney. \nCarney said most veteran operatives would have balked at what many see as Carson's moonshot bid for the presidency. He gave Bennett credit for seeing something in Carson when others didn't.\n\"He saw an opportunity where most folks would turn their nose up at it.\"\nCarson has used the opportunity to play with some out-of-the box ideas, like appealing to supporters for donations in exchange for having their children's names displayed on a campaign bus. The bus is now covered with hundreds of little stick figures whose shapes are filled in with names written in tiny script. \n\"He's got outsized talents with a moderate-sized ego,\" said Republican strategist Matt Schlapp, who knows Bennett. \"Usually it's the other way around.\"\n\nROMNEY FILM\nUntil now, Bennett was probably best known for having produced \"When Mitt Romney Came to Town\" during the 2012 Republican primaries, when he was working as an independent consultant. It was a 28-minute collection of interviews with people who lost their jobs after Romney's private equity firm Bain Capital took over their companies.\nThe film dampened voters' enthusiasm for Romney and forced his campaign to go into damage control mode, said a former Romney staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \n\"I wished he was on our side,\" he said of Bennett. \nIn 2016, Bennett has been on the other side of political attacks, defending Carson's controversial statements. \nOn Carson's comments encouraging people to fight back against gunmen, Bennett invoked the victims of the al Qaeda-hijacked airplane Flight 93, which crashed into a Pennsylvania field on Sept. 11, 2001. Investigators believe the passengers thwarted a planned attack when they stormed the cockpit and attempted, unsuccessfully, to regain control of the aircraft.\n\"That's what you hope you'd do in that situation,\" Bennett said. \n\n (Reporting By Emily Flitter; Additional reporting by Grant Smith, editing by Paul Thomasch and Ross Colvin)", "byline": "", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Ben Carson may be the farthest Republican voters can get from the party's establishment: A retired neurosurgeon with a penchant for inflammatory comments who has never held, much less run, for elected office.", "title": "Behind Ben Carson's rebellious public image, a DC insider is hard at work", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/vmiP9TFHLUA/story01.htm", "topics": ["personality", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Rob Portman", "Mitt Romney", "Emily Flitter", "Jeb Bush", "Matt Schlapp", "Paul Thomasch", "Ronald Reagan", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Grant Smith", "Barry Bennett", "Dave Carney", "Ross Colvin", "Ben Carson"], "orgs": ["Federal Election Commission", "al Qaeda", "Bain Capital", "Republican National Committee"], "election_confidence": 0.9988341773212437, "authors": [{"author_id": 34261, "fullname": "emily flitter", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-10-25 18:07:20", "org": "reuters", "article_id": "2ee7c4adb6077ed2ca96f110d2913faa", "date_access": "2015-10-25 17:36:50.579471"},

{"body": "NEW YORK U.S. presidential candidate Ben Carson may be the farthest Republican voters can get from the party's establishment: A retired neurosurgeon with a penchant for inflammatory comments who has never held, much less run, for elected office.\nWhile many of his rivals are concentrating on hiring staff and renting offices in key states like New Hampshire and Iowa, Carson is pursuing a more unorthodox campaign, sometimes less visible to the naked eye, that has fueled his rise to the top of the polls. He is just behind Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican 2016 presidential nomination.\nHelping Carson position himself as the answer to Americans' frustration with Washington gridlock is Barry Bennett, 52, a Washington insider, who is running a decidedly non-traditional campaign to build his client's brand.\nUnder Bennett's guidance, the campaign enables supporters to connect with Carson with unusual intimacy: they can get emailed or texted questions personally answered; or huddle on his Facebook page every day; and donors can even have their children's names posted on the campaign's bus. \nCarson\u2019s campaign relies heavily on the Internet to get his message across, more so than the campaigns of his 13 rivals. The campaign\u2019s Facebook page has more than 4 million followers, while Carson\u2019s Instagram account has 127,000. \nOne popular Facebook feature shows fans holding handwritten explanations of their support for Carson. Bennett says urging supporters to take more of those photos was his idea to drive voter engagement.   \nStarting this month, the campaign began using a computer program that lets one staffer answer up to 9,000 questions per day. Supporters will be able to text or email Carson a question and get an individual response. The program uses an algorithm that groups together questions that may look unique but are actually similar enough to elicit a single answer. Bennett says using the program was also his idea.\nIn an interview at Carson's campaign headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia, Bennett saw no contradiction in a long-time Washington political operative helping a candidate whose main selling point is that he has never worked in Washington. \n\"We both believe Washington needs to be turned upside down,\" he said.\nHe also said he has no problems with some of Carson's more controversial statements. Carson has faced sharp criticism for comments suggesting the Holocaust could have been diminished if Jews had been armed, and that victims of a recent mass shooting in Oregon should have fought harder against the gunman.\n\"He doesn't speak in a way that Washington politicians are trained to speak, so to some people that sounds crazy but to me and most of America that sounds refreshing,\" Bennett said.\nIndeed polls show that Carson has not been hurt at all by the comments. In fact, he may even have grown stronger.\n\nAN INSIDER'S STORY\nBennett, who has worked for 30 years as a political operative for hire, has also helped to mastermind a data-collection operation that has enabled Carson to tap into an army of small donors and out-raise his rivals.\nAs of Friday, Carson had raised more than $37 million, from 725,000 donors, with the average donation size at $51, according to a tally provided by Bennett. His nearest Republican fund-raising rivals, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, had each raised about $25 million by the end of September, according to Federal Election Commission filings. \nBennett's career began when, as a student, he started doing data entry for President Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign. After  working in the Ohio state legislature, Bennett moved to Washington, where he worked for the Republican National Committee and Ohio Senator Rob Portman and founded a media analysis firm. In short, he became a Washington insider. \n\"Who with a 202 (Washington) area code on their cell phone would even think of working for Carson?\" said New Hampshire Republican strategist Dave Carney. \nCarney said most veteran operatives would have balked at what many see as Carson's moonshot bid for the presidency. He gave Bennett credit for seeing something in Carson when others didn't.\n\"He saw an opportunity where most folks would turn their nose up at it.\"\nCarson has used the opportunity to play with some out-of-the box ideas, like appealing to supporters for donations in exchange for having their children's names displayed on a campaign bus. The bus is now covered with hundreds of little stick figures whose shapes are filled in with names written in tiny script. \n\"He's got outsized talents with a moderate-sized ego,\" said Republican strategist Matt Schlapp, who knows Bennett. \"Usually it's the other way around.\"\n\nROMNEY FILM\nUntil now, Bennett was probably best known for having produced \"When Mitt Romney Came to Town\" during the 2012 Republican primaries, when he was working as an independent consultant. It was a 28-minute collection of interviews with people who lost their jobs after Romney's private equity firm Bain Capital took over their companies.\nThe film dampened voters' enthusiasm for Romney and forced his campaign to go into damage control mode, said a former Romney staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \n\"I wished he was on our side,\" he said of Bennett. \nIn 2016, Bennett has been on the other side of political attacks, defending Carson's controversial statements. \nOn Carson's comments encouraging people to fight back against gunmen, Bennett invoked the victims of the al Qaeda-hijacked airplane Flight 93, which crashed into a Pennsylvania field on Sept. 11, 2001. Investigators believe the passengers thwarted a planned attack when they stormed the cockpit and attempted, unsuccessfully, to regain control of the aircraft.\n\"That's what you hope you'd do in that situation,\" Bennett said. \n\n (Reporting By Emily Flitter; Additional reporting by Grant Smith, editing by Paul Thomasch and Ross Colvin)", "byline": "", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Ben Carson may be the farthest Republican voters can get from the party's establishment: A retired neurosurgeon with a penchant for inflammatory comments who has never held, much less run, for elected office.", "title": "Behind Ben Carson's rebellious public image, a DC insider is hard at work", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/GTT2BUpCHds/story01.htm", "topics": ["personality", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Rob Portman", "Mitt Romney", "Emily Flitter", "Jeb Bush", "Matt Schlapp", "Paul Thomasch", "Ronald Reagan", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Grant Smith", "Barry Bennett", "Dave Carney", "Ross Colvin", "Ben Carson"], "orgs": ["Federal Election Commission", "al Qaeda", "Bain Capital", "Republican National Committee"], "election_confidence": 0.9988341773212437, "authors": [{"author_id": 34261, "fullname": "emily flitter", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-10-25 18:07:20", "org": "reuters", "article_id": "f2cac6a3688de4c8d24d73302325fad7", "date_access": "2015-10-25 19:05:11.969666"},
