Elijah Cummings of Maryland said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\nIn the run-up to Thursday\u2019s 11-hour hearing with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Democrats were reported considering pulling out of the hearings that they\u2019ve dismissed as a Republican witch hunt and a waste of taxpayer money.\nBut Cummings said Sunday the hearing showed that he and his Democratic colleagues still have an important role to play.\n\u201cYou really did need to have Democrats in the room \u2026 to make sure the complete picture was painted,\u201d he said.\nDemocrats will also keep up their efforts to make all witness testimony available to the public, Cummings said. \n\n2016\n\n            By \nGlenn Thrush\n             and \nGabriel Debenedetti\n\nWhile Clinton\u2019s appearance was public and televised, dozens of witnesses have testified privately. And Cummings said transcripts of those hearings will reveal the GOP\u2019s true intentions of hurting Clinton\u2019s standing in her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.\nAppearing separately, Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) said private hearings are preferable for all parties and will continue.\n\u201cIn the private interviews, there is never any of what you saw Thursday,\u201d Gowdy said. Those hearings typically only go as long as one hour of questioning from both sides, \u201cwhich is why you\u2019re going to see the next two dozen interviews done privately.\u201d\nGowdy said a public hearing was Clinton\u2019s choice, and that led to the extensive questioning and partisan bickering. \u201cThe private ones always produce better results,\u201d he said.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Cummings: Dems will stay on Benghazi committee", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/cummings-benghazi-clinton-215140", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Katy O'Donnell", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Rachael Bade", "Henry C.
