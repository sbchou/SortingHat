{"body": "During the summer of often-breathless speculation about whether Vice President Joe Biden would run for president, the voice that was missing was the normally loquacious Biden's. On Sunday, he finally offered his own view, saying that in times when he leaned toward entering the race, he was pulled back by fresh grief over the recent death of his son.\nIn an interview with \"60 Minutes,\" his first since he announced last week that he'd decided not to campaign, the vice president openly acknowledged his struggle to make a decision while he and his family mourned the death of his eldest son, Beau, in May.\nAt one point in late summer when he felt inclined to run, he told CBS\u2019 Norah O\u2019Donnell, Beau's only daughter began weeping in his arms during a family dinner.\n\u201c \u2018Pop, I see Daddy all the time,\u2019 \u201d he recalled his granddaughter saying to him. \u201c \u2018You\u2019re not going to leave me, are you, Pop?\u2019\n\u201cWhen that happens,\u201d Biden said, \u201cyou go, \u2018I don\u2019t know, man.\u2019 \u201d\nAt other times, Biden said the frenzied media speculation almost led him to prematurely announce he would not run. He\u2019d read stories citing unnamed sources with often-contradictory claims about his decision.\n\u201cThat used to drive me crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d get up some mornings and say, \u2018Let\u2019s just end this thing.\u2019 \u201d\nBut his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, often portrayed as one of the figures close to him who was least supportive of a run, would nonetheless challenge him in such moments. She would ask him such questions as: \u201cWhat about the Supreme Court?\u201d\n\u201cI felt like everything we worked so hard for in the administration, you know, could just all change,\u201d she said in the interview.\nThe vice president also disputed the assertion made in some media reports that his son made a final deathbed plea for him to join the race.\nHillary Rodham Clinton warned Saturday that returning the White House to a Republican would jeopardize the nation's economic recovery under President Obama, as she tried to build on her campaign's recent momentum while her Democratic rivals stepped up their criticisms.\n\u201cWe need to defend the progress...\nHillary Rodham Clinton warned Saturday that returning the White House to a Republican would jeopardize the nation's economic recovery under President Obama, as she tried to build on her campaign's recent momentum while her Democratic rivals stepped up their criticisms.\n\u201cWe need to defend the progress...\n\u201cThere was not what was sort of made out as some kind of this Hollywood-esque thing, that at the last minute, Beau grabbed my hand and said, \u2018Dad, you\u2019ve got to run.\u2019 \u2026 It wasn\u2019t anything like that,\u201d he said.\nStill, both Beau and Biden\u2019s younger son, Hunter, were his best political advisors, Biden said, and Beau \u201call along thought that I should run and could win,\u201d the vice president added.\u00a0\nUltimately, Biden repeated that his final decision against running was simply a matter of timing.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be very blunt. If I thought we could\u2019ve put together the campaign that our supporters deserve and our contributors deserved, I would have gone ahead and done it,\u201d he said.\nStill, Biden said he sees a future for himself in the party even if it\u2019s not as a candidate for president. He acknowledged that his announcement from the Rose Garden on Wednesday did sound like a political speech.\n\u201cThere\u2019s some truth to that,\u201d he said. \u201cI was making a case that I do want to influence the Democratic Party.\u201d\nBut he denied sending a message to Clinton in recent days. Repeatedly over the past week, he has criticized Democrats who view the GOP as \u201cenemies,\u201d as Clinton recently said she did. Biden said he was not directing his complaints of a lack of bipartisanship at her but instead at Washington as a whole.\nHe said that he didn\u2019t want Democrats walking away from what he and President Obama have accomplished, and that although Clinton may not be following his advice to run on the administration\u2019s record, \u201cit doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t be a great president,\u201d Biden said.\n\u201cGo back and find anybody who says for the four years we worked together Hillary and I weren\u2019t friends,\u201d he said of the idea that he\u2019d come to resent her.\nBiden said he believes he can still accomplish a lot even as he said he would not run for office again. He also expressed hope that the White House could work with Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), the most likely candidate to be the new House speaker, to avoid a government shutdown and agree on a new budget.\n\u201cI hope I leave office as a respected figure who can convene people and bring people together,\u201d he said.\nFollow \n@mikememoli\n for more news out of Washington.", "byline": "", "description": "<p>During the summer of often-breathless speculation about whether Vice President Joe Biden would run for president, the voice that was missing was the normally loquacious Biden's.
