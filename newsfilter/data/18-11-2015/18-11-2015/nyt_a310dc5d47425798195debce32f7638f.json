{"body": "In her pursuit of the Democratic nomination for president, Hillary Rodham Clinton has emphasized her ties to President Obama. She regularly tells the story of how he wooed her into serving as his secretary of state and recites, typically to a roar of applause, the line: \u201cPresident Obama doesn\u2019t get the credit he deserves.\u201d\n\nBut the terrorist attacks in Paris on Friday, and a presidential election that has suddenly taken a turn toward foreign policy, have complicated Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strategy of aligning herself closely with Mr. Obama, who is widely popular among Democratic primary voters and whose support she will need should she advance to the general election.\n\nOn Saturday in the second Democratic debate, Mrs. Clinton declined to directly respond to a question about whether she thought Mr. Obama had underestimated the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, which French officials have said was responsible for the attacks.\n\nBut she did \u2014 indirectly and deftly \u2014 contradict Mr. Obama\u2019s comments, made in a television interview recorded a day before the attacks, that the Islamic State had been \u201ccontained\u201d in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\u201cWe have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cIt cannot be contained; it must be defeated.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign has said for months that it sees no reason to break with Mr. Obama. Mrs. Clinton has instead positioned her agenda around plans to \u201cbuild on the progress\u201d of the Obama administration. In places like South Carolina where African-American voters, in particular, overwhelmingly support the president, Mrs. Clinton devotes much of her stump speech to effusively praising Mr. Obama\u2019s success in reviving the economy after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nIn a New York Times/CBS News survey released last Thursday, 79 percent of Democrats said they were satisfied or very satisfied with Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency and 60 percent said they would like to see the next president continue his policies.\n\nBut the renewed emphasis on terrorism in the past few days has laid bare Mrs. Clinton\u2019s long-held differences with Mr. Obama on foreign policy and when the United States should intervene in conflicts abroad.\n\nFor four years as secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton played a prominent role in nearly every foreign policy issue of Mr. Obama\u2019s first term, often pushing the White House to embrace a more aggressive approach. She urged the administration to join a NATO-led coalition to oust Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya, proposed that more forces be left in Iraq and pushed to funnel arms to moderate Syrian rebels.\n\n\u201cI assume she and her advisers are trying to calibrate Obama\u2019s approval rating right now,\u201d said Paul R. Pillar, a former C.I.A. analyst who teaches at Georgetown University. But he added, \u201cI think the conventional wisdom, that Hillary Clinton is a more hawkish person and would be a more hawkish president, with everything that adjective implies, is correct.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton has gone further than Mr. Obama on Syria by proposing that a coalition put in place a no-fly zone to provide safe areas for Syrians, an approach several Republican presidential candidates have also embraced. And she frequently talks about how she pushed Mr. Obama to arm some Syrian rebels.\n\n\u201cI did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early on,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said Saturday. \u201cBecause I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum.\u201d\n\nThe images from France have not prompted Mr. Obama to abandon his deep reluctance to send additional American troops to Iraq and Syria.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe U.S. troops are the answer to the problem,\u201d Benjamin J. Rhodes, Mr. Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser, said Sunday. \u201cThe further introduction of U.S. troops to fully re-engage in ground combat in the Middle East is not the way to deal with this challenge.\u201d\n\n(In an interview with ABC News on Sunday, Mr. Rhodes sought to clarify Mr. Obama\u2019s comment that the Islamic State had been contained. Mr. Rhodes said, \u201cThe fact is, we have been able to stop that geographic advance and take back significant amounts of territory in both northern Iraq and northern Syria.\u201d)\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s reaction to the attacks in France reminded foreign policy experts of the gulf between the president and Mrs. Clinton, which first emerged in their 2008 primary contest as Mr. Obama contrasted his antiwar message with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2002 vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq.\n\n\u201cBoth when she was secretary of state and since, she has had a sense of focusing not just on the cost of action, but the cost of inaction,\u201d said Dennis B. Ross, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama who is now a distinguished fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cPresident Obama has been much more inclined to the cost of action versus the cost of inaction.\u201d\n\nBut for Mrs. Clinton, embracing an inclination toward intervention is potentially an even more precarious proposition in a Democratic primary than breaking with Mr. Obama.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s Iraq war vote, which she has repeatedly said was a mistake, was a major factor in her defeat in the 2008 primary, and it remains a vulnerability.\n\nOn Saturday, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democratic rival, assailed her for supporting the war. \u201cI don\u2019t think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now,\u201d he said.\n\nAppearing acutely aware of how liberal primary voters, particularly in Iowa, view her hawkish reputation, Mrs. Clinton said on Saturday that \u201cthis cannot be an American fight\u201d and that the United States should not bear \u201cthe bulk of the responsibility.\u201d\n\nThose remarks allowed Republicans to tie Mrs. Clinton to an administration that they widely view as ineffective in combating the Islamic State. \u201cThe president has admitted he does not have a strategy as it relates to ISIS,\u201d Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor and a Republican presidential candidate, told CNN. \u201cHillary Clinton last night said that it\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s not our fight.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt is our fight, and without our leadership in building a coalition to destroy ISIS, it won\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nAt a campaign event in Ames, Iowa, on Sunday, Mrs. Clinton tried to expand on her earlier statement, saying that the United States should play a leadership role and \u201cbe rallying our partners and allies, pulling countries off the sidelines.\u201d\n\nHer seemingly incongruous comments on the issue speak to the reality that there may be no real political upside for Mrs. Clinton in coming out early with a detailed plan for Syria, said Michael O\u2019Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\u201cEven if she could convince people she\u2019s right today, by a year from now, on Election Day, the situation will have morphed,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Hanlon said. \u201cAnd in the meantime, she would have scared a lot of people with a little too much of what the Democratic base doesn\u2019t want to hear right now.\u201d", "byline": "AMY CHOZICK", "description": "The presidential race\u2019s new emphasis on terrorism has laid bare Mrs. Clinton\u2019s long-held differences with President Obama on foreign policy.", "title": "Paris Attacks Complicate Hillary Clinton\u2019s Alignment With Obama", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/us/politics/paris-attacks-complicate-hillary-clintons-alignment-with-obama.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Michael O'Hanlon", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Barack Obama", "Bernie Sanders"], "orgs": ["Brookings Institution"], "election_confidence": 0.7401183880597504, "authors": [{"author_id": 1667, "fullname": "amy chozick", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 10:00:17", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "a310dc5d47425798195debce32f7638f", "date_access": "2015-11-17 10:27:40.091557"}
