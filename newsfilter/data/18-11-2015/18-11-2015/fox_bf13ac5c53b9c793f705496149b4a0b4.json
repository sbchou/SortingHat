Martin O\u2019Malley calling her the \u201ccandidate of Wall Street.\u201d\nAsked about her hefty Wall Street-backed speaking fees and donations, Clinton defended her independence in being able to pursue financial industry reform.\nBut Sanders shot back, \u201cNot good enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet's not be naive about it. Why \u2026has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?\u201d he said during Saturday's debate. \u201cYou know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.\u201d\nClinton responded to Sanders\u2019 criticism of her Wall Street donations by saying that as a New York senator, she helped \u201crebuild\u201d Wall Street after 9/11.\nSanders later told Couric that Clinton\u2019s position on Wall Street had nothing to do with 9/11.\n\u201cThe truth is Hillary Clinton and all of us in Congress did everything that we could to rebuild New York City after the devastating attack but that has nothing to do with the question of the impact of Wall Street campaign contributions and her views on Wall Street.\u201d", "byline": "", "description": "Bernie Sanders said Tuesday that fellow Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s remarks about her Wall Street stance during Saturday\u2019s debate were \u201csilly\u201d and \u201cabsurd.\u201d", "title": "Sanders calls Clinton's Wall Street remarks 'silly' and 'absurd'", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/5YxxdU8uH5g/", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "immigration"], "people": ["Charlie Neibergall", "Martin O'Malley", "Hillary Clinton", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Bernie Sanders", "Katie Couric"], "orgs": ["Congress"], "election_confidence": 0.7709483274289414, "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-11-18 01:43:04", "org": "fox", "article_id": "bf13ac5c53b9c793f705496149b4a0b4", "date_access": "2015-11-18 02:23:12.050622"}
