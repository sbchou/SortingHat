Bernie Sanders for proposals to raise taxes on the middle class that were part of the national single-payer health care bills he introduced in Congress.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cBernie Sanders has called for a roughly 9-percent tax hike on middle-class families just to cover his health-care plan,\u201d said Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon, referring to legislation Sanders introduced in 2013, \u201cand simple math dictates he'll need to tax workers even more to pay for the rest of his at least $18-20 trillion agenda. If you are truly concerned about raising incomes for middle-class families, the last thing you should do is cut their take-home pay right off the bat by raising their taxes.\u201d\nSanders introduced a single-payer healthcare bill in 2013 that included a 2.2 percent income tax across the board, as well as a 6.7 percent payroll tax for employers, the Washington Post reported Friday, and has introduced similar legislation in multiple sessions of Congress. While payroll taxes are split between the employer and the employee, economists and the Congressional Budget Office have said that most of those fees are carried by the workers in the form of lower wages.\nSanders has yet to announce the details of how he will pay for the national single-payer, Medicare for all Americans proposal that is a major plank of his presidential campaign. Economic experts have said it would be impossible to institute a single-payer system relying solely on tax hikes on the wealthy. Sanders camp has argued in response that in the long run, the single-payer system will save the country trillions of currently wasted dollars.\n\n\n\n            By \nJosh Gerstein\n             and \nKenneth P. Vogel\n\n\"On Medicare for all, the middle class would be far better off because it would save taxpayers money,\" Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said in response to Clinton's latest line of attack. \"More people would get better care at less cost. Didn't she used to be for that? We wouldn't throw money away on costly premiums for profit-making private insurance companies. Pharmaceutical companies would no longer be able to rip off Americans with the most expensive prescription drugs in the world. \n\"Didn't she used to be for that?\"\nFor months, Clinton\u2019s campaign has been highlighting issues where it can carve out a lane to the left of Sanders \u2014 gun control became a flashpoint in the first debate when Clinton attacked Sanders for his vote against the Brady Bill, and she doubled down on those attacks for days after on the campaign trail.\nThe latest attempt to draw a contrast on tax hikes and wage increases can be seen as an attempt by Clinton to undercut any momentum Sanders is building among union workers and middle class voters, and to position herself as the candidate most concerned with take home pay for working families.\n\u201cHillary Clinton believes strongly that middle class families deserve a raise, not a tax increase,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cShe has proposed a bold, aggressive agenda, but when it comes to paying for it, she will make sure the wealthiest Americans finally start paying their fair share, not force the middle class to pay even more than they already do.\"\n\n\n\n            By \nGabriel Debenedetti\n\nDuring the debate, Clinton stated that she will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for her debt-free public college program and her proposal to institute mandatory paid family leave \u2014but stopped short of drawing a contrast with Sanders\u2019 tax plans. \u201cI have made very clear that hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase,\u201d Clinton said Saturday night. \u201cI will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment and I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class.\"\nIn the debate, Sanders demurred when asked for details about his forthcoming tax plan. \u201cWe haven\u2019t come up with an exact number yet,\u201d he said when asked by how much he would raise the country\u2019s top marginal income tax rate to pay for his proposals.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "'The last thing you should do is cut their take-home pay right off the bat,' says Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon.", "title": "Clinton hits Sanders on middle class tax hikes", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/hillary-clinton-taxes-middle-class-bernie-sanders-215958", "topics": ["economy", "guns"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Susan Rice", "Michael Briggs", "Kenneth P.
