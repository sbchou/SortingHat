{"body": "Leslie Dach, Senior Counselor of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services speaks with WSJ\u2019s Laura Landro at CEO Council about the future of the Affordable Care Act.\nBy now, supporters and opponents of the Affordable Care Act\u00c2\u00a0often divide along \u201cglass half full or half empty\u201d lines over similar facts, and each perspective was on display at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council on Tuesday.\n\u201cWe believe coverage in general has been improved\u201d by the 2010 law, said Health and Human Services senior counselor Leslie Dach. \u201cThat\u2019s an important beginning.\u201d\nHis agency has estimated that the law has extended coverage to 17.6 million people, between its provision requiring plans to cover young adult dependents to their 26th birthdays, the expansion of Medicaid, and the availability of subsidized private coverage to everyone through HealthCare.gov and state equivalents. The law also imposes new requirements on insurance plans on what they must cover, and says\u00c2\u00a0they must price coverage equally regardless of people\u2019s medical history, and these affect everyone who gets insurance on their own.\nIt\u2019s true that the law has made a significant dent in the number of people without insurance, and made sweeping changes to the way coverage operates in America. For critics, the issue isn\u2019t how many people it\u2019s covered \u2013\u00c2\u00a0it\u2019s how many have been left behind.\nRepublican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, speaking after Mr. Dach, pointed to Congressional Budget Office estimates suggesting that as many as 35 million people are still without coverage, and 27 million will be uninsured five years from now, to argue\u00c2\u00a0the health law has required too much to do too little.\n\u201cIt is an incredible amount of disruption to still have that many people uncovered when all is said and done,\u201d he said. Mr. Thune said that Republican replacements for the law all aim to find some way of providing insurance for people with pre-existing conditions that once could have barred them from buying insurance on their own, but with relaxed requirements on what coverage must include, as a way of bringing the price down.\nMORE FROM WSJ CEO COUNCIL:\nTop Clinton Adviser Says Wealthy Should Pay More in Taxes\nObama Adviser Furman Sees Limited Economic Impact From Paris Attacks\nDefense Chief Ash Carter Calls on Europe to Do More to Confront ISIS\nMarco Rubio Says GOP Rivals Tried to Weaken U.S. Intelligence Efforts\n______________________________________________________\n2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll Standings\n\n\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops. \r\n\nCapital Journal Daybreak Newsletter: Sign up to get the latest on politics, policy and defense delivered to your inbox every morning.\r\nFor the latest Washington news, follow @wsjpolitics\r\nFor outside analysis, follow @wsjthinktank", "byline": "", "description": "By now, supporters and opponents of\u00a0the Affordable Care Act\u00a0often divide along \"glass half full or half empty\" lines over similar facts, and each perspective was on display at the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/specialcoverage/ceo-council-2015\">Wall Street Journal CEO Council</a>\u00a0on Tuesday.\n\n\"We believe coverage in general has been improved\" by the 2010 law, said Health and Human Services senior counselor Leslie Dach. \"That's an important beginning.", "title": "At WSJ CEO Council, Health Law\u2019s Success Depends on Which Number You Prefer", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/17/at-wsj-ceo-council-glass-is-half-full-or-half-empty-on-health-law/", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "health"], "people": ["Ash Carter", "Marco Rubio", "John Thune"], "orgs": ["WSJ", "U.S. Department of Health and Human Services", "Health and Human Services", "Congressional Budget Office", "Capital Journal", "Medicaid", "HealthCare", "GOP"], "election_confidence": 0.8322229528304158, "authors": [{"author_id": 1141, "fullname": "louise radnofsky", "primary_org": "wsj"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 17:01:38", "org": "wsj", "article_id": "1aeb56b9db98d1b0a0eb823a4444e624", "date_access": "2015-11-17 18:04:02.405423"}
