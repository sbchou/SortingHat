McCaskill\n\n11/17/15 05:03 PM EST\nTwo of Ben Carson's own top advisers are knocking his ability to grasp foreign policy despite aggressive tutoring sessions, according to a report in The New York Times. \nThe retired neurosurgeon has bobbled a number of foreign policy issues in recent days, claiming that China has a military presence in Syria and struggling on \"Fox News Sunday\" to name allies he would seek out to create an international military coalition to combat Islamic State, \nStory Continued Below\nNow, two of his advisers told The New York Times in interviews that Carson is having trouble absorbing facts on international affairs.\n\u201cNobody has been able to sit down with him and have him get one iota of intelligent information about the Middle East,\u201d said Duane Clarridge, a top adviser to Carson on terrorism and national security. Carson needs weekly foreign policy briefings to \u201cmake him smart,\u201d added Clarridge, a longtime CIA agent who is seen as a colorful figure. \n\n\n\n            By \nJake Sherman\n\nArmstrong Williams, one of Carson's lead advisers and closest friends, also expressed frustration to the newspaper about the \"Fox News Sunday\" interview. \u201cHe\u2019s been briefed on it so many times,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess he just froze.\u201d\nCarson's campaign has spent a good amount of energy trying to compensate for his comment in last week's debate in which he suggested China is involved in the conflict in Syria. \u201cWe also must recognize that it\u2019s a very complex place,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, the Chinese are there, as well as the Russians, and you have all kinds of factions there.\u201d \n The White House dismissed the notion that the Chinese are in Syria, but Carson stood by his comment. His campaign subsequently said he was referring to Chinese military weapons and equipment.\nBut Clarridge told The New York Times that Carson relied on a freelance American intelligence operative in Iraq who \"overleaped\" in implying that Chinese troops are in Syria.\nThe Carson campaign pushed back on the article, saying the paper took advantage of an \"elderly gentleman.\" \n\n\n\n            By \nEli Stokols\n\n\"Mr. Clarridge has incomplete knowledge of the daily, not weekly briefings, that Dr. Carson receives on important national security matters from former military and State Department officials,\" Doug Watts, a Carson campaign spokesman, told Business Insider in an email. \"He is coming to the end of a long career of serving our country. Mr. Clarridge's input to Dr. Carson is appreciated but he is clearly not one of Dr. Carson's top advisors. For the New York Times to take advantage of an elderly gentleman and use him as their foil in this story is an affront to good journalistic practices.\"\nDespite publicly aired doubts about Carson's ability to master foreign policy issues, voters still rank him relatively high in the GOP field on the topic. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Tuesday, 20 percent of Republican voters surveyed say Donald Trump is best suited to handle terrorism, followed by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at roughly 10 percent, and Carson with 8 percent.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Report: Carson&apos;s top advisers question his foreign policy grasp", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/ben-carson-foreign-policy-advisers-215993", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kenneth P.
