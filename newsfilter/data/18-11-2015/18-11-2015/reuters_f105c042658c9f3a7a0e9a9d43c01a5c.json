{"body": "WASHINGTON U.S. lawmakers called on Tuesday for even tighter scrutiny of Syrian refugees fleeing to the United States as last week's deadly Paris attacks recast America's long-running debate over immigration and national security.\nRepublican leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives, worried about Islamist attacks following Friday's killings of 129 people in France, threatened to suspend President Barack Obama's efforts to allow 10,000 more Syrian refugees into the country.\nDemocrats also called for close vetting of refugees from the four-year-old civil war in Syria in case they are linked to extremist groups such as Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the Paris killings.\nThe attacks focused the spotlight in Washington on national security with the November 2016 presidential election campaign heating up and Obama in the final year of his presidency.\n\"This is a moment where it is better to be safe than sorry,\" the Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters.\nSeparately, two influential senators, Republican Jeff Flake and Democrat Tim Kaine, responded to the Paris attacks by renewing their push for Congress to vote on a formal authorization for the use of military force for the campaign against Islamic State.\nBut most of the emphasis in the Republican-controlled Congress has been on the backlash against Syrian refugees.\nRyan called for a pause in Obama's program, announced in September, to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees in a year. The number of Syrians destined for the United States is low compared with figures in European countries such as Germany. \nThe issue has challenged America's image of itself as a nation that welcomes downtrodden newcomers, with some lawmakers suggesting all Syrians should be barred, or that Christian Syrians should be favored over Muslims.        \nRepublican Senator John McCain on Tuesday backed scrupulous vetting but strongly opposed such discrimination.\n\"All of us are God\u2019s children ... so I disagree with that assumption that only Christian children should be able to come to the United States,\" he told Reuters.\nRepublicans and Democrats have both voiced fears that housing refugees from a conflict zone in the Middle East could  leave the country open to attacks like those staged by al Qaeda  on Sept. 11, 2001.\nSenator Ben Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said Washington should look at the strongest possible vetting process to ensure \"terrorists cannot get into the United States through our refugee program.\"   \nThe current U.S. screening process takes 18 to 24 months and is tighter than that in Europe, he said.\nOther Western countries have begun to question their willingness to admit Syrians after reports that at least one of the Paris attackers passed through Greece in October.\nThe White House National Security Council said it was continuing to look for ways to tighten screening.\nSenior Obama administration officials including Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson held a classified briefing on Tuesday evening for all 435 members of the House about the aftermath of the Paris attacks. But many Republicans remained deeply concerned.\n\"I have great concerns about allowing people on our shores without knowing that we're able to find out information about them,\" said Republican Representative Matt Salmon. \"I'm leaving this briefing far less comfortable than when I came in.\"        \nIMMIGRATION FIGHTS\nU.S. politicians have debated for years over immigration, most recently about Latin Americans who entered the country illegally.\nConservative Republicans in the 2016 White House race are offering competing plans to limit illegal immigration. Republican presidential campaign front-runner Donald Trump has threatened to deport the 11 million already in the United States.     \nRepublican presidential candidate Jeb Bush broke with rivals by saying he would support the entry of some Syrian refugees but stressed that screening must be tough enough to bar militants.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Worrying refugee advocates, at least 26 mostly Republican governors say they are concerned about people resettling in their states after fleeing Syria's four-year-old civil war, saying some could be associated with Islamic State. Other governors, mostly Democrats, have said Syrians are welcome.\nSecretary of State John Kerry said that of 785,000 refugees accepted since 2001, only 12 \"were found to perhaps be problematic with respect to potential terror.\" \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But he told NBC that while screening is effective it will have to be increased and \"will probably go slower and cost more money.\" \nRyan did not offer details about proposed legislation to pause Obama's refugee plan, but said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that he would bring it to the House floor on Thursday.\nHe said he had spoken to the White House, congressional Democrats and senators about the bill.\nSeveral other Republicans are pushing to include a provision to block the resettlement of Syrians in a trillion-dollar budget bill that must be passed, and signed into law by Obama, by Dec. 11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Others have proposed measures setting strict conditions on admitting Syrians, such as requiring the FBI director to certify that refugees' background checks have been completed, and an audit of the vetting process.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Senate, where Republicans hold a smaller majority than in the House, would also have to approve any legislation before it could take effect. Rhetoric there has been less heated than in the House.\nA plan by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to accept 25,000 Syrian refugees by the end of the year ran into trouble on Monday as some local leaders said the timeline is too short.\n\n (Additional reporting by Richard Cowan, David Lawder and Susan Cornwell; Writing by Alistair Bell; Editing by Howard Goller, James Dalgleish and Ken Wills)", "byline": "", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers called on Tuesday for even tighter scrutiny of Syrian refugees fleeing to the United States as last week's deadly Paris attacks recast America's long-running debate over immigration and national security.", "title": "Paris attacks reshape U.S. debate on immigration, security", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/jl7wi84m4eM/story01.htm", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["John Kerry", "Howard Goller", "David Lawder", "Ben Cardin", "James Dalgleish", "Jeb Bush", "Justin Trudeau", "Jeh Johnson", "Donald Trump", "Matt Salmon", "Barack Obama", "Paul Ryan", "Ken Wills", "Richard Cowan", "Susan Cornwell", "Alistair Bell"], "orgs": ["Congress", "Senate", "al Qaeda", "U.S. House of Representatives", "Foreign Relations Committee", "Homeland Security", "United States.", "FBI"], "election_confidence": 0.5448428293822747, "authors": [{"author_id": 33517, "fullname": "patricia zengerle", "primary_org": "reuters"}, {"author_id": 33445, "fullname": "megan cassella", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-11-18 01:21:58", "org": "reuters", "article_id": "f105c042658c9f3a7a0e9a9d43c01a5c", "date_access": "2015-11-18 01:48:40.418413"}
