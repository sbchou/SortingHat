President Barack Obama has said the U.S. will accept 10,000 refugees over the next year. Trump often cites a far higher figure \u2014 250,000 \u2014 that has no basis in fact. On Tuesday morning, Trump tweeted, \"Refugees from Syria are now pouring into our great country. Who knows who they are - some could be ISIS. Is our president insane?\"\nAt a rally in Knoxville, Tenn., on Monday, Trump said the refugees should stay within Syria. \"What I'd like is ... build a big beautiful safe zone and you have whatever it is so people can live, and they'll be happier,\" he said.\nIngraham said that she had spoken with Florida's Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, who told her his state is already hosting dozens of Syrian refugees because \u201ceverybody wants to come to Florida\u201d due to its low taxes and ample job opportunities.\n\u201cIn California, you have a Democrat as a governor; in Florida you have Rick Scott so they send them to the Republicans,\u201d Trump told Ingraham. \u201cTaking these people is absolutely insanity.\u201d\nAccording to the Associated Press, governors from both parties have accepted refugees, although the number is nearly double for GOP states. More than 1,000 Syrian refugees have been accepted into states with Republican governors since January 1, while just over 500 have moved to Democratic-led states. (The number of Republican governors outweighs Democrats, 31 to 18, however.)\nIngraham tried to steer Trump away from using exaggerated figures for the number of refugees, but he held firm. \u201cNo I\u2019m talking about now, I\u2019m talking about in terms of Syria. I\u2019ve heard numbers as high as 250,000 people.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Trump: Obama sending refugees to Republican states", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/trump-obama-syria-refugees-215975", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "economy"], "people": ["Sara Solovitch", "Susan Rice", "Michael Hirsh", "Kate Tummarello", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "Marc Caputo", "Tim Starks", "Steven Shepard", "Barack Obama", "Jenny Hopkinson", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Jeffrey Gedmin", "Howard Dean", "Theodoric Meyer", "Loretta Lynch", "Annie Karni", "Josh Gerstein", "Shane Goldmacher", "Nick Gass", "Bernie Becker", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Laura Ingraham", "Andrew Glass", "Jeremy Herb", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Paul Ryan", "Brianna Ehley", "David Pittman", "Lauren French", "John Podesta", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Donald Trump", "Paul Lindsay", "Howard Fineman", "Rick Scott", "Ben White", "Alex Spence", "Darren Samuelsohn", "Victoria Guida", "Alex Byers", "Eric Wolff", "Ernest Moniz", "Edward Snowden", "Caitlin Emma"], "orgs": ["Washington And The World", "FDA", "Congress", "Amtrak", "Senate", "Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee", "PAC", "FCC", "College", "Senate GOP", "Congressional Black Caucus", "CMS", "GOP", "Tenn"], "election_confidence": 0.8489157262844512, "authors": [{"author_id": 30728, "fullname": "nick gass", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 17:23:35", "org": "politico", "article_id": "cd5e09b1b594c2a016aec6a4d83da2eb", "date_access": "2015-11-17 17:47:15.450367"}
