{"body": "VIDEO: Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, Jr. speaks with WSJ\u2019s Jerry Seib at CEO Council about how to beat ISIS\nThe top U.S. military officer said Tuesday the U.S. had asked allies to take specific steps to increase the pressure against Islamic State in the wake of the Paris terror attacks.\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal at the annual\u00c2\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00c2\u00a0CEO Council meeting in Washington, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joe Dunford said the Pentagon drew up plans to solicit more contributions from coalition partners to take on the terrorist group that claimed responsibility for the coordinated attacks in Paris that killed more than 120 people.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOver the weekend, as we started looking at the implications of Paris, one of the things we did was identify kind of a list of all those things that we would want to see in terms of contributions from both parties inside of NATO but as importantly\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 inside of the region,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gen. Dunford said.\nGen. Dunford said the attacks changed the nature of the fight against Islamic State.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI assess, and I think most people do, that the rules may have changed in Paris last week,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gen. Dunford said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd so in the wake of Paris, a much more energized approach\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 towards getting people to make a contribution is kind of what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re after, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just going to take some political persuasion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nGen. Dunford said some nations might be willing to contribute to a ground force in Syria and Iraq and the U.S. is encouraging those efforts.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe ground force is a critical element, particularly in Syria and Iraq. We have to have critical partners on the ground to be effective against ISIL,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gen. Dunford said.\nHe added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe would like to see particularly Sunni nations in the region, GCC States, contribute to a greater degree on the ground. I think they would have the credibility and frankly come without some of the baggage of western forces.. I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some possibility for that, we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been able to do that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nGen. Dunford, who has been chairman of the Joint Chiefs for seven\u00c2\u00a0weeks, said he sees targeting foreign fighters as an area of the campaign that has the most room for improvement. Presently 10 nations including the U.S. coordinate on those efforts, Gen. Dunford said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a complete view on foreign fighters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThose 10 nations need to be 70 or 80 nations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nGen. Dunford said following the Paris attacks nations might also be more willing to address the flow of foreign fighters.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the areas I believe we have the most opportunity to advance the campaign,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\nThe coalition has a much better picture of foreign fighters entering Iraq and Syria than leaving, he said.\n\nMORE FROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL CEO COUNCIL:\nTop Clinton Adviser Says Wealthy Should Pay More in Taxes\nPollsters on 2016: Voters Will Be Angrier, Less Religious, More Diverse\nObama Adviser Furman Sees Limited Economic Impact From Paris Attacks\nDefense Chief Ash Carter Calls on Europe to Do More to Confront ISIS\nMarco Rubio Says GOP Rivals Tried to Weaken U.S. Intelligence Efforts\nFull coverage \u00e2\u0080\u0094 articles and videos \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from WSJ CEO Council\nMORE\nVideo: Gen.
