{"body": "WASHINGTON Nov 17 A 12-nation Pacific Rim\nfree-trade deal, facing stiff opposition from many Democrats and\nunexpected resistance from Republicans, is unlikely to be voted\non by the U.S. Congress before President Barack Obama leaves\noffice, according to some Republican lawmakers and aides.\nA veteran Senate Republican aide, who asked not to be\nidentified, said Republican leaders intend to shelve the deal\nuntil after the November 2016 presidential election, which would\ndash administration hopes of a vote in the first half of next\nyear.\nThe aide added that much of the Senate Republican rank and\nfile \"is not supportive of the agreement\" negotiated by Obama\nand 11 other countries that aims to liberalize trade for 40\npercent of the world economy.\n\"I doubt seriously that we're going to get that resolved by\n2016,\" Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch told\nReuters on Tuesday regarding the Trans-Pacific Partnership\n(TPP).\n\nUPDATE\n\"Nobody wants to do it in the lame duck either so it will\nprobably carry over,\" Hatch said referring to the end-year\nsession of Congress that occurs after the November elections but\nbefore the new Congress and president are sworn in.\nHatch previously had said it would be difficult to bring TPP\nto a vote in Congress during the 2016 election year.\nCongressional aides' comments suggested Hatch's sentiment was\nwidely held.\nWith few Democrats in the House expected to vote for TPP,\nObama has been relying on Republicans - who control both the\nSenate and the House of Representatives - to provide the votes\nneeded for approval.\nOn Friday, Obama urged Congress to \"move promptly\" in early\n2016 to approve the trade pact. He is scheduled to attend an\nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Manila this week,\nwhere he also hopes to build momentum for the TPP, a key plank\nof the administration's engagement with Asia.\nBut the outlook has soured in Congress. Although many farm\nlobby groups have come out in support, business groups are still\nmulling the fine print. New House Speaker Paul Ryan, a trade\nsupporter, has yet to declare his view. A spokesman for Ryan\nsaid no decision had been made on the timing of a vote.\nAnother House Republican leadership aide said TPP needs a\nlong, thorough review by Congress, calling it a \"complicated,\nlengthy deal.\" The aide added: \"The president doesn't have the\npolitical capital (to get it passed) that he once had.\"\nHatch has criticized the deal for failing to secure 12 years\nof protection for some pharmaceuticals, a goal that U.S.\nofficials say was just not possible given staunch opposition\nfrom countries like Australia.\nThe high-ranking Republican has said Obama might have to\nreopen negotiations with the other 11 countries to address his\nconcerns. That idea has been firmly rejected by the White House\nand Japan, the second-biggest economy in the bloc.\n\"No one is in a hurry, and the message from many (Senate\nRepublicans) will be we need to restart negotiations,\" the\nSenate aide told Reuters.\nComplicating TPP's prospects in Congress are opposition from\naspiring presidential candidates, including Republican\nfront-runner Donald Trump. Democratic front-runner Hillary\nClinton has split with Obama and said free-trade deals could do\n\"more harm than good.\"\nPete Sessions, a senior House of Representatives Republican\nwho supported key trade legislation earlier this year, told\nReuters that the Obama administration failed to follow markers\nput down by Congress when he negotiated TPP.\n\"It's a tough thing for a Republican to put a trade bill up\n(for a vote) and not support it when the whole concept was for\nus to offer an advantage against what the Chinese have done to\nthe marketplace, and that's what this was about.\"\n\n (Reporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)", "byline": "", "description": "WASHINGTON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - A 12-nation Pacific Rim\nfree-trade deal, facing stiff opposition from many Democrats and\nunexpected resistance from Republicans, is unlikely to be voted\non by the U.S. Congress before President Barack Obama leaves\noffice, according to some Republican lawmakers and aides.", "title": "Prospects dim for 2016 Pacific Rim trade vote in U.S. Congress", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/noncyclicalconsumergoodsNews/~3/VY7krATEeXw/usa-trade-congress-idUSL1N13C24V20151117", "topics": ["trade"], "people": ["Richard Cowan", "Jonathan Oatis", "Pete Sessions", "Donald Trump", "Barack Obama", "Paul Ryan", "Orrin Hatch"], "orgs": ["U.S. Congress", "Congress", "Senate Finance Committee", "Senate", "House of Representatives", "TPP"], "election_confidence": 0.7624647548169273, "authors": [{"author_id": 33346, "fullname": "reuters editorial", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 21:56:06", "org": "reuters", "article_id": "27339731deabeb0bad3bfdb1b7ab8b94", "date_access": "2015-11-17 23:52:43.551642"}
