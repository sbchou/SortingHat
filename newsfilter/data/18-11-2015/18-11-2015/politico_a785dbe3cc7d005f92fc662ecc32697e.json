McCaskill\n\n11/17/15 10:06 AM EST\nDays ahead of a run-off election for governor in Louisiana, Sen. David Vitter\u2019s campaign has launched an attack ad blasting his Democratic opponent, John Bel Edwards, for his support of the administration\u2019s plan to resettle 10,000 Syrian refugees in the U.S.\nFollowing the terror attacks that struck Paris on Friday, more than two dozen Republican governors have voiced opposition to accepting Syrian refugees into their states. International investigators believe one of the assailants entered Europe by posing as a refugee. \nStory Continued Below\n\u201cNow Obama is sending Syrian refugees to Louisiana,\u201d the narrator says in the ad. \u201cDavid Vitter warned Obama the dangers of Syrian refugees weeks ago and promised as governor no Syrian refugees will enter Louisiana. John Bel Edwards has pledged to work with Obama to bring Syrian refugees to Louisiana.\u201d\nThe 30-second ad closes with a clip of Edwards saying, \u201cI supported the president,\u201d with the narrator concluding, \u201cHe always does.\u201d\nEdwards responded with a Facebook post accusing Vitter of \u201cbombarding\u201d voters with lies about his position. \u201cMany of you have expressed concern about how to respond to this, the most recent example of his deceptiveness,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have clearly and openly called for a complete stop to the entry of refugees to Louisiana. This is a shameful and desperate attempt by David to distort my position as well as my record as the only candidate with military experience.\u201d\nEdwards said he will stay in contact with law enforcement regarding the 14 refugees already in Louisiana but asked who voters trust more: \u201ca West Point graduate and former Army Ranger or David Vitter, who continues to lie to us in order to divide us?\u201d he added. \u201cThe choice is STILL clear, Louisiana.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Vitter hits Edwards with ad knocking his support for Syrian refugees", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/david-vitter-john-edwards-syria-215969", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "economy"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Susan Rice", "Kenneth P.
