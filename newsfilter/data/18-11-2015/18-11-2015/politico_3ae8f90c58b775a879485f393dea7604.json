Would it be like LaBradford Smith talking trash to Jordan or something?\" Simmons asked.\n\"I would\u2019ve enjoyed campaigning against Trump,\" Obama remarked.\nLater in the interview, Obama told Simmons that he had smoked zero cigarettes \"in the last five years.\"\n\"I made a promise that once health care passed, I would never have a cigarette again. And I have not,\" Obama said, despite a stir earlier this year generated by a photo of him with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.\nObama also laughed off the Jade Helm 15 conspiracy theories that he was going to begin martial law to stay in office longer, remarking, \"[a]nybody who thinks I could get away with telling Michelle I\u2019m going to be president any longer than eight years does not know my wife.\"\nDaughters Sasha and Malia are also apparently eager for their dad to leave the Oval Office.\n\"Not as much as Michelle, but certainly ready,\" Obama said.\nThe president also commented on the impression that he is feeling less burdened by the job now that he is well into his second term and does not have to face re-election.\n\n\n\n            By \nNahal Toosi\n\n\"There\u2019s no doubt that the longer I\u2019m in this job, the more confident I am about the decisions I\u2019m making and more knowledgeable about the responses I can expect. And as a consequence, you end up being looser,\" he said. \"There\u2019s not much I have not seen at this point, and I know what to expect, and I can anticipate more than I did before.\"\nBut that apparently does not mean he is willing to pick between his vice president (who is very much not running for his job) or former secretary of state (who certainly is).\n\"Which leadership style suits your vision of where America should go forward? Biden or Hillary?\"\n\"Come on, Bill,\" Obama said with a laugh.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Obama: Running against Trump &apos;would&apos;ve been fun&apos;", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/obama-trump-campaign-215966", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Matteo Renzi", "Susan Rice", "Kenneth P.
