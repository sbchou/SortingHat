We look forward to hearing from you!\nHIGHLIGHTS\nWESTERN ALLIES SOUGHT TO KILL KEY SUSPECT IN PARIS ATTACKS: An Islamic State operative suspected of helping plan the Paris attacks had been monitored in Syria by Western allies seeking to kill him in an airstrike, but they couldn\u2019t locate him in the weeks before the plot was carried out, two Western security officials said. The operative, a Belgian citizen named Abdelhamid Abaaoud, was convicted in absentia in Brussels earlier this year of recruiting jihadists, was suspected of masterminding a foiled plot to behead police officers, escaped to Syria and was profiled in Islamic State\u2019s online magazine mocking European authorities for their failure to catch him. A year ago, video emerged of him in Syria, smiling as he drove a truck dragging the dead bodies of Islamic State\u2019s opponents tied to the bumper.\nMr. Abaaoud is one of two people who have emerged at the center of a probe into the attacks that killed 129 people on Friday. Both are at large. French and Belgian authorities are also searching for a 26-year-old petty criminal named Salah Abdeslam, who they say rented a car used in the attacks on Friday and is suspected of driving some of the suicide bombers through Paris. Beno\u00eet Faucon, Matthew Dalton, Stacy Meichtry and David Gauthier-Villars report.\nThe latest on the Paris attacks: World leaders pledged to seize on the Paris attacks to deepen their involvement in what looked\u00a0Monday\u00a0to be turning into more of a global campaign against the growing threat of Islamic State\u2026\u00a0The French air force carried out raids against Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa in northern Syria for the second consecutive day, as the U.S. stepped up attacks on Islamic State\u2019s industrial base, striking more than 100 oil tanker trucks \u2026 French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande vowed to adopt hard-line security powers in an attempt to reassure a nation traumatized by the Paris attacks that left at least 129 people dead \u2026Islamic State militants vow in a video released\u00a0on Monday to launch terror attacks in Washington and Rome similar to the violence that erupted\u00a0Friday in Paris and killed at least 129 people.\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 Turkish officials revealed that they had identified one of the Paris assailants as a terrorism suspect and notified French authorities twice to no avail, highlighting intelligence lapses that plague cooperation among Western allies amid mounting security risks from extremist militants\u00a0\u2026 The Paris attacks have jolted Germany into considering greater military involvement in the fight against Islamic State, despite public opposition to abandoning its largely pacifist foreign policy\u00a0\u2026 Here\u2019s what we know about the attackers \u2026 The probe to find the network behind\u00a0Friday\u2019s\u00a0attacks in Paris quickly led to Molenbeek, a small neighborhood near the historic center of the Belgian capital\u2026 As more information surfaced Monday about the Paris victims, a theme emerged: They were mostly young people, killed while having a night on the town.\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry made an unannounced stop in Paris on Monday to meet with French officials and demonstrate U.S. support after Friday\u2019s attacks.\nJAY SOLOMON: IS IRAN\u2019S RESOLUTE SUPPORT FOR SYRIA\u2019S ASSAD A DEAL BREAKER?\nIran is holding firm that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad be allowed to run in any future elections in his country, presenting a potentially fatal blow to renewed international talks aimed at ending the Syrian civil war. On Saturday, 17 countries met in Vienna, including the U.S., Russia and Iran, and outlined a framework for reaching a cease-fire in Syria and then a political transition. Left unresolved, according to diplomats who attended, is what happens to Mr. Assad. The U.S. and its closest Middle East allies, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar, have demanded that Mr. Assad leave office as part of efforts to reconcile Syria\u2019s warring factions. But a leading Iranian diplomat at the Vienna talks, however, reaffirmed Tehran\u2019s position that foreign powers cannot decide to bar Mr. Assad from future elections, Jay Solomon reports.

High-ranking Republicans in Congress also are considering ways to stop the efforts to settle migrants, and a number of GOP presidential candidates on Monday took a similarly hard line. The partisan battle over accepting Syrian refugees began in earnest after authorities in Paris said one of the suspects in the attacks that left 129 dead may have entered France as a refugee. As a result, the already volatile politics of the refugee crisis, and immigration in general, have become vastly more complicated by the addition of a national-security threat. Byron Tau and Kristina Peterson report.\nPARIS ATTACKS SPUR HARSHER TONE FROM GOP CANDIDATES: As a fervid debate over illegal immigration roils the GOP presidential primary, the terrorist attacks in Paris are pushing candidates to take a harder line\u2014a tack some Republicans worry will hamstring their nominee in the general election. Most Republicans seeking the White House have called for President Obama to shelve his plan to admit about 10,000 refugees of the Syrian civil war. The rhetoric escalated in the wake of reports linking one of the suicide bombers to a passport from a Syrian seeking asylum. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz are suggesting different standards for Christian and Muslim refugees, while businessman Donald Trump said\u00a0Monday\u00a0that the government should \u201cstrongly consider\u201d closing mosques in the U.S. Beth Reinhard reports.\nPlus:\u00a0Days after the Paris terrorist attacks heightened homeland security concerns, Florida Sen.

Mr. Bortnikov said authorities had evidence that the Airbus A321 was downed by a homemade bomb, carrying the explosive equivalent of up to one kilogram of TNT. Andrey Ostroukh reports.\nHOW TO FORM AN ARMY TO FIGHT ISIS:\u00a0It took French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande to flatly declare it: In the wake of the terror attacks in Paris, the struggle against Islamic State isn\u2019t merely a fight. It is a war. There\u2019s no shortage of aggrieved or alarmed nations to engage in this war, nor of planes to do their part in waging it from the air. What is lacking is an actual army to fight it. \u201cThe fundamental problem,\u201d says Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, \u201cis we still don\u2019t have a ground partner.\u201d The principal goal of President Obama as well as European and Sunni Arab leaders now has to be fixing that problem.

Steve King tells John McCormick of Bloomberg that a visit to Europe and an examination of the Middle East refugee surge there helped convinced him to endorse Sen.
