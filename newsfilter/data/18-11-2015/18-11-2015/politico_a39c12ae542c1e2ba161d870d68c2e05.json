Some Republicans are threatening to hold up a government funding bill next month to stop money from flowing to the program. \nOne bill that's under consideration was penned by North Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson. It would force the government to certify refugees have passed a background check. \nFurthermore, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) announced during the meeting that he created a task force comprised of the chairmen of jurisdiction to consider further legislative action. Those committees are Homeland Security, Armed Services, Judiciary, Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Appropriations.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Ryan aims to address refugee situation this week", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/paul-ryan-syria-refugees-congress-215968", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Susan Rice", "Kenneth P.
