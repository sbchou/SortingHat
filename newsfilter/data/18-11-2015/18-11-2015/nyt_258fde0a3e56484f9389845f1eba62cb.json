{"body": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, a onetime rising Republican star whose popularity has plummeted in his own state, abruptly dropped out of the presidential race on Tuesday, conceding that he was unable to find any traction.\n\n\u201cThis is not my time,\u201d he said on Fox News.\n\nMr. Jindal unveiled a series of policy proposals, ferociously attacked Donald J. Trump and spent considerable time courting conservatives in Iowa, which begins the presidential nominating process. None of it worked. He raised little money, did not rise high enough in the polls to appear on the prime-time debate stage and was overshadowed by unconventional candidates such as Mr. Trump and Ben Carson.\n\nIn withdrawing, Mr. Jindal alluded to his parents\u2019 emigration to the United States from India 45 years ago.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think in a million years they would have ever imagined that I\u2019d be governor or one day I\u2019d be running for president of the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nBut, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve come to the realization this is not my time.\u201d\n\nMr. Jindal\u2019s withdrawal comes days before a runoff election in the Louisiana governor\u2019s race, a contest in which the candidates in both parties have intermittently criticized the once-popular incumbent.", "byline": "JONATHAN MARTIN", "description": "\u201cThis is not my time,\u201d said the governor of Louisiana, who had never risen high enough in the polls to appear in the prime-time debates.", "title": "Bobby Jindal Quits Republican Presidential Race", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/us/politics/bobb-jindal-presidential-race.html", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["Bobby Jindal", "Donald Trump", "Donald J.
