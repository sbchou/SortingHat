Once sure-footed and decisive in expressing his view of the most important issue facing the country, income inequality, Sanders now appears to be holding back, hesitant to put meat on the bones of his big-picture ideas.\n\n\n\n            By \nGabriel Debenedetti\n\nThe socialism speech \u2013 billed by his campaign as a major address where Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist, would finally explain his definition of a politically loaded term that is deeply personal to him \u2013 provides perhaps the most concrete example.\nSanders first told reporters that he was planning to deliver a \u201cmajor speech\u201d outlining his political philosophy in October. \u201cI think we have some explaining to do,\u201d he said, admitting the tag of Democratic socialism wrongly makes some people \u201cvery, very nervous.\u201d\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re probably going to do to begin with is hold a major speech in the not-too-distant future, to define exactly what I mean by Democratic socialist,\u201d Sanders said during a campaign stop in Iowa. \u201cTo me, Democratic socialism means democracy. It means creating a government that represents all of us, not just the wealthiest people in the country.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s been postponed indefinitely because Sanders has not yet finished writing the high-risk speech, or agreed that he is ready to deliver it. The delay highlights another issue facing the Sanders camp \u2013 an apparent disconnect between the candidate and his staffers, who say they are pushing the senator to give his speech sooner rather than later.\n\u201cI personally think we\u2019re ready, he\u2019s just got to agree we\u2019re ready,\u201d said senior strategist Tad Devine. \u201cIt\u2019s very much on the horizon, it\u2019s just a question of timing. He wants to finish the speech first.\u201d\nSanders still likes to write all of his speeches himself \u2013 even when an aide offers a draft, he will typically rework the specific language. The mere prospect of the speech drew comparisons to other Democratic presidential candidates who confronted sensitive questions about faith or belief \u2013 putting it in line with Barack Obama's 2008 speech in Philadelphia about race, and John F. Kennedy's speech about his Roman Catholic faith in 1960. And Sanders camp said it was not backing away.\n\nFourth Estate\n\n            By \nJack Shafer\n\n\u201cWe want to do this,\u201d Devine said. \u201cIt\u2019s not because we don\u2019t want to talk about being a socialist. No way. Just the opposite. This is an opportunity for him to explain how his political philosophy fits squarely into the Democratic Party.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also not clear when Sanders will provide details of how he plans to pay for his health insurance plan. \u201cLike with the socialism speech, there\u2019s no set date,\u201d Devine said of the single-payer program, as well as the related tax policy details. \u201cI would admit there\u2019s delay. I would attribute that to a desire for it to be a fully costed analysis. We\u2019re not trying to be evasive. He\u2019s trying to be serious.\u201d\nDuring the second Democratic debate Saturday night, Sanders said he was not ready to say how much he would raise the country\u2019s top marginal income tax rate. \u201cWe haven\u2019t come up with an exact number yet,\u201d he told CBS news correspondent Nancy Cordes. \u201cBut it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent.\u201d\nHe wiggled out of providing specificity with humor. \u201cI\u2019m not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,\u201d he joked, landing his first applause line of the night.\nIn the past, Sanders has introduced single-payer legislation in Congress that included a 2.2 percent income tax across the board, as well as a 6.7 percent payroll tax for employers. While payroll taxes are split between the employer and the employee, economists and the Congressional Budget Office have said that most of those fees are carried by workers in the form of lower wages. Sensing opportunity, the Clinton camp went on offense against Sanders on Tuesday, hoping to cast an unflattering light on him for supporting legislation that would raise taxes on the middle class, while Clinton has promised that none of her proposals involve a middle class tax hike.\n\"Bernie Sanders has called for a roughly 9-percent tax hike on middle-class families just to cover his health care plan,\" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said, referring to his 2013 single-payer legislation, \"and simple math dictates he'll need to tax workers even more to pay for the rest of his at least $18-20 trillion agenda.\"\n\nWhite House \n\n            By \nSarah Wheaton\n\nIn an interview, Sanders\u2019 campaign appeared to be backing away from the senator's own previous bills, aware that any possible tax hike that could be a deal breaker for middle class voters. Devine said \u201cwhat Bernie wants to do now [in terms of his healthcare proposal] is not exactly like the one proposed in past legislation.\u201d\nAny proposal the campaign will unveil, said Devine, is unlikely to involve tax rate increases on the middle class. \u201cI don\u2019t really see that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see tax rate increases involving anyone other than people making a lot of money.\u201d\nDevine also pushed back against the idea that the Sanders campaign\u2019s delays in rolling out specifics \u2013 on his tax plan or anything else \u2013 reflected a calculated consideration of the political realities of the race and his approach.\n\u201cThat is a not a back of the envelope endeavor,\u201d Devine said of the tax plan. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the Congressional Budget Office itself will be involved, but it\u2019s going to be legit. The think tanks are going to say these are real numbers. This is not somebody\u2019s tax plan that makes no sense in the real world. He\u2019s a serious legislator.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Once sure-footed and decisive in expressing his views, the Vermont senator now appears to be holding back on the details of his big-picture ideas.", "title": "Sanders hesitates on socialism speech", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/bernie-sanders-socialism-speech-215965", "topics": ["economy"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Susan Rice", "Kenneth P.
