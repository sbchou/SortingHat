We don't make good decisions if its based on hysteria or an exaggeration of risks,\" Obama said while visiting the Philippines for the APEC economic summit. \"I cannot think of a more potent recruitment tool for ISIL than some of the rhetoric that's been coming out of here during the course of this debate.\"\nStory Continued Below\nIn the wake of the deadly attacks in Paris, more than half of U.S. governors, most of them Republican, have said they don't want refugees resettled in their states. House Republican leaders also are looking at legislation designed to stop the Obama administration from resettling up to 10,000 Syrian refugees next year. Several GOP presidential contenders have also slammed the idea of letting Syrians in, while some have suggested only letting in those who are Christian.\nObama earlier this week has expressed anger over the idea of discriminating based on religion, and reiterated that sentiment in his latest comments in Manila.\n\"When individuals say we should have a religious test and that only Christians, proven Christians should be admitted, that's offensive,\" he said.\nThe president also noted that many of the same people who have suggested stopping refugees from coming to the United States also claim they themselves are tough enough to stare down Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\n\n            By \nJake Sherman\n\n\"At first they were too scared of the press being too tough on them in the debates,\" Obama said. \"Now they are scared of three-year-old orphans. That doesn't seem so tough to me.\"\nThe president's comments appear to be a reference to remarks by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Monday: \u201cI don\u2019t think orphans under 5 are being, you know, should be admitted into the United States at this point. But you know, they have no family here.
