Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., right, arrives on Capitol Hill in Washington to testify before the committee's hearing: \"Oversight of the United States Department of Justice.\" (AP)\n\n\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch said Tuesday that President Obama\u2019s remarks on the Hillary Clinton email controversy would have \u201cno influence or bearing\u201d on the investigation into the 2016 Democratic presidential front-runner's email use.\nLynch made the remarks at a hearing of the House Committee on the Judiciary after she was asked by Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., about a statement President Obama had made that Clinton\u2019s emails posed no national security risk.\n\u201cThis is not a situation where America\u2019s national security was endangered,\u201d Obama said in an interview with CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in October when asked about the controversy, which has engulfed the former secretary of state.\nGoodlatte pointed to the investigation into the IRS targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status, and said that after Obama had said on Super Bowl Sunday there was \u201cnot a smidgen of corruption\u201d at the IRS, no charges were filed in relation to the scandal.\n\u201cShould we expect that when the FBI finishes its investigation of this matter that no charges will be filed? Does the department allow statements by the president to dictate its investigative practices?\u201d Goodlatte asked Lynch.\n\nLynch responded by saying the department reviews facts and evidence presented to it and applies the law based on those facts and evidence, and takes \u201call the appropriate steps.\u201d\n\u201cWith respect to the president\u2019s comments, they have no influence or bearing on how the department manages these matters, and I would have to refer you to him for a review of those,\u201d Lynch said.\nGoodlatte asked if, in Lynch's view, it was inappropriate \u201cfor the president to once again inject his personal views into an ongoing FBI investigation.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Chairman, I really don\u2019t have a comment on the president\u2019s expression of his views,\u201d Lynch said.\nGoodlatte pressed the matter further, saying Obama is the chief executive officer of the U.S. and noted that everything that operated within in the executive branch -- including the FBI -- is under his purview, and asked Lynch again if it would be better if the president didn\u2019t comment on ongoing investigations.\n\u201cMr. Chairman, I really don\u2019t have a comment on the president\u2019s statements,\u201d Lynch repeated.", "byline": "", "description": "Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Tuesday that President Obama\u2019s remarks on the Hillary Clinton email controversy would have \u201cno influence or bearing\u201d on any investigation into the 2016 Democratic frontrunner's email use.", "title": "Lynch says Obama's comments will have 'no influence' on Clinton email probe", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/xJJ82Kc2Yj0/", "topics": ["ethics"], "people": ["Bob Goodlatte", "Loretta Lynch", "Hillary Clinton"], "orgs": ["FBI", "IRS", "House Committee", "House Judiciary Committee"], "election_confidence": 0.5535039918400877, "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-11-17 17:30:18", "org": "fox", "article_id": "e9f29327a06fc36dbf4bec3e5e42482d", "date_access": "2015-11-17 18:00:35.960888"}
