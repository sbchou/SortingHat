{"body": "Since 1975, the United States has resettled more than three million refugees. They have contributed to the economy and culture of all 50 states.\u00a0As hundreds of thousands of Syrians have fled their war-ravaged homeland, a growing number of American politicians \u2014 including more than half of the nation\u2019s governors\u00a0\u2014 are responding with unspeakable cruelty.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample of reactions:\n\nAsked whether he would allow orphaned refugees, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey said: \u201cI don\u2019t think orphans under five are being, you know, should be admitted into the United States at this point.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump, a leading Republican presidential candidate and the nation\u2019s immigrant basher in chief, predictably joined the keep-em-out camp.\n\nRefugees from Syria are now pouring into our great country. Who knows who they are \u2013 some could be ISIS. Is our president insane?\n\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 17 Nov 15\n\nGov. Greg Abbott of Texas wrote a letter to President Obama saying Texas would not be welcoming to any new Syrian refugees. He warned that \u201copening our door to them irresponsibly exposes our fellow Americans to unspeakable peril.\u201d\n\nMy letter to @POTUS: Texas WILL NOT accept any Syrian refugees in the wake of the Paris attacks. https://t.co/GOALpfBD3X\n\n\u2014 Gov. Greg Abbott (@GovAbbott) 16 Nov 15\n\nGov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, which is home to one of the nation\u2019s largest communities of Muslims, wrote a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry and Jeh Johnson, the Secretary of Homeland Security,\u00a0urging a \u201cfull review\u201d of the screening process for refugees.\n\nHere is the letter that I sent to Secretary John Kerry and Secretary Jeh Johnson: https://t.co/IcW1OJxrlj https://t.co/kxJYnrXpwh\n\n\u2014 Governor Rick Snyder (@onetoughnerd) 16 Nov 15\n\nEven though governors have no control over refugee admission policy, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana signed an executive order seeking to keep Syrian refugees out of his state.\n\nMy letter to @POTUS: In light of Paris terrorist attacks, time to pause process of refugees coming to the US https://t.co/v2K7wuigX0\n\n\u2014 Gov. Bobby Jindal (@BobbyJindal) 14 Nov 15\n\nIt is heartening that some governors, including Jay Inslee of Washington, took the opposite tack, saying their states would continue to welcome people fleeing war.\n\nWA continues to welcome those seeking refuge from persecution, no matter where they come from or their religion https://t.co/kT7dlJ4WJZ 3/3\n\n\u2014 Governor Jay Inslee (@GovInslee) 16 Nov 15", "byline": "ERNESTO LONDO\u00d1O", "description": "As hundreds of thousands flee Syria, a growing number of American politicians are responding with unspeakable cruelty.", "title": "Taking Note: The Vile Politics of the Syrian Refugee Crisis", "url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/17/the-vile-politics-of-the-syrian-refugee-crisis/", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["John Kerry", "Jay Inslee", "Chris Christie", "Jeh Johnson", "Donald Trump", "Rick Snyder", "Donald J.
