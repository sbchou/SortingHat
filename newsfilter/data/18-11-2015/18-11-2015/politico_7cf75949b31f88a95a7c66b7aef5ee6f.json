And we pray for the recovery of all those who were injured, many of them seriously.\"\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cIn my view, now is the time for developing a serious and effective approach to destroy ISIS. Now is not the time for taking cheap political advantage of this tragedy. Now is the time \u2013 as President Obama is trying to do \u2013 to unite the world in an organized campaign against ISIS that will eliminate the stain of ISIS from this world,\u201d Sanders said. \nThe United States must not turn its backs on refugees fleeing violence from places like Syria or Afghanistan, he said, on the same day that governors of more than two dozen states said that they would try to stop the flow of immigrants from Syria out of concerns stemming from the fact that one of the terrorists in Friday's deadly attacks in France came from Syria.\n\"What terrorism is about is trying to instill terror and fear into the hearts of people. And we will not let that happen. We will not be terrorized or live in fear. During these difficult times, we will not succumb to Islamophobia,\" Sanders declared. \"We will not turn our backs on the refugees who are fleeing Syria and Afghanistan. We will do what we do best and that is be Americans \u2013 fighting racism, fighting xenophobia, fighting fear.\u201d\nHis top rival, Hillary Clinton, has remained silent this week on what to do about the refugees seeking asylum.\nDuring last Saturday's debate, the former secretary of state explained that screening refugees for potential terrorists should be \"the number one requirement.\" Clinton also reiterated her desire to increase the number of refugees allowed in to 65,000.\n\"I also said that we should increase numbers of refugees,\" she said. \"The administration originally said 10 [thousand]. I said we should go to 65 [thousand], but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes. I do not want us to in any way inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.\"\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Sanders: We will not turn our backs on Syrian refugees", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/bernie-sanders-syria-refugees-215967", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Susan Rice", "Kenneth P.
