Reporters Allie Jones and Sam Biddle will head out on the campaign trail; Ashley Feinberg will monitor the \"hilarious lunatic fringes and the right and left,\" while Tom Scocca and Pareene will get regular columns.\n\"Gawker won\u2019t just do horse-race coverage, of course\u2014it will take a Daily Show approach to covering the ever-intensifying culture wars, documenting, satirizing, and reporting on the ways that political disputes are refracted in every aspect of our popular culture,\" Cook wrote. \"Gawker\u2019s biggest stories have always had a political component, from Toronto\u2019s crack-smoking mayor to Roger Ailes\u2019 paranoia and power to Josh Duggar\u2019s rank hypocrisy. Pareene is doubling down on that tradition.\"\nIt's a coming home of sorts for Pareene, who first started at Gawker's Wonkette, the D.C. media and politics gossip site which the company subsequently sold in 2008\nThe move will also result in layoffs at the company, though the same number of jobs will be created, according to the New York Times which first broke the news.\nIn a separate memo to staff, Gawker founder and CEO Nick Denton said politics have provided \"the scene for some of Gawker's most recognized\" stories, including those about former Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, Fox News, Hillary Clinton's email practices and Bill Clinton's travels with a convicted pedophile. \nAlex Pareene\u2019s Gawker will ride the circus of the 2016 campaign cycle, seizing the opportunity to re-orient its editorial scope on political news, commentary and satire.\n\"Is there any doubt that the 2016 US presidential election campaign, a contest between reality-defying fabulists and the last representatives of two exhausted political dynasties, will provide rich new opportunities for sensation and satire?\" Cook wrote. \"I can appreciate the wonky contrarianism of Ezra Klein\u2019s Vox.com and high-metabolism micronews from Ben Smith\u2019s Buzzfeed Politics. But, more than any other facet of the American system, the politico-media blob begs puncturing by some sharp Gawker wit and probing by Gawker\u2019s inquisitive journalists.\"\nDeveloping....\nHadas Gold is a reporter at\u00a0Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Gawker Media plans to shift the focus of its flagship site Gawker.com to politics, editors at the company announced in memos to staff on Tuesday.", "title": "Gawker refocusing aim to politics", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2015/11/gawker-refocusing-aim-to-politics-215987", "topics": ["economy"], "people": ["Roger Ailes", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Ben Smith", "Josh Duggar", "Kenneth P.
