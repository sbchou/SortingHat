There's more to the story.\n\n            By \nDarren Samuelsohn\n\n11/17/15 05:14 AM EST\nAt least four times in the past year, Al Gore has passed up opportunities to endorse Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, brushing off questions from People magazine and other media outlets with the admonition that it\u2019s still too early in the Democratic primary process for him to take sides. On Monday, an aide to the former vice president told POLITICO he\u2019ll stay on the sidelines until his party has selected its nominee.\nGore\u2019s reticence, his friends and allies say, is in part to maximize his own leverage on fighting climate change. But his repeated demurrals also reflect a complicated relationship with his former boss\u2019s wife that dates back more than two decades. While Gore and Hillary Clinton may not be enemies, they\u2019re not exactly close friends, either.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cThey have a lot of history. More than the average bear,\u201d said one Democratic source close to Gore.\nThe Hillary Clinton-Gore rivalry started when the two baby boomer policy wonks arrived in the White House in 1993. Gore got the new administration\u2019s environmental and technology portfolios. Bill Clinton raised eyebrows by assigning his wife what would become an ill-fated attempt to pass comprehensive health-care reform legislation.\n\u201cUsually you give your vice president something of that level. You don\u2019t give it to the first lady,\u201d recalled a former Clinton White House staffer. \u201cPeople forget that sort of started the relationship on a downward spiral early on.\u201d\nWhile Gore and Bill Clinton maintained a strong relationship throughout the president\u2019s first term, things took a turn in the other direction after the Monica Lewinsky scandal emerged in 1998. Gore insisted on keeping the president away from his own White House bid in 2000. \u201cI understand the disappointment and anger that you feel toward President Clinton, and I felt it myself,\u201d he told New Hampshire voters during his primary campaign. The political headwinds were tough enough, the vice president reasoned, and they got only more complicated when Hillary Clinton pursued the next step of her own career.\n\nWhite House \n\n            By \nSarah Wheaton\n\n\u201cHer Senate race complicated things,\u201d another former White House aide said. \u201cIt took up a lot of the political oxygen and party money. It put the spotlight on the Clintons when it wasn\u2019t focused on his race. It didn\u2019t help.\u201d\nBill Clinton reportedly reconciled with Gore in the days after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks \u2014 bonding over a late-night chat at the former president\u2019s New York home, according to The New York Times. But sources close to the Democratic heavyweights explain that the relationship between Gore and Hillary Clinton had never even gotten to a place where it could be smoothed over.\n\u201cTheir worlds haven\u2019t really crossed,\u201d said a fourth source, this one also a former Clinton White House aide. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been that much connection.\u201d\nGore has several reasons for keeping out of the 2016 maelstrom. When he does interviews, and inevitably questions get asked about his own never-fulfilled presidential ambitions, the response typically comes with a disclaimer that he\u2019s a \u201crecovering politician\u201d driven by an almost obsessive desire to save the planet.\n\"It's still too early, in my opinion, to endorse a candidate or pick a candidate,\" Gore told People magazine in an interview published last week ahead of a planned 24-hour webcast from Paris to raise awareness about climate change.\nIn an email Monday to POLITICO, a Gore spokesperson went a step further, saying the former vice president wouldn\u2019t be endorsing in the primary at all. \u201c[Gore] has great respect for and long-standing relationships with all of the candidates running for the Democratic nomination for president,\u201d this person said. \u201cHe appreciates the emphasis each of the candidates has placed on advocating for solutions to the climate crisis and will do all that he can to ensure that climate change remains a priority throughout this debate. However, he has no plans to endorse a candidate in the Democratic primary.\u201d\nClose associates also note that Gore has burned bridges before when he has spoken up about other Democrats running for the White House. In 2004, he sat out a rematch with President George W. Bush and instead gave his endorsement to the surging anti-war candidacy of Howard Dean, snubbing his former Senate colleague and fellow 1985 freshman classmate John Kerry. Not only did Dean\u2019s bid fade in the Iowa cornfields, Gore also left some feelings hurt because he didn\u2019t back his own 2000 vice presidential running mate, Sen. Joe Lieberman, either.\n\n2016\n\n            By \nEli Stokols\n\nDuring the next presidential primary cycle, which featured then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, an upstart Illinois senator named Barack Obama and son-of-a-mill-worker John Edwards, Gore opted to keep his power dry. Multiple sources tell POLITICO the former vice president got a call from Sen. Ted Kennedy urging him to endorse Obama. But Gore resisted, and he didn\u2019t go public for the future president until more than a week after Clinton had conceded.\nGore has since specifically praised Clinton without going all in on an endorsement. Last fall, he told Bloomberg TV that the former secretary of state was \u201cextremely capable\u201d but insisted it was too soon to be so focused on the Democratic horse race. In an early 2014 interview with POLITICO Magazine at his Nashville office, published a full year before Clinton formally announced she was running for president, Gore did give a tepid sign of where his support could ultimately go.\n\u201cI\u2019m of course fully aware of the general expectation that she will run and that she\u2019ll get the nomination. And if that happens, I certainly hope that she wins and I certainly hope that if she wins she\u2019ll be an effective advocate on climate,\u201d he said.\nGore recalled in the interview that Hillary Clinton had called him in 2007 before she gave a major energy and climate change speech \u201casking for advice on what the most forward leaning positions she could take would be.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I really appreciated that,\u201d Gore added. \u201cI don\u2019t have any doubt that her heart is in the right place on the issue and that she would like to be an agent for positive change on the issue.\u201d\nIn that November 2007 speech, given in Iowa, Clinton did name-check Gore three times. She congratulated the former vice president for recently winning the Nobel Peace Prize, and she pitched one of his ideas: a new \u201cConnie Mae\u201d program that would help people get loans to pay for more energy efficient homes.\nThe Clinton campaign did not respond to a request for comment, and several former Gore aides shrugged off questions about the Hillary Clinton-Gore relationship and the former vice president\u2019s silence on making an official endorsement. Clinton, who had faced criticism from greens for years of dithering over the Keystone XL pipeline, has since picked up the backing of the League of Conservation Voters. Gore, with his own intense following on climate issues, could help buttress Clinton\u2019s left flank as she fends off a primary challenge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley. But the Gore spokeswoman said an endorsement would need to wait until after the Democratic primaries are over and the party\u2019s nominee is selected.\n\u201cShe\u2019s running for president in her own right and he\u2019s advocating on an issue that\u2019s the most important issue to him. Inevitably that\u2019s where these two will interact again on this campaign,\u201d said Michael Feldman, Gore\u2019s former traveling chief of staff from his 2000 White House run.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in it for Al to endorse anyone at this point?\u201d added Greg Simon, Gore\u2019s former chief domestic policy adviser. \u201cAt this stage of the game if he wanted to go out and campaign for somebody he\u2019d have gone out and campaigned for himself, not for Bernie or Hillary.\u201d\n\n\n\n            By \nDaniel Strauss\n\nOther sources explained that Gore\u2019s restraint \u2014 a recent Associated Press count of Democratic superdelegates in Tennessee found that he indeed remains uncommitted \u2014 also needed to be seen in the context of that longer-term, and oh-so complicated relationship with the Clintons. Sure, Gore owes President Clinton for making him a one-of-a-kind job offer back in 1992. But Gore\u2019s own efforts to take the next big step in his political career suffered in no small part because of the roller coaster politics associated with the Lewinsky saga and the general drama that has become synonymous since then with anyone running for office named Clinton.\n\u201cSome of the stuff that\u2019s been plaguing the Clinton campaign \u2026 is the stuff he doesn\u2019t like about serving with the Clintons,\u201d said a veteran Democratic operative who worked for Gore. \u201cMy guess is he\u2019ll endorse Hillary Rodham Clinton. But if he were to close his eyes and wish for a leader who he would want to lead the world it\u2019s not where he would land.\u201d\nAs Hillary Clinton suffered through her summer slump, BuzzFeed in mid-August reported on a tiny flicker of interest among Gore supporters for him to mount a 2016 primary challenge. But the former vice president\u2019s spokeswoman, Betsy McManus, quickly doused any speculation a campaign was coming. \u201cThere\u2019s no truth to it,\u201d she told POLITICO the next day. \u201cHe\u2019s laser-focused on solving the climate crisis.\u201d\nIndeed, Gore\u2019s allies repeatedly dismissed questions that the former vice president\u2019s endorsement silence had anything to do with any designs of his own on running for president. He\u2019s built no institutional organization for a White House campaign or given any public statements suggesting interest. On top of that, the same deadlines and other barriers that forced Joe Biden to take a pass have also come and gone for Gore. About the only scenario anyone close to the former vice president would entertain \u2014 and even here it\u2019s preceded by laughs, dismissals and catastrophic caveats \u2014 involves an epic collapse on Clinton\u2019s part followed by the Democratic establishment scrambling at the last minute for an experienced replacement. \nWith a bit of alternative reality yearning in the voice, one of Gore\u2019s former aides posited: \u201cThe guy who\u2019s been the victim of Clinton scandals over the years \u2014 maybe it is his turn to be a beneficiary.\u201d\n\nDarren Samuelsohn is a senior policy reporter for Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "People close to the former vice president say it's not just to preserve his leverage on climate change.
