{"body": "Louisiana Gov. \nBobby Jindal\n, who campaigned as an unstinting champion of social conservatives but found himself crowded out by other more forceful, dynamic personalities, on Tuesday abruptly ended his bid for the Republican presidential nomination.\nJindal, 44, had staked out far-right territory -- with a particular focus on social conservatives -- but never gained traction during a primary that\u2019s been dominated by outsiders with similar or more conservative views, particularly \nDonald Trump\n and \nBen Carson\n.\nJindal noted that the policy papers his campaign had unveiled in recent months, on issues such as energy and education, hadn't\u00a0resonated with voters.\n\u201cDuring this crazy, unpredictable election season, clearly there just wasn\u2019t a lot of interest in those policy papers,\u201d he said Tuesday in an announcement on Fox News.\nJindal consistently drew support in polls in the low single digits and never made it to the main stage in any of the Republican debates. His exit from the crowded \nGOP\n primary comes after Wisconsin Gov. \nScott Walker\n and former Texas Gov. \nRick Perry\n also departed the race.\n\u201cThe Republican Party has to lay out the pathway for why we are the party for opportunity and growth,\u201d Jindal said Tuesday.\nEarlier this week, a blow to Jindal\u2019s campaign came when Rep. \nSteve King\n (R-Iowa), a firebrand among \ntea party\n conservatives, threw his support behind Sen. \nTed Cruz\n of Texas. King had been heavily courted by the Louisiana governor for his endorsement.\nJindal spent the majority of his time campaigning in Iowa --\u00a0by some tallies, more than any other GOP candidate -- where caucusgoers will kick off voting in the 2016 election cycle in February.\nCraig Robinson\n, former political director of the Iowa Republican Party, said that while grass-roots social conservatives in Iowa supported Jindal's\u00a0message, he\u00a0just lacked the appeal of Cruz.\nCruz \u201cjust brought more juice and generated a lot more enthusiasm,\u201d Robinson said.\nDennis Goldford, a longtime student of the Iowa caucuses who teaches political science at Des Moines' \nDrake University\n, noted the large amount of time Jindal spent in Iowa, dating back to last year.\n\u201cJindal would always get a good response from audiences, but that enthusiastic support never showed up in his poll numbers,\u201d Goldford said.\nMoreover, Goldford noted that Jindal was vying for the social conservative vote along with Cruz, Carson and Mike Huckabee, winner of 2008 caucus. Collectively, those candidates took \u201call the oxygen out of the room.\u201d\nYet Jindals\u2019 campaign on Tuesday did not highlight other candidates as a reason for his exit.\nCurt Anderson, a chief strategist to Jindal, said Tuesday that his lack of fundraising -- which hovered near a paltry $1.1 million -- was among the deciding factors for his exit from the race.\n\u201cWe were far behind,\u201d Anderson said. \"Say what you want, it takes money to win elections.\"\nBarabak reported from Des Moines and Lee from Los Angeles.\nFollow \n@kurtisalee\n\u00a0and \n@markzbarabak\n\u00a0for political news.\nALSO\nWhy the LAFD is still largely white and male despite diversity efforts\nFormer Assembly leader urges dialogue, caution at California colleges\nLike a 'stab in your brain' -- Complaints from Bay Area residents in noisy flight path spike 2,706%", "byline": "", "description": "<p>Louisiana Gov.
