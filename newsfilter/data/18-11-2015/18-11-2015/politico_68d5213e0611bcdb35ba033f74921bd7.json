(AP)\n\n            By \nJosh Gerstein\n\n11/17/15 11:29 AM EST\nPresident Barack Obama's public comments appearing to prejudge the outcome of Justice Department investigations don't affect the decisions in those inquiries, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Tuesday.\nIn her first appearance before the House Judiciary Committee since taking office in April, Lynch was questioned by panel chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) about remarks Obama made last year declaring there was \"not even a smidgen of corruption\" in the IRS's handling of applications from nonprofit groups and a statement the president made last month that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email set-up posed no national security problem.\n\"With respect to the president's comments, they have no influence or bearing on how the department manages these matters,\" Lynch said.\nGoodlatte tried a couple of times to get Lynch to comment on whether it was unwise for Obama to make such comments while an investigation was pending, but she declined to do so. \n\"I really don\u2019t have a comment on the president\u2019s expression of his view,\" Lynch said.\nThe Justice Department announced last month that no criminal charges would be brought in connection with the controversy over the IRS's targeting of nonprofit groups that were chiefly conservative in their outlook.\nThe FBI is conducting an ongoing inquiry into possible mishandling of classified information in connection with Clinton's use of a private email account during her four years as secretary of state. Some FBI agents complained that Obama's comments had the potential to undercut the agency's work.\nLater in the hearing, Lynch said she was unaware of any effort by the White House to interfere with the email investigation, but she declined to discuss where the probe stands or how long it is likely to take. \"I\u2019m not able to comment on the status of that matter,\" she said.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "&quot;I really don\u2019t have a comment on the president\u2019s expression of his view,&quot; Loretta Lynch said", "title": "Lynch: Obama remarks don&apos;t affect probes", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2015/11/lynch-obama-remarks-dont-affect-probes-215973", "topics": ["economy", "surveillance/privacy"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Susan Rice", "Kenneth P.
