Some Republicans in Congress are threatening a government shutdown over the issue in light of plans by the Obama administration to resettle 10,000 Syrians next year.\nIn a conference call with reporters Tuesday, senior administration officials reiterated that the federal government controls the refugee resettlement program, but they also acknowledged funding from Congress is critical to maintaining it and that local support is key to helping refugees integrate wherever they land.\n\"We don\u2019t want to send refugees anywhere where they would not be welcomed,\" one of the officials said, adding later: \"The thing I most fear about this current discussion going on in the United States is that we will lose the bipartisan support ... that (this program) has enjoyed for decades. This is a very precious thing. In the current day and age, it\u2019s been a rare thing.\" \nThe officials, all of whom spoke on condition they not be identified by name, said they will meet with lawmakers this week and also hold calls with governors and mayors to correct \"misimpressions\" about the refugee program. On Tuesday, for instance, GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has erroneously claimed some 250,000 Syrian refugees are headed for the country, tweeted, \"Refugees from Syria are now pouring into our great country. Who knows who they are \u2014 some could be ISIS. Is our president insane?\"\nSince the Syrian conflict erupted in 2011, the United States has admitted roughly 1,800 Syrian refugees, a tiny fraction of 4 million Syrians who have fled their country and registered as refugees with the United Nations. According to the U.N. and various aid agencies, another 7 million Syrians are displaced inside the Arab country, where they face dangers from both the Syrian government of Bashar Assad and groups such as the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, which is believed responsible for the Paris attacks. \n\n\n\n            By \nJake Sherman\n\nSyria's pre-war population was 23 million people, and 250,000 people have died since the conflict began there. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians -- seeing no end to the war and despairing of conditions in refugee camps -- have in recent months headed to Europe, making an often-dangerous land and sea journey. But others are still in camps or otherwise living in countries such as Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan, where their rights and mobility face restrictions.\nThousands of Syrians have already applied for resettlement, so most of the 10,000 Syrians that the Obama administration hopes to admit next year are likely going through security screening. Republican presidential candidates and others are now questioning whether those security procedures are rigorous enough, noting that it only takes one or a handful of people to carry out a terrorist attack. \n\"The problem is we can\u2019t background check them,\" Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a top GOP presidential contender, said Sunday. \"You can\u2019t pick up the phone and call Syria.\"\nAccording to the administration officials, the refugee vetting process takes an average of 18-24 months, and for Syrians it often takes longer because they face additional scrutiny. The refugees are first screened through the United Nations, which has its own vetting procedures. If they are referred to the United States for possible admission, they are then screened through a whole new process. \nThat involves checking their biographic and biometric data, as well as lengthy interviews and background checks involving multiple federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies. Some of the procedures involved are classified.\nOne way the officials screening the refugees can verify their stories is to double check the events they claim happened to them with intelligence and other known data about what was happening in Syria at the time. So if a Syrian says their home in particular neighborhood was bombed on a particular date, it's likely the defense department or other agencies can check to see if there was a bombing reported in the area at that time.\n\"Each element of the process is not the totality of the process,\" one of the officials said. \"All these things have to be synthesized and taken in the aggregate to make a decision.\"\n\n\n\n            By \nGabriel Debenedetti\n\nThe admission rate so far is just over 50 percent; the rest are either rejected or have their cases still pending, one of the officials said. Of the Syrians admitted, half are children and a quarter are adults over 60, the officials said. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for a religious breakdown, but roughly 10 percent of Syrians as a whole are Christian.\nThere are nine non-profit groups, several of them faith-based, that work with the federal government to help resettle the refugees in communities across the United States. Where a refugee is sent can depend on a range of factors, such as whether they have relatives there who can support them. If a child is a burn victim \u2014 which would not be unusual among Syrians fleeing the brutal civil war \u2014 they would likely be placed in a community with relevant medical facilities.\nTraditionally, the U.S. refugee program has had strong bipartisan support, and the numbers of Syrians is a trickle compared to the numbers of refugees admitted from other conflicts. For instance, the United States took in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Vietnam. \nOverall, the U.S. takes in 70,000 refugees a year, a number the administration planned to raise to 85,000 next year, and 100,000 the following year. Based on statistics released by the State Department, most the additional 15,000 planned for next year would not come from the Middle East. One of the administration officials on Tuesday said the U.S. has the capacity to absorb significantly more refugees than it does now, but noted that financial support makes all the difference. \n\"The program is absolutely dependent on funding from Congress,\" the official said. \"As we grow it we will require more assistance from Congress.\"\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "\"We don\u2019t want to send refugees anywhere where they would not be welcomed,\" one official said.", "title": "Obama Administration defends Syrian refugee program", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/obama-syria-refugee-program-215982", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Sara Solovitch", "Susan Rice", "Kenneth P.
