But the Rubio campaign believes this is its opening to expose Cruz as being in step with Democrats on an issue that will drive the next three months of the campaign.\nLate Tuesday afternoon, Cruz fired back and said that Rubio is trying to distract from his record of working on the Senate\u2019s comprehensive immigration bill, the subject of a protracted dispute between the two campaigns over the past week.\n\u201cIt is not surprising that Marco\u2019s campaign wants to change the topic from Marco\u2019s partnership with President Obama to push a massive amnesty program,\u201d Cruz said with a theatrical chuckle. \u201cI understand politically why they want to change the topic from that, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be successful.\u201d\nRubio and his team went all in on Tuesday painting Cruz as weak on national security, an attack line that seizes on growing unease in the United States following the Paris attacks. In brief remarks following a closed Intelligence Committee briefing on the Paris attacks, Rubio stood by his comments the night before that Cruz and a number of other GOP senators had voted to \"weaken\" national security and intelligence gathering.\n\u201cIt eventually undermines our ability to collect information and to monitor those who seek to harm the United States,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nCongress\n\n            By \nJake Sherman\n             and \nSeung Min Kim\n\nAsked why he singled out Cruz among the 67 senators that ultimately voted for the reforms, Rubio replied: \u201cWe have a race for commander-in-chief and the most important obligation of a president is to keep our country safe.\u201d\nStill, Rubio\u2019s comments made life awkward for several of his surrogates who supported the USA Freedom Act, which made reforms to the surveillance dragnet that the Florida senator opposed. Rubio has been endorsed by a trio of his colleagues in the chamber, including Freedom Act supporting Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Steve Daines of Montana, who backed the bill.\nIn interviews, Gardner and Daines shrugged off Rubio\u2019s comments. Gardner said \u201cpeople have different opinions\u201d and then knocked Obama\u2019s leadership on Syria; Daines said he backed the legislation because of its privacy protections. \n\u201cBut I think Marco Rubio would be a great commander and chief,\u201d Daines added.\nMeanwhile, Cruz\u2019s team quickly pointed out that influential senators from early-voting states supported the USA Freedom Act, suggesting that Rubio was alienating potential supporters in Congress by criticizing their efforts to rein in the bulk data collection programs.\nBut other lawmakers, including Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), chafed at Rubio\u2019s attacks on Cruz and the surveillance bill. \n\u201cIf the presidential candidates want to talk against your personal liberties, let them do so to their own demise as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d said Heller, a supporter of Jeb Bush.\n\n2016\n\n            By \nBen Schreckinger\n\nFor the hard-charging Cruz, foreign policy is an area of relative moderation. He likes to say that there are two poles in the party, with Rand Paul at one end and Rubio and John McCain at the other.\nTo Rubio, the issue is more black and white: you're either with Paul or you\u2019re with Rubio. On Tuesday, Rubio\u2019s campaign aides circulated Cruz\u2019s equivocal reactions to the disclosures of national security programs by Edward Snowden, hoping to further paint Cruz as out of step within the GOP. \nCruz\u2019s campaign deemed the attacks as a distraction from Rubio\u2019s vulnerability on immigration, and an adviser said \u201cour campaign won't be taking the bait.\"\nStill, there was evidence among senior senators that Rubio\u2019s aggressive posture on national security and foreign policy is working.\n\u201cPeople who have extensive experience on national security issues and intelligence issues right now are going to have an advantage,\u201d said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.). \u201cMarco has sort of staked out for some time pretty strong positions on those issues and I think he\u2019s well positioned to make the arguments.\u201d\nAdded Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.): \u201cMarco is right on it, and he\u2019s got the intelligence to be right on it.\"\nRubio and Cruz have warily eyed one another on national security for years. They voted together for a filibuster of Chuck Hagel\u2019s nomination as defense secretary in 2013, but have experienced high-profile breaks as well: When Paul forced a vote on cutting aid to Egypt in 2013, Rubio spoke against it, while Cruz sided with Paul.\nPaul and Cruz were the only Republicans to oppose a compromise national defense policy bill last month, another area in Cruz\u2019s record that Rubio\u2019s team believe is ripe for inspection. And senior Republicans are still annoyed at those votes.\n\u201cI have a number of differences with Sen. Cruz. And I have some with Senator Rubio. But it was disturbing to me when Sen. Cruz voted against the defense authorization bill,\u201d said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz. \u201cI view that as a slap in the face to the men and women who are serving.\u201d\n\nDefense\n\n            By \nBryan Bender\n\nCruz is best known for insulting McConnell and being among the most conservative senators on practically any topic. But on surveillance reform he joined a bipartisan coalition early on, charting a middle course between Paul, whose views are to the left of much of the GOP, and Rubio, who Cruz believes is too close to McCain\u2019s position.\nIt\u2019s a difficult balance. Cruz is trying to court both Ron Paul voters and more mainstream conservatives. But on Tuesday, he stood by his vote on the surveillance bill and said conservatives across the country are more concerned with privacy issues than Rubio would like to believe.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, conservatives care about the Bill of Rights, care about protecting the privacy of law-abiding citizens and also about protecting our national security,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cAt the end of the day, this issue all comes down to their campaign\u2019s desire to change the subject from Marco\u2019s support for amnesty.\u201d\nMany Republicans bristled during the debate over government surveillance at how the program was portrayed. Senators close to the intelligence community said there had been no abuses. But the idea of extending the bulk data collection with no changes, supported by Rubio, couldn\u2019t even get a majority in the Senate, much less clear the chamber\u2019s 60-vote requirement.\nThe issue turned senators who often vote against anything that smells of compromise into pragmatists; on this issue, Rubio was the hardliner, not Cruz.\n\u201cIt was the only thing we had. Without it, we\u2019d have nothing. It was what you had to do,\u201d said Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). \u201cBut I was highly concerned about the weakening of our intelligence gathering capabilities. I still am.\u201d\n\u201cI have no second thoughts,\u201d added Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), who also backed the bill. \u201cThere is an important equilibrium to be found between weighing privacy and national security.\u201d\nSeung Min Kim contributed to this report. \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The Florida senator sees Cruz as vulnerable and in line with Democrats on what could become a dominant issue.", "title": "Rubio escalates foreign policy feud with Cruz", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/rubio-cruz-foreign-policy-216004", "topics": ["surveillance/privacy"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Ron Paul", "Kenneth P.
