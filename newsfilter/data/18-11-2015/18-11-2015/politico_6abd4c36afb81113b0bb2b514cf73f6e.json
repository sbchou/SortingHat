Matt Salmon, a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the vetting process is far from adequate and I have great concerns about allowing people on our shores without knowing that we are able to find out information about them.\u201d\nThe House is set to vote this week on a bill, drafted by Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), that would strengthen the vetting process for individuals seeking refugee status. It includes a temporary moratorium on refugees from Syria entering the U.S. until the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI can implement those tougher standards.\nThe concern over refugees in the U.S. comes four days after terrorists killed 129 people in a series of attacks in Paris. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has taken credit for those attacks.\n\nDefense\n\n            By \nBryan Bender\n\nHudson said after the briefing that the administration needs to report to Congress on its efforts before GOP lawmakers feel comfortable seeing thousands of Syrian entering the U.S. \nBut Hudson offered a rebuke of Republican presidential candidates, such as Jeb Bush, who had suggested focusing on allowing Christian refugees to enter the country. \nThe Obama administration officials told lawmakers they were attempting to quickly distill information coming in from allies to rigorously vet individual who want refugee status. But Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) said he was \u201cnot satisfied\u201d with how the Homeland Security Department and the FBI screen individuals.\n \u201cThere is no database from Syria and that\u2019s pretty much it,\u201d King said.\nA leading Democrat, however, defended the vetting process, saying the administration had a \u201ccomprehensive answer\u201d to lawmakers' concerns.\n\u201cThe process takes on average 18 months to two years. There are background checks and bio-metric identifiers,\u201d California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s a very laborious process. My sense is that members want to make sure their constituents are safe \u2026 but at the same time we don\u2019t want to be deterred from helping those in need.\u201d\nRepublicans are hoping that at least some of the 188 House Democrats will back the Hudson bill when it comes to the House floor for a vote this week.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Republicans not satisfied after administration briefing on Syria", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/republicans-syria-obama-216006", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kenneth P.
