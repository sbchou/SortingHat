The survey was conducted earlier this month, prior to the terrorist attacks in France last week, and was supplemented by on-the-ground reporting in Iowa, which will cast the first votes in the presidential nominating process next February.\nStory Continued Below\nOffered identical lists of issues \u2014 economic inequality, economic growth, deficit reduction, taxes and unemployment \u2014 insiders differed dramatically by party. The overwhelming majority of Democrats, 81 percent, said inequality was the most important economic issue in their party's nominating contest, while nearly 65 percent of Republicans picked economic growth as the most important.\n\u201cDemocratic base voters see the country in stark terms: the small group at the top who've got it all, and everyone else struggling to make it in a country that won't even guarantee them modest sick time or family leave,\u201d said a Nevada Democrat, who, like all of the Caucus insiders, responded anonymously.\nMost Republicans, meanwhile, said growing the economy overall was more important than the other priorities listed. None of the 60 GOP insiders surveyed chose economic inequality as the most important issue. Deficit reduction was the only other priority for Republicans to register significantly; just under a quarter of GOP insiders said the national debt was most important.\nHere in the first-in-the-nation caucus state, those arguments are resonating acutely with potential caucusgoers in both parties. Conditions are improving nationwide \u2014 even more rapidly in Iowa \u2014 but serious problems persist.\nUnemployment has recovered close to historical norms nationally. And it\u2019s down to just 3.8 percent in Iowa, where the financial services and agricultural technology industries are booming, especially around Des Moines. \nDean Bowers, a farmer for decades before building a home-repair business, told POLITICO outside the Drake Diner on a windy day last week that he may eventually support one of the GOP candidates. But the 88-year-old balks at the way Republicans have talked about the economy during their highly watched debates.\n\u201cThey get up there and say, \u2018Oh, everything is so awful. America is falling apart.\u2019 And it makes me mad, because it just isn\u2019t true,\" said Bowers. \"It's not true here. There\u2019s plenty of work.\u201d \nBut growth remains slow both in Iowa and nationwide. Wages are sluggish, and the labor force participation rate is at its lowest level in nearly 40 years. The country faces an $18-trillion debt, and entitlement programs whose long-term financing is in peril. Many Americans think the nation is on the wrong track and that the deck is stacked for powerful interests in Washington and corporate America.\nThose feelings provide a ripe climate for Republican outsiders, who are dominating here in Iowa over more traditional candidates. They have also driven the rise of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has challenged Hillary Clinton\u2019s front-runner status in the Democratic race. \nThe frustrations were on clear display in Fort Dodge last Thursday, when thousands turned out for what turned into one of real estate billionaire Donald Trump\u2019s most epic rants of the 2016 campaign \u2014 in which he railed against illegal immigrants and \u201canchor babies,\u201d and likened rival Ben Carson to a child molester. \nAttendees at the event said Trump\u2019s appeal is rooted in his outsider status, business record and pledge to put America back on the right track. \n\u201cHe wants to bring jobs back here, and he knows how to do it,\u201d said Lindie Phipps, a self-described \u201cpoor dirt farmer\u201d from Boxholm, population 200. \u201cHe has got the confidence and the strength do it, and I respect that.\u201d\nAsked to pick which candidate would best handle the economy, fewer than 10 percent of POLITICO Caucus insiders chose Trump. But those who did valued his business experience \u2014 and expressed doubts that any other candidate could match it.\n\"Are you kidding with this question?\" an Iowa GOP Trump supporter asked. \"Only one answer.\"\nThe three candidates who scored highest on the question of handling the economy: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Bush was praised by one Iowa Republican for his emphasis on the need for growth.\n\u201cChina's new growth forecast is 6.5 percent,\u201d said the Iowa Republican. \u201cThe U.S. would crave achieving half that number. [Jeb] Bush and others who focus on growth have the right policy and political focus.\u201d\nMore than three-fourths of Democratic insiders, meanwhile, said Clinton would do the best job handling the economy \u2014 even as they acknowledge Sanders has driven the conversation on economic issues.\n\u201cThis is the crux of the Sanders' campaign, which has galvanized his base of support,\u201d said a Nevada Democrat. \u201cEven Clinton \u2013 who hails from an upper-middle-class background and is now at the top of the economic pyramid \u2013 has had to make economic inequality a point of attack against Republicans. The issue rings hollow coming from her, but Sanders spits the hot fire when he gets going on inequality, and his genuine passion fuels his supporters.\u201d\nOne reason for insiders\u2019 differing prescriptions for the U.S. economy? Disparate views on the state of the economy, including their own financial situation \u2013 a finding that mirrors public polling that shows Americans who identify as Democrats are significantly more likely to say they are doing better under President Barack Obama than Republicans.\nIn the POLITICO Caucus survey, 80 percent of Democratic insiders said they were better off now than when Obama took office in 2009, but fewer than three-in-10 Republicans agreed. Nearly half of GOP insiders said they were worse off, compared to fewer than 5 percent of Democrats.\nIt\u2019s a divide that is driving the parallel races for the two parties\u2019 respective nominations: Democrats are looking for a candidate to continue the economic recovery but make it more equitable, and Republicans are urging a more drastic change of course from what they see as a disastrous set of economic policies.\nThat's also true in Iowa, which is doing better than the rest of the nation. The state\u2019s unemployment rate is low, and home prices are rising. A recent USA Today/Wells Fargo poll found that 65 percent of Iowans rate local economic conditions as \u201cgood,\u201d well above the national average. The cost of living is manageable. And Forbes magazine recently named Des Moines the best city in America for young professionals.\n\u201cOur economy, quite frankly, has been booming,\u201d Jay Byers, CEO of the Greater Des Moines Partnership, said in an interview in his office in downtown Des Moines. \u201cWe have the largest concentration of insurance jobs per capita in the entire country. We are the third-largest employment hub for Wells Fargo. And our other world-class cluster is ag-bioscience and agriculture. Monsanto has more jobs in Iowa than they do in Missouri,\u201d where the company is based. \nFacebook and Microsoft are both building $2-billion data centers in Des Moines. Fancy new hotels are going up, and cranes are everywhere. \nBut low commodity prices are hurting the state\u2019s agricultural exports. So is the strong dollar, which hurts both agricultural and manufacturing exports.\nThe uneven economic environment presents political challenges to both parties. Democrats must deal with the overwhelming majority of voters who still view the nation\u2019s economy as moving in the wrong direction despite the longest economic expansion in decades. \nRepublicans have to address the fact that the unemployment rate is down by half since the first year of President Barack Obama\u2019s term and the nation has created 8 million new jobs under his watch, compared to the 1.3 million created under George W. Bush. They also have to shift away from their traditional base of support in corporate America and Wall Street to reflect a populist age in which distrust of big business \u2014 especially the financial industry \u2014 runs deeply through both parties. \n\u201cVoters don't trust people that are in public life,\u201d one Iowa GOP insider said. \u201cDo you want people running this country who are in bed with special interests, or someone who will say what he means and mean what he says?\"\nOn the Democratic side, Clinton has regained some momentum by moving left on Wall Street issues, saying she would break up the biggest banks if she had to. But Clinton may have a problem in Iowa on trade. The state is a major agricultural and manufacturing exporter, and big companies here are mostly in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the giant trade deal with Asia that Clinton recently said she opposes against despite supporting it while she served as secretary of state. \nThat is not likely to cost her a win in the Iowa caucuses, but it could prove damaging in the general election. Iowa is a classic \u201cpurple\u201d state, voting for the winner of the popular vote in every presidential election since 1992. \n\u201cThe TPP has a lot of components that really benefit the agriculture industry in the state, and former Gov. Tom Vilsack has strongly supported the TPP in Iowa for these reasons,\u201d said one Iowa Democratic insider. \u201cHowever, among Democratic caucus attendees, these policies are used to judge whether a candidate is truly progressive \u2014 it's no coincidence that Hillary has now come out against the TPP.\u201d\nThe Republican candidates, meanwhile, will have to toe the line between an Iowa GOP electorate that wants drastic, national change \u2014 but is also proud of how well the state has done compared to the rest of the nation and doesn\u2019t take kindly to people talking it down. \n\u201cWe didn\u2019t take the kind of hit other places did during the recession and we are doing pretty well now,\u201d said Chris Wilde, chief engineer at KCCI, the local CBS affiliate. Broadcasters in particular fare well during caucus seasons, which sees millions of dollars in political ad spending. \nBut Byers of the Greater Des Moines Partnership put the current economic attitude of Iowans in even stronger terms. \u201cIt\u2019s very different right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is swagger out there, there\u2019s pride.\u201d\nThese are the members of the POLITICO Caucus, not all of whom participated in this special survey:\nIowa: Tim Albrecht, Brad Anderson, Rob Barron, Jeff Boeyink, Bonnie Campbell, Dave Caris, Sam Clovis, Sara Craig, Jerry Crawford, John Davis, Steve Deace, John Deeth, Derek Eadon, Ed Failor Jr., Karen Fesler, David Fischer, Doug Gross, Steve Grubbs, Tim Hagle, Bob Haus, Joe Henry, Drew Ivers, Jill June, Lori Jungling, Jeff Kaufmann, Brian Kennedy, Jake Ketzner, David Kochel, Chris Larimer, Chuck Larson, Jill Latham, Jeff Link, Dave Loebsack, Mark Lucas, Liz Mathis, Jan Michelson, Chad Olsen, David Oman, Matt Paul, Marlys Popma, Troy Price, Christopher Rants, Kim Reem, Craig Robinson, Sam Roecker, David Roederer, Nick Ryan, Tamara Scott, Joni Scotter, Karen Slifka, John Smith, AJ Spiker, Norm Sterzenbach, John Stineman, Matt Strawn, Phil Valenziano, Jessica Vanden Berg, Nate Willems, Eric Woolson, Grant Young\nNew Hampshire: Charlie Arlinghaus, Arnie Arnesen, Patrick Arnold, Rich Ashooh, Dean Barker, Juliana Bergeron, D.J.
