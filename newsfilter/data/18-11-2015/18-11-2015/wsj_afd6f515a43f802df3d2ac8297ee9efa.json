{"body": "As of yesterday morning a handful of governors were vowing to resist Obama administration plans to resettle Syrian refugees in their states. As of this morning, CNN put the count at 27, with only seven governors, all Democrats, saying their states will welcome the Syrians. President Obama likely helped catalyze this cross-country revolt with a dreadful performance in a press conference yesterday at Antalya, Turkey.\nThe president came off as impassive as he discussed last week\u2019s attacks in Paris. He turned prickly under repeated questioning about his own underestimation of the Islamic State\u2014which he denied, even when a reporter mentioned his January 2014 dismissal of the group as \u201cthe jayvee team.\u201d\nBut he got passionate when the subject turned to Republicans who disagree with him on the refugee question:\nBut Yahoo! News\u2019s Michael Isikoff last week reported that the administration is in fact on the verge of imposing just the sort of \u201creligious test\u201d the president claims to disavow:\nThe Yazidi are a religious minority whose faith \u201cincorporates elements of Christianity and Islam.\u201d\n\u201cA genocide designation would have significant policy implications for American efforts to restore property and lands taken from the minority groups and for offers of aid, asylum, and other protections to such victims,\u201d the Hudson Institute\u2019s Nina Shea writes for National Review. Christians are not being considered for the genocide designation, Shea notes, although they are \u201calso among the most vulnerable religious minority groups that have been deliberately and mercilessly targeted for eradication by ISIS.\u201d\nSo Obama\u2019s objection is not to \u201creligious tests\u201d per se, but to favorable treatment of Christians. It is of a piece with his February speech to the National Prayer Breakfast, in which he bizarrely lectured Christians to get off their \u201chigh horse\u201d and remember the Crusades, while also claiming that ISIS and other Muslim terrorists are \u201cbetraying\u201d Islam.\nApprehension about admitting Muslim Syrian refugees is motivated by fear. It is \u201cThe Return of Republican Islamophobia,\u201d according to the title of a piece yesterday by New York magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait. He writes that \u201cfigures like Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush are calling for the United States to admit only Christian refugees, thereby positioning the United States as indifferent to ISIS\u2019s primary victims,\u201d by which he means Muslims. So are Yazidis secondary victims and Christians tertiary ones, or the other way around? Chait doesn\u2019t say.\nBut a phobia is an irrational fear, and the attacks in Paris are nothing if not a reminder that fear of Islamic terrorism is rational. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that one of the Paris attackers came in as part of the wave of Syrian refugees:\nReuters reported this morning that \u201cGerman police have detained an Algerian man in a refugee reception centre in connection with the attacks in Paris.\u201d\nThe Obama administration plans to admit some 10,000 Syrian refugees next year. At Saturday\u2019s debate, Hillary Clinton and Martin O\u2019Malley both said they\u2019d like to make it 65,000. \u201cAccommodating 65,000 refugees in our country today, people of 320 million, is akin to making room for 6\u00bd more people in a baseball stadium with 32,000,\u201d said O\u2019Malley.\nThe problem, however, is not one of numbers. If even a handful of terrorists were among the 10,000 or 65,000 admitted, that would be enough to cause carnage and serious disruption. As the president himself observed during yesterday\u2019s press conference: \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about the ability of a handful of people .\u00a0.\u00a0. who are willing to die, they can kill a lot of people.\u201d\nProponents of admitting Syrian refugees acknowledge the importance of vetting them. \u201cEven as we accept more refugees\u2014including Syrians\u2014we do so only after subjecting them to rigorous screening and security checks,\u201d Obama said in his opening statement yesterday. In the debate, Mrs. Clinton said that \u201cwe should go to 65 [thousand] but only if we have as carefully screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes.\u201d\nIn an interview yesterday with radio host Hugh Hewitt, New Jersey\u2019s Gov. Chris Christie\u2014one of those who\u2019ve said their states won\u2019t accept refugees\u2014made the obvious point in response: \u201cI do not trust this administration to effectively vet the people who are proposed to be coming in, in order to protect the safety and security of the American people.\u201d\nWe have no specialized knowledge here, but it seems to us that Christie easily has the better of this argument. To put it mildly, administrative competence has not been the hallmark of this administration. Obama has presided over, among other things, the abuses at the Internal Revenue Service, the Chinese hacking of millions of federal employees\u2019 private records, and the scandal at the Veterans Administration. His administration could not even design a properly functioning website for its central ideological vanity project, the federal health-insurance exchange. It seems crazy to place one\u2019s faith in its ability to do better even than the Greeks in vetting refugees.\nUSA Today points out that the governors have little formal authority to keep the feds from resettling refugees in their state:\nIt\u2019s certainly political, but resistance from governors in a majority of states\u2014including 11 states Obama carried in 2012, and including one Democrat, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, who is seeking a U.S. Senate seat\u2014it\u2019s more than posturing. This is not just a national-security crisis but a developing political crisis for the president and his party.\nWhy Do Bad Things Always Happen to Him?   \u201cMANILA, Philippines\u2014After years of red-eye flights across the Pacific and marathon summits, President Obama had hoped to arrive in this Southeast Asian capital and tout progress in his seven-year charm offensive in Asia: His campaign to move away from the cycle of crisis in the Middle East and toward the rising region was finally yielding results. Instead, the president was due to land Philippines Tuesday amid a fresh crisis\u2014a reminder of the trouble that has dogged his \u2018Asia rebalance\u2019 from its inception. The terrorist attacks in Paris and talk of reprisals for the Islamic State quickly threatened to overshadow Obama\u2019s good-news tour to the Philippines and Malaysia this week.\u201d\u2014Kathleen Hennessey, Associated Press, Nov.\u00a016\nMission Accomplished\nTwo Young-Adult Websites in One!\nFox Butterfield, Is That You?\nOut on a Limb   \u201cIf Donald Trump Is the Problem, Mitt Romney Isn\u2019t the Solution\u201d\u2014headline, FiveThirtyEight.com, Nov.\u00a016\nWhat Would We Do Without Experts?   \u201cSave Some Money, Experts Say Don\u2019t Buy Organic Produce\u201d\u2014headline, KXAN-TV website (Austin, Texas), Nov.\u00a017\nHe\u2019s Just Not That Into You   \u201cObama on His ISIS Strategy: I\u2019m Not Interested in \u2018American Leadership, or America Winning\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014headline, Federalist, Nov.\u00a016\nLongest Books Ever Written   \u201cAll the Questionable Statements on Defense From Saturday\u2019s Democratic Debate\u201d\u2014headline, Jalopnik.com, Nov.\u00a016\nProblem and Solution\u2014I\nProblem and Solution\u2014II\nThe Soft Bigotry of Low Expectations   \u201cAnyway, the results are in: Ruth Bader Ginsburg is more fun than Gloria Steinem.\u201d\u2014blogress Ann Althouse, Nov.\u00a016\n21st-Century Jobs   \u201cLocal Kids Learn to Give Heroin Antidote\u201d\u2014headline, Courier-Journal (Lexington, Ky.), Nov.\u00a017\nHey, Kids!
