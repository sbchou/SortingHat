But now, after the terrorist attacks on an American ally, Republican elders think their party\u2019s flirtation with inexperience is nearing its end.\nThe reemergence of foreign policy atop the Republican agenda will force voters to reevaluate the outsider candidates, particularly as both Trump and Carson display a lack of knowledge about national security and the terrorist threat, party stalwarts said.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cThe losers are going to be Donald Trump and Ben Carson on national security,\u201d said Katon Dawson, the former chairman of the South Carolina GOP. \u201cAs the Republican base sobers up, they are the two, if this story lasts a long time, it's going to hurt.\"\nIndeed, in interviews with current and former GOP chairs, veteran operatives, lobbyists and strategists, the long-held conviction that neither Trump nor Carson will win the Republican nomination has only strengthened since the attacks in Paris last week.\nFred Malek, who has advised multiple Republican presidents and is not affiliated with any contender this cycle, said the inexperience Trump and Carson reveal in their rhetoric will drive GOP primary voters toward another candidate.\n\n\n\n            By \nEli Stokols\n\n\u201cThe severity of the attacks in Paris crystallize in people\u2019s minds the importance of having somebody in the commander-in-chief spot who has made the kinds of decisions, gone through the kind of decision-making process, that an experienced leader has,\u201d Malek said.\nCarson in particular is vulnerable on security and foreign policy issues, Republican leaders say. The pediatric neurosurgeon, who has no previous political experience, has already stunned with a meandering answer about the Middle East in last week\u2019s debate, before the attacks. He drew criticism in an earlier debate for suggesting that American brainpower was a substitute for military force and he shocked many by saying he had intelligence that the White House did not about Chinese forces engaging in Syria. \nWorse yet for the candidate, two of Carson\u2019s senior advisors on Tuesday told The New York Times, on the record, that their candidate was struggling to understand the Middle East. Intense tutoring, they told the paper, was having little effect.\nCarson has tried to correct course in recent days. On Friday, he said his message to Vladimir Putin is, \u201cWe are a peaceful country, but we are not a marshmallow.\u201d On Monday, on social media and in a press conference, sought to highlight his plan to take on ISIS and articulate a broader, more cogent foreign policy.\nBut GOP insiders say they aren't impressed, and think the foreign policy shift will take a visible toll on Carson, especially in next month\u2019s debate, which many expect will be filled with security questions. \n\u201cCarson I\u2019m not so worried about,\u201d said Fergus Cullen, the former chairman of the New Hampshire GOP who puts his overall concern level about Trump and Carson at a five, on a scale of 10. \u201cI respect him for his accomplishments in life, but he is completely unprepared to be president of the United States, and that will take care of itself at the polls.\u201d\n\n\n\n            By \nNolan D. McCaskill\n\nThe more exposure he gets, said Doug Gross, a longtime Iowa Republican, the more it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s \u201cnot ready to be president. Just from a policy standpoint, he\u2019s not prepared to deal with issues.\u201d\nLongtime Republicans don\u2019t have nearly as clear a theory of Trump\u2019s downfall. \n\u201cIt\u2019s always easier to predict how this ends up than how [we] get there,\u201d said Stuart Stevens, who was Mitt Romney\u2019s chief strategist. But as for Trump, \u201cI don\u2019t think he wins a single primary\u2026 I think he gets out.\u201d \nOthers agree that he will falter, even as some acknowledge that all predictions of his demise have been wrong thus far. Truly, Trump\u2019s resilience -- even after attacking prisoners of war, immigrants and even Iowans -- has flummoxed and alarmed party leaders.\nForeign policy-minded GOP veterans call Trump an amateur on the issue and say he should be pressed for more policy specifics. But they acknowledge that the fresh focus on security will not be as damaging in the short term to Trump, who can better rouse crowds with his \u201cbomb-the-sh**-out-of-ISIS\u201d rhetoric, as it is to Carson.\nYet, these party leaders and strategists said there\u2019s no feeling of panic. \n\u201cIt\u2019s too early for anyone to be hand-wringing about any particular candidate,\u201d said Matt Strawn, the former chairman of the Iowa GOP, speaking more broadly but offering a sentiment shared by many interviewed. \u201cBoth Iowa and New Hampshire historically make their decisions late.\u201d\nWhile Republican insiders argue that nominating Trump would lose the GOP the White House, they maintain that it\u2019s a nightmare that will never come to pass.\n\"If this was the middle of March and we had a Republican candidate racking up win after win after win in states and we looked like we were free falling into losing not only the White House but also the Senate and seats in the House, yeah, there would be every reason for the party to be deeply concerned about the direction of the country,\" said Henry Barbour, a Republican National Committeeman from Mississippi. \u201cBut it's November.\u201d \nExperienced operatives keep adjusting the timeline for Trump\u2019s decline: several months ago, some campaigns and Republican insiders said the debate would get more serious around Thanksgiving and hurt his standing in the polls but now they\u2019re looking out to January, even February.\n\u201cI\u2019m not totally discounting that this is a real problem,\u201d said Cullen, who now acknowledges he could see Trump winning some early contests. \u201cBut I also think that in the fullness of time this will eventually work itself out.\u201d \n\n\n\n            By \nNahal Toosi\n\nBut most of the Republicans interviewed said Trump in particular doesn\u2019t have the organization or appeal to last deep into the cycle (not to mention that should he show signs of actually winning any contests, plenty of Republicans are prepared to write big checks to a Stop Trump campaign). \n\u201cI\u2019m not too worried about it,\u201d said Charlie Black, another longtime adviser to Republican presidents and presidential campaigns. \u201cTrump\u2019s been losing a little steam since Labor Day, when he was up around 30, now he\u2019s in the low 20s. Carson is as high as he\u2019ll ever be, just because he\u2019s beginning to demonstrate he doesn\u2019t have real good knowledge of the issues. Either of them might win a primary or something, but that\u2019s it.\u201d\nOne indication of impending panic would be a mad scramble to organize an explicit anti-Trump effort. Dawson, who had been looking to form just such a super PAC, hasn\u2019t found a donor yet.\n\"I specifically did not find the right donor to get me to go to that effort. And then Trump's numbers started moving down, from the 30s to the 20s,\" Dawson said. \nThis all changes as the primaries near. If Trump is still on track to win one of the first four voting states, the GOP establishment will face perhaps its final moment to rally around another candidate.\n\u201cThe (Paris) attacks proved that a month is an infinite amount of political time, and that the shape of a campaign can flip dramatically in an instant,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a veteran Republican who served in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cAnd for that reason I believe it's a fair reading of the evidence to say that people don't get serious until, if, and when they vote. And so I want to see what the polls in New Hampshire look like a week, three days, the day before the actual primaries are held...If Donald is at 42 percent in New Hampshire a day before the primary, you may see the establishment freak out. But I don't think today.\u201d \nThe Trump and Carson campaigns would not comment for this story.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "GOP leaders: National security will end Carson and Trump campaigns", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/republicans-ben-carson-donald-trump-security-215999", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kenneth P.
