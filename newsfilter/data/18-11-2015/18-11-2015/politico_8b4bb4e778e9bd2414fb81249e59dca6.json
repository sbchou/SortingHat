But just as his campaign enters the critical primary phase, the fallen frontrunner is about to get outgunned on the airwaves by the man his campaign views as its chief rival, Marco Rubio.\n\u201cAccording to media buyers and a POLITICO review of TV ad purchase data, Bush and his allies are on pace to spend $5 million more than Team Rubio on broadcast, cable and radio ads through the first four voting states \u2013 but for that sum, they will put fewer ads on the airwaves. That\u2019s because the vast majority of Bush\u2019s ads are paid for by his super PAC \u2013 roughly 85 percent for Bush versus only 40 percent for Rubio \u2013 and super PACs get far less bang for their buck. \u2026 In Iowa and New Hampshire, \u2026 super PACs are confronting ad rates that can soar to nearly 1,000 percent more than the rates charged of candidates \u2026\n\u201cData from GOP analytics firm Echelon Insights shows that Rubio will run at least 5,000 more broadcast TV spots than Bush in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada through February, even as the former Florida governor and his super PAC spend more overall.\u201d http://politi.co/1NANYCZ\n**SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/1M75UbX\nJUST POSTED \u2013 \u201cWhy Al Gore won't endorse Hillary Clinton,\u201d by Politico\u2019s Darren Samuelsohn: An aide said Gore will \u201cstay on the sidelines [during the primaries]. Gore\u2019s reticence \u2026 is in part to maximize his own leverage on fighting climate change. But his repeated demurrals also reflect a complicated relationship with [Hillary] that dates back more than two decades. \u2026 The \u2026 rivalry started when the two baby boomer policy wonks arrived in the White House in 1993. Gore got the \u2026 environmental and technology portfolios. Bill Clinton \u2026 assign[ed] his wife what would become an ill-fated attempt to pass \u2026 health-care reform \u2026\n\u201cBill Clinton reportedly reconciled with Gore in the days after \u2026 Sept. 11 \u2026 But \u2026 the relationship between Gore and Hillary Clinton had never even gotten to a place where it could be smoothed over. \u2026 Gore\u2019s own efforts to take the next big step in his political career suffered in no small part because of the roller coaster politics associated with the Lewinsky saga \u2026\n\u201c[In 2008, Gore] got a call from Sen. Ted Kennedy urging him to endorse Obama. But Gore resisted, and he didn\u2019t go public for the future president until more than a week after Clinton had conceded.\u201d http://politi.co/1MP8TWk\nPIC DU JOUR -- @BernieSanders: \u201cWhat is this Snapshot thing and why do I only get ten seconds?\u201d http://bit.ly/1X42o3i\nUPDATED POLITICO APP -- dynamic new design.
