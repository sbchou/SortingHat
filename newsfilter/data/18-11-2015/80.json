Would it be like LaBradford Smith talking trash to Jordan or something?\" Simmons asked.\n\"I would\u2019ve enjoyed campaigning against Trump,\" Obama remarked.\nLater in the interview, Obama told Simmons that he had smoked zero cigarettes \"in the last five years.\"\n\"I made a promise that once health care passed, I would never have a cigarette again. And I have not,\" Obama said, despite a stir earlier this year generated by a photo of him with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.\nObama also laughed off the Jade Helm 15 conspiracy theories that he was going to begin martial law to stay in office longer, remarking, \"[a]nybody who thinks I could get away with telling Michelle I\u2019m going to be president any longer than eight years does not know my wife.\"\nDaughters Sasha and Malia are also apparently eager for their dad to leave the Oval Office.\n\"Not as much as Michelle, but certainly ready,\" Obama said.\nThe president also commented on the impression that he is feeling less burdened by the job now that he is well into his second term and does not have to face re-election.\nBy\nNahal Toosi\n\"There\u2019s no doubt that the longer I\u2019m in this job, the more confident I am about the decisions I\u2019m making and more knowledgeable about the responses I can expect. And as a consequence, you end up being looser,\" he said. \"There\u2019s not much I have not seen at this point, and I know what to expect, and I can anticipate more than I did before.\"\nBut that apparently does not mean he is willing to pick between his vice president (who is very much not running for his job) or former secretary of state (who certainly is).\n\"Which leadership style suits your vision of where America should go forward? Biden or Hillary?\"\n\"Come on, Bill,\" Obama said with a laugh.\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Obama: Running against Trump &apos;would&apos;ve been fun&apos;", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/obama-trump-campaign-215966", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Matteo Renzi", "Susan Rice", "Kenneth P.

The views expressed are his own.\n(CNN)Enough with the French Flag Facebook logo please.\nI was as horrified as anyone when teams of ISIS terrorists ripped through Paris with bullets and bombs on Friday, killing at least 129 people. And I, too, was taken back to September 11, 2001, and the horrifying images of the collapsing World Trade Center and carnage at the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania.\nThat was a life-altering morning for America. We quickly accepted the need to partially disrobe to get on airplanes, to open our purses at ballparks, to assume the government might be listening to our telephone calls and reading our emails.\nNow, the Paris attacks will change the French way of life -- substantially in the short term, and perhaps significantly in the long term, as well. And, as a fellow citizen of the free world, I offer my support to France and encourage American leaders to do everything possible to assist our friends.\nBut I am not going to tri-color my face.\nThe truth is that this perhaps well-intentioned show of solidarity cheapens the suffering of Parisians and trivializes the war on terror. ISIS is not a boogie man in a video game, it is a true threat to all who believe in self-evident freedoms, including the right to worship (or not) as we wish.\nIndeed, a core component of American and French democracy is freedom of religion and the rejection of theistic triumphalism. ISIS, in contrast, hides behind a religious cloak to distract attention from its self-serving lunacy. It needs to be treated seriously, and so Facebook makeup is not the correct response.\nThe new cycle of response to terrorist attacks is this: Grieve loudly, adopt a symbol, justify suspicions of anyone different from ourselves and eventually go back to our relatively carefree and careless lives.\nIn the wake of the World Trade Center attacks, the nation rallied around Gotham, embraced the FDNY, the NYPD and the hardhats. Yet 14 years later, there may not be the political will to even pass the Zadroga Act to extend health care benefits for people injured saving others that day. Rudy Giuliani, meanwhile, went from being \"America's Mayor\" to someone with less political oomph than Donald Trump or Ben Carson, men who never held elected office nor stood in the pit at ground zero.\nSoon, the French flag will fade from Facebook. In another couple of news cycles, Paris will drop from the headlines. The terrorists, though, will not evaporate, and they will not be scared off by cheap symbols.\nInstead, American leadership needs to translate the requirements for the war on terror from symbols to tangible action. We will see more heavily armed police on our streets. The director of the CIA claims he needs more leeway to track terrorists, to listen to more telephone calls and capture more communications. Yet many of those Facebook patriots will claim that armored cops are polarizing, and that the privacy of our innermost thoughts shared on social media is constitutionally protected and should be exempt from scrutiny.\nAn American with a French Facebook flag demeans the war on terror and is as effective as a smiley face.\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Opinion: Enough with French Flag Facebook logo", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/17/opinions/mulvaney-facebook-french-flag/index.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Rudy Giuliani", "Ben Carson"], "org": "cnn", "election_confidence": 0.5058709993072555, "authors": [{"author_id": 45910, "fullname": "james mulvaney", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 23:57:15", "orgs": ["NYPD", "CIA", "World Trade Center", "Pentagon"], "article_id": "a3102045d9c5551d22598b37b7c7a8ed", "date_access": "2015-11-18 01:02:02.921841"}, {"body": "11/17/15 06:51 AM EST\n11/17/15 06:28 AM EST\nPutnam\u2019s profitable pals \u2013 Who\u2019s who in Hillary\u2019s FL shop.\n11/17/15 05:48 AM EST\nB\u2019DAY: Susan Rice, John Boehner, Howard Dean, Howard Fineman, Paul Lindsay, Lorne Michaels\n2016\n11/17/15 05:15 AM EST\nBy\nShane Goldmacher\nRubio\u2019s campaign is getting twice the ads for half the price of Bush\u2019s super PAC, undercutting his rival\u2019s cash advantage.\n2016\n11/17/15 05:14 AM EST\nBy\nDarren Samuelsohn\nPeople close to the former vice president say it's not just to preserve his leverage on climate change.

But just as his campaign enters the critical primary phase, the fallen frontrunner is about to get outgunned on the airwaves by the man his campaign views as its chief rival, Marco Rubio.\n\u201cAccording to media buyers and a POLITICO review of TV ad purchase data, Bush and his allies are on pace to spend $5 million more than Team Rubio on broadcast, cable and radio ads through the first four voting states \u2013 but for that sum, they will put fewer ads on the airwaves. That\u2019s because the vast majority of Bush\u2019s ads are paid for by his super PAC \u2013 roughly 85 percent for Bush versus only 40 percent for Rubio \u2013 and super PACs get far less bang for their buck. \u2026 In Iowa and New Hampshire, \u2026 super PACs are confronting ad rates that can soar to nearly 1,000 percent more than the rates charged of candidates \u2026\n\u201cData from GOP analytics firm Echelon Insights shows that Rubio will run at least 5,000 more broadcast TV spots than Bush in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada through February, even as the former Florida governor and his super PAC spend more overall.\u201d http://politi.co/1NANYCZ\n**SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/1M75UbX\nJUST POSTED \u2013 \u201cWhy Al Gore won't endorse Hillary Clinton,\u201d by Politico\u2019s Darren Samuelsohn: An aide said Gore will \u201cstay on the sidelines [during the primaries]. Gore\u2019s reticence \u2026 is in part to maximize his own leverage on fighting climate change. But his repeated demurrals also reflect a complicated relationship with [Hillary] that dates back more than two decades. \u2026 The \u2026 rivalry started when the two baby boomer policy wonks arrived in the White House in 1993. Gore got the \u2026 environmental and technology portfolios. Bill Clinton \u2026 assign[ed] his wife what would become an ill-fated attempt to pass \u2026 health-care reform \u2026\n\u201cBill Clinton reportedly reconciled with Gore in the days after \u2026 Sept. 11 \u2026 But \u2026 the relationship between Gore and Hillary Clinton had never even gotten to a place where it could be smoothed over. \u2026 Gore\u2019s own efforts to take the next big step in his political career suffered in no small part because of the roller coaster politics associated with the Lewinsky saga \u2026\n\u201c[In 2008, Gore] got a call from Sen.

The survey was conducted earlier this month, prior to the terrorist attacks in France last week, and was supplemented by on-the-ground reporting in Iowa, which will cast the first votes in the presidential nominating process next February.\nStory Continued Below\nOffered identical lists of issues \u2014 economic inequality, economic growth, deficit reduction, taxes and unemployment \u2014 insiders differed dramatically by party. The overwhelming majority of Democrats, 81 percent, said inequality was the most important economic issue in their party's nominating contest, while nearly 65 percent of Republicans picked economic growth as the most important.\n\u201cDemocratic base voters see the country in stark terms: the small group at the top who've got it all, and everyone else struggling to make it in a country that won't even guarantee them modest sick time or family leave,\u201d said a Nevada Democrat, who, like all of the Caucus insiders, responded anonymously.\nMost Republicans, meanwhile, said growing the economy overall was more important than the other priorities listed. None of the 60 GOP insiders surveyed chose economic inequality as the most important issue. Deficit reduction was the only other priority for Republicans to register significantly; just under a quarter of GOP insiders said the national debt was most important.\nHere in the first-in-the-nation caucus state, those arguments are resonating acutely with potential caucusgoers in both parties. Conditions are improving nationwide \u2014 even more rapidly in Iowa \u2014 but serious problems persist.\nUnemployment has recovered close to historical norms nationally. And it\u2019s down to just 3.8 percent in Iowa, where the financial services and agricultural technology industries are booming, especially around Des Moines.\nDean Bowers, a farmer for decades before building a home-repair business, told POLITICO outside the Drake Diner on a windy day last week that he may eventually support one of the GOP candidates. But the 88-year-old balks at the way Republicans have talked about the economy during their highly watched debates.\n\u201cThey get up there and say, \u2018Oh, everything is so awful. America is falling apart.\u2019 And it makes me mad, because it just isn\u2019t true,\" said Bowers. \"It's not true here. There\u2019s plenty of work.\u201d\nBut growth remains slow both in Iowa and nationwide. Wages are sluggish, and the labor force participation rate is at its lowest level in nearly 40 years. The country faces an $18-trillion debt, and entitlement programs whose long-term financing is in peril. Many Americans think the nation is on the wrong track and that the deck is stacked for powerful interests in Washington and corporate America.\nThose feelings provide a ripe climate for Republican outsiders, who are dominating here in Iowa over more traditional candidates. They have also driven the rise of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has challenged Hillary Clinton\u2019s front-runner status in the Democratic race.\nThe frustrations were on clear display in Fort Dodge last Thursday, when thousands turned out for what turned into one of real estate billionaire Donald Trump\u2019s most epic rants of the 2016 campaign \u2014 in which he railed against illegal immigrants and \u201canchor babies,\u201d and likened rival Ben Carson to a child molester.\nAttendees at the event said Trump\u2019s appeal is rooted in his outsider status, business record and pledge to put America back on the right track.\n\u201cHe wants to bring jobs back here, and he knows how to do it,\u201d said Lindie Phipps, a self-described \u201cpoor dirt farmer\u201d from Boxholm, population 200. \u201cHe has got the confidence and the strength do it, and I respect that.\u201d\nAsked to pick which candidate would best handle the economy, fewer than 10 percent of POLITICO Caucus insiders chose Trump. But those who did valued his business experience \u2014 and expressed doubts that any other candidate could match it.\n\"Are you kidding with this question?\" an Iowa GOP Trump supporter asked. \"Only one answer.\"\nThe three candidates who scored highest on the question of handling the economy: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Bush was praised by one Iowa Republican for his emphasis on the need for growth.\n\u201cChina's new growth forecast is 6.5 percent,\u201d said the Iowa Republican. \u201cThe U.S. would crave achieving half that number. [Jeb] Bush and others who focus on growth have the right policy and political focus.\u201d\nMore than three-fourths of Democratic insiders, meanwhile, said Clinton would do the best job handling the economy \u2014 even as they acknowledge Sanders has driven the conversation on economic issues.\n\u201cThis is the crux of the Sanders' campaign, which has galvanized his base of support,\u201d said a Nevada Democrat. \u201cEven Clinton \u2013 who hails from an upper-middle-class background and is now at the top of the economic pyramid \u2013 has had to make economic inequality a point of attack against Republicans. The issue rings hollow coming from her, but Sanders spits the hot fire when he gets going on inequality, and his genuine passion fuels his supporters.\u201d\nOne reason for insiders\u2019 differing prescriptions for the U.S. economy? Disparate views on the state of the economy, including their own financial situation \u2013 a finding that mirrors public polling that shows Americans who identify as Democrats are significantly more likely to say they are doing better under President Barack Obama than Republicans.\nIn the POLITICO Caucus survey, 80 percent of Democratic insiders said they were better off now than when Obama took office in 2009, but fewer than three-in-10 Republicans agreed. Nearly half of GOP insiders said they were worse off, compared to fewer than 5 percent of Democrats.\nIt\u2019s a divide that is driving the parallel races for the two parties\u2019 respective nominations: Democrats are looking for a candidate to continue the economic recovery but make it more equitable, and Republicans are urging a more drastic change of course from what they see as a disastrous set of economic policies.\nThat's also true in Iowa, which is doing better than the rest of the nation. The state\u2019s unemployment rate is low, and home prices are rising. A recent USA Today/Wells Fargo poll found that 65 percent of Iowans rate local economic conditions as \u201cgood,\u201d well above the national average. The cost of living is manageable. And Forbes magazine recently named Des Moines the best city in America for young professionals.\n\u201cOur economy, quite frankly, has been booming,\u201d Jay Byers, CEO of the Greater Des Moines Partnership, said in an interview in his office in downtown Des Moines. \u201cWe have the largest concentration of insurance jobs per capita in the entire country. We are the third-largest employment hub for Wells Fargo. And our other world-class cluster is ag-bioscience and agriculture. Monsanto has more jobs in Iowa than they do in Missouri,\u201d where the company is based.\nFacebook and Microsoft are both building $2-billion data centers in Des Moines. Fancy new hotels are going up, and cranes are everywhere.\nBut low commodity prices are hurting the state\u2019s agricultural exports. So is the strong dollar, which hurts both agricultural and manufacturing exports.\nThe uneven economic environment presents political challenges to both parties. Democrats must deal with the overwhelming majority of voters who still view the nation\u2019s economy as moving in the wrong direction despite the longest economic expansion in decades.\nRepublicans have to address the fact that the unemployment rate is down by half since the first year of President Barack Obama\u2019s term and the nation has created 8 million new jobs under his watch, compared to the 1.3 million created under George W. Bush. They also have to shift away from their traditional base of support in corporate America and Wall Street to reflect a populist age in which distrust of big business \u2014 especially the financial industry \u2014 runs deeply through both parties.\n\u201cVoters don't trust people that are in public life,\u201d one Iowa GOP insider said. \u201cDo you want people running this country who are in bed with special interests, or someone who will say what he means and mean what he says?\"\nOn the Democratic side, Clinton has regained some momentum by moving left on Wall Street issues, saying she would break up the biggest banks if she had to. But Clinton may have a problem in Iowa on trade. The state is a major agricultural and manufacturing exporter, and big companies here are mostly in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the giant trade deal with Asia that Clinton recently said she opposes against despite supporting it while she served as secretary of state.\nThat is not likely to cost her a win in the Iowa caucuses, but it could prove damaging in the general election. Iowa is a classic \u201cpurple\u201d state, voting for the winner of the popular vote in every presidential election since 1992.\n\u201cThe TPP has a lot of components that really benefit the agriculture industry in the state, and former Gov. Tom Vilsack has strongly supported the TPP in Iowa for these reasons,\u201d said one Iowa Democratic insider. \u201cHowever, among Democratic caucus attendees, these policies are used to judge whether a candidate is truly progressive \u2014 it's no coincidence that Hillary has now come out against the TPP.\u201d\nThe Republican candidates, meanwhile, will have to toe the line between an Iowa GOP electorate that wants drastic, national change \u2014 but is also proud of how well the state has done compared to the rest of the nation and doesn\u2019t take kindly to people talking it down.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t take the kind of hit other places did during the recession and we are doing pretty well now,\u201d said Chris Wilde, chief engineer at KCCI, the local CBS affiliate. Broadcasters in particular fare well during caucus seasons, which sees millions of dollars in political ad spending.\nBut Byers of the Greater Des Moines Partnership put the current economic attitude of Iowans in even stronger terms. \u201cIt\u2019s very different right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is swagger out there, there\u2019s pride.\u201d\nThese are the members of the POLITICO Caucus, not all of whom participated in this special survey:\nIowa: Tim Albrecht, Brad Anderson, Rob Barron, Jeff Boeyink, Bonnie Campbell, Dave Caris, Sam Clovis, Sara Craig, Jerry Crawford, John Davis, Steve Deace, John Deeth, Derek Eadon, Ed Failor Jr., Karen Fesler, David Fischer, Doug Gross, Steve Grubbs, Tim Hagle, Bob Haus, Joe Henry, Drew Ivers, Jill June, Lori Jungling, Jeff Kaufmann, Brian Kennedy, Jake Ketzner, David Kochel, Chris Larimer, Chuck Larson, Jill Latham, Jeff Link, Dave Loebsack, Mark Lucas, Liz Mathis, Jan Michelson, Chad Olsen, David Oman, Matt Paul, Marlys Popma, Troy Price, Christopher Rants, Kim Reem, Craig Robinson, Sam Roecker, David Roederer, Nick Ryan, Tamara Scott, Joni Scotter, Karen Slifka, John Smith, AJ Spiker, Norm Sterzenbach, John Stineman, Matt Strawn, Phil Valenziano, Jessica Vanden Berg, Nate Willems, Eric Woolson, Grant Young\nNew Hampshire: Charlie Arlinghaus, Arnie Arnesen, Patrick Arnold, Rich Ashooh, Dean Barker, Juliana Bergeron, D.J.

There's more to the story.\nBy\nDarren Samuelsohn\n11/17/15 05:14 AM EST\nAt least four times in the past year, Al Gore has passed up opportunities to endorse Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, brushing off questions from People magazine and other media outlets with the admonition that it\u2019s still too early in the Democratic primary process for him to take sides. On Monday, an aide to the former vice president told POLITICO he\u2019ll stay on the sidelines until his party has selected its nominee.\nGore\u2019s reticence, his friends and allies say, is in part to maximize his own leverage on fighting climate change. But his repeated demurrals also reflect a complicated relationship with his former boss\u2019s wife that dates back more than two decades. While Gore and Hillary Clinton may not be enemies, they\u2019re not exactly close friends, either.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cThey have a lot of history. More than the average bear,\u201d said one Democratic source close to Gore.\nThe Hillary Clinton-Gore rivalry started when the two baby boomer policy wonks arrived in the White House in 1993. Gore got the new administration\u2019s environmental and technology portfolios. Bill Clinton raised eyebrows by assigning his wife what would become an ill-fated attempt to pass comprehensive health-care reform legislation.\n\u201cUsually you give your vice president something of that level. You don\u2019t give it to the first lady,\u201d recalled a former Clinton White House staffer. \u201cPeople forget that sort of started the relationship on a downward spiral early on.\u201d\nWhile Gore and Bill Clinton maintained a strong relationship throughout the president\u2019s first term, things took a turn in the other direction after the Monica Lewinsky scandal emerged in 1998. Gore insisted on keeping the president away from his own White House bid in 2000. \u201cI understand the disappointment and anger that you feel toward President Clinton, and I felt it myself,\u201d he told New Hampshire voters during his primary campaign. The political headwinds were tough enough, the vice president reasoned, and they got only more complicated when Hillary Clinton pursued the next step of her own career.\nWhite House\nBy\nSarah Wheaton\n\u201cHer Senate race complicated things,\u201d another former White House aide said. \u201cIt took up a lot of the political oxygen and party money. It put the spotlight on the Clintons when it wasn\u2019t focused on his race. It didn\u2019t help.\u201d\nBill Clinton reportedly reconciled with Gore in the days after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks \u2014 bonding over a late-night chat at the former president\u2019s New York home, according to The New York Times. But sources close to the Democratic heavyweights explain that the relationship between Gore and Hillary Clinton had never even gotten to a place where it could be smoothed over.\n\u201cTheir worlds haven\u2019t really crossed,\u201d said a fourth source, this one also a former Clinton White House aide. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been that much connection.\u201d\nGore has several reasons for keeping out of the 2016 maelstrom. When he does interviews, and inevitably questions get asked about his own never-fulfilled presidential ambitions, the response typically comes with a disclaimer that he\u2019s a \u201crecovering politician\u201d driven by an almost obsessive desire to save the planet.\n\"It's still too early, in my opinion, to endorse a candidate or pick a candidate,\" Gore told People magazine in an interview published last week ahead of a planned 24-hour webcast from Paris to raise awareness about climate change.\nIn an email Monday to POLITICO, a Gore spokesperson went a step further, saying the former vice president wouldn\u2019t be endorsing in the primary at all. \u201c[Gore] has great respect for and long-standing relationships with all of the candidates running for the Democratic nomination for president,\u201d this person said. \u201cHe appreciates the emphasis each of the candidates has placed on advocating for solutions to the climate crisis and will do all that he can to ensure that climate change remains a priority throughout this debate. However, he has no plans to endorse a candidate in the Democratic primary.\u201d\nClose associates also note that Gore has burned bridges before when he has spoken up about other Democrats running for the White House. In 2004, he sat out a rematch with President George W. Bush and instead gave his endorsement to the surging anti-war candidacy of Howard Dean, snubbing his former Senate colleague and fellow 1985 freshman classmate John Kerry. Not only did Dean\u2019s bid fade in the Iowa cornfields, Gore also left some feelings hurt because he didn\u2019t back his own 2000 vice presidential running mate, Sen. Joe Lieberman, either.\n2016\nBy\nEli Stokols\nDuring the next presidential primary cycle, which featured then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, an upstart Illinois senator named Barack Obama and son-of-a-mill-worker John Edwards, Gore opted to keep his power dry. Multiple sources tell POLITICO the former vice president got a call from Sen. Ted Kennedy urging him to endorse Obama. But Gore resisted, and he didn\u2019t go public for the future president until more than a week after Clinton had conceded.\nGore has since specifically praised Clinton without going all in on an endorsement. Last fall, he told Bloomberg TV that the former secretary of state was \u201cextremely capable\u201d but insisted it was too soon to be so focused on the Democratic horse race. In an early 2014 interview with POLITICO Magazine at his Nashville office, published a full year before Clinton formally announced she was running for president, Gore did give a tepid sign of where his support could ultimately go.\n\u201cI\u2019m of course fully aware of the general expectation that she will run and that she\u2019ll get the nomination. And if that happens, I certainly hope that she wins and I certainly hope that if she wins she\u2019ll be an effective advocate on climate,\u201d he said.\nGore recalled in the interview that Hillary Clinton had called him in 2007 before she gave a major energy and climate change speech \u201casking for advice on what the most forward leaning positions she could take would be.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I really appreciated that,\u201d Gore added. \u201cI don\u2019t have any doubt that her heart is in the right place on the issue and that she would like to be an agent for positive change on the issue.\u201d\nIn that November 2007 speech, given in Iowa, Clinton did name-check Gore three times. She congratulated the former vice president for recently winning the Nobel Peace Prize, and she pitched one of his ideas: a new \u201cConnie Mae\u201d program that would help people get loans to pay for more energy efficient homes.\nThe Clinton campaign did not respond to a request for comment, and several former Gore aides shrugged off questions about the Hillary Clinton-Gore relationship and the former vice president\u2019s silence on making an official endorsement. Clinton, who had faced criticism from greens for years of dithering over the Keystone XL pipeline, has since picked up the backing of the League of Conservation Voters. Gore, with his own intense following on climate issues, could help buttress Clinton\u2019s left flank as she fends off a primary challenge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley. But the Gore spokeswoman said an endorsement would need to wait until after the Democratic primaries are over and the party\u2019s nominee is selected.\n\u201cShe\u2019s running for president in her own right and he\u2019s advocating on an issue that\u2019s the most important issue to him. Inevitably that\u2019s where these two will interact again on this campaign,\u201d said Michael Feldman, Gore\u2019s former traveling chief of staff from his 2000 White House run.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in it for Al to endorse anyone at this point?\u201d added Greg Simon, Gore\u2019s former chief domestic policy adviser. \u201cAt this stage of the game if he wanted to go out and campaign for somebody he\u2019d have gone out and campaigned for himself, not for Bernie or Hillary.\u201d\nBy\nDaniel Strauss\nOther sources explained that Gore\u2019s restraint \u2014 a recent Associated Press count of Democratic superdelegates in Tennessee found that he indeed remains uncommitted \u2014 also needed to be seen in the context of that longer-term, and oh-so complicated relationship with the Clintons. Sure, Gore owes President Clinton for making him a one-of-a-kind job offer back in 1992. But Gore\u2019s own efforts to take the next big step in his political career suffered in no small part because of the roller coaster politics associated with the Lewinsky saga and the general drama that has become synonymous since then with anyone running for office named Clinton.\n\u201cSome of the stuff that\u2019s been plaguing the Clinton campaign \u2026 is the stuff he doesn\u2019t like about serving with the Clintons,\u201d said a veteran Democratic operative who worked for Gore. \u201cMy guess is he\u2019ll endorse Hillary Rodham Clinton. But if he were to close his eyes and wish for a leader who he would want to lead the world it\u2019s not where he would land.\u201d\nAs Hillary Clinton suffered through her summer slump, BuzzFeed in mid-August reported on a tiny flicker of interest among Gore supporters for him to mount a 2016 primary challenge. But the former vice president\u2019s spokeswoman, Betsy McManus, quickly doused any speculation a campaign was coming. \u201cThere\u2019s no truth to it,\u201d she told POLITICO the next day. \u201cHe\u2019s laser-focused on solving the climate crisis.\u201d\nIndeed, Gore\u2019s allies repeatedly dismissed questions that the former vice president\u2019s endorsement silence had anything to do with any designs of his own on running for president. He\u2019s built no institutional organization for a White House campaign or given any public statements suggesting interest. On top of that, the same deadlines and other barriers that forced Joe Biden to take a pass have also come and gone for Gore. About the only scenario anyone close to the former vice president would entertain \u2014 and even here it\u2019s preceded by laughs, dismissals and catastrophic caveats \u2014 involves an epic collapse on Clinton\u2019s part followed by the Democratic establishment scrambling at the last minute for an experienced replacement.\nWith a bit of alternative reality yearning in the voice, one of Gore\u2019s former aides posited: \u201cThe guy who\u2019s been the victim of Clinton scandals over the years \u2014 maybe it is his turn to be a beneficiary.\u201d\nDarren Samuelsohn is a senior policy reporter for Politico.\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "People close to the former vice president say it's not just to preserve his leverage on climate change.

But the Rubio campaign believes this is its opening to expose Cruz as being in step with Democrats on an issue that will drive the next three months of the campaign.\nLate Tuesday afternoon, Cruz fired back and said that Rubio is trying to distract from his record of working on the Senate\u2019s comprehensive immigration bill, the subject of a protracted dispute between the two campaigns over the past week.\n\u201cIt is not surprising that Marco\u2019s campaign wants to change the topic from Marco\u2019s partnership with President Obama to push a massive amnesty program,\u201d Cruz said with a theatrical chuckle. \u201cI understand politically why they want to change the topic from that, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be successful.\u201d\nRubio and his team went all in on Tuesday painting Cruz as weak on national security, an attack line that seizes on growing unease in the United States following the Paris attacks. In brief remarks following a closed Intelligence Committee briefing on the Paris attacks, Rubio stood by his comments the night before that Cruz and a number of other GOP senators had voted to \"weaken\" national security and intelligence gathering.\n\u201cIt eventually undermines our ability to collect information and to monitor those who seek to harm the United States,\u201d Rubio said.\nCongress\nBy\nJake Sherman\nand\nSeung Min Kim\nAsked why he singled out Cruz among the 67 senators that ultimately voted for the reforms, Rubio replied: \u201cWe have a race for commander-in-chief and the most important obligation of a president is to keep our country safe.\u201d\nStill, Rubio\u2019s comments made life awkward for several of his surrogates who supported the USA Freedom Act, which made reforms to the surveillance dragnet that the Florida senator opposed. Rubio has been endorsed by a trio of his colleagues in the chamber, including Freedom Act supporting Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Steve Daines of Montana, who backed the bill.\nIn interviews, Gardner and Daines shrugged off Rubio\u2019s comments. Gardner said \u201cpeople have different opinions\u201d and then knocked Obama\u2019s leadership on Syria; Daines said he backed the legislation because of its privacy protections.\n\u201cBut I think Marco Rubio would be a great commander and chief,\u201d Daines added.\nMeanwhile, Cruz\u2019s team quickly pointed out that influential senators from early-voting states supported the USA Freedom Act, suggesting that Rubio was alienating potential supporters in Congress by criticizing their efforts to rein in the bulk data collection programs.\nBut other lawmakers, including Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), chafed at Rubio\u2019s attacks on Cruz and the surveillance bill.\n\u201cIf the presidential candidates want to talk against your personal liberties, let them do so to their own demise as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d said Heller, a supporter of Jeb Bush.\n2016\nBy\nBen Schreckinger\nFor the hard-charging Cruz, foreign policy is an area of relative moderation. He likes to say that there are two poles in the party, with Rand Paul at one end and Rubio and John McCain at the other.\nTo Rubio, the issue is more black and white: you're either with Paul or you\u2019re with Rubio. On Tuesday, Rubio\u2019s campaign aides circulated Cruz\u2019s equivocal reactions to the disclosures of national security programs by Edward Snowden, hoping to further paint Cruz as out of step within the GOP.\nCruz\u2019s campaign deemed the attacks as a distraction from Rubio\u2019s vulnerability on immigration, and an adviser said \u201cour campaign won't be taking the bait.\"\nStill, there was evidence among senior senators that Rubio\u2019s aggressive posture on national security and foreign policy is working.\n\u201cPeople who have extensive experience on national security issues and intelligence issues right now are going to have an advantage,\u201d said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.). \u201cMarco has sort of staked out for some time pretty strong positions on those issues and I think he\u2019s well positioned to make the arguments.\u201d\nAdded Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.): \u201cMarco is right on it, and he\u2019s got the intelligence to be right on it.\"\nRubio and Cruz have warily eyed one another on national security for years. They voted together for a filibuster of Chuck Hagel\u2019s nomination as defense secretary in 2013, but have experienced high-profile breaks as well: When Paul forced a vote on cutting aid to Egypt in 2013, Rubio spoke against it, while Cruz sided with Paul.\nPaul and Cruz were the only Republicans to oppose a compromise national defense policy bill last month, another area in Cruz\u2019s record that Rubio\u2019s team believe is ripe for inspection. And senior Republicans are still annoyed at those votes.\n\u201cI have a number of differences with Sen. Cruz. And I have some with Senator Rubio. But it was disturbing to me when Sen. Cruz voted against the defense authorization bill,\u201d said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz. \u201cI view that as a slap in the face to the men and women who are serving.\u201d\nDefense\nBy\nBryan Bender\nCruz is best known for insulting McConnell and being among the most conservative senators on practically any topic. But on surveillance reform he joined a bipartisan coalition early on, charting a middle course between Paul, whose views are to the left of much of the GOP, and Rubio, who Cruz believes is too close to McCain\u2019s position.\nIt\u2019s a difficult balance. Cruz is trying to court both Ron Paul voters and more mainstream conservatives. But on Tuesday, he stood by his vote on the surveillance bill and said conservatives across the country are more concerned with privacy issues than Rubio would like to believe.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, conservatives care about the Bill of Rights, care about protecting the privacy of law-abiding citizens and also about protecting our national security,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cAt the end of the day, this issue all comes down to their campaign\u2019s desire to change the subject from Marco\u2019s support for amnesty.\u201d\nMany Republicans bristled during the debate over government surveillance at how the program was portrayed. Senators close to the intelligence community said there had been no abuses. But the idea of extending the bulk data collection with no changes, supported by Rubio, couldn\u2019t even get a majority in the Senate, much less clear the chamber\u2019s 60-vote requirement.\nThe issue turned senators who often vote against anything that smells of compromise into pragmatists; on this issue, Rubio was the hardliner, not Cruz.\n\u201cIt was the only thing we had. Without it, we\u2019d have nothing. It was what you had to do,\u201d said Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). \u201cBut I was highly concerned about the weakening of our intelligence gathering capabilities. I still am.\u201d\n\u201cI have no second thoughts,\u201d added Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), who also backed the bill. \u201cThere is an important equilibrium to be found between weighing privacy and national security.\u201d\nSeung Min Kim contributed to this report.\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The Florida senator sees Cruz as vulnerable and in line with Democrats on what could become a dominant issue.", "title": "Rubio escalates foreign policy feud with Cruz", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/rubio-cruz-foreign-policy-216004", "topics": ["surveillance/privacy"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Ron Paul", "Kenneth P.

But presidential candidates do.\nSuch is the dance of a political campaign reacting to events in real time. Candidates must attempt to honor a tragic event without cheapening it, while at the same time stealthily framing their own positions as more presidential than those of their competitors.\nThat tension was apparent Saturday night during the second Democratic presidential debate, which began with a moment of silence for the attacks in Paris.\nSenator Bernie Sanders, who has championed not running a negative campaign, let loose on Hillary Rodham Clinton for voting for the war in Iraq during her time in the Senate, and implicitly blamed the Iraq invasion for the resulting rise of the Islamic State.\nOn the Republican side, candidates have suggested different approaches to combating the Islamic State. Senator Lindsey Graham wants the United States to send ground troops into Iraq and Syria, while Donald J. Trump has previously boasted that he would aggressively bomb Iraqi oil fields and \u201ctake away their wealth.\u201d\nAlmost the entire Republican field has used the Paris attacks as evidence that Syrian refugees should not be allowed to resettle in the United States, arguing that the current vetting process is not sound enough to ensure that terrorists are kept out.\nWe may not want to politicize tragedies, but tragedies have political outcomes all the same. President George W. Bush\u2019s approval rating skyrocketed after 9/11, to 90 percent in the days after the attacks from 55 percent a month before. This impulse to circle the wagons around your leader in a time of crisis, no matter your political persuasion, is known as the \u201crally \u2019round the flag effect.\u201d\nWhen tragedy strikes during a presidential campaign, the candidates involved have to respond respectfully, while also getting voters to see them as trustworthy and willing to stand up to acts of brutality: in other words, like a commander in chief. Mrs. Clinton made that intent clear in Saturday night\u2019s debate.\n\u201cThis election is not only about electing a president; it\u2019s also about choosing our next commander in chief,\u201d she said. \u201cI will be laying out in detail what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism. Our country deserves no less because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.\u201d\nThat answer echoed the \u201c3 a.m. phone call\u201d ad that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign ran during the 2008 Democratic primary as proof that she was more reliable on national security than Barack Obama. But while, in 2008, the Democratic base was sick of hawkishness and far enough removed from 2001 to yearn for an antiwar candidate, 2016 may favor Mrs. Clinton\u2019s experience in times of strife.\nIn the 2004 campaign, Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont emerged as a front-runner, earning the endorsement of Al Gore and standing out in the field as an antiwar firebrand. In December 2003, just before the Iowa caucuses, Saddam Hussein was captured, giving the Bush administration a much-needed win and increasing hopes that the Iraq war wasn\u2019t a quagmire-to-be after all. It was John Kerry, a Vietnam veteran who voted as a senator in 2002 to give the president the authority to use military force in Iraq, who won at the Iowa caucuses, not Mr. Dean.\nDavid Wade, who served as press secretary during Mr. Kerry\u2019s 2004 campaign and went on to serve as chief of staff under Mr. Kerry at the State Department, noted the political challenges of that time. \u201cWe were campaigning in an age of color-coded homeland security alerts,\u201d Mr. Wade said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very tricky exercise to run a presidential campaign, particularly as a challenger, against the backdrop of unpredictable and unfolding national security events.\u201d\nWhen campaigning during a period of crisis, style can be more important than substance. Voters want to feel safe more than they want to read a five-point plan on intelligence operations and coalition building. According to Mr. Wade, voters want to answer the question, \u201cCan I picture this person in my living room on my television as commander in chief when something bad happens?\u201d\nUltimately, the Democratic electorate decided in 2004 that Mr. Dean did not pass the commander in chief test. Today, we may see a similar trajectory for Democratic voters who might have common ground with Mr. Sanders on economic issues, but can\u2019t quite picture him in the Situation Room.\nMatt Latimer, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush, said that as voters\u2019 attention is drawn more to global instability, the love for political outsiders may fade. \u201cThe nation is going to select a new commander in chief, and at times like this they will be drawn to candidates who look the part,\u201d Mr. Latimer said. \u201cThat probably is not helpful to someone like a Ben Carson or a Bernie Sanders.\u201d\nThe psychologist Abraham Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs holds true in politics, too. When humans feel threatened, they are less inclined to take risks \u2014 whether that meant, in ancient times, venturing farther away from caves, or voting for a candidate who is not a known political entity. When an attack like the one we saw in Paris throws our own national security into question, seeking out a maverick candidate tends to take a back seat to finding someone safe.\nAnd it\u2019s still relatively early in the campaign. The political calculus that goes into a foreign policy platform during the primaries is much different during the general election. Mr. Bush\u2019s campaign successfully branded Mr. Kerry as a flip-flopper, especially on his support for, then opposition to, the war in Iraq. The same moderate foreign policy stances that made Mr. Kerry stand out from his more liberal competitors during the primary got him labeled an equivocator in the general election.\nIt\u2019s unclear what political ramifications the attacks in Paris will have on the presidential election a year from now \u2014 and it feels crass to even raise that question \u2014 but there is evidence that when people feel threatened or experience personal trauma, they tend to vote more conservatively. One 2013 study found that relatives of Sept. 11 victims who did not identify as Republican before the attacks were more likely than a control group to say they were Republican in the years after.\n. Other studies have found that participants respond more conservatively to political survey questions after being shown images meant to provoke fear or disgust.\nIt\u2019s challenging, as a political candidate, to process news of a tragedy that\u2019s still unfolding. But news will continue to unfold, and shape how voters see things in the process. Candidates can\u2019t choose the political climate they campaign in.

But, ultimately this time, his dreams of the White House fell short. \"Never in their wildest dreams did they think their son would have the opportunity to serve as Governor of Louisiana or to run for president,\" Jindal said on Fox News Channel's \"Special Report with Bret Baier.\" The two-term governor had struggled to raise money and to gain any traction in the race, consistently relegated to the lower undercard debates at each of the past four Republican debates. Overshadowed by outsider candidates like Donald Trump and neurosurgeon Ben Carson. for a time Jindal had focused his fire at the wealthy real estate magnate, blasting him \"a narcissist\" and \"a carnival act\" this fall.

Seven people will be laid off, a spokesman for the company said, but six new reporters will be hired.\nFounded in 2002, Gawker is a veteran of the new media space, and it has grown into a network of seven sites focusing on subjects including cars, technology, sports and feminism.\nFallout from the controversial blog post in July about a little-known media executive who allegedly tried to hire a gay escort aggravated Gawker Media\u2019s mounting financial woes, as some marketers put their advertising on hold. In addition, legal costs stemming from the $100 million lawsuit brought by Hulk Hogan have hit hundreds of thousands of dollars a month at times, triggering a need for outside investment, Mr. Denton has said. But outside investors have opted to remain on the sidelines until the Hogan case\u2014postponed until March\u2014is resolved, he has said.\nMr. Denton has warned that a major damages award in the Hogan case could potentially bankrupt the company. Following the gay escort post\u2014which was taken down, triggering a staff exodus\u2014Mr. Denton vowed a kinder, gentler version of Gawker moving forward.\nThe shift toward politics comes just as the 2016 election cycle begins to kick into high gear, potentially opening avenues for Gawker to tap into the pool of digital political advertising. It enters a crowded political media space, however, with digital sites like Politico and Vox.com having built a strong presence, as well as old media stalwarts like the Washington Post.\nThe new Gawker.com will be headed by Alex Pareene, who was tapped as editor in chief last month. Mr. Pareene cut his teeth at the Washington, D.C., gossip site Wonkette, which Mr. Denton sold in 2008.\n\u201cThe 2016 election is a real gift for anyone who has a real sense of the absurd,\u201d Mr. Pareene said in an interview, vowing that the new site wouldn't pull any punches. \u201cI think it would be a disservice to the country to be overly nice to Donald Trump. But the overriding ethos will be to pick our battles.\u201d\nGawker says it turned an operating profit of $6.5 million in 2014 on revenue of $44.3 million.\nOver the summer, Gawker also said it has secured an $8 million loan from Silicon Valley Bank to help finance the expansion and relocation of its headquarters to a 40,000-square-foot office in Manhattan\u2019s flatiron district. The deal also includes an open credit line of an additional $7.5 million.\nWrite to Lukas I.

Howard Dean.\nIn an interview Tuesday with Katie Couric on Yahoo News, Mr. Sanders said the world would have been better off without the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 \u2013 and, by extension, better off if Hussein had remained in power. It is a remark that, if taken out of context, political opponents could use against Mr. Sanders. But it is also a more nuanced remark on Hussein than Mr. Dean made in December 2003, to disastrous effect.\nMr. Dean, who was running strongly in polls at the time because of his steadfast opposition to the Iraq war, gave a major foreign policy speech just two days after American forces had found Hussein hiding in a hole near Tikrit. Mr. Dean uttered 10 words that may have cost him the presidential nomination: \u201cThe capture of Saddam Hussein has not made America safer.\u201d\nHis Democratic rivals pounced, saying Mr. Dean\u2019s comment was a clear sign that he was not prepared to lead a nation at wartime; some voters, thrilled that Hussein was in custody, were taken aback by his view.\nMr. Sanders, like Mr. Dean, was against the Iraq war, and \u2013 like Senator Barack Obama in 2008 \u2013 has been using Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s vote authorizing the war to attack her judgment. But in the interview on Tuesday, Ms. Couric pressed Mr. Sanders on the link between the unpopular war and the popular ouster of Hussein.\n\u201cDo you believe that Iraq would be better off if Saddam Hussein had remained in power?\u201d Ms. Couric asked.\nMr. Sanders replied with a level of context and perspective that lacked the sort of easy sound bite that made Mr. Dean so vulnerable.\n\u201cDo I think the entire region would have been better off if we had not invaded that country and brought about the massive levels of destabilization which led to the death of 6,700 Americans, 500,000 coming back with P.T.S.D. or T.B.I., the death of many, many hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, the growth of ISIS and Al-Qaeda in that region?\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cDo I think the world have been better off? Yeah.\n\u201cSaddam Hussein was a brutal, disgusting tyrant, and the effort would have been, \u2018How do you get rid of him?\u2019 But to destabilize that region the way we did, to bring about that chaos, and the incredible cost to us in terms of human life and trillions of dollar of expenditure \u2013 yes, we should not have undertaken that invasion, and I think history will record that as one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the history of America.\u201d\nAs if imagining a television commercial using the remark against him, like happened to Mr. Dean, Mr. Sanders continued: \u201cI don\u2019t want people to be simply saying, \u2018Oh, Bernie Sanders doesn\u2019t have experience in foreign policy.\u2019 True, I was not a secretary of state for four years, I concede that,\u201d a reference to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s tenure. \u201cBut I think if you check my record, and the votes that I\u2019ve cast, and what I have said, you\u2019ll find that, in fact, we do have a lot of credibility in many foreign policy areas.\u201d", "byline": "PATRICK D.

The council called them \"heartland\" states, located in the Midwest and South.\nSixty-eight percent of those surveyed approve of the restoration of diplomatic ties, which was achieved in July, versus 26 percent who disapprove. The respondents favor ending the trade embargo, which remains in place, by 58 percent to 35 percent. The poll showed 67 percent favor ending current restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba, compared to 28 percent in opposition.\nLast December U.S. President Barack Obama reversed the policy of 10 previous presidents by engaging with Cuba as he and Cuban President Raul Castro pledged to restore diplomatic relations.\nObama's call to lift the trade embargo has been blocked by the Republican-controlled Congress, as has a separate measure to allow Americans to go to Cuba as tourists.\nThe poll showed Republicans and conservatives still opposed Obama over the embargo by 9 and 17 points, respectively, but they sided with him or were closely split on restoring diplomatic relations and ending travel restrictions.\n\"You would be hard-pressed to find any other Obama administration policy with this much Republican support,\" Peter Schechter, director of the Atlantic Council's Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, said in a statement.\nFor decades both parties heeded the pro-embargo lobby led by Cuban-Americans in and around Miami, mindful of their fund-raising ability and sway in the swing state of Florida. But in 2012, Obama split the Cuban-American vote, and subsequent polls showed Cuban-Americans tilting in favor of normalizing relations.\nMost of the Republican presidential contenders maintain the party's historic support of the embargo and isolation of the former Cold War adversary, notably the Cuban-American Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.\nWithin the four states, Ohio voters showed the most sympathy to the Obama policies and Tennessee voters the least.\nThe Atlantic Council said its survey, taken Oct. 15-18 by Republican pollster Glen Bolger, questioned 150 likely voters in each state and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent.\n(Reporting by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Bill Trott)", "byline": "", "description": "HAVANA (Reuters) - Solid majorities of likely U.S. voters in Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and Tennessee favor diplomatic relations with Cuba and an end to trade and travel restrictions with the Communist-ruled island, a poll by the Atlantic Council showed on Tuesday.", "title": "Voters in four 'heartland' states favor Obama policy on Cuba: poll", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/domesticNews/~3/VFHhDBZWIjk/story01.htm", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "trade"], "people": ["Bill Trott", "Jeb Bush", "Glen Bolger", "Marco Rubio", "Barack Obama", "Raul Castro", "Ted Cruz"], "org": "reuters", "election_confidence": 0.9388093056655146, "authors": [{"author_id": 33503, "fullname": "daniel trotta", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 15:06:27", "orgs": [], "article_id": "f3bdccea4322ae1f066c775707359c4f", "date_access": "2015-11-17 15:36:42.289886"}, {"body": "11/17/15 08:30 AM EST\nBy\nJeremy Herb\nFrance launches new round of airstrikes \u2014 Republican calls grow to halt Syrian refugees to U.S.\n11/17/15 08:21 AM EST\nThe GOP-led House moves to block funding for a program that resettles Syrian refugees in the U.S.\nBy\nJacopo Barigazzi\nBy\nAlex Spence\nand\nDuncan Gardham\n11/17/15 08:01 AM EST\nBy\nNick Gass\n\"We will not turn our backs on the refugees who are fleeing Syria and Afghanistan.

And we will not let that happen. We will not be terrorized or live in fear.

I said we should go to 65 [thousand], but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes.

(AP)\nBy\nJosh Gerstein\n11/17/15 11:29 AM EST\nPresident Barack Obama's public comments appearing to prejudge the outcome of Justice Department investigations don't affect the decisions in those inquiries, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Tuesday.\nIn her first appearance before the House Judiciary Committee since taking office in April, Lynch was questioned by panel chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) about remarks Obama made last year declaring there was \"not even a smidgen of corruption\" in the IRS's handling of applications from nonprofit groups and a statement the president made last month that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email set-up posed no national security problem.\n\"With respect to the president's comments, they have no influence or bearing on how the department manages these matters,\" Lynch said.\nGoodlatte tried a couple of times to get Lynch to comment on whether it was unwise for Obama to make such comments while an investigation was pending, but she declined to do so.\n\"I really don\u2019t have a comment on the president\u2019s expression of his view,\" Lynch said.\nThe Justice Department announced last month that no criminal charges would be brought in connection with the controversy over the IRS's targeting of nonprofit groups that were chiefly conservative in their outlook.\nThe FBI is conducting an ongoing inquiry into possible mishandling of classified information in connection with Clinton's use of a private email account during her four years as secretary of state. Some FBI agents complained that Obama's comments had the potential to undercut the agency's work.\nLater in the hearing, Lynch said she was unaware of any effort by the White House to interfere with the email investigation, but she declined to discuss where the probe stands or how long it is likely to take. \"I\u2019m not able to comment on the status of that matter,\" she said.\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "&quot;I really don\u2019t have a comment on the president\u2019s expression of his view,&quot; Loretta Lynch said", "title": "Lynch: Obama remarks don&apos;t affect probes", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2015/11/lynch-obama-remarks-dont-affect-probes-215973", "topics": ["economy", "surveillance/privacy"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Susan Rice", "Kenneth P.

The law also imposes new requirements on insurance plans on what they must cover, and says\u00c2\u00a0they must price coverage equally regardless of people\u2019s medical history, and these affect everyone who gets insurance on their own.\nIt\u2019s true that the law has made a significant dent in the number of people without insurance, and made sweeping changes to the way coverage operates in America. For critics, the issue isn\u2019t how many people it\u2019s covered \u2013\u00c2\u00a0it\u2019s how many have been left behind.\nRepublican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, speaking after Mr. Dach, pointed to Congressional Budget Office estimates suggesting that as many as 35 million people are still without coverage, and 27 million will be uninsured five years from now, to argue\u00c2\u00a0the health law has required too much to do too little.\n\u201cIt is an incredible amount of disruption to still have that many people uncovered when all is said and done,\u201d he said. Mr. Thune said that Republican replacements for the law all aim to find some way of providing insurance for people with pre-existing conditions that once could have barred them from buying insurance on their own, but with relaxed requirements on what coverage must include, as a way of bringing the price down.\nMORE FROM WSJ CEO COUNCIL:\nTop Clinton Adviser Says Wealthy Should Pay More in Taxes\nObama Adviser Furman Sees Limited Economic Impact From Paris Attacks\nDefense Chief Ash Carter Calls on Europe to Do More to Confront ISIS\nMarco Rubio Says GOP Rivals Tried to Weaken U.S. Intelligence Efforts\n______________________________________________________\n2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll Standings\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.\nCapital Journal Daybreak Newsletter: Sign up to get the latest on politics, policy and defense delivered to your inbox every morning.\nFor the latest Washington news, follow @wsjpolitics\nFor outside analysis, follow @wsjthinktank", "byline": "", "description": "By now, supporters and opponents of\u00a0the Affordable Care Act\u00a0often divide along \"glass half full or half empty\" lines over similar facts, and each perspective was on display at the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/specialcoverage/ceo-council-2015\">Wall Street Journal CEO Council</a>\u00a0on Tuesday.\n\n\"We believe coverage in general has been improved\" by the 2010 law, said Health and Human Services senior counselor Leslie Dach. \"That's an important beginning.", "title": "At WSJ CEO Council, Health Law\u2019s Success Depends on Which Number You Prefer", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/17/at-wsj-ceo-council-glass-is-half-full-or-half-empty-on-health-law/", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "health"], "people": ["Ash Carter", "Marco Rubio", "John Thune"], "org": "wsj", "election_confidence": 0.8322229528304158, "authors": [{"author_id": 1141, "fullname": "louise radnofsky", "primary_org": "wsj"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 17:01:38", "orgs": ["WSJ", "U.S. Department of Health and Human Services", "Health and Human Services", "Congressional Budget Office", "Capital Journal", "Medicaid", "HealthCare", "GOP"], "article_id": "1aeb56b9db98d1b0a0eb823a4444e624", "date_access": "2015-11-17 18:04:02.405423"}, {"body": "Washington (CNN)Sarah Palin slammed President Barack Obama's \"naivet\u00e9\" for calling on states to take in Syrian refugees and said that governors who vowed to block their entry are \"our last line of defense when it comes to taking in those who have not been vetted.\"\n\"There is no process to vet \u2014 get rid of the bad guys \u2014 before they step foot on our soil,\" the former vice presidential candidate said in an interview with Fox News' \"Fox and Friends\" Tuesday morning. \"It is our Republican governors who are so strong on this and so correct when it comes to who's authority actually, it is to make sure that the people that they're serving are safe.\"\nAsked who of the Republican presidential candidates is the \"strongest\" on national security, Palin named Texas Sen.
