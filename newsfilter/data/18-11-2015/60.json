[{"body": "Washington (CNN)Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal on Tuesday announced he was ending his campaign for president.\n\"This is not my time,\" Jindal told Fox News' Bret Baier. \"I've come to the realization that this is not my time. So I've come here to announce that I am suspending my campaign for president of the United States.\"\nJindal, 44, was once seen as a rising star in the Republican Party and a strong contender for the White House. The Brown University graduate and Rhodes Scholar was viewed as a strong voice for a Republican Party looking to reach out to minorities and broaden its base.\nHe rose to prominence at the start of President Barack Obama's first term and was given a major spot delivering the Republican Party's rebuttal to the State of the Union address in 2009, but delivered a widely-panned performance.\nJindal's presidential campaign never gained traction as he, along with other establishment Republican candidates, fell victim to the GOP's desire for outsider candidates such as Donald Trump and Ben Carson, who have never held public office.\nHe never topped 2% in any CNN/ORC poll and never advanced past the \"undercard\" round at the Republican debates held thus far.\nA top adviser to Jindal told CNN he may endorse one of his former Republican rivals. But if he does, it will not be imminent.\nHe has a respectable following among some Iowa conservative activists, the product of spending years planning a presidential run.\nHe is the latest governor to drop out of the race, following Scott Walker and Rick Perry. One adviser said Jindal believes government experience is needed in a presidential candidate, so he is more likely to back Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio than Trump or Carson, the two leading candidates in the race.\nJindal reached his decision, two aides said, because he didn't want to go into debt and realized there was no credible path to the nomination.\nAs he left the Fox News studio in Washington Tuesday night, a CNN reporter asked Jindal about who would be the Republican nominee.\n\"It's not going to be Trump,\" Jindal said. \"It'll be somebody else.\"", "byline": "", "description": "Louisiana Gov.

Bobby Jindal dropped out of the 2016 race for president Tuesday, ending a campaign that failed to gain much support among Republicans sifting through a long list of contenders for the GOP nomination.\n\"I've come to the realization that this is not my time,\" Jindal said on Fox News Channel as he announced the decision to suspend his campaign.\nThe 44-year-old governor said he wasn't ready to endorse another candidate, but intended to support the eventual Republican presidential nominee.\nTerm-limited and out of office in January, Jindal said he will work with a think tank he started a few years ago, called America Next, to devise what he called \"a blueprint for making this the American century.\"\n\"Going forward, I believe we have to be the party of growth and we can never stop being the party that believes in opportunity. We cannot settle for the left's view of envy and division,\" Jindal said in a statement.\nThe nation's first elected Indian-American governor, Jindal focused his entire campaign effort on Iowa, first courting evangelical voters and then trying to broaden his appeal as a candidate with conservative policy plans that others weren't offering.\nBut he never won much support in Iowa or elsewhere against higher-profile Republican candidates such as Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.\nJindal's low poll numbers kept him off the main debate stages where he could have drawn more attention, and his fundraising lagged. He was facing a major cash crunch to keep the campaign going, after wrapping up the last fundraising period with $261,000 on hand.\nHe also was saddled with low approval ratings and criticism about his governing back in Louisiana, which followed him as he campaigned for the White House.\nJindal's advisers blamed finances as well as the debate criteria that locked him out of the prime-time events for the governor's decision to exit the competition.\n\"He's been thinking about it for a few weeks,\" said campaign strategist Curt Anderson. \"It's not easy. He's a fighter and his instinct is to never give up, but also you have to be realistic in politics.\"\nTamara Scott, a national GOP committeewoman from Iowa, said the response was strong when Jindal spoke to crowds there. She said the Louisiana governor was damaged by a debate process that used national polling, rather than early state polling, to determine who appeared on the main stages.\n\"He had solutions, not just talking points,\" said Scott, who is remaining neutral in the race. \"To me this is very sad that we are losing one that really resonated well with Iowans when they got to hear him.\"\nShane Vander Hart, author of a conservative Iowa blog who recently endorsed Jindal, also expressed disappointment, saying Jindal was getting good reaction in Iowa, though he struggled to gain traction in the polls.\n\"If you've done any of his events, retail politicking is one of his strengths. People as they got to know him liked him,\" Vander Hart said.\nJindal is the third Republican contender to exit the race, all governors. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker ended their campaigns earlier this year.\nTimmy Teepell, Jindal's campaign manager and longtime political adviser, said the governor was heading home to Louisiana to announce his plan for closing a $490 million budget deficit before traveling the state as he wraps up his tenure in office.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Catherine Lucey contributed to this report from Iowa.\n___\nFollow Melinda Deslatte on Twitter at:", "byline": "", "description": "BATON ROUGE, La.

They're the neighbor from hell,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham.\nJim Cole/AP\nPresident Obama says he's intensifying his strategy against ISIS \u2014 a strategy that includes airstrikes, working with local fighters like the Kurdish Peshmerga and stepping up diplomatic efforts. But Sen. Lindsey Graham, who's running for the Republican presidential nomination, wants to the U.S. to do more. He wants to send in upwards of 10,000 ground forces as part of a coalition to fight ISIS, also known as ISIL. Graham spoke to NPR's Audie Cornish about that coalition of Arab allies, and why he says Syrian refugees coming to the U.S. are \"a symptom of a failed strategy.\"  Interview Highlights On his strategy to fight Islamic State In the eyes of the Arabs in Turkey, ISIL is a completely different threat than Saddam Hussain, than the Taliban. They're the neighbor from hell. My strategy is pretty simple: rally the region who is ready to be led because they're directly threatened by ISIL and we'll provide a thickening of the force, a capability they don't provide. On Arab allies  They've been dropping bombs, but they're not going to go in without us. ... What I would do is go to Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and the region as a whole and say we share two goals. The destruction of ISIL, which is a threat to your societies and our way of life and our homeland. And we will also work together to make sure that Iran doesn't control Syria when this is all over and Assad's got to go. If you don't put the second component on the table, the Arabs are not just going to go in and destroy ISIL and give Syria to Iran. On Syrian refugees coming to the U.S. Number one, a lot of people who are seizing on the refugee issue are demagoguing to emotions behind it, and not addressing the problem. Refugees are symptom of a failed strategy. The reason they're leaving Syria is because they're getting raped and murdered. And could ISIL integrate into this refugee population? Absolutely. So I'm calling for a time out on our refugee program until we can ensure we have proper vetting. I'm more worried about getting it right than anything else. I'm willing to give money to international organizations who are dealing with the refugees in Jordan and Turkey ... I'm willing to help the region deal with refugees but if you don't go to the source of the problems, the refugees continue to flow and eventually ISIL hits us here at home. On his viability in the 2016 race given low poll numbers I'm going to stay in this race as long as I possibly can, and here's what I think. My voice is going to resonate over time. I don't believe you can deport 11 million illegal immigrants. I think a lot of what Trump is saying about illegal immigration is hurting the party ... and I want to go on the offense against radical Islam. New Hampshire is the way forward for me. I hope to do well in Iowa, but John McCain endorsed me last week in New Hampshire, he won there twice. I've gone there a bunch \u2013- I do weddings, funerals, bar mitzvahs, friendly divorces. If you're in New Hampshire I'm coming your way soon. That's whereo I think Lindsey Graham can break through.", "byline": "", "description": "Sen.

The operative, a Belgian citizen named Abdelhamid Abaaoud, was convicted in absentia in Brussels earlier this year of recruiting jihadists, was suspected of masterminding a foiled plot to behead police officers, escaped to Syria and was profiled in Islamic State\u2019s online magazine mocking European authorities for their failure to catch him. A year ago, video emerged of him in Syria, smiling as he drove a truck dragging the dead bodies of Islamic State\u2019s opponents tied to the bumper.\nMr. Abaaoud is one of two people who have emerged at the center of a probe into the attacks that killed 129 people on Friday. Both are at large. French and Belgian authorities are also searching for a 26-year-old petty criminal named Salah Abdeslam, who they say rented a car used in the attacks on Friday and is suspected of driving some of the suicide bombers through Paris. Beno\u00eet Faucon, Matthew Dalton, Stacy Meichtry and David Gauthier-Villars report.\nThe latest on the Paris attacks: World leaders pledged to seize on the Paris attacks to deepen their involvement in what looked\u00a0Monday\u00a0to be turning into more of a global campaign against the growing threat of Islamic State\u2026\u00a0The French air force carried out raids against Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa in northern Syria for the second consecutive day, as the U.S. stepped up attacks on Islamic State\u2019s industrial base, striking more than 100 oil tanker trucks \u2026 French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande vowed to adopt hard-line security powers in an attempt to reassure a nation traumatized by the Paris attacks that left at least 129 people dead \u2026Islamic State militants vow in a video released\u00a0on Monday to launch terror attacks in Washington and Rome similar to the violence that erupted\u00a0Friday in Paris and killed at least 129 people.\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 Turkish officials revealed that they had identified one of the Paris assailants as a terrorism suspect and notified French authorities twice to no avail, highlighting intelligence lapses that plague cooperation among Western allies amid mounting security risks from extremist militants\u00a0\u2026 The Paris attacks have jolted Germany into considering greater military involvement in the fight against Islamic State, despite public opposition to abandoning its largely pacifist foreign policy\u00a0\u2026 Here\u2019s what we know about the attackers \u2026 The probe to find the network behind\u00a0Friday\u2019s\u00a0attacks in Paris quickly led to Molenbeek, a small neighborhood near the historic center of the Belgian capital\u2026 As more information surfaced Monday about the Paris victims, a theme emerged: They were mostly young people, killed while having a night on the town.\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry made an unannounced stop in Paris on Monday to meet with French officials and demonstrate U.S. support after Friday\u2019s attacks.\nJAY SOLOMON: IS IRAN\u2019S RESOLUTE SUPPORT FOR SYRIA\u2019S ASSAD A DEAL BREAKER?\nIran is holding firm that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad be allowed to run in any future elections in his country, presenting a potentially fatal blow to renewed international talks aimed at ending the Syrian civil war. On Saturday, 17 countries met in Vienna, including the U.S., Russia and Iran, and outlined a framework for reaching a cease-fire in Syria and then a political transition. Left unresolved, according to diplomats who attended, is what happens to Mr. Assad. The U.S. and its closest Middle East allies, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar, have demanded that Mr. Assad leave office as part of efforts to reconcile Syria\u2019s warring factions. But a leading Iranian diplomat at the Vienna talks, however, reaffirmed Tehran\u2019s position that foreign powers cannot decide to bar Mr. Assad from future elections, Jay Solomon reports.

High-ranking Republicans in Congress also are considering ways to stop the efforts to settle migrants, and a number of GOP presidential candidates on Monday took a similarly hard line. The partisan battle over accepting Syrian refugees began in earnest after authorities in Paris said one of the suspects in the attacks that left 129 dead may have entered France as a refugee. As a result, the already volatile politics of the refugee crisis, and immigration in general, have become vastly more complicated by the addition of a national-security threat. Byron Tau and Kristina Peterson report.\nPARIS ATTACKS SPUR HARSHER TONE FROM GOP CANDIDATES: As a fervid debate over illegal immigration roils the GOP presidential primary, the terrorist attacks in Paris are pushing candidates to take a harder line\u2014a tack some Republicans worry will hamstring their nominee in the general election. Most Republicans seeking the White House have called for President Obama to shelve his plan to admit about 10,000 refugees of the Syrian civil war. The rhetoric escalated in the wake of reports linking one of the suicide bombers to a passport from a Syrian seeking asylum. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Texas Sen.

Mr. Bortnikov said authorities had evidence that the Airbus A321 was downed by a homemade bomb, carrying the explosive equivalent of up to one kilogram of TNT. Andrey Ostroukh reports.\nHOW TO FORM AN ARMY TO FIGHT ISIS:\u00a0It took French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande to flatly declare it: In the wake of the terror attacks in Paris, the struggle against Islamic State isn\u2019t merely a fight. It is a war. There\u2019s no shortage of aggrieved or alarmed nations to engage in this war, nor of planes to do their part in waging it from the air. What is lacking is an actual army to fight it. \u201cThe fundamental problem,\u201d says Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, \u201cis we still don\u2019t have a ground partner.\u201d The principal goal of President Obama as well as European and Sunni Arab leaders now has to be fixing that problem.

When big business wants the government funded no matter what and social conservatives refuse to budge on Planned Parenthood funding, you see the tension.  One of the uniting forces in Republican politics, at least since the Vietnam War, has been foreign policy. The GOP, even considering some strong isolationist roots, generally has identified itself as the party of a robust defense and a hardline stance on national security.  Just look at how quickly the 2016 presidential candidates and legislative leaders lined up behind a moratorium on accepting Syrian refugees.  But as we saw in a counter-volley Monday in the escalating conflict between Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, a probable final pairing for the nominating contest, national security is becoming increasingly fraught as a topic.  While this ideological split is not new, two events \u2013 the Iraq war and Edward Snowden\u2019s revelation of the extent of domestic spying \u2013 have sharpened the contours of the disagreement.  The refusal of all but a few third-tier candidates to commit to more ground troops for Syria and Iraq tells you the political effect of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq itself.  And now, here comes Snowden.  Speaking at a WSJ event, Rubio blasted Cruz for the Texas senator\u2019s vote in favor of a measure which stopped the federal government from what is euphemistically called \u201cbulk data collection\u201d but was scattershot domestic surveillance which remained available to be searched by investigators to try to \u201cconnect the dots.\u201d\nGiven that the strongest proponent of the domestic spying, Jeb Bush, and its strongest detractor, Rand Paul, are diminished, we have not heard that much about the issue. But Rubio reintroduced it with a sonic boom.  Rubio\u2019s accusation is that Cruz, who voted with libertarian-minded Paul to end the program \u201cweakening our intelligence-gathering capabilities\u201d which \u201cleaves America vulnerable.\u201d To level that charge when Americans are on high alert in the wake of the Paris attacks is a gloves-off move from Rubio, who found himself last week on the receiving end of a Cruz attack on \u201camnesty.\u201d  Now, while the charges are potentially incendiary, Republicans can at least be glad that they are fighting on issues of substance rather than the efficacy of a belt buckle at stopping a stabbing. Plus, on the issues of not just domestic surveillance but also how large the U.S. footprint in Iraq as Syria should be, these are fights the GOP needs to sort out.  The Cruz/Rubio duel has started sooner than expected and with plenty of intensity. This is likely just an early flare-up, but if it hints at what the two 44-year-old senators are going to be throwing down later, the Republican electorate will be treated to what promises to be a pointed and maybe even smart debate about its future.  Trump wants U.S., allies to buy \u2018a big, beautiful safe zone\u2019 for refugees in Syria - NYT: \u201c \u2018I predicted Osama bin Laden,\u2019 Mr. Trump declared in Knoxville, adding, \u2018In my book, I predicted terrorism. Because I can feel it, like I feel a good location, O.K.?\u2019 \u2018In real estate \u2014 my father always used to tell people, \u2018You know, he may be my son, but everything he touches turns to gold,'\u2018 Mr. Trump said. His father helped him begin his real estate career with a loan. \u2018When my father said that, that was a great compliment because he was a tough cookie. He said, \u2018He has an instinct for location.\u2019 You have an instinct about things. I really believe I have an instinct for this kind of thing.\u2019\u201d  Fiorina aces it with millennials in FBN debate - Fox Business: \u201cThe College Republican National Committee (CRNC) along with G2 Analytics hosted a web-based focused group during the FOX Business Network and Wall Street Journal debate surveying both Republican and Independent Millennial voters. In data provided exclusively to FOXBusiness.com, the CRNC found that overall Millennials aged 18-29 resonated the most with Carly Fiorina during the debate, with 81% more likely to support her.\u00a0The top five candidates that Millennials resonated with: Carly Fiorina, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, Dr. Ben Carson, Florida Senator Marco Rubio and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Written responses in the poll cited Fiorina as articulating her positions and policies clearly and providing answers that were solutions oriented.\u201d  Jeb\u2019s PAC burning through fat stacks of cash - Politico: \u201cAccording to media buyers and a POLITICO review of TV ad purchase data, Bush and his allies are on pace to spend $5 million more than Team Rubio on broadcast, cable and radio ads through the first four voting states \u2013 but for that sum, they will put fewer ads on the airwaves. That\u2019s because the vast majority of Bush\u2019s ads are paid for by his super PAC \u2013 roughly 85 percent for Bush versus only 40 percent for Rubio \u2013 and super PACs get far less bang for their buck.\u201d  You\u2019re going to want to bookmark this \u2013 Real Clear Politics has launched its delegate tracker for the 2016 GOP nomination. You\u2019ll be back\u2026  WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026 Is Martin Scorsese the best filmmaker of the last 50 years? If you look at \u201cGoodfellas,\u201d \u201cCasino,\u201d \u201cThe Departed\u201d and \u201cThe Last Waltz\u201d one would be sorely tempted to say so, especially American males, whom Scorsese treated to riveting action, macho codes of honor and stunning beauties. And given his peer group, which included Brian De Palma, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, Scorsese seems almost more remarkable for his ability to shine. But if you watched \u201cNew York, New York\u201d or suffered through the gritty grind of both \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and \u201cRaging Bull\u201d in close proximity, you might think that Scorsese was impossibly overrated. But whatever you think, he made this perfect scene. Happy birthday, Martin Scorsese.

The foundation had neglected to state its government funding separately from other funding sources in its original returns. The foundation also revealed that it raised $177 million in 2014, the year before Hillary Clinton announced her run for the presidency\u2026Critics have said that the foundation's dealings during her tenure as secretary of state represented a conflict of interest.\u00a0Critics have also slammed the foundation after it admitted earlier this year that it had not complied with an ethics agreement that had been insisted upon by the Obama administration and signed by Clinton prior to becoming secretary of state.\u201d  What they meant to say\u2026 - Forbes breaks down the amendments to the Clinton Foundation\u2019s reporting in three consecutive years it received\u00a0\u201cno donations from foreign government sources\u201d and to speeches by Bill, Hillary and Chelsea that were reported as charitable contributions, but actually, the speech fees were\u00a0payments for services.  Email from top aide says Hillary \u2018often confused\u2019 - The Hill: \u201cFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was \u201coften confused,\u201d according to a 2013 email from her longtime aide Huma Abedin\u2026 The comment\u2026was revealed on Monday following a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit from conservative legal group Judicial Watch.\u00a0In the\u00a0Jan. 26, 2013, message, Abedin gave the note about Clinton while discussing the secretary\u2019s schedule with another Clinton aide, Monica Hanley.  \u2018Have you been going over calls with her for tomorrow?\u2019 Abedin asked Hanley. \u2018So she knows [then-Indian Prime Minister Manmohan] singh is at 8?\u2019\n\u2018She was in bed for a nap by the time I heard that she had an 8am call,\u2019 Hanley responded. \u2018Will go over with her.\u2019\n\u2018Very imp to do that,\u2019 Abedin said in response. \u2018She\u2019s often confused.\u2019  The email was sent to Abedin via the email address that she kept on Clinton\u2019s personal server.\u201d  Gore still cool to Hillary - An aide to the former Vice President Al Gore told Politico he\u2019ll stay on the sidelines until his party has selected its nominee. \u201cGore\u2019s reticence, his friends and allies say, is in part to maximize his own leverage on fighting climate change. But\u2026also reflect[s] a complicated relationship with [Hillary]\u2026 [A] rivalry started when the two baby boomer policy wonks arrived in the White House in 1993. Gore got the new administration\u2019s environmental and technology portfolios. Bill Clinton raised eyebrows by assigning his wife what would become an ill-fated attempt to pass comprehensive health-care reform legislation\u2026Gore\u2019s own efforts to take the next big step in his political career suffered in no small part because of the roller coaster politics associated with the Lewinsky saga and the general drama that has become synonymous since then with anyone running for office named Clinton.\u201d  Too little, too late for Marty O? - Baltimore Sun: \u201cTrailing in polling and fundraising,\u00a0Martin O'Malley's presidential campaign is shifting staff from its Baltimore headquarters to early primary states such as Iowa. The shift comes just days after O'Malley's performance at the second debate was widely praised. Yet his campaign has struggled to raise the money needed to mount a campaign --\u00a0reporting less than $1 million on hand at the end of the third quarter.\u201d  SOUND OFF: READERS RESPOND TO THE 2016 POWER INDEX \u201cWith Islamic terrorism now the preeminent national issue, the GOP needs to nominate its best informed and fluent foreign policy candidates \u2013 Marco Rubio and Carly Fiorina \u2013 as the 2016 \u2018ticket\u2019.\u201d\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Jim Hartman  \u201cWhile I am having difficulty making a selection for the Republican candidate, I have begun to think that after the Friday massacres in France we need a very strong leader.\u00a0 It is now my thought that Chris Christie might be that guy.\u00a0 He certainly could debate Hillary Clinton also.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Chloe Gardner  \u201cRecent events have painfully illuminated the seriousness of the upcoming presidential election in terms of national security, the economy, and international relations and entanglements. Hopefully, we can count on sober voters to end their adolescent flirtations and give consideration to the most serious candidates as balloting dates approach.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Mary Heller  \u201cI understand why your index puts Cruz ahead of Rubio, but I feel that those who favor Cruz fail to understand that he is too extreme to win over unaffiliated voters in the general election.\u00a0Isn't the choice made by us in the primary to put up the best candidate to win in the general election?\u201d \u2013 Salvatore Pace  \u201cYour Power Index is laughable \u00a0!! It must be put together by morons \u00a0!!!\u201d - Ernst Gehrich  \u2018IF YOUR NAME IS KEITH, THERE\u2019S A PRETTY DECENT CHANCE THAT WE WON\u2019T GET ALONG\u2019 How\u2019s the strength of the legal disclaimer on your email signature?

AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026 \u201cWhat struck me above all was not the misstatement of facts or the delusions about what\u2019s going on, it's the president\u2019s tone.

He served in the Reagan administration in posts including assistant counsel in the White House and special assistant to two attorneys general. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n(CNN)Even as the campaign for the White House shifted on its axis after the atrocities in Paris and again following the president's tantrum in Turkey -- his defenders are using the last refuge of the desperate by claiming the President's scornful mocking of slogans about \"America leading\" or \"America winning\" were taken out of context -- the basic realities of the campaign remain fixed.\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic nominee. And no one knows who will carry the GOP standard.\nAfter interviews on my radio show with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Sen. Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina and Sen. Lindsey Graham during or since the Paris attacks, the conversation has of course been about the security of Americans and the world in the face of an ISIS threat the President declared \"contained\" the morning of the Paris slaughter.\nThe Republicans all called on the President to rethink the expanded admission of Syrian refugees.\nChristie resisted the emotional appeal of orphaned children and bluntly stated that he opposed admission of any Syrian refugees whatsoever because the President's and his administration's record is so awful in following through on any program. Hard to argue with Christie, given the IRS, VA and Edward Snowden scandals.\nEven as they push for the public's attention and agreement in every setting, however, each of many GOP campaigns has to find and turn out actual voters.\nIn particular, they have to find weekly churchgoers, the most reliable of all Republican primary voters, and not just in Iowa and New Hampshire, but across all the states in the \"SEC primary\" on March 1 and the first day of \"winner-take-all primaries\" on March 15.  How to find these specific people?\nMy longtime friend Jonathan Bock in Los Angeles, whose Grace Hill Media has been successfully marketing big studio releases to Christian churches and audiences for two decades, has just launched an intriguing new technology that goes far beyond generating a mailing list of people who tell pollsters they attend church.\nHis Christians in Churches (CiC) platform is a mobile advertising technology that he says is able to create exquisitely precise audiences based on their physical attendance at one of 300,000-plus churches around the country.\n\"Could your technology work for campaigns?\" I asked him. \"Could you find my Presbyterians -- PCA not PCUSA -- in Florida who are there every week, or Catholics who attend Mass every Sunday (or Saturday night) in Manchester?\"\nOf course, he replied. And, Republicans take note, this is not just a technological advancement that can help you. Democrats are not unaware of the developments in microtargeting by faith.\nThe research that went into creating CiC, Bock said, indicates that while 46% of those who attend church at least once a week are registered Republicans, more than a third -- 36% -- are Democrats. After the success the Obama campaign had in harnessing digital technology in 2008 and 2012, the Clinton team will also be mining the church attendance data.\nSo what exactly can CiC do?\n\"Besides church attendance,\" Jon explained, \"CiC's technology uses other attributes to hypertarget their audience: like demographics (gender, age), religious denominations, frequency of attendance and other places patronized in the last nine months (restaurants, movie theaters, sports venues, schools, you name it.)\n\"So for example,\" he continued, \"suppose you are a political campaign and want to target ads at politically active mothers of young kids in Iowa City who go to a Presbyterian church every week. CiC's technology can serve that up based on church attendance, weekday proximity to elementary schools (dropping kids off and picking them up at 8 a.m. and 3 p.m.) and these moms' appearances at campaign rallies over the last few months.\"\nOf course, there is a website: www.ChristiansInChurches.com.  The vaunted \"voter vaults\" of a decade ago are as old as dial-up now. With news cycles shorter than ever, the campaigns that manage their marketing of timely messages to the most reliable voters are going to win the political battles that begin with the Iowa caucus in February.\nThe election changed last Friday, just as sermons did on Sunday and news coverage through today and beyond. But the blocking and tackling of the election didn't change --the imperative to turn out your likeliest voters. The meta-messaging that candidates have been using on my show and on others, and via speeches, is intended to move a voter towards them. Now their campaigns must touch those voters, tag them, and bag them in February and March.\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "GOP campaign's real focus: Iowa, not Syria", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/17/opinions/hewitt-syria-gop-get-out-the-vote/index.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Chris Christie", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Lindsey Graham", "Hugh Hewitt", "Carly Fiorina", "Edward Snowden", "Ted Cruz"], "org": "cnn", "election_confidence": 0.8390693440955025, "authors": [{"author_id": 38859, "fullname": "hugh hewitt", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 22:50:59", "orgs": ["SEC", "IRS", "Reagan", "GOP", "PCA"], "article_id": "02d4568a3b66a4bb487238fba948cf65", "date_access": "2015-11-17 23:22:10.796197"}, {"body": "WASHINGTON U.S. lawmakers called on Tuesday for even tighter scrutiny of Syrian refugees fleeing to the United States as last week's deadly Paris attacks recast America's long-running debate over immigration and national security.\nRepublican leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives, worried about Islamist attacks following Friday's killings of 129 people in France, threatened to suspend President Barack Obama's efforts to allow 10,000 more Syrian refugees into the country.\nDemocrats also called for close vetting of refugees from the four-year-old civil war in Syria in case they are linked to extremist groups such as Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the Paris killings.\nThe attacks focused the spotlight in Washington on national security with the November 2016 presidential election campaign heating up and Obama in the final year of his presidency.\n\"This is a moment where it is better to be safe than sorry,\" the Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters.\nSeparately, two influential senators, Republican Jeff Flake and Democrat Tim Kaine, responded to the Paris attacks by renewing their push for Congress to vote on a formal authorization for the use of military force for the campaign against Islamic State.\nBut most of the emphasis in the Republican-controlled Congress has been on the backlash against Syrian refugees.\nRyan called for a pause in Obama's program, announced in September, to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees in a year. The number of Syrians destined for the United States is low compared with figures in European countries such as Germany.\nThe issue has challenged America's image of itself as a nation that welcomes downtrodden newcomers, with some lawmakers suggesting all Syrians should be barred, or that Christian Syrians should be favored over Muslims.\nRepublican Senator John McCain on Tuesday backed scrupulous vetting but strongly opposed such discrimination.\n\"All of us are God\u2019s children ... so I disagree with that assumption that only Christian children should be able to come to the United States,\" he told Reuters.\nRepublicans and Democrats have both voiced fears that housing refugees from a conflict zone in the Middle East could  leave the country open to attacks like those staged by al Qaeda  on Sept. 11, 2001.\nSenator Ben Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said Washington should look at the strongest possible vetting process to ensure \"terrorists cannot get into the United States through our refugee program.\"\nThe current U.S. screening process takes 18 to 24 months and is tighter than that in Europe, he said.\nOther Western countries have begun to question their willingness to admit Syrians after reports that at least one of the Paris attackers passed through Greece in October.\nThe White House National Security Council said it was continuing to look for ways to tighten screening.\nSenior Obama administration officials including Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson held a classified briefing on Tuesday evening for all 435 members of the House about the aftermath of the Paris attacks. But many Republicans remained deeply concerned.\n\"I have great concerns about allowing people on our shores without knowing that we're able to find out information about them,\" said Republican Representative Matt Salmon. \"I'm leaving this briefing far less comfortable than when I came in.\"\nIMMIGRATION FIGHTS\nU.S. politicians have debated for years over immigration, most recently about Latin Americans who entered the country illegally.\nConservative Republicans in the 2016 White House race are offering competing plans to limit illegal immigration. Republican presidential campaign front-runner Donald Trump has threatened to deport the 11 million already in the United States.\nRepublican presidential candidate Jeb Bush broke with rivals by saying he would support the entry of some Syrian refugees but stressed that screening must be tough enough to bar militants.\nWorrying refugee advocates, at least 26 mostly Republican governors say they are concerned about people resettling in their states after fleeing Syria's four-year-old civil war, saying some could be associated with Islamic State. Other governors, mostly Democrats, have said Syrians are welcome.\nSecretary of State John Kerry said that of 785,000 refugees accepted since 2001, only 12 \"were found to perhaps be problematic with respect to potential terror.\"\nBut he told NBC that while screening is effective it will have to be increased and \"will probably go slower and cost more money.\"\nRyan did not offer details about proposed legislation to pause Obama's refugee plan, but said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that he would bring it to the House floor on Thursday.\nHe said he had spoken to the White House, congressional Democrats and senators about the bill.\nSeveral other Republicans are pushing to include a provision to block the resettlement of Syrians in a trillion-dollar budget bill that must be passed, and signed into law by Obama, by Dec. 11.\nOthers have proposed measures setting strict conditions on admitting Syrians, such as requiring the FBI director to certify that refugees' background checks have been completed, and an audit of the vetting process.\nThe Senate, where Republicans hold a smaller majority than in the House, would also have to approve any legislation before it could take effect. Rhetoric there has been less heated than in the House.\nA plan by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to accept 25,000 Syrian refugees by the end of the year ran into trouble on Monday as some local leaders said the timeline is too short.\n(Additional reporting by Richard Cowan, David Lawder and Susan Cornwell; Writing by Alistair Bell; Editing by Howard Goller, James Dalgleish and Ken Wills)", "byline": "", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers called on Tuesday for even tighter scrutiny of Syrian refugees fleeing to the United States as last week's deadly Paris attacks recast America's long-running debate over immigration and national security.", "title": "Paris attacks reshape U.S. debate on immigration, security", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/jl7wi84m4eM/story01.htm", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["John Kerry", "Howard Goller", "David Lawder", "Ben Cardin", "James Dalgleish", "Jeb Bush", "Justin Trudeau", "Jeh Johnson", "Donald Trump", "Matt Salmon", "Barack Obama", "Paul Ryan", "Ken Wills", "Richard Cowan", "Susan Cornwell", "Alistair Bell"], "org": "reuters", "election_confidence": 0.5448428293822747, "authors": [{"author_id": 33517, "fullname": "patricia zengerle", "primary_org": "reuters"}, {"author_id": 33445, "fullname": "megan cassella", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-11-18 01:21:58", "orgs": ["Congress", "Senate", "al Qaeda", "U.S. House of Representatives", "Foreign Relations Committee", "Homeland Security", "United States.", "FBI"], "article_id": "f105c042658c9f3a7a0e9a9d43c01a5c", "date_access": "2015-11-18 01:48:40.418413"}, {"body": "11/17/15 03:32 PM EST\nBy\nEliza Collins\nThomas\u2019 husband is conservative Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas.\n11/17/15 03:20 PM EST\nBy\nHadas Gold\nGawker Media plans to shift the focus of its flagship site Gawker.com to politics, editors at the company announced in memos to staff on Tuesday.\n11/17/15 02:44 PM EST\nBy\nNick Gass\nAfter the Paris attacks, the Republican field is taking a tougher stance against the refugees.\n11/17/15 02:41 PM EST\n11/17/15 02:12 PM EST\nBy\nBurgess Everett\nThe gathering is slated to be held in Baltimore on  Jan. 13 and 14.\nUpdated 11/17/15 02:01 PM EST\nBy\nJosh Gerstein\nLynch says the Justice Department plans to comply with provisions in the current National Defense Authorization Act.\n11/17/15 02:00 PM EST\nBy\nIsaac Arnsdorf\nSpace bill passes, casino bill fails \u2014 Brady fundraiser\n11/17/15 01:33 PM EST\nBy\nNahal Toosi\n\"We don\u2019t want to send refugees anywhere where they would not be welcomed,\" one official said.\n11/17/15 01:32 PM EST\nBy\nNick Gass\nHis statement differs from a campaign ad released earlier in the day.\n11/17/15 12:55 PM EST\nBy\nKenneth P.

The executive body represents the almost 2 million workers represented by the union.\n\"Hillary Clinton has proven she will fight, deliver and win for working families,\" SEIU International President Mary Kay Henry said in a statement. \"SEIU members and working families across America are part of a growing movement to build a better future for their families, and Hillary Clinton will support and stand with them. This movement for economic, racial, immigrant and social justice is poised to turn out to vote in November with their families and communities and keep pushing elected officials to deliver once in office.\"\nClinton praised the SEIU's endorsement in a statement released by her campaign, saying she was \"deeply honored.\"\n\"As president, I will be proud to stand with SEIU and fight alongside them -- to defend workers' right to organize and unions' right to bargain collectively, to raise incomes for working people and the middle class, and to ensure that hardworking Americans can retire with dignity and security,\" Clinton said.\nThe endorsement comes far earlier in the Democratic nominating process than it did in 2008, when the union picked then-Sen. Barack Obama over Clinton in February of that year.\nThe national endorsement is not binding to state and local SEIU chapters -- a local chapter in New Hampshire, for example, endorsed Sanders earlier this month -- but the national endorsement comes with more infrastructure, money and organization than the local backing.\nIn order to make their decision, SEIU held a 1,200-member conference in March and conducted three national member polls from fall 2014 to fall 2015.\nCoupled with their endorsement, SEIU released a video touting their endorsement that features members describing why they support the former secretary of state.\nThe SEIU endorsement comes less than a month after AFSCME, the largest trade union of public employees in the United States, endorsed Clinton and gives the Democratic front-runner a credible claim on having the bulk of organized labor behind her.\nThe American Federation of Teachers, a group that has long supported Clinton, also backed the former secretary of state in July.\nSanders has responded to the wealth of union endorsements by claiming that whole union leadership is with Clinton, it is the members on the ground that are behind him.\n\"Bernie is proud to have the grassroots support of tens of thousands of working families in AFSCME and other unions,\" Sanders' spokesman Michael Briggs said in response to Clinton's endorsement last month.", "byline": "", "description": "Hillary Clinton won the endorsement of the nation's top service employee union on Tuesday, solidifying her lock on organized labor over Bernie Sanders, her top Democratic opponent in 2016.", "title": "SEIU endorses Clinton for president", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/17/politics/hillary-clinton-seiu-endorsement-2016/index.html", "topics": ["trade", "economy"], "people": ["Mary Kay Henry", "Bernie Sanders", "Barack Obama", "Hillary Clinton", "Michael Briggs"], "org": "cnn", "election_confidence": 0.6125216611897571, "authors": [{"author_id": 2532, "fullname": "dan merica", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 17:50:12", "orgs": ["American Federation of Teachers", "AFSCME", "SEIU"], "article_id": "e56b7ebe7025b9a7e9603f2f28dc552e", "date_access": "2015-11-17 18:01:19.078809"}, {"body": "Investigation\nHer legislation on banking and housing finance stalled as crisis escalated.\nBy\nJeff Gerth\nNovember 15, 2015\nGetty\nUnder attack during Saturday night\u2019s Democratic debate over her historical reliance on campaign contributions from Wall Street, Hillary Clinton said she isn\u2019t influenced by such donations and would be at least as tough on the industry as her opponents.\n\u201cYou can look at what I did in the Senate,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI did introduce legislation to rein in compensation. I looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena. And specifically said to Wall Street, that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\nYet an examination of Clinton\u2019s remarks to Wall Street in December 2007 and her actions as a New York senator\u2014a period when she had the best opportunity to translate her words into deeds\u2014presents a more mixed picture of her record on the financial industry.\nThe bills Clinton introduced on banking and housing finance got no traction. When she had a chance to support a 2007 bill that aimed to curb a tax break she publicly decried for hedge-fund and private-equity executives, she failed to sign on.\nClinton also has some history with the shadow-banking world she says is a continuing risk to the financial system. While in the Senate, she made a little-noticed overture to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who was involved in talks to rescue giant insurer AIG with government funds. She was calling on behalf of wealthy investors who stood to lose millions and had hired two longtime Clinton associates to represent them.\n\u2018Cut it Out\u2019\nIn his most direct attack on Clinton\u2019s record to date, Sanders on Saturday suggested that she was in Wall Street\u2019s pocket.\n\u201cWhy, over her political career has Wall Street been a major\u2014the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton? You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so,\u201d the Vermont senator said.\nIn her defense, Clinton brought up her efforts to help Wall Street rebuild after the 2001 terrorist attacks, a reference that later led one panelist to suggest she was avoiding the original question. But Clinton also defended her record as tough on the banks, saying she is \u201cgoing right at them\u201d with a comprehensive plan. For the second time in the debates she referenced a speech she gave to executives before the economic meltdown. In October\u2019s debate she had described herself as going to Wall Street and saying, \u201cCut it out! Quit foreclosing on homes! Quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors.\u201d\nA review of that 28-minute talk at an office of the Nasdaq stock exchange in New York shows Clinton steered a middle ground. She presented a detailed analysis of the burgeoning dangers in the housing market and its threat to the economy. (ProPublica obtained a video of the speech, which hasn\u2019t previously been posted.)\nClinton gave a shout-out to her \u201cwonderful donors\u201d in the audience, and asked the bankers to voluntarily suspend foreclosures and freeze interest rates on adjustable subprime mortgages. She praised Wall Street for its role in creating the nation\u2019s wealth, then added that \u201ctoo many American families are not sharing\u201d in that prosperity.\nShe said the brewing economic troubles weren\u2019t mainly the fault of banks, \u201cnot by a long shot,\u201d but added they needed to shoulder responsibility for their role. While there was plenty of blame to go around for the spate of reckless lending, and while Wall Street may not have created the foreclosure crisis, it \u201ccertainly had a hand in making it worse\u201d and \u201cneeds to help us solve it.\u201d\nFinally, Clinton said, if the banks didn\u2019t take the voluntary steps she proposed, \u201cI will consider legislation to address the problem.\u201d\nBills Died\nThe lenders did not adopt Clinton\u2019s proposals. During 2007 and 2008, when the housing market collapsed and while she was also running for president, the Democrats controlled the Senate. Of the 140 bills Clinton introduced during that period, five were related to housing finance or foreclosures, according to congressional records, including one aimed at making it easier for homeowners facing foreclosure to get their loans modified. Only one of the five secured any co-sponsors -- New York Sen. Charles Schumer signed onto a bill that would have helped veterans refinance their mortgages.\n2016\nBy TODD S. PURDUM\nWashington And The World\nBy GRAEME WOOD\nWar Room\nBy MICHAEL HIRSH\nClinton also introduced in 2008 the bill she referenced Saturday, which would have curbed compensation of corporate executives.\nNo Senate committee took action on any of the bills, and they died without further discussion.\nMeanwhile the Senate moved forward on other bills with wider support. These eventually led to a sweeping housing and mortgage law signed by President Bush in July 2008. That legislation was voted on three times in the Senate in 2008, in addition to a few procedural votes related to the bill. Clinton missed votes in February and April, when she was running for president, but also missed votes in late June, after she had dropped out of the contest. On July 26, when the bill passed, Clinton was there to vote in support.\nThe bill\u2019s main sponsor, Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, summarized the bill\u2019s journey and, in a floor speech, praised 13 other senators for their help. Clinton\u2019s name wasn\u2019t among them.\nBrian Fallon, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, declined to comment for this story.\n\u2018Something Wrong\u2019\nClinton\u2019s campaign referenced her Senate record in a fact sheet issued last month titled, \u201cWall Street Should Work for Main Street.\u201d It cited one bill \u2013 the executive compensation legislation that died. It also mentioned four press releases or speeches from 2007 and 2008 \u2013 including a March 15, 2007, talk in which she proposed a series of housing initiatives and her call later that year for higher taxes on hedge fund executives.\nJeff Gerth is a senior reporter at ProPublica.

But just as his campaign enters the critical primary phase, the fallen front-runner is about to get outgunned on the airwaves by the man his campaign views as its chief rival: Marco Rubio.\nAccording to media buyers and a POLITICO review of TV ad purchase data, Bush and his allies are on pace to spend $5 million more than Team Rubio on broadcast, cable and radio ads through the first four voting states \u2013 but for that sum, they will put fewer ads on the airwaves.\nStory Continued Below\nThat\u2019s because the vast majority of Bush\u2019s ads are paid for by his super PAC \u2013 roughly 85 percent for Bush versus only 40 percent for Rubio \u2013 and super PACs get far less bang for their buck.\n\u201cA dollar is not a dollar,\u201d explained Evan Tracey, a veteran political ad buyer at National Media, a Republican media firm. \u201cCandidate dollars go much farther than super PAC dollars go.\u201d\nBy\nJosh Gerstein\nand\nKenneth P. Vogel\nIn Iowa and New Hampshire, for example, super PACs are confronting ad rates that can soar to nearly 1,000 percent more than the rates charged of candidates \u2014 an enormous markup that is sapping much of the punch from the $103 million Bush and his allies had amassed by mid-2015.\nData from GOP analytics firm Echelon Insights shows that Rubio will run at least 5,000 more broadcast TV spots than Bush in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada through February, even as the former Florida governor and his super PAC spend more overall.\nAnd that\u2019s the case despite Rubio reserving pricier prime-time advertising with bigger audiences. Echelon says Rubio has devoted 38 percent of its broadcast budget to prime time, versus 20 percent, on average, for the rest of the field. Echelon tracks only broadcast ad buys that are publicly reported to the Federal Communications Commission.\nThere are important caveats to this snapshot of the ad wars: Bush\u2019s super PAC, Right to Rise, could still redirect millions more into the crucial February states. Plus, Bush\u2019s super PAC is the only group to have reserved ads in states that will vote later, in March \u2013 nearly $15 million and counting \u2013 but those ads will only be of value if Bush remains a viable candidate then. In addition, Rubio needs to raise more money to fully fund his reservations.\nStill, that Bush \u2013 and his financial juggernaut of a super PAC \u2013 would get out-advertised in the winter of 2016 would have been unthinkable only a few months ago. But after slashing his staff dramatically this fall amid a fundraising slump, Bush\u2019s official campaign has reserved a little more than one-quarter as much airtime as Rubio: roughly $4.7 million to $16.7 million for Rubio\u2019s campaign between this week and the end of February in the first four states.\nOn the super PAC side of the ad-buying equation, Bush\u2019s team has reserved $17 million more than Rubio\u2019s outside allies in those states. But Rubio\u2019s $12 million advantage in candidate-booked ads more than makes up that difference: It is the equivalent, depending on the station, of between $24 million to $60 million in super PAC ads, as candidates are protected under federal law from TV station price-gouging but super PACs are not.\nTake the NBC affiliate in Des Moines, WHO. Over the two weeks between December 28 and January 11, Rubio will pay an average of $219 per 30-second spot while Bush\u2019s super PAC will pay nearly eight times that amount, $1,596 per 30 seconds, during the same period at the same station.\nBy\nLauren French\nThe gap is just as large within the same TV show. On the first Wednesday of 2016, for instance, Right to Rise will spend $2,750 for a single 30-second prime time ad on WHO; Rubio\u2019s campaign has booked two ads at the exact same time for $300 apiece.\nThis story repeats itself in early-state markets big and small \u2014morning, noon and night.\nAt KTIV in Sioux City, Rubio\u2019s campaign is paying $625 for 30 seconds on the 10 p.m. news on December 30. Bush\u2019s super PAC is paying $3,700 \u2013 a roughly 500 percent markup. The next morning, Rubio has two more 30-second ads during \u201cToday\u201d for $165 each. The rate for a single 30-second spot for Right to Rise is $650.\nIn other words, Rubio is getting twice the airtime for half the price.\nBush has long predicted that his television advertising advantage would lift his candidacy. \u201cI'm gonna do something really novel,\u201d he said last month in Iowa. \u201cIt's called advertising.\u201d So far, though, Right to Rise has spent more on television ads than any of his competitors \u2013 more than $17 million to date \u2013 only to see Bush flatline in the polls both nationally and in early states.\nInside the Bush operation, there is already some quiet grumbling about why Right to Rise, run by longtime Bush operative Mike Murphy, sat idle on its tens of millions during the summer \u2013 a time that saw Bush slip, Donald Trump surge, and New Hampshire rivals John Kasich and Chris Christie own that state\u2019s airwaves.\nAnd now, New Hampshire has emerged as an almost must-win state for Bush. Unfortunately for his super PAC, the state\u2019s most sought-after TV station for political ads, WMUR, has been among the most rapacious in up-charging super PACS.\nLast week, for instance, on WMUR\u2019s 5 p.m. news, the campaigns of Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Ben Carson were all paying $700 for a 30-second ad. But the nonprofit and super PAC backing Rubio and John Kasich, respectively, were paying $7,500 for 30 seconds during the same newscast. Bush\u2019s super PAC negotiated a relative bargain: only $5,000, though still more than seven times the candidate rate.\nThe Bush and Rubio campaigns declined to comment for this story.\nBut Right to Rise spokesman Paul Lindsay said it was unfair to compare super PAC and campaign ad rates. \u201cSuper PAC spending and campaign spending should always be viewed separately,\u201d he said.\nViewers, however, don\u2019t differentiate between what type of entity is paying when they watch political ads, and ultimately they are slated to see more such spots from Rubio and his allies.\nLindsay said that while Bush\u2019s super PAC can\u2019t pay candidate rates, it\u2019s maximizing its financial advantage by placing large ad buy early and locking in low rates in important markets. \u201cThat has helped us get better bang for our buck than other organizations, particularly the Rubio super PAC and the Rubio dark money organization,\u201d Lindsay said.\nThat is a swipe at Rubio\u2019s supporters\u2019 use of a secretive 501(c)4 nonprofit to bolster the Florida senator. The pro-Rubio nonprofit, the Conservative Solutions Project, shares staff and a name with Rubio\u2019s super PAC, the Conservative Solutions PAC, but it does not have to disclose its donors, who paid for millions in ads that aired over the summer and fall.\n\u201cHaven't seen the Rubio press release on frugality did it include the $6 million in secret money TV ads they saved money on?\u201d Bush communications director Tim Miller wrote on Twitter last month, as the campaigns sparred about their fundraising figures.\nJeff Sadosky, a spokesman for Rubio\u2019s nonprofit and super PAC, defended the use of the nonprofit for ad buys: \u201cAs it has for the past two years, Conservative Solutions Project remains focused on one thing\u2026advocating for a conservative agenda that will solve some of the most serious issues American families are facing.\u201d\nCampaign operatives acknowledge that super PACs buying TV ads is a poor use of resources, given the huge premiums they pay. But with their ability to raise unlimited money, and the strict $2,700 limits on direct campaign donations, the responsibility for TV ads has still mostly fallen on super PACs in the closing months, with the exception of Rubio.\n\u201cIdeally, super PAC's would do the bulk of voter contact and field work, and the campaign would focus their resources on TV, since you're getting 2-3 times your value for each spot,\u201d said a GOP strategist currently running a super PAC, though not for Bush or Rubio. \u201cThat said, most campaigns don't have the resources to make sufficient media buys so it falls back on the super PAC.\u201d\nRubio, like most candidates, has not yet paid for the ads he has reserved in advance. The roughly $17 million in booked ads amounts to more money than his campaign had on hand at the end of September but because ads are paid week by week, Rubio\u2019s team has been confident it will raise the funds to fulfill his orders through February. Top Republican bundlers, including GOP financier and billionaire Paul Singer, have gravitated toward Rubio as he has risen in the polls.\nThe Rubio campaign\u2019s first flight of ads is set to hit the airwaves in Iowa and New Hampshire next week.\nDaniel Lippman contributed to this report.\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Rubio\u2019s campaign is getting twice the ads for half the price of Bush\u2019s super PAC, undercutting his rival\u2019s cash advantage.", "title": "Jeb Bush loses TV ad edge to Marco Rubio", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/marco-rubio-jeb-bush-super-pac-215962", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Jim Obergefell", "Kenneth P.

It's the company he keeps: a colony of cats, wild to most but family to Woldeyilma, whose daily care for them is about the only thing that remains static in the neighborhood they call home.\n\"It's all about money,\" he said, indicating the growth of shops, restaurants and increasingly pricey apartments around him.\nEach day, through blizzards, rainstorms and heat waves, Woldeyilma, 55, can be found in the same spot along the waterfront in Brooklyn.\nBehind him is a high, chain-link fence and a vacant lot, which someday will be part of a waterfront park. Beyond the lot, he can see colorful shipping containers of the busy port on the harbor.

Woldeyilma tried to ignore them, but eventually he began feeding them all.\nEven after he was evicted from his apartment for non-payment of rent several years ago, Woldeyilma kept returning to make sure the colony had food and water each day.\nOver the years, Woldeyilma has named the cats: Nubia, Congo, Mozambique, Miss Ethiopia, Rico, Damascus, Oprah, Castro, Princess Diana and so on. He says there are 14 in the colony, whose patriarch is Nubia, the first cat he ever fed.\nSome have died over the years, often hit by cars on the adjacent avenue. They include Addis Ababa, Mogadishu and Miss USA.\nDespite his disheveled appearance, Woldeyilma has a strict routine, and his gift of gab has earned him a following among locals.\nOn a recent afternoon, as cats lurked nearby, Woldeyilma, a U.S. citizen, discussed the presidential candidates and lamented that Vice President Joseph Biden had opted not to run.\n\"He's a nice guy, like Jimmy Carter,\" Woldeyilma said. As for Hillary Rodham Clinton, \"I don't trust her, but it's time for a woman.\"\nHe threw his head back and laughed, showing a mouth missing several teeth, when asked about Donald Trump. \"Oh, crazy,\" Woldeyilma said of the Republican candidate and his comments that Mexico was sending rapists and other criminals across the border. \"Why doesn't he apologize to Mexico?\"\nHe misses Ethiopia every day, although he no longer has contact with anyone there. Woldeyilma said he left the central African country in 1982 and made his way to Sudan, where he lived in a refugee camp on the edge of Khartoum for several years.\nIn 1987, he gained refugee status in the United States and was employed in construction in New York until an accident left him unable to work. He won $300,000 in a settlement arising from the accident but admits he spent nearly all of it in Atlantic City.\n\"It's seductive, the women, the boardwalk, the casinos,\" said Woldeyilma, who never married.\nNow, he bicycles several miles most days from his Manhattan residence to his waterfront spot to tend to the cats. Some days, he brings food for them, but he also receives regular donations from local residents.\nThey include a woman named Janine, who visits Woldeyilma most afternoons.\nShe used to spot him in her neighborhood grocery store. \"I'd walk out because I was scared of him,\" she said, as Woldeyilma laughed with her at the memory.\nEventually, her husband, a social worker, introduced her to Woldeyilma as the man who fed local stray cats.\n\"Then we all became friends,\" said Janine as she scooped food onto paper plates.\nCats slithered through the weeds and scampered across the lot behind Woldeyilma and began to eat.\n\"He helps all the people in the neighborhood,\" she said of Woldeyilma. \"He listens. He knows everybody's story.\"\n\"I see you here all the time and just thought you might like this,\" a man said one afternoon after stopping his truck and presenting Woldeyilma with a container of steaming Thai noodles from a nearby takeout restaurant.\n\"Hi, kitty kitty!\" a little girl squealed as she rode by on a bicycle with her father.\nAcross the street, an elderly man looked out his second-floor apartment window and waved a greeting to Woldeyilma.\nNot everyone is friendly.

Some Republicans in Congress are threatening a government shutdown over the issue in light of plans by the Obama administration to resettle 10,000 Syrians next year.\nIn a conference call with reporters Tuesday, senior administration officials reiterated that the federal government controls the refugee resettlement program, but they also acknowledged funding from Congress is critical to maintaining it and that local support is key to helping refugees integrate wherever they land.\n\"We don\u2019t want to send refugees anywhere where they would not be welcomed,\" one of the officials said, adding later: \"The thing I most fear about this current discussion going on in the United States is that we will lose the bipartisan support ... that (this program) has enjoyed for decades. This is a very precious thing. In the current day and age, it\u2019s been a rare thing.\"\nThe officials, all of whom spoke on condition they not be identified by name, said they will meet with lawmakers this week and also hold calls with governors and mayors to correct \"misimpressions\" about the refugee program. On Tuesday, for instance, GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has erroneously claimed some 250,000 Syrian refugees are headed for the country, tweeted, \"Refugees from Syria are now pouring into our great country. Who knows who they are \u2014 some could be ISIS. Is our president insane?\"\nSince the Syrian conflict erupted in 2011, the United States has admitted roughly 1,800 Syrian refugees, a tiny fraction of 4 million Syrians who have fled their country and registered as refugees with the United Nations. According to the U.N. and various aid agencies, another 7 million Syrians are displaced inside the Arab country, where they face dangers from both the Syrian government of Bashar Assad and groups such as the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, which is believed responsible for the Paris attacks.\nBy\nJake Sherman\nSyria's pre-war population was 23 million people, and 250,000 people have died since the conflict began there. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians -- seeing no end to the war and despairing of conditions in refugee camps -- have in recent months headed to Europe, making an often-dangerous land and sea journey. But others are still in camps or otherwise living in countries such as Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan, where their rights and mobility face restrictions.\nThousands of Syrians have already applied for resettlement, so most of the 10,000 Syrians that the Obama administration hopes to admit next year are likely going through security screening. Republican presidential candidates and others are now questioning whether those security procedures are rigorous enough, noting that it only takes one or a handful of people to carry out a terrorist attack.\n\"The problem is we can\u2019t background check them,\" Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a top GOP presidential contender, said Sunday. \"You can\u2019t pick up the phone and call Syria.\"\nAccording to the administration officials, the refugee vetting process takes an average of 18-24 months, and for Syrians it often takes longer because they face additional scrutiny. The refugees are first screened through the United Nations, which has its own vetting procedures. If they are referred to the United States for possible admission, they are then screened through a whole new process.\nThat involves checking their biographic and biometric data, as well as lengthy interviews and background checks involving multiple federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies. Some of the procedures involved are classified.\nOne way the officials screening the refugees can verify their stories is to double check the events they claim happened to them with intelligence and other known data about what was happening in Syria at the time. So if a Syrian says their home in particular neighborhood was bombed on a particular date, it's likely the defense department or other agencies can check to see if there was a bombing reported in the area at that time.\n\"Each element of the process is not the totality of the process,\" one of the officials said. \"All these things have to be synthesized and taken in the aggregate to make a decision.\"\nBy\nGabriel Debenedetti\nThe admission rate so far is just over 50 percent; the rest are either rejected or have their cases still pending, one of the officials said. Of the Syrians admitted, half are children and a quarter are adults over 60, the officials said. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for a religious breakdown, but roughly 10 percent of Syrians as a whole are Christian.\nThere are nine non-profit groups, several of them faith-based, that work with the federal government to help resettle the refugees in communities across the United States. Where a refugee is sent can depend on a range of factors, such as whether they have relatives there who can support them. If a child is a burn victim \u2014 which would not be unusual among Syrians fleeing the brutal civil war \u2014 they would likely be placed in a community with relevant medical facilities.\nTraditionally, the U.S. refugee program has had strong bipartisan support, and the numbers of Syrians is a trickle compared to the numbers of refugees admitted from other conflicts. For instance, the United States took in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Vietnam.\nOverall, the U.S. takes in 70,000 refugees a year, a number the administration planned to raise to 85,000 next year, and 100,000 the following year. Based on statistics released by the State Department, most the additional 15,000 planned for next year would not come from the Middle East. One of the administration officials on Tuesday said the U.S. has the capacity to absorb significantly more refugees than it does now, but noted that financial support makes all the difference.\n\"The program is absolutely dependent on funding from Congress,\" the official said. \"As we grow it we will require more assistance from Congress.\"\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "\"We don\u2019t want to send refugees anywhere where they would not be welcomed,\" one official said.", "title": "Obama Administration defends Syrian refugee program", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/obama-syria-refugee-program-215982", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Sara Solovitch", "Susan Rice", "Kenneth P.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a 2016 Republican presidential candidate, was among those who joined the early call in the wake of last week's terrorist attacks in Paris. But just months ago, Kasich had encouraged President Obama to accept the refugees. During a Tuesday speech at the National Press Club outlining his foreign policy agenda, Kasich called for a more robust U.S. military presence in the Middle East and pointed to his experience in Congress on the House Armed Services Committee. After his address, Kasich spoke to NPR's Audie Cornish, telling her that a critical part of U.S. success in toppling extremist organizations like ISIS would be spreading other ideas in the Middle East,including \"Jewish [and] Christian principles.\" In an interview with NBC, Kasich went even further, calling for a new U.S. agency to promote a Jewish and Christian belief system abroad in places like the Middle East, China and Russia. As for his low standing in recent polls, Kasich dismissed early national surveys and said the nominating process through Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina was \"excellent\" and would work.  Interview Highlights On why he changed his views on allowing Syrian refugees into the U.S.  Maybe there's a bit of a shift in the position, but in light of Paris and in light of the concern that people have, not just in my state but in my neighborhood, I think it's very reasonable to say that we need to have a pause. If we have a problem with our intelligence folks telling us we can't vet them, then of course we can't move forward. I don't think at this point that we should have any more come in and if we can establish proper protocols, procedures to know who they are so that we're not inviting people under the cover of refugee status who mean us harm. ... I have a big heart, and I also think I have a pretty good brain, and to me this is a very reasonable approach to take at this point in time. I think this is a reasonable approach that will strike the American people as reasonable, and let's try to improve the situation whereby we can determine who wants to come here. On a no-fly zone in Syria  I think we should establish a no-fly zone in Syria, with a sanctuary where families can be protected ... I think it's appropriate for the U.S. to increase financial assistance to countries that can keep these folks in the Middle East, in the region where they live. I was a little taken aback when the president said we should study [no-fly zones]. We should have been studying it a heck of a lot earlier once somebody like me made a suggestion that we ought to have one. These can be sanctuaries. This can be a no-fly zone that can be patrolled, and I think there is a way to invite our allies in the Middle East to make sure that those sanctuaries are safe. ... We need to support the opposition in Syria, remove [President Bashar] al-Assad. On his approach to the Middle East We win battles with bullets, but we win wars with ideas. And I think it is absolutely critical to invite our moderate Muslim friends, along with those who for centuries, have had a foundation of Jewish and Christian principles, to begin to tell the world about who we are, what we are, what we believe and why it's preferable to a force that sponsors murder [and] rape.
