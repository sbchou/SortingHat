{"body": " (CNN)The horrific terrorist attacks in Paris have abruptly elevated religious tolerance to a top political issue in the 2016 presidential campaign -- a race already heavily influenced by identity politics. \nAfter the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the mass killings that shocked France, Republican White House hopefuls pounced, leveling harsh rhetoric about Islam and calling for a much more aggressive strategy to fight the radical group known as ISIS. \nTed Cruz said the United States should deny entry to Muslim refugees from Syria, but leave the door open to fleeing Christians. Allowing tens of thousands of \"Syrian Muslims\" into the country was \"nothing short of lunacy,\" the Texas senator said, because there is no way to know who among them may be terrorists. \"It is a different situation with the Middle Eastern Christians,\" Cruz said in South Carolina.\nRepublicans to Obama: Keep Syrian refugees out\nJeb Bush echoed that view, saying U.S. efforts to assist refugees should focus on Christians.\n\"I do think there is a special important need to make sure that Christians from Syria are being protected because they are being slaughtered in the country,\" Bush said on CBS on Sunday. \"And but for us, who?\"\nDonald Trump, the Republican Party's months-long front-runner, declared that he would strongly consider closing down mosques. \"You're going to have to watch and study the mosques,\" Trump said on MSNBC Tuesday. \nMeanwhile, Republicans have mocked Democrats for refusing to label \"radical Islam\" as the enemy and force behind ISIS. Marco Rubio attacked Hillary Clinton for rejecting the term at the Democratic debate over the weekend. \n\"That would be like saying we weren't at war with Nazis because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi party, but weren't violent,\" Rubio said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \nThese comments come as a crowded field of GOP presidential candidates are fighting to win the support of Christian conservatives in early voting states like Iowa and across the South, in part by vowing to fiercely protect religious liberties. \nParis attacks become focus of 2016 race\nTrump, who regularly discusses his religion the stump, has recently taken to firing up supporters at campaign rallies by ranting against individuals and companies that he says refuse to use the phrase \"Merry Christmas.\" A significant part of Ben Carson's appeal among Christians, meanwhile, is the retired neurosurgeon's compelling story of redemption through faith. \nThe highly politicized and heightened language in the 2016 campaign has raised alarm about a potential backlash against the Muslim community and prompted calls for greater religious tolerance. \nSpeaking at a G-20 summit in Turkey, President Barack Obama chastised politicians across the aisle for advocating for a \"religious test\" for individuals fleeing persecution in war-torn countries.\n\"That's shameful. That's not American. That's not who we are,\" Obama said. The values we are fighting against ISIL for are precisely that we don't discriminate against people because of their faith. We don't kill people because they're different than us. That's what separates us from them.\"\nThe heated rhetoric since Friday's attacks in Paris is only the latest instance of heated comments toward Muslims in the 2016 campaign.\nTrump, the New York real estate mogul who has climbed to front-runner status in part through inflammatory rhetoric invoking fear about a United States under attack from outside forces, said in September that some Muslims are \"a problem.\" Carson, another unlikely presidential candidate, drew backlash when he said the United States should not elect a Muslim president.\nThe particular question of how the U.S. should respond to the flood of immigrants fleeing violence in countries like Afghanistan and Syria has partisan divides. In a CNN/ORC poll conducted in early September, most Republicans, 55%, were opposed to accepting some refugees, while the majority of Democrats, 65%, said they support it. \nConcerns about anti-Muslim sentiments bubbling up to the surface are hardly new in the United States. In the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush famously called on Americans to make a clear distinction between terrorists and people of Islamic backgrounds -- an example Obama urged Republicans to follow on Monday. \n\"The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam. That's not what Islam is all about,\" Bush said in 2001. \"Islam is peace.\" \nAt the time, Bush was anticipating anti-Muslim backlash in the aftermath of 9/11. Unlike current GOP presidential candidates, however, Bush was not in the middle of a presidential campaign. \nLast week's attacks in Paris, and the Islamic State's believed role in the killings, have once again brought the issue of religious tolerance to the forefront. \n\"They (ISIS) actually want to see an increase in Islamophobia and anti-Muslim hate crime so that that will increase their recruitment pool,\" Arsalan Iftikhar, senior editor of the Islamic Monthly, said on CNN Monday. \"So that's why it's even more important for our western nations to embrace their Muslim communities and diasporas.\"\n", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "How religion is roiling the GOP race", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/17/politics/republican-religion-muslim-paris-attacks/index.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Barack Obama", "George W.

{"body": " (CNN)Two of the country's largest and most influential religious groups, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the National Association of Evangelicals, are urging the United States not to halt the resettlement of Syrian refugees after the deadly terrorist attack in Paris last Friday.  \n\"Of course we want to keep terrorists out of our country, but let's not punish the victims of ISIS for the sins of ISIS,\" Leith Anderson, NAE president, said on Tuesday. \nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan has called for a \"pause\" in the U.S. program accepting Syrian refugees and 27 governors have said they will not welcome them, though they have little legal authority to bar the federal government from settling refugees in their states.  \nMeanwhile, almost every GOP presidential candidate has said the United States should stop admitting Syrian refugees. Ted Cruz told CNN that the country should deny entry to Muslim refugees from Syria, but leave the door open to fleeing Christians. Jeb Bush said that refugee resettlement should \"focus\" on Christians. \nTuesday's announcements from the Catholic bishops and evangelical association, which represents some 45,000 churches, put several candidates squarely at odds with their religious leaders. Sen. Marco Rubio, Bush and Chris Christie are Catholic. Cruz and Mike Huckabee are evangelicals. \n\"I am disturbed ... by calls from both federal and state officials for an end to the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the United States,\" Bishop Eusebio Elizondo, Chairman of the Catholic bishops' committee on migration, said on Tuesday.  \n\"These refugees are fleeing terror themselves -- violence like we have witnessed in Paris. They are extremely vulnerable families, women, and children who are fleeing for their lives. We cannot and should not blame them for the actions of a terrorist organization.\"\nOnly 1,500 Syrian refugees have been accepted into the United States since 2011, but the Obama administration announced in September that 10,000 Syrians will be allowed entry next year.\nAt least one of the suspects believed to be involved in the Paris terrorist attacks that killed 129 entered Europe among the current wave of Syrian refugees. He had falsely identified himself as a Syrian named Ahmad al Muhammad and was allowed to enter Greece in early October. \nBut the United States has a \"strong track record\" for screening refugee applicants, Anderson said. \n\"It is more thorough and careful than the screening for tourist and student visas to the United States. A tourist with a French passport does not need screening or a visa; a refugee from Syria must pass multiple careful tests for eligibility.\" \nElizondo echoed that thought, noting that refugees must pass security checks and multiple interviews before entering the United States. \n\"Instead of using this tragedy to scapegoat all refugees,\" the bishop continued, \"I call upon our public officials to work together to end the Syrian conflict peacefully so the close to 4 million Syrian refugees can return to their country and rebuild their homes.\"\nMany, but not all, American religious leaders have likewise called on the United States to forge ahead with plans to resettle Syrian refugees. Franklin Graham, the son of famed evangelist Billy Graham, posted this message on November 14:\n\"We cannot allow Muslim immigrants to come across our borders unchecked while we are fighting this war on terror. If we continue to allow Muslim immigration, we'll see much more of what happened in Paris -- it's on our doorstep.\"\n", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Don't scapegoat Syrian refugees, evangelicals and bishops say", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/17/politics/catholics-evangelicals-refugees/index.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Chris Christie", "Billy Graham", "Jeb Bush", "Marco Rubio", "Mike Huckabee", "Paul Ryan", "Franklin Graham", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": ["United States.", "U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops", "GOP"], "election_confidence": 0.5662879265632375, "authors": [{"author_id": 2580, "fullname": "daniel burke religion editor", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 21:09:35", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "e38166d1b47dcfd7516b8e49ac6e69de", "date_access": "2015-11-17 21:22:10.419155"},

SEIU officials said Tuesday their endorsement reflects the will of the rank-and-file members. In a release announcing the endorsement, a union spokesperson wrote of massive outreach efforts from union leadership to get the sense of which candidates members support. That included \"three national member polls\" and more than a hundred local level executive board debates and discussions.The union is an immensely powerful force in Democratic politics, and its 2 million members create a potent grassroots network for the candidates the union supports. Clinton has been very successful in earning support from labor unions despite Sanders's career street cred with the labor left, which few in Democratic politics dispute. Politico reported Tuesday that the endorsement from SEIU meant Clinton \"now has the support of unions representing about 9.5 million union members, or nearly two-thirds of the U.S.\u2019 14.6 million union workers.\"That Sanders has struggled to get the support of national unions, with their millions of dollars and millions of volunteer campaign workers, has made it even harder for his startup campaign to build out national infrastructure to compete with Clinton's.Sanders has benefited throughout his campaign from a grassroots army that tends to get very loud when national organizations they're a part of endorse Clinton. When the League Of Conservation Voters endorsed her as a champion of climate change advocates, Sanders backers from the green left inundated the group's Facebook page with criticisms, forcing the group's leaders to clarify why Clinton was the chosen candidate. The process leading to the NEA teachers union endorsement of Clinton included public infighting between union leaders and rank-and-file members who supported Sanders.Union locals have backed Sanders in New Hampshire and other states, and some rank-and-file SEIU members who back Sanders are already telling reporters they're not happy with the Clinton endorsement.\n", "title": "Sanders Campaign After SEIU Endorses Clinton: Move Along, Nothing To See Here", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/evanmcsan/sanders-campaign-after-seiu-endorses-clinton-move-along-noth", "topics": ["health", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Bernie Sanders", "Tad Devine", "Hillary Clinton", "Michael Briggs"], "orgs": ["Service Employees International Union", "NEA", "SEIU", "CLEVELAND"], "election_confidence": 0.7958807632251552, "authors": [{"author_id": 6685, "fullname": "evan mcmorris-santoro", "primary_org": "buzzfeed"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 20:50:54", "org": "buzzfeed", "article_id": "d0e4d274cdec40c5155b994841acee24", "date_access": "2015-11-17 22:11:45.302209"},

Send your questions to editor Kate Milani at kate.milani@wsj.com. We look forward to hearing from you!\nHIGHLIGHTS\nWESTERN ALLIES SOUGHT TO KILL KEY SUSPECT IN PARIS ATTACKS: An Islamic State operative suspected of helping plan the Paris attacks had been monitored in Syria by Western allies seeking to kill him in an airstrike, but they couldn\u2019t locate him in the weeks before the plot was carried out, two Western security officials said. The operative, a Belgian citizen named Abdelhamid Abaaoud, was convicted in absentia in Brussels earlier this year of recruiting jihadists, was suspected of masterminding a foiled plot to behead police officers, escaped to Syria and was profiled in Islamic State\u2019s online magazine mocking European authorities for their failure to catch him. A year ago, video emerged of him in Syria, smiling as he drove a truck dragging the dead bodies of Islamic State\u2019s opponents tied to the bumper.\nMr. Abaaoud is one of two people who have emerged at the center of a probe into the attacks that killed 129 people on Friday.

On Saturday, 17 countries met in Vienna, including the U.S., Russia and Iran, and outlined a framework for reaching a cease-fire in Syria and then a political transition. Left unresolved, according to diplomats who attended, is what happens to Mr. Assad. The U.S. and its closest Middle East allies, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar, have demanded that Mr. Assad leave office as part of efforts to reconcile Syria\u2019s warring factions. But a leading Iranian diplomat at the Vienna talks, however, reaffirmed Tehran\u2019s position that foreign powers cannot decide to bar Mr. Assad from future elections, Jay Solomon reports.

High-ranking Republicans in Congress also are considering ways to stop the efforts to settle migrants, and a number of GOP presidential candidates on Monday took a similarly hard line. The partisan battle over accepting Syrian refugees began in earnest after authorities in Paris said one of the suspects in the attacks that left 129 dead may have entered France as a refugee. As a result, the already volatile politics of the refugee crisis, and immigration in general, have become vastly more complicated by the addition of a national-security threat.

Most Republicans seeking the White House have called for President Obama to shelve his plan to admit about 10,000 refugees of the Syrian civil war.

{"body": "According to legend, if not actual historians, Harold Macmillan was once asked what he most feared could derail his agenda. The British prime minister allegedly said, \"Events, my dear boy, events.\"\nMacmillan may never have actually said it, but the quote endures because it gets at a fundamental truth of politics (and life). Facts on the ground can deliver a fatal blow to one's most cherished plans.\nThe line kept coming to mind as I listened to \nPresident Obama\n's remarkable news conference Monday from the G-20 meeting in Turkey. Asked again and again whether he underestimated the threat from \nIslamic State\n, a group he once dismissed as a \"JV team,\" the president said, in effect, \"no.\"\nOf course, he used a lot more words, but that was the gist: \"It's important for us to get the strategy right, and the strategy that we are pursuing is the right one.\" He added that \"the terrible events in Paris were obviously a terrible and sickening setback.\"\nCritics who disagree, he said, shouldn't \"pop off\" with their half-baked and ill-considered opinions. He's \"not interested\" in what he sees as mere sloganeering about \"American leadership or America winning\" that distract him from his strategy.\nThe contrast with remarks by French President Francois Hollande, addressing Parliament on Monday, was remarkable. Had Hollande's speech been delivered by a Republican presidential candidate, Obama would probably have dismissed it as more popping off. Hollande pledged to wage war \"without a respite, without a truce.... It is not a question of containing but of destroying this organization.\"\nObama's bloodlessly detached and condescendingly professorial remarks seemed oddly reminiscent of those excruciating news conferences during the Iraq war when George W. Bush couldn't bring himself to admit he made any mistakes.\nJust days before the Paris attack, Obama insisted that Islamic State was \"contained.\" He may have meant, as he now claims, that he was merely talking about its territorial holdings in Iraq and Syria (leaving out its gains in Libya, Afghanistan, the Sinai and its successful terror attacks elsewhere). But when people hear that a threat has been contained, they can be forgiven for thinking that rules out mass killings in Paris.\nThe chilling takeaway from Friday\u2019s terrorist attacks in Paris is that \nIslamic State\n has expanded its theater of operations beyond the Middle East. But that doesn\u2019t mean the group is about to unleash a wave of attacks on the United States.\nThe Homeland Security Department said Friday it knows of...\nThe chilling takeaway from Friday\u2019s terrorist attacks in Paris is that \nIslamic State\n has expanded its theater of operations beyond the Middle East. But that doesn\u2019t mean the group is about to unleash a wave of attacks on the United States.\nThe Homeland Security Department said Friday it knows of...\nAnd that's the bedeviling thing about events \u2014 the enemy gets to create them. Obama has all but admitted that Islamic State forced his hand by chopping off the heads of American hostages.\nFor Republicans, the attacks in Paris \u2014 not to mention in Turkey, Beirut and above Egypt (Islamic State almost surely brought down that Russian plane) \u2014 are just more proof that Obama's foreign policy is a mess.\nIn a more rational climate, this would be a moment for presidential candidates with serious foreign policy chops to shine and for candidates such as Donald Trump and Ben Carson to recede. That is, unless you actually believe Trump when he says, \"I know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me.\"\nBut even Trump, in his own way, seems more attuned to events as they unfold than Obama and the Democrats running to replace him.\nIn Saturday's Democratic debate, all three of the candidates struggled as the ground shifted under their feet. They bristled at the suggestion that we are at war with \"radical Islam.\" Saying so, according to Hillary Rodham Clinton, would be \"painting with too broad a brush.\"\nSen. Bernie Sanders, whose campaign furiously protested CBS' decision to shift the focus to terrorism, seemed despondent that he had to talk about the subject.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley was far more comfortable with the change, insisting that we must take in even more refugees from Syria.\nThat was a minority view even before it was revealed that at least one of the Paris terrorists had been a \"refugee.\" You can be sure it's even less popular now, which is why the roster of U.S. states seeking measures to bar Syrian refugees is growing rapidly.\nFor now, most Democrats stand with Obama in his denial. One wonders how long that resolve will last in the face of even one more \"setback\" to Obama's successful strategy.\njgoldberg@latimescolumnists.com\nFollow the Opinion section on Twitter \n@latimesopinion\n and \nFacebook", "byline": "", "description": "<p>According to legend, if not actual historians, Harold Macmillan was once asked what he most feared could derail his agenda.

{"body": "As of yesterday morning a handful of governors were vowing to resist Obama administration plans to resettle Syrian refugees in their states. As of this morning, CNN put the count at 27, with only seven governors, all Democrats, saying their states will welcome the Syrians. President Obama likely helped catalyze this cross-country revolt with a dreadful performance in a press conference yesterday at Antalya, Turkey.\nThe president came off as impassive as he discussed last week\u2019s attacks in Paris. He turned prickly under repeated questioning about his own underestimation of the Islamic State\u2014which he denied, even when a reporter mentioned his January 2014 dismissal of the group as \u201cthe jayvee team.\u201d\nBut he got passionate when the subject turned to Republicans who disagree with him on the refugee question:\nBut Yahoo! News\u2019s Michael Isikoff last week reported that the administration is in fact on the verge of imposing just the sort of \u201creligious test\u201d the president claims to disavow:\nThe Yazidi are a religious minority whose faith \u201cincorporates elements of Christianity and Islam.\u201d\n\u201cA genocide designation would have significant policy implications for American efforts to restore property and lands taken from the minority groups and for offers of aid, asylum, and other protections to such victims,\u201d the Hudson Institute\u2019s Nina Shea writes for National Review. Christians are not being considered for the genocide designation, Shea notes, although they are \u201calso among the most vulnerable religious minority groups that have been deliberately and mercilessly targeted for eradication by ISIS.\u201d\nSo Obama\u2019s objection is not to \u201creligious tests\u201d per se, but to favorable treatment of Christians. It is of a piece with his February speech to the National Prayer Breakfast, in which he bizarrely lectured Christians to get off their \u201chigh horse\u201d and remember the Crusades, while also claiming that ISIS and other Muslim terrorists are \u201cbetraying\u201d Islam.\nApprehension about admitting Muslim Syrian refugees is motivated by fear. It is \u201cThe Return of Republican Islamophobia,\u201d according to the title of a piece yesterday by New York magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait. He writes that \u201cfigures like Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush are calling for the United States to admit only Christian refugees, thereby positioning the United States as indifferent to ISIS\u2019s primary victims,\u201d by which he means Muslims. So are Yazidis secondary victims and Christians tertiary ones, or the other way around? Chait doesn\u2019t say.\nBut a phobia is an irrational fear, and the attacks in Paris are nothing if not a reminder that fear of Islamic terrorism is rational. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that one of the Paris attackers came in as part of the wave of Syrian refugees:\nReuters reported this morning that \u201cGerman police have detained an Algerian man in a refugee reception centre in connection with the attacks in Paris.\u201d\nThe Obama administration plans to admit some 10,000 Syrian refugees next year. At Saturday\u2019s debate, Hillary Clinton and Martin O\u2019Malley both said they\u2019d like to make it 65,000. \u201cAccommodating 65,000 refugees in our country today, people of 320 million, is akin to making room for 6\u00bd more people in a baseball stadium with 32,000,\u201d said O\u2019Malley.\nThe problem, however, is not one of numbers. If even a handful of terrorists were among the 10,000 or 65,000 admitted, that would be enough to cause carnage and serious disruption. As the president himself observed during yesterday\u2019s press conference: \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about the ability of a handful of people .\u00a0.\u00a0. who are willing to die, they can kill a lot of people.\u201d\nProponents of admitting Syrian refugees acknowledge the importance of vetting them. \u201cEven as we accept more refugees\u2014including Syrians\u2014we do so only after subjecting them to rigorous screening and security checks,\u201d Obama said in his opening statement yesterday. In the debate, Mrs. Clinton said that \u201cwe should go to 65 [thousand] but only if we have as carefully screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes.\u201d\nIn an interview yesterday with radio host Hugh Hewitt, New Jersey\u2019s Gov. Chris Christie\u2014one of those who\u2019ve said their states won\u2019t accept refugees\u2014made the obvious point in response: \u201cI do not trust this administration to effectively vet the people who are proposed to be coming in, in order to protect the safety and security of the American people.\u201d\nWe have no specialized knowledge here, but it seems to us that Christie easily has the better of this argument. To put it mildly, administrative competence has not been the hallmark of this administration. Obama has presided over, among other things, the abuses at the Internal Revenue Service, the Chinese hacking of millions of federal employees\u2019 private records, and the scandal at the Veterans Administration. His administration could not even design a properly functioning website for its central ideological vanity project, the federal health-insurance exchange. It seems crazy to place one\u2019s faith in its ability to do better even than the Greeks in vetting refugees.\nUSA Today points out that the governors have little formal authority to keep the feds from resettling refugees in their state:\nIt\u2019s certainly political, but resistance from governors in a majority of states\u2014including 11 states Obama carried in 2012, and including one Democrat, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, who is seeking a U.S. Senate seat\u2014it\u2019s more than posturing. This is not just a national-security crisis but a developing political crisis for the president and his party.\nWhy Do Bad Things Always Happen to Him?   \u201cMANILA, Philippines\u2014After years of red-eye flights across the Pacific and marathon summits, President Obama had hoped to arrive in this Southeast Asian capital and tout progress in his seven-year charm offensive in Asia: His campaign to move away from the cycle of crisis in the Middle East and toward the rising region was finally yielding results. Instead, the president was due to land Philippines Tuesday amid a fresh crisis\u2014a reminder of the trouble that has dogged his \u2018Asia rebalance\u2019 from its inception. The terrorist attacks in Paris and talk of reprisals for the Islamic State quickly threatened to overshadow Obama\u2019s good-news tour to the Philippines and Malaysia this week.\u201d\u2014Kathleen Hennessey, Associated Press, Nov.\u00a016\nMission Accomplished\nTwo Young-Adult Websites in One!\nFox Butterfield, Is That You?\nOut on a Limb   \u201cIf Donald Trump Is the Problem, Mitt Romney Isn\u2019t the Solution\u201d\u2014headline, FiveThirtyEight.com, Nov.\u00a016\nWhat Would We Do Without Experts?   \u201cSave Some Money, Experts Say Don\u2019t Buy Organic Produce\u201d\u2014headline, KXAN-TV website (Austin, Texas), Nov.\u00a017\nHe\u2019s Just Not That Into You   \u201cObama on His ISIS Strategy: I\u2019m Not Interested in \u2018American Leadership, or America Winning\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014headline, Federalist, Nov.\u00a016\nLongest Books Ever Written   \u201cAll the Questionable Statements on Defense From Saturday\u2019s Democratic Debate\u201d\u2014headline, Jalopnik.com, Nov.\u00a016\nProblem and Solution\u2014I\nProblem and Solution\u2014II\nThe Soft Bigotry of Low Expectations   \u201cAnyway, the results are in: Ruth Bader Ginsburg is more fun than Gloria Steinem.\u201d\u2014blogress Ann Althouse, Nov.\u00a016\n21st-Century Jobs   \u201cLocal Kids Learn to Give Heroin Antidote\u201d\u2014headline, Courier-Journal (Lexington, Ky.), Nov.\u00a017\nHey, Kids!

{"body": "Ben Carson\u2019s remarks on foreign policy have repeatedly raised questions about his grasp of the subject, but never more seriously than in the past week, when he wrongly asserted that China had intervened militarily in Syria and then failed, on national television, to name the countries he would call on to form a coalition to fight the Islamic State.\n\nFaced with increasing scrutiny about whether Mr. Carson \u2014 who leads in some Republican presidential polls \u2014 was capable of leading American foreign policy, two of his top advisers said in interviews with The New York Times that he had struggled to master the intricacies of the Middle East and national security and that intense tutoring was having little effect.\n\n\u201cNobody has been able to sit down with him and have him get one iota of intelligent information about the Middle East,\u201d Duane R. Clarridge, a top adviser to Mr. Carson on terrorism and national security, said in an interview. He also said Mr. Carson needed weekly conference calls briefing him on foreign policy so \u201cwe can make him smart.\u201d\n\nAs the deadly assaults in Paris claimed by the Islamic State reframe the presidential race, the candidates\u2019 foreign policy credentials are suddenly under scrutiny. And Mr. Carson has attracted extra attention because his repeated dubious statements give rise to questions about where, as a retired neurosurgeon without government experience, he turns for information and counsel on complex global issues. What is unusual is the candor of those who are tutoring him about the physician\u2019s struggle to master the subject.\n\nIn last week\u2019s Republican debate, speaking of the turmoil in Syria, Mr. Carson said that \u201cthe Chinese are there.\u201d\n\nBoth the White House and China denied that China had intervened militarily in Syria.\n\nThis week, Mr. Carson\u2019s advisers said that his source for claiming Chinese involvement in Syria was a telephone conversation he had had with a freelance American intelligence operative in Iraq.\n\nAccording to notes of the briefing kept by a Carson aide who was also on the line, the operative had said, \u201cMultiple reports have surfaced that Chinese military advisers are on the ground in Syria, operating with Russian special operations personnel.\u201d\n\nMr. Clarridge, a former C.I.A. agent who had connected Mr. Carson with the operative in Iraq, said on Monday that the information was wrong. The operative in Iraq had \u201coverleaped\u201d in suggesting Chinese troops are in Syria, Mr. Clarridge said, adding of the operative, \u201cYou know how it goes when people are desperate for some headline.\u201d\n\nMr. Clarridge, described by Mr. Carson\u2019s top adviser, Armstrong Williams, as \u201ca mentor for Dr. Carson,\u201d is a colorful, even legendary figure in intelligence circles, someone who could have stepped out of a Hollywood thriller. He was a longtime C.I.A. officer, serving undercover in India, Turkey, Italy and other countries. During the Reagan administration, he helped found the agency\u2019s Counterterrorism Center and ran the C.I.A.\u2019s Latin American division.\n\nIndicted on charges of lying to Congress in the Iran-contra scandal (he was later pardoned), Mr. Clarridge today runs a private network of intelligence sources, including, he said, experts on Iran, China and the Middle East, who have all briefed Mr. Carson in phone calls or Skype sessions.\n\nMr. Clarridge, who contacted Mr. Carson nearly two years ago to offer his services without pay, has helped the candidate prepare for debates. But the briefings do not always seem to sink in, Mr. Clarridge acknowledged. After Mr. Carson struggled on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d to say whom he would call first to form a coalition against the Islamic State, Mr. Clarridge called Mr. Williams, the candidate\u2019s top adviser, in frustration. \u201cWe need to have a conference call once a week where his guys roll out the subjects they think will be out there, and we can make him smart,\u201d Mr. Clarridge said he told Mr. Williams.\n\nMr. Williams, one of Mr. Carson\u2019s closest friends, who does not have an official role in the campaign, also lamented the Fox News interview. \u201cHe\u2019s been briefed on it so many times,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess he just froze.\u201d\n\nMr. Carson, 64, who retired as one the world\u2019s foremost pediatric neurosurgeons, has sometimes struggled to adapt his thoughtful manner and speaking style to the rat-a-tat of debates and TV interviews. \u201cSometimes he overthinks things,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said, adding that he spoke to Mr. Carson after the Fox News stumble. \u201cI could tell, talking to him, it was a bummer for him.\u201d\n\nOnce written off by political insiders, Mr. Carson has rocketed to the top tier of candidates and has traded off a lead in recent polls with Donald J. Trump.\n\nBut the stress of his ascent has revealed an inexperienced political operation and a lack of connections to informed and respected advisers. Whereas Jeb Bush can call on dozens of experts from the foreign policy establishment who once worked for the presidential administrations of his father and brother, Mr. Carson so far has only one paid national security adviser, Robert F. Dees, a retired Army general on the staff of Liberty University, the institution founded by Jerry Falwell.\n\nThe Carson campaign has also set up conversations between the candidate and former senior foreign affairs officials in past presidential administrations, including former secretaries of state, Mr. Williams said.\n\nOne official, Michael V. Hayden, a former C.I.A. director, described a conversation he had had with Mr. Carson to MSNBC last week. \u201cI had one lengthy phone call with Ben Carson two months ago,\u201d Mr. Hayden said, \u201cand his instincts are all right, but this is a database in which he\u2019s very unfamiliar.\u201d\n\nMr. Dees, a West Point graduate whose biography lists commands in Korea and Europe, met Mr. Carson at a conference at a Baptist church in February. He said he and the candidate had since \u201clocked ourselves up in a hotel room a couple of different sessions and took walks around the world.\u201d\n\nHe also provides Mr. Carson with a regular national security update, with input from a group of retired military officers, business leaders and \u201cambassador-level type guys,\u201d he said, some of whom the campaign plans to identify shortly.\n\nMr. Dees offered a different portrait of Mr. Carson than Mr. Clarridge. \u201cDr. Carson is an amazing intellect,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has the right stuff to be commander in chief.\u201d\n\nOn Facebook, where the campaign connects to its vast grass-roots army, two of his top campaign aides posted a video on Monday highlighting his \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d interview with no hint of Mr. Carson\u2019s private acknowledgment that he had performed poorly. The Facebook page included what it said was supporting evidence of Mr. Carson\u2019s claim of Chinese involvement in Syria: a satellite image of a purported Chinese-made radar system in Syria, and a Syrian soldier posing on a Chinese-made armored vehicle.\n\nBut the effort to claim that Mr. Carson had meant only that there was Chinese-made material in Syria, not military personnel, was contradicted by his own top Middle East adviser, Mr. Clarridge.\n\nHe blamed his operative, who had spoken to Mr. Carson ahead of last week\u2019s Republican debate. The operative, who had visited the Kurd-controlled city of Erbil in Iraq, described unconfirmed intelligence he had gleaned about disguised Russian soldiers working in Kurdistan.\n\n\u201cRussian special forces are staying in the Titanic Hotel in Sulaymaniya,\u201d the operative said, according to notes recorded by Mr. Williams. \u201cThey frequent an Irish pub in the hotel bar.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe jump from Erbil and Soviets,\u201d Mr. Clarridge said, to the Chinese \u201cin Damascus is a long leap.\u201d", "byline": "TRIP GABRIEL", "description": "The candidate\u2019s remarks on the Middle East and national security have raised questions about his knowledge of the subject, and advisers say tutoring is having little effect.", "title": "Ben Carson Is Struggling to Grasp Foreign Policy, Advisers Say", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/us/politics/ben-carson-is-struggling-to-grasp-foreign-policy-advisers-say.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Armstrong Williams", "Jeb Bush", "Andrew Williams", "Donald J.

McCaskill\n\n11/17/15 10:06 AM EST\nDays ahead of a run-off election for governor in Louisiana, Sen. David Vitter\u2019s campaign has launched an attack ad blasting his Democratic opponent, John Bel Edwards, for his support of the administration\u2019s plan to resettle 10,000 Syrian refugees in the U.S.\nFollowing the terror attacks that struck Paris on Friday, more than two dozen Republican governors have voiced opposition to accepting Syrian refugees into their states. International investigators believe one of the assailants entered Europe by posing as a refugee. \nStory Continued Below\n\u201cNow Obama is sending Syrian refugees to Louisiana,\u201d the narrator says in the ad. \u201cDavid Vitter warned Obama the dangers of Syrian refugees weeks ago and promised as governor no Syrian refugees will enter Louisiana. John Bel Edwards has pledged to work with Obama to bring Syrian refugees to Louisiana.\u201d\nThe 30-second ad closes with a clip of Edwards saying, \u201cI supported the president,\u201d with the narrator concluding, \u201cHe always does.\u201d\nEdwards responded with a Facebook post accusing Vitter of \u201cbombarding\u201d voters with lies about his position. \u201cMany of you have expressed concern about how to respond to this, the most recent example of his deceptiveness,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have clearly and openly called for a complete stop to the entry of refugees to Louisiana. This is a shameful and desperate attempt by David to distort my position as well as my record as the only candidate with military experience.\u201d\nEdwards said he will stay in contact with law enforcement regarding the 14 refugees already in Louisiana but asked who voters trust more: \u201ca West Point graduate and former Army Ranger or David Vitter, who continues to lie to us in order to divide us?\u201d he added. \u201cThe choice is STILL clear, Louisiana.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Vitter hits Edwards with ad knocking his support for Syrian refugees", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/david-vitter-john-edwards-syria-215969", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "economy"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Susan Rice", "Kenneth P.

{"body": "Charleston, SC (CNN)Ted Cruz may believe that Christian refugees from Syria pose no risk to American security, but he is open to looking beyond religion and actually vetting those emigrants, he said in a new interview.\nThe rising presidential candidate is aligning himself with the most restrictionist voices in the debate over how to handle the refugee crisis, which is dominating the Republican race after a deadly attack in Paris left more than 100 dead. Cruz has applied a \"religious test\" to judge which refugees to admit, in the words of the White House, telling reporters across South Carolina this weekend that he would admit all persecuted Christians to the U.S. but no persecuted Muslims.\nBut in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash on Monday, Cruz conceded that he would support measures to sift through the Christian refugees should ISIS militants try to disguise their identities.\n\"There is no doubt we would need to vet anyone coming in, but there is no indication that we have Muslims pretending to be Christians in the coming refugee wave,\" Cruz said before an event at the College of Charleston, concluding his three-day swing across the Palmetto State. \"If that develops to be a problem, then our first obligation should be protecting our national security.\"\nCruz, like other Republican hardliners, has argued that the risk of Islamic militants infiltrating the refugee population is too high for America to accept them with open arms. On the stump across South Carolina, Cruz argued that the percentage of refugees that are young men suggests that ISIS may look to take advantage of any relaxation of immigration laws. \nThe Texas senator instead thinks that Muslims fleeing the Syrian civil war should be repopulated to other Muslim countries. But the Christian population, he believes, has nowhere else to go, and Cruz batted away concerns by telling reporters in Myrtle Beach on Sunday that Christians posed \"no meaningful risk\" to national security.\nThat has made him vulnerable to charges of discrimination, both from liberal activists and the White House.\nCruz plans to introduce legislation in the Senate this week to cut off federal funding for refugee resettlement, allying himself with Ben Carson, perhaps Cruz's closest competitor in the presidential race. And he also said he supports governors who are closing their borders to the refugees.\n\"I was one of the very first to stake out this position. Now we're seeing more and more come over and agree with me,\" Cruz told Bash. \"And I think you're going to see more and more governors who say, 'I want to protect the citizens of my states and it doesn't make any sense for us to bring potential terrorists into this country'.\"\nThe Texas senator often tries to occupy a middle ground in foreign policy debates, bashing the nation-building, neoconservativism of the George W. Bush administration but being equally as critical of those who posit that America should abandon targeted military campaigns. For instance, Cruz does not support American intervention in Syria, instead calling for an offensive air operation and to arm the Kurds in the region. \nCruz's position on the \"religious test\" drew the scorn of President Barack Obama on Monday, which called out Cruz by name at a press conference and said his position was \"not American.\"\n\"It's not surprising that President Obama is attacking me personally,\" Cruz said. \"I'll tell you what is shameful is that we have a President that after 7 years still refuses to utter the words radical Islamic terrorism.\"\nObama's attack could be a political boon for a candidate energized by sparring with the White House from the pole position in the conservative movement. Cruz wouldn't quite go as far as his other conservative rival, Donald Trump, who suggested that some mosques should be closed, but Cruz's rhetoric on Monday is his latest try to race to the right on every issue in the GOP primary.\nWhat to do with the Syrian refugees is proving to be politically volatile. Just two hours after sitting down with Bash, Cruz met protestors at an event who heckled him loudly as he worked the crowd: \"We don't want a president who discriminates against Muslims!\" three young college students shouted at Cruz repeatedly for over 10 minutes. \"You can't let only Christians into the U.S.\"\n\"It's not Muslims, it's terrorists,\" one Cruz supporter volleyed back. \"Then go over to them and join them,\" yelled another.\nCruz, for his part, didn't seem rattled.\n\"I think it says something that speaking at a college campus, on the entire campus, only two protesters come out and yell,\" Cruz told CNN as he left the event. \"I'll take those numbers any day.\"\n", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Ted Cruz: Muslim refugees from Syria should go to other Islamic countries", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/17/politics/ted-cruz-refugees-syria/index.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Dana Bash", "Donald Trump", "George W.

Barack Obama over Clinton in February of that year. \nThe national endorsement is not binding to state and local SEIU chapters -- a local chapter in New Hampshire, for example, endorsed Sanders earlier this month -- but the national endorsement comes with more infrastructure, money and organization than the local backing.\nIn order to make their decision, SEIU held a 1,200-member conference in March and conducted three national member polls from fall 2014 to fall 2015.\nCoupled with their endorsement, SEIU released a video touting their endorsement that features members describing why they support the former secretary of state.\nThe SEIU endorsement comes less than a month after AFSCME, the largest trade union of public employees in the United States, endorsed Clinton and gives the Democratic front-runner a credible claim on having the bulk of organized labor behind her. \nThe American Federation of Teachers, a group that has long supported Clinton, also backed the former secretary of state in July.\nSanders has responded to the wealth of union endorsements by claiming that whole union leadership is with Clinton, it is the members on the ground that are behind him.\n\"Bernie is proud to have the grassroots support of tens of thousands of working families in AFSCME and other unions,\" Sanders' spokesman Michael Briggs said in response to Clinton's endorsement last month.\n", "byline": "", "description": "Hillary Clinton won the endorsement of the nation's top service employee union on Tuesday, solidifying her lock on organized labor over Bernie Sanders, her top Democratic opponent in 2016.", "title": "SEIU endorses Clinton for president", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/17/politics/hillary-clinton-seiu-endorsement-2016/index.html", "topics": ["trade", "economy"], "people": ["Mary Kay Henry", "Bernie Sanders", "Barack Obama", "Hillary Clinton", "Michael Briggs"], "orgs": ["American Federation of Teachers", "AFSCME", "SEIU"], "election_confidence": 0.6125216611897571, "authors": [{"author_id": 2532, "fullname": "dan merica", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 17:50:12", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "e56b7ebe7025b9a7e9603f2f28dc552e", "date_access": "2015-11-17 18:01:19.078809"},

{"body": "Florence, South Carolina (CNN)Ted Cruz's path to victory relies in part on corralling evangelical voters in early states like Iowa and South Carolina. But he's running into a problem: Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon the establishment underestimated, who continues to show surprising durability and backing from evangelicals. \nNow, with his three-day tour of the Palmetto State, Cruz and his supporters are looking to pinch the evangelical firewalls of Carson and other Christian favorites. \nCruz isn't saying that he's a better Christian -- he's arguing that he's a better defender of Christians. Even candidates of deep faith who themselves have been born again aren't in step with the Republican base on questions of religious liberty, he says. \n\"I've been blessed to have had the opportunity to stand and defend religious liberty over and over and over again,\" Cruz said during a script-less 55-minute sermon at Florence Baptist Church in the state's Pee Dee region Sunday. \nIt is a tough needle to thread: Carson, whose inspirational life story is rooted in his religious revival, has the highest favorability ratings in the Republican field, which discourages Cruz from attacking him directly. In fact, Cruz said recently that he \"likes and trusts\" Carson. \nBut the pitch on religious issues puts Carson squarely in the crosshairs in the area where he is supposed to be untouchable: questions of Christian leadership. It brings Cruz's central calling card -- that he has taken arrows for the conservative cause while others haven't -- onto Carson's turf. \n\"I like Ben Carson, but this one has been in the fight a lot longer,\" said Sheila Ayres, a 50-year-old secretary, as she pointed to Cruz working the post-church pews. \"Dr. Carson doesn't have the background in the political part of it.\" \nJames Galbraith, a 73-year-old part-time worker at Florence Baptist, was quick to dismiss Carson due to his faith. \"He's Seventh-day Adventist,\" said Galbraith. \"I just don't believe in that Saturday worshipping is better than Sunday. I'm a Sunday worshipper.\" \nCruz relies heavily on his tenure as solicitor general of Texas, during which he led several high-profile fights to the Supreme Court. And others learned of him through a different religious avenue: his father, a former preacher, whose fiery crusades sometimes verge on the impolitic. \nAt the same time, Cruz isn't directly criticizing Carson. That troubles some boosters who say he needs to get moving against Carson and Donald Trump. Rival campaigns have hoped that Carson and Trump's penchant for impolitic statements would ultimately be his undoing but that hasn't happened. \nCarson also surprised by raising $20 million in the third quarter, undermining a Cruz credo that he was the only well-funded conservative in the race.  \n\"He's got character running out his ears,\" said Bill Monroe, the pastor who invited Cruz here to preach said of the senator. \"But I don't think he's been in the trenches fighting these kinds of things.\" \n\"Cruz needs to start swinging,\" said one strategist close to the campaign. \"He's in third or fourth. He can't keep waiting for Trump and Carson to fall apart.\" \nCruz trails Carson in every Iowa and South Carolina poll, sometimes badly, as Carson continues to hold on to the evangelical voters Cruz counted on. The latest CNN/ORC poll shows Cruz in fourth place with 11%. Trump leads at 25%, Carson second at 23% and Marco Rubio is in third at 13%.\n \nHe told an interviewer in June that his chief rival among evangelicals was not Carson, but Mike Huckabee, who now barely registers in opinion polls. When the Cruz-affliated super PAC Keep the Promise compared their candidate to the rest of the field in a 51-page slideshow this past summer to donors, the only mention of Trump was on a list of \"well-funded campaigns.\"  \nCarson's name didn't appear in the slideshow at all. \nReligious conversions underpins both the Cruz and Carson life stories, with each talking proudly about how faith transformed their history from one of alcoholism in their family or violence to Ivy League educations. And both have predicated their political success on cornering their co-religionists, with each visiting Bob Jones University in the northwest corner of the state on back-to-back days this weekend. \n\"Dr. Carson wears his faith,\" said his senior strategist Ed Brookover. \"Dr. Carson has been saying all along that we think it's time for someone who has a new approach and has a new way of doing things.\" \nCruz's campaign has intentionally courted the leading lights of the evangelical movement, assembling a document with 411 national leaders whose support they want. They've won over almost half, 191, according to a campaign official. \nThat's in contrast to Carson, who despite his grassroots evangelical support, has not been successful winning over national faith leaders, according to one of them. \n\"He's not built relationships with conservative leaders,\" said Tony Perkins, an influential Christian leader who oversees a broad network of conservative advocacy groups. \"I don't know that he's actually looking for endorsements from conservative leaders. He may have a different approach to his campaign.\" \nAnd after Monday's endorsement by Steve King, Cruz will try to win the biggest evangelical endorsement in 2016 this Friday: that of Iowa powerbroker Bob Vander Plaats. \nCarson's best argument is to point to the scoreboard. \n\"We've been organizing as well,\" Brookover said. \"We don't talk about it as much.\"\n \n", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Ted Cruz's challenge: Winning Ben Carson's evangelicals", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/17/politics/ted-cruz-ben-carson-evangelical-voters/index.html", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Steve King", "Ed Brookover", "Bob Vander Plaats", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Mike Huckabee", "Tony Perkins", "Ben Carson", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": ["Supreme Court"], "election_confidence": 0.9907460206380774, "authors": [{"author_id": 23575, "fullname": "theodore schleifer", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 10:56:59", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "503952059b438189942b3d630c1ba6bb", "date_access": "2015-11-17 11:18:14.329946"},

The poll showed 67 percent favor ending current restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba, compared to 28 percent in opposition.\nLast December U.S. President Barack Obama reversed the policy of 10 previous presidents by engaging with Cuba as he and Cuban President Raul Castro pledged to restore diplomatic relations.\nObama's call to lift the trade embargo has been blocked by the Republican-controlled Congress, as has a separate measure to allow Americans to go to Cuba as tourists.\nThe poll showed Republicans and conservatives still opposed Obama over the embargo by 9 and 17 points, respectively, but they sided with him or were closely split on restoring diplomatic relations and ending travel restrictions.\n\"You would be hard-pressed to find any other Obama administration policy with this much Republican support,\" Peter Schechter, director of the Atlantic Council's Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, said in a statement.\nFor decades both parties heeded the pro-embargo lobby led by Cuban-Americans in and around Miami, mindful of their fund-raising ability and sway in the swing state of Florida. But in 2012, Obama split the Cuban-American vote, and subsequent polls showed Cuban-Americans tilting in favor of normalizing relations.\nMost of the Republican presidential contenders maintain the party's historic support of the embargo and isolation of the former Cold War adversary, notably the Cuban-American Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.\nWithin the four states, Ohio voters showed the most sympathy to the Obama policies and Tennessee voters the least.\nThe Atlantic Council said its survey, taken Oct. 15-18 by Republican pollster Glen Bolger, questioned 150 likely voters in each state and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent.\n\n (Reporting by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Bill Trott)", "byline": "", "description": "HAVANA (Reuters) - Solid majorities of likely U.S. voters in Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and Tennessee favor diplomatic relations with Cuba and an end to trade and travel restrictions with the Communist-ruled island, a poll by the Atlantic Council showed on Tuesday.", "title": "Voters in four 'heartland' states favor Obama policy on Cuba: poll", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/domesticNews/~3/VFHhDBZWIjk/story01.htm", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "trade"], "people": ["Bill Trott", "Jeb Bush", "Glen Bolger", "Marco Rubio", "Barack Obama", "Raul Castro", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": [], "election_confidence": 0.9388093056655146, "authors": [{"author_id": 33503, "fullname": "daniel trotta", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 15:06:27", "org": "reuters", "article_id": "f3bdccea4322ae1f066c775707359c4f", "date_access": "2015-11-17 15:36:42.289886"},
{"body": "Hugh Hewitt is a lawyer, law professor, author and host of a nationally syndicated radio show. He served in the Reagan administration in posts including assistant counsel in the White House and special assistant to two attorneys general. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n (CNN)Even as the campaign for the White House shifted on its axis after the atrocities in Paris and again following the president's tantrum in Turkey -- his defenders are using the last refuge of the desperate by claiming the President's scornful mocking of slogans about \"America leading\" or \"America winning\" were taken out of context -- the basic realities of the campaign remain fixed.\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic nominee. And no one knows who will carry the GOP standard.\nAfter interviews on my radio show with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Sen. Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina and Sen. Lindsey Graham during or since the Paris attacks, the conversation has of course been about the security of Americans and the world in the face of an ISIS threat the President declared \"contained\" the morning of the Paris slaughter.  \nThe Republicans all called on the President to rethink the expanded admission of Syrian refugees. \nChristie resisted the emotional appeal of orphaned children and bluntly stated that he opposed admission of any Syrian refugees whatsoever because the President's and his administration's record is so awful in following through on any program. Hard to argue with Christie, given the IRS, VA and Edward Snowden scandals.  \nEven as they push for the public's attention and agreement in every setting, however, each of many GOP campaigns has to find and turn out actual voters. \nIn particular, they have to find weekly churchgoers, the most reliable of all Republican primary voters, and not just in Iowa and New Hampshire, but across all the states in the \"SEC primary\" on March 1 and the first day of \"winner-take-all primaries\" on March 15.  How to find these specific people?\nMy longtime friend Jonathan Bock in Los Angeles, whose Grace Hill Media has been successfully marketing big studio releases to Christian churches and audiences for two decades, has just launched an intriguing new technology that goes far beyond generating a mailing list of people who tell pollsters they attend church. \nHis Christians in Churches (CiC) platform is a mobile advertising technology that he says is able to create exquisitely precise audiences based on their physical attendance at one of 300,000-plus churches around the country.  \n\"Could your technology work for campaigns?\" I asked him. \"Could you find my Presbyterians -- PCA not PCUSA -- in Florida who are there every week, or Catholics who attend Mass every Sunday (or Saturday night) in Manchester?\"\nOf course, he replied. And, Republicans take note, this is not just a technological advancement that can help you. Democrats are not unaware of the developments in microtargeting by faith.\nThe research that went into creating CiC, Bock said, indicates that while 46% of those who attend church at least once a week are registered Republicans, more than a third -- 36% -- are Democrats. After the success the Obama campaign had in harnessing digital technology in 2008 and 2012, the Clinton team will also be mining the church attendance data.\nSo what exactly can CiC do? \n\"Besides church attendance,\" Jon explained, \"CiC's technology uses other attributes to hypertarget their audience: like demographics (gender, age), religious denominations, frequency of attendance and other places patronized in the last nine months (restaurants, movie theaters, sports venues, schools, you name it.)\n\"So for example,\" he continued, \"suppose you are a political campaign and want to target ads at politically active mothers of young kids in Iowa City who go to a Presbyterian church every week. CiC's technology can serve that up based on church attendance, weekday proximity to elementary schools (dropping kids off and picking them up at 8 a.m. and 3 p.m.) and these moms' appearances at campaign rallies over the last few months.\"\nOf course, there is a website: www.ChristiansInChurches.com.  The vaunted \"voter vaults\" of a decade ago are as old as dial-up now. With news cycles shorter than ever, the campaigns that manage their marketing of timely messages to the most reliable voters are going to win the political battles that begin with the Iowa caucus in February. \nThe election changed last Friday, just as sermons did on Sunday and news coverage through today and beyond. But the blocking and tackling of the election didn't change --the imperative to turn out your likeliest voters. The meta-messaging that candidates have been using on my show and on others, and via speeches, is intended to move a voter towards them. Now their campaigns must touch those voters, tag them, and bag them in February and March.\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.\n", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "GOP campaign's real focus: Iowa, not Syria", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/17/opinions/hewitt-syria-gop-get-out-the-vote/index.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Chris Christie", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Lindsey Graham", "Hugh Hewitt", "Carly Fiorina", "Edward Snowden", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": ["SEC", "IRS", "Reagan", "GOP", "PCA"], "election_confidence": 0.8390693440955025, "authors": [{"author_id": 38859, "fullname": "hugh hewitt", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 22:50:59", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "02d4568a3b66a4bb487238fba948cf65", "date_access": "2015-11-17 23:22:10.796197"},

{"body": "In her pursuit of the Democratic nomination for president, Hillary Rodham Clinton has emphasized her ties to President Obama. She regularly tells the story of how he wooed her into serving as his secretary of state and recites, typically to a roar of applause, the line: \u201cPresident Obama doesn\u2019t get the credit he deserves.\u201d\n\nBut the terrorist attacks in Paris on Friday, and a presidential election that has suddenly taken a turn toward foreign policy, have complicated Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strategy of aligning herself closely with Mr. Obama, who is widely popular among Democratic primary voters and whose support she will need should she advance to the general election.\n\nOn Saturday in the second Democratic debate, Mrs. Clinton declined to directly respond to a question about whether she thought Mr. Obama had underestimated the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, which French officials have said was responsible for the attacks.\n\nBut she did \u2014 indirectly and deftly \u2014 contradict Mr. Obama\u2019s comments, made in a television interview recorded a day before the attacks, that the Islamic State had been \u201ccontained\u201d in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\u201cWe have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cIt cannot be contained; it must be defeated.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign has said for months that it sees no reason to break with Mr. Obama. Mrs. Clinton has instead positioned her agenda around plans to \u201cbuild on the progress\u201d of the Obama administration. In places like South Carolina where African-American voters, in particular, overwhelmingly support the president, Mrs. Clinton devotes much of her stump speech to effusively praising Mr. Obama\u2019s success in reviving the economy after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nIn a New York Times/CBS News survey released last Thursday, 79 percent of Democrats said they were satisfied or very satisfied with Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency and 60 percent said they would like to see the next president continue his policies.\n\nBut the renewed emphasis on terrorism in the past few days has laid bare Mrs. Clinton\u2019s long-held differences with Mr. Obama on foreign policy and when the United States should intervene in conflicts abroad.\n\nFor four years as secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton played a prominent role in nearly every foreign policy issue of Mr. Obama\u2019s first term, often pushing the White House to embrace a more aggressive approach. She urged the administration to join a NATO-led coalition to oust Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya, proposed that more forces be left in Iraq and pushed to funnel arms to moderate Syrian rebels.\n\n\u201cI assume she and her advisers are trying to calibrate Obama\u2019s approval rating right now,\u201d said Paul R. Pillar, a former C.I.A. analyst who teaches at Georgetown University. But he added, \u201cI think the conventional wisdom, that Hillary Clinton is a more hawkish person and would be a more hawkish president, with everything that adjective implies, is correct.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton has gone further than Mr. Obama on Syria by proposing that a coalition put in place a no-fly zone to provide safe areas for Syrians, an approach several Republican presidential candidates have also embraced. And she frequently talks about how she pushed Mr. Obama to arm some Syrian rebels.\n\n\u201cI did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early on,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said Saturday. \u201cBecause I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum.\u201d\n\nThe images from France have not prompted Mr. Obama to abandon his deep reluctance to send additional American troops to Iraq and Syria.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe U.S. troops are the answer to the problem,\u201d Benjamin J. Rhodes, Mr. Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser, said Sunday. \u201cThe further introduction of U.S. troops to fully re-engage in ground combat in the Middle East is not the way to deal with this challenge.\u201d\n\n(In an interview with ABC News on Sunday, Mr. Rhodes sought to clarify Mr. Obama\u2019s comment that the Islamic State had been contained. Mr. Rhodes said, \u201cThe fact is, we have been able to stop that geographic advance and take back significant amounts of territory in both northern Iraq and northern Syria.\u201d)\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s reaction to the attacks in France reminded foreign policy experts of the gulf between the president and Mrs. Clinton, which first emerged in their 2008 primary contest as Mr. Obama contrasted his antiwar message with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2002 vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq.\n\n\u201cBoth when she was secretary of state and since, she has had a sense of focusing not just on the cost of action, but the cost of inaction,\u201d said Dennis B. Ross, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama who is now a distinguished fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cPresident Obama has been much more inclined to the cost of action versus the cost of inaction.\u201d\n\nBut for Mrs. Clinton, embracing an inclination toward intervention is potentially an even more precarious proposition in a Democratic primary than breaking with Mr. Obama.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s Iraq war vote, which she has repeatedly said was a mistake, was a major factor in her defeat in the 2008 primary, and it remains a vulnerability.\n\nOn Saturday, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democratic rival, assailed her for supporting the war. \u201cI don\u2019t think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now,\u201d he said.\n\nAppearing acutely aware of how liberal primary voters, particularly in Iowa, view her hawkish reputation, Mrs. Clinton said on Saturday that \u201cthis cannot be an American fight\u201d and that the United States should not bear \u201cthe bulk of the responsibility.\u201d\n\nThose remarks allowed Republicans to tie Mrs. Clinton to an administration that they widely view as ineffective in combating the Islamic State. \u201cThe president has admitted he does not have a strategy as it relates to ISIS,\u201d Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor and a Republican presidential candidate, told CNN. \u201cHillary Clinton last night said that it\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s not our fight.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt is our fight, and without our leadership in building a coalition to destroy ISIS, it won\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nAt a campaign event in Ames, Iowa, on Sunday, Mrs. Clinton tried to expand on her earlier statement, saying that the United States should play a leadership role and \u201cbe rallying our partners and allies, pulling countries off the sidelines.\u201d\n\nHer seemingly incongruous comments on the issue speak to the reality that there may be no real political upside for Mrs. Clinton in coming out early with a detailed plan for Syria, said Michael O\u2019Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\u201cEven if she could convince people she\u2019s right today, by a year from now, on Election Day, the situation will have morphed,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Hanlon said. \u201cAnd in the meantime, she would have scared a lot of people with a little too much of what the Democratic base doesn\u2019t want to hear right now.\u201d", "byline": "AMY CHOZICK", "description": "The presidential race\u2019s new emphasis on terrorism has laid bare Mrs. Clinton\u2019s long-held differences with President Obama on foreign policy.", "title": "Paris Attacks Complicate Hillary Clinton\u2019s Alignment With Obama", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/us/politics/paris-attacks-complicate-hillary-clintons-alignment-with-obama.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Michael O'Hanlon", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Barack Obama", "Bernie Sanders"], "orgs": ["Brookings Institution"], "election_confidence": 0.7401183880597504, "authors": [{"author_id": 1667, "fullname": "amy chozick", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 10:00:17", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "a310dc5d47425798195debce32f7638f", "date_access": "2015-11-17 10:27:40.091557"},

Given the stream of nativist rhetoric already out there, it was also inevitable that some politicians' responses would be highly objectionable, beginning with Texas Sen. \nTed Cruz\n's assertion that the United States should accept only Christian refugees from the Syrian conflict. Former Florida Gov. \nJeb Bush\n sounded a similar note, calling for special efforts to protect Christians in the region; never mind that \nIslamic State\n jihadists \ntarget fellow Muslims with just as much viciousness\n.\nIt's preposterous that a serious contender for the presidency of the U.S. would bar war refugee status based on someone's religion. And the suggestion by GOP candidate \nBen Carson\n that the U.S. bar all Syrian refugees for fear that a \"sleeper\" terrorist might slip in is an emotional, and ill-conceived, overreaction, as are pledges by several Republican governors to resist efforts to resettle refugees in their states.\nThe United States doesn't have the same challenge as Europe, whose relative proximity to the Middle Eastern war zone has left it inundated with millions of refugees. And the source isn't just Syria and Iraq; refugees \u2014 both political and economic \u2014 from Africa have landed in Europe as well. There are few good options for stopping that tide without first stabilizing the regions from which it arises; a political solution to the Syrian civil war is a crucial first step to achieving that stability.\nWe haven't faced this exodus simply because it is so much harder for Syrian refugees to arrive at the border and seek asylum. President Obama affirmed in Turkey on Tuesday that \"America has to step up and do its part\" in providing for war refugees, which presumably includes moving ahead with his plan to accept up to 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year, up from fewer than 2,000. This page has argued that the U.S. should take significantly more because there are too many for Europe to absorb and because of our history as a safe haven. Nothing in the Paris attacks changes that.\nThat's not to suggest that the U.S. should accept any and all comers. What the Republican candidates ignore, though, is that there is already a system in place to vet the refugees. To gain entry to the U.S., a Syrian refugee first must pass rigorous screening by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which verifies personal backgrounds and details before recommending individuals for resettlement to the United States. Then the Department of Homeland Security does its own screening before a refugee is granted entry and protection.\nIt makes sense to be prudent and diligent when accepting refugees from a region of such threat and instability. But it defies what the nation stands for to deny a safe haven for the persecuted based on their faith, nation of origin, or our fear.\nFollow the Opinion section on Twitter \n@latimesopinion\n and \nFacebook", "byline": "", "description": "<p>It was inevitable that the terrorism attacks in Paris last week would echo quickly through the U.S. presidential campaign.

And I, too, was taken back to September 11, 2001, and the horrifying images of the collapsing World Trade Center and carnage at the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania.\nThat was a life-altering morning for America. We quickly accepted the need to partially disrobe to get on airplanes, to open our purses at ballparks, to assume the government might be listening to our telephone calls and reading our emails.\nNow, the Paris attacks will change the French way of life -- substantially in the short term, and perhaps significantly in the long term, as well. And, as a fellow citizen of the free world, I offer my support to France and encourage American leaders to do everything possible to assist our friends. \nBut I am not going to tri-color my face.\nThe truth is that this perhaps well-intentioned show of solidarity cheapens the suffering of Parisians and trivializes the war on terror. ISIS is not a boogie man in a video game, it is a true threat to all who believe in self-evident freedoms, including the right to worship (or not) as we wish. \nIndeed, a core component of American and French democracy is freedom of religion and the rejection of theistic triumphalism.

It needs to be treated seriously, and so Facebook makeup is not the correct response.\nThe new cycle of response to terrorist attacks is this: Grieve loudly, adopt a symbol, justify suspicions of anyone different from ourselves and eventually go back to our relatively carefree and careless lives.\nIn the wake of the World Trade Center attacks, the nation rallied around Gotham, embraced the FDNY, the NYPD and the hardhats. Yet 14 years later, there may not be the political will to even pass the Zadroga Act to extend health care benefits for people injured saving others that day. Rudy Giuliani, meanwhile, went from being \"America's Mayor\" to someone with less political oomph than Donald Trump or Ben Carson, men who never held elected office nor stood in the pit at ground zero.\nSoon, the French flag will fade from Facebook. In another couple of news cycles, Paris will drop from the headlines. The terrorists, though, will not evaporate, and they will not be scared off by cheap symbols.\nInstead, American leadership needs to translate the requirements for the war on terror from symbols to tangible action. We will see more heavily armed police on our streets. The director of the CIA claims he needs more leeway to track terrorists, to listen to more telephone calls and capture more communications. Yet many of those Facebook patriots will claim that armored cops are polarizing, and that the privacy of our innermost thoughts shared on social media is constitutionally protected and should be exempt from scrutiny.\nAn American with a French Facebook flag demeans the war on terror and is as effective as a smiley face.\n Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.\n", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Opinion: Enough with French Flag Facebook logo", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/17/opinions/mulvaney-facebook-french-flag/index.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Rudy Giuliani", "Ben Carson"], "orgs": ["NYPD", "CIA", "World Trade Center", "Pentagon"], "election_confidence": 0.5058709993072555, "authors": [{"author_id": 45910, "fullname": "james mulvaney", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 23:57:15", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "a3102045d9c5551d22598b37b7c7a8ed", "date_access": "2015-11-18 01:02:02.921841"},
{"body": "Leslie Dach, Senior Counselor of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services speaks with WSJ\u2019s Laura Landro at CEO Council about the future of the Affordable Care Act.\nBy now, supporters and opponents of the Affordable Care Act\u00c2\u00a0often divide along \u201cglass half full or half empty\u201d lines over similar facts, and each perspective was on display at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council on Tuesday.\n\u201cWe believe coverage in general has been improved\u201d by the 2010 law, said Health and Human Services senior counselor Leslie Dach. \u201cThat\u2019s an important beginning.\u201d\nHis agency has estimated that the law has extended coverage to 17.6 million people, between its provision requiring plans to cover young adult dependents to their 26th birthdays, the expansion of Medicaid, and the availability of subsidized private coverage to everyone through HealthCare.gov and state equivalents. The law also imposes new requirements on insurance plans on what they must cover, and says\u00c2\u00a0they must price coverage equally regardless of people\u2019s medical history, and these affect everyone who gets insurance on their own.\nIt\u2019s true that the law has made a significant dent in the number of people without insurance, and made sweeping changes to the way coverage operates in America. For critics, the issue isn\u2019t how many people it\u2019s covered \u2013\u00c2\u00a0it\u2019s how many have been left behind.\nRepublican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, speaking after Mr. Dach, pointed to Congressional Budget Office estimates suggesting that as many as 35 million people are still without coverage, and 27 million will be uninsured five years from now, to argue\u00c2\u00a0the health law has required too much to do too little.\n\u201cIt is an incredible amount of disruption to still have that many people uncovered when all is said and done,\u201d he said. Mr. Thune said that Republican replacements for the law all aim to find some way of providing insurance for people with pre-existing conditions that once could have barred them from buying insurance on their own, but with relaxed requirements on what coverage must include, as a way of bringing the price down.\nMORE FROM WSJ CEO COUNCIL:\nTop Clinton Adviser Says Wealthy Should Pay More in Taxes\nObama Adviser Furman Sees Limited Economic Impact From Paris Attacks\nDefense Chief Ash Carter Calls on Europe to Do More to Confront ISIS\nMarco Rubio Says GOP Rivals Tried to Weaken U.S. Intelligence Efforts\n______________________________________________________\n2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll Standings\n\n\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops. \r\n\nCapital Journal Daybreak Newsletter: Sign up to get the latest on politics, policy and defense delivered to your inbox every morning.\r\nFor the latest Washington news, follow @wsjpolitics\r\nFor outside analysis, follow @wsjthinktank", "byline": "", "description": "By now, supporters and opponents of\u00a0the Affordable Care Act\u00a0often divide along \"glass half full or half empty\" lines over similar facts, and each perspective was on display at the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/specialcoverage/ceo-council-2015\">Wall Street Journal CEO Council</a>\u00a0on Tuesday.\n\n\"We believe coverage in general has been improved\" by the 2010 law, said Health and Human Services senior counselor Leslie Dach. \"That's an important beginning.", "title": "At WSJ CEO Council, Health Law\u2019s Success Depends on Which Number You Prefer", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/17/at-wsj-ceo-council-glass-is-half-full-or-half-empty-on-health-law/", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "health"], "people": ["Ash Carter", "Marco Rubio", "John Thune"], "orgs": ["WSJ", "U.S. Department of Health and Human Services", "Health and Human Services", "Congressional Budget Office", "Capital Journal", "Medicaid", "HealthCare", "GOP"], "election_confidence": 0.8322229528304158, "authors": [{"author_id": 1141, "fullname": "louise radnofsky", "primary_org": "wsj"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 17:01:38", "org": "wsj", "article_id": "1aeb56b9db98d1b0a0eb823a4444e624", "date_access": "2015-11-17 18:04:02.405423"},
{"body": "Louisiana Gov. \nBobby Jindal\n, who campaigned as an unstinting champion of social conservatives but found himself crowded out by other more forceful, dynamic personalities, on Tuesday abruptly ended his bid for the Republican presidential nomination.\nJindal, 44, had staked out far-right territory -- with a particular focus on social conservatives -- but never gained traction during a primary that\u2019s been dominated by outsiders with similar or more conservative views, particularly \nDonald Trump\n and \nBen Carson\n.\nJindal noted that the policy papers his campaign had unveiled in recent months, on issues such as energy and education, hadn't\u00a0resonated with voters.\n\u201cDuring this crazy, unpredictable election season, clearly there just wasn\u2019t a lot of interest in those policy papers,\u201d he said Tuesday in an announcement on Fox News.\nJindal consistently drew support in polls in the low single digits and never made it to the main stage in any of the Republican debates. His exit from the crowded \nGOP\n primary comes after Wisconsin Gov. \nScott Walker\n and former Texas Gov. \nRick Perry\n also departed the race.\n\u201cThe Republican Party has to lay out the pathway for why we are the party for opportunity and growth,\u201d Jindal said Tuesday.\nEarlier this week, a blow to Jindal\u2019s campaign came when Rep. \nSteve King\n (R-Iowa), a firebrand among \ntea party\n conservatives, threw his support behind Sen. \nTed Cruz\n of Texas. King had been heavily courted by the Louisiana governor for his endorsement.\nJindal spent the majority of his time campaigning in Iowa --\u00a0by some tallies, more than any other GOP candidate -- where caucusgoers will kick off voting in the 2016 election cycle in February.\nCraig Robinson\n, former political director of the Iowa Republican Party, said that while grass-roots social conservatives in Iowa supported Jindal's\u00a0message, he\u00a0just lacked the appeal of Cruz.\nCruz \u201cjust brought more juice and generated a lot more enthusiasm,\u201d Robinson said.\nDennis Goldford, a longtime student of the Iowa caucuses who teaches political science at Des Moines' \nDrake University\n, noted the large amount of time Jindal spent in Iowa, dating back to last year.\n\u201cJindal would always get a good response from audiences, but that enthusiastic support never showed up in his poll numbers,\u201d Goldford said.\nMoreover, Goldford noted that Jindal was vying for the social conservative vote along with Cruz, Carson and Mike Huckabee, winner of 2008 caucus. Collectively, those candidates took \u201call the oxygen out of the room.\u201d\nYet Jindals\u2019 campaign on Tuesday did not highlight other candidates as a reason for his exit.\nCurt Anderson, a chief strategist to Jindal, said Tuesday that his lack of fundraising -- which hovered near a paltry $1.1 million -- was among the deciding factors for his exit from the race.\n\u201cWe were far behind,\u201d Anderson said. \"Say what you want, it takes money to win elections.\"\nBarabak reported from Des Moines and Lee from Los Angeles.\nFollow \n@kurtisalee\n\u00a0and \n@markzbarabak\n\u00a0for political news.\nALSO\nWhy the LAFD is still largely white and male despite diversity efforts\nFormer Assembly leader urges dialogue, caution at California colleges\nLike a 'stab in your brain' -- Complaints from Bay Area residents in noisy flight path spike 2,706%", "byline": "", "description": "<p>Louisiana Gov.

{"body": "Once billed as a rising star in the Republican Party, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana had his 2016 presidential bid fail to make it out of 2015 as a flat message and flagging poll numbers plagued his campaign. Mr. Jindal remained fiery on stump until the end, but his conservative message did not resonate in this cycle\u2019s crowded field. \n\nThe Beginning: Mr. Jindal kicked off his campaign in June in a suburb of New Orleans and touted his record as a two-term governor in the state. Framing himself as a social conservative who knows how to get things done, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had enough of talkers. It is time for a doer.\u201d\n\nThe Strategy: His poll numbers low from the beginning, Mr. Jindal set his sights on Iowa, hoping that the caucus state could propel his campaign forward. He managed to connect with the Hawkeye State\u2019s evangelical Christians at the July Family Leadership Summit and drew a loud ovation when he defended religious freedom. \u201cAmerica did not create religious liberty,\u201d Mr. Jindal said. \u201cReligious liberty created the United States of America.\u201d\n\nThe Policies: Mr. Jindal made repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act a hallmark of his candidacy, vowing to voters that he was the only one who could do it. He also looked to take the most conservative positions possible on most issues. In August he said at an education summit that mayors of \u201csanctuary cities\u201d should be prosecuted when undocumented immigrants commit crimes. \n\nThe Trump Factor: By September it was evident that Mr. Jindal\u2019s campaign was failing to catch on, and he took to loudly attacking Donald J. Trump in hopes of grabbing some of the spotlight. In a speech at the National Press Club, Mr. Jindal called Mr. Trump a \u201cnarcissist\u201d and an \u201cegomaniacal madman\u201d who had no principles. Mr. Jindal, a former Rhodes scholar, also said that Mr. Trump\u2019s hairstyle looked as if he were wearing a squirrel on his head. \n\nThe Debate: Mr. Jindal was relegated to the \u201cundercard\u201d in the Republican debates, and his frustration was clear. He threatened to skip the party\u2019s debate in late October, and in the most recent debate he spent most of his time attacking the record of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. \n\nThe End: Revealing his plans on Fox News, Mr. Jindal suspended his campaign on Nov. 17 and released a statement acknowledging, \u201cThis is not my time.\u201d ", "byline": "ALAN RAPPEPORT", "description": "Once billed as a rising Republican star, Gov.

{"body": "Ordinary observers don\u2019t need to try to explain the consequences of the attacks in Paris that killed 129 people on Friday night. But presidential candidates do.\n\nSuch is the dance of a political campaign reacting to events in real time. Candidates must attempt to honor a tragic event without cheapening it, while at the same time stealthily framing their own positions as more presidential than those of their competitors.\n\nThat tension was apparent Saturday night during the second Democratic presidential debate, which began with a moment of silence for the attacks in Paris.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, who has championed not running a negative campaign, let loose on Hillary Rodham Clinton for voting for the war in Iraq during her time in the Senate, and implicitly blamed the Iraq invasion for the resulting rise of the Islamic State.\n\nOn the Republican side, candidates have suggested different approaches to combating the Islamic State. Senator Lindsey Graham wants the United States to send ground troops into Iraq and Syria, while Donald J. Trump has previously boasted that he would aggressively bomb Iraqi oil fields and \u201ctake away their wealth.\u201d\n\nAlmost the entire Republican field has used the Paris attacks as evidence that Syrian refugees should not be allowed to resettle in the United States, arguing that the current vetting process is not sound enough to ensure that terrorists are kept out.\n\nWe may not want to politicize tragedies, but tragedies have political outcomes all the same. President George W. Bush\u2019s approval rating skyrocketed after 9/11, to 90 percent in the days after the attacks from 55 percent a month before. This impulse to circle the wagons around your leader in a time of crisis, no matter your political persuasion, is known as the \u201crally \u2019round the flag effect.\u201d\n\nWhen tragedy strikes during a presidential campaign, the candidates involved have to respond respectfully, while also getting voters to see them as trustworthy and willing to stand up to acts of brutality: in other words, like a commander in chief. Mrs. Clinton made that intent clear in Saturday night\u2019s debate.\n\n\u201cThis election is not only about electing a president; it\u2019s also about choosing our next commander in chief,\u201d she said. \u201cI will be laying out in detail what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism. Our country deserves no less because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.\u201d\n\nThat answer echoed the \u201c3 a.m. phone call\u201d ad that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign ran during the 2008 Democratic primary as proof that she was more reliable on national security than Barack Obama. But while, in 2008, the Democratic base was sick of hawkishness and far enough removed from 2001 to yearn for an antiwar candidate, 2016 may favor Mrs. Clinton\u2019s experience in times of strife.\n\nIn the 2004 campaign, Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont emerged as a front-runner, earning the endorsement of Al Gore and standing out in the field as an antiwar firebrand. In December 2003, just before the Iowa caucuses, Saddam Hussein was captured, giving the Bush administration a much-needed win and increasing hopes that the Iraq war wasn\u2019t a quagmire-to-be after all. It was John Kerry, a Vietnam veteran who voted as a senator in 2002 to give the president the authority to use military force in Iraq, who won at the Iowa caucuses, not Mr. Dean.\n\nDavid Wade, who served as press secretary during Mr. Kerry\u2019s 2004 campaign and went on to serve as chief of staff under Mr. Kerry at the State Department, noted the political challenges of that time. \u201cWe were campaigning in an age of color-coded homeland security alerts,\u201d Mr. Wade said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very tricky exercise to run a presidential campaign, particularly as a challenger, against the backdrop of unpredictable and unfolding national security events.\u201d\n\nWhen campaigning during a period of crisis, style can be more important than substance. Voters want to feel safe more than they want to read a five-point plan on intelligence operations and coalition building. According to Mr. Wade, voters want to answer the question, \u201cCan I picture this person in my living room on my television as commander in chief when something bad happens?\u201d\n\nUltimately, the Democratic electorate decided in 2004 that Mr. Dean did not pass the commander in chief test. Today, we may see a similar trajectory for Democratic voters who might have common ground with Mr. Sanders on economic issues, but can\u2019t quite picture him in the Situation Room.\n\nMatt Latimer, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush, said that as voters\u2019 attention is drawn more to global instability, the love for political outsiders may fade. \u201cThe nation is going to select a new commander in chief, and at times like this they will be drawn to candidates who look the part,\u201d Mr. Latimer said. \u201cThat probably is not helpful to someone like a Ben Carson or a Bernie Sanders.\u201d\n\nThe psychologist Abraham Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs holds true in politics, too. When humans feel threatened, they are less inclined to take risks \u2014 whether that meant, in ancient times, venturing farther away from caves, or voting for a candidate who is not a known political entity. When an attack like the one we saw in Paris throws our own national security into question, seeking out a maverick candidate tends to take a back seat to finding someone safe.\n\nAnd it\u2019s still relatively early in the campaign. The political calculus that goes into a foreign policy platform during the primaries is much different during the general election. Mr. Bush\u2019s campaign successfully branded Mr. Kerry as a flip-flopper, especially on his support for, then opposition to, the war in Iraq. The same moderate foreign policy stances that made Mr. Kerry stand out from his more liberal competitors during the primary got him labeled an equivocator in the general election.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what political ramifications the attacks in Paris will have on the presidential election a year from now \u2014 and it feels crass to even raise that question \u2014 but there is evidence that when people feel threatened or experience personal trauma, they tend to vote more conservatively. One 2013 study found that relatives of Sept. 11 victims who did not identify as Republican before the attacks were more likely than a control group to say they were Republican in the years after.\n\n. Other studies have found that participants respond more conservatively to political survey questions after being shown images meant to provoke fear or disgust.\n\nIt\u2019s challenging, as a political candidate, to process news of a tragedy that\u2019s still unfolding. But news will continue to unfold, and shape how voters see things in the process. Candidates can\u2019t choose the political climate they campaign in. They can, however, choose how to react.", "byline": "EMMA ROLLER", "description": "We may not want to politicize tragedies, but tragedies have political outcomes all the same.", "title": "Contributing Op-Ed Writer: After Paris, Who Passes the \u2018Commander in Chief Test\u2019?", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/17/opinion/campaign-stops/after-paris-who-passes-the-commander-in-chief-test.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["John Kerry", "Saddam Hussein", "Lindsey Graham", "Matt Latimer", "Howard Dean", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "George W.

{"body": "Organized labor took a major step in coalescing around \nHillary Rodham Clinton\n on Tuesday, as one of its heavyweights voted to endorse her despite loud objections from backers of her rival and longtime labor stalwart \nBernie Sanders\n.\nThe Service Employees International Union, which represents 2 million workers in service industries such as healthcare and child care, made the endorsement following a lengthy debate at a meeting of its executive board here.\n\u201cWe feel very confident about Hillary Clinton\u2019s capacity to fight, win and deliver for working people,\u201d SEIU International President Mary Kay Henry said in an interview immediately following the endorsement vote. Henry said the 77-member board overwhelmingly approved the move in a voice vote. \u201cWe looked at the analytics and believe that this is the woman who can win in a general election,\u201d Henry said.\nThough\u00a0Sanders, a senator from Vermont, has received the support of a few smaller unions, including those that represent nurses and postal workers, the major organizations have been lining up with Clinton, a former senator and secretary of State. With the SEIU endorsement, she now has unions representing roughly two-thirds of the country\u2019s unionized workers supporting her.\n\u201cAs president, I will be proud to stand with SEIU and fight alongside them \u2014 to defend workers\u2019 right to organize and unions\u2019 right to bargain collectively, to raise incomes for working people and the middle class, and to ensure that hardworking Americans can retire with dignity and security,\u201d Clinton said in a statement.\nThe SEIU support is particularly meaningful among the labor endorsements Clinton has been racking up. The union is at the forefront of the push to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour, which Sanders has endorsed but not Clinton. Some local SEIU chapters had urged the board not to endorse Clinton, warning she was a status quo candidate.\nYet Clinton has long been popular among the SEIU rank and file, a racially diverse group with a large presence in Western states. And union leaders at SEIU and elsewhere are anxious about the possibility of losing the White House at a time when their organizations are under siege in Congress and at the Supreme Court.

The union is one of the top political spenders in the country, with a history of investing tens of millions of dollars on Democrats in presidential election cycles. The union is also a key source of boots on the ground.

The unions that have endorsed Mrs. Clinton collectively represent well over half of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 14.6 million union members in 2014.\nSEIU, which has nearly two million members, said it chose to support Mrs. Clinton because she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a leader who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll fight to raise wages and stand up for working people. The union also said she values the kind of care work that many SEIU members do daily, including the work of home-care aides who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been fighting for higher minimum pay.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSEIU members and working families across America are part of a growing movement to build a better future for their families, and Hillary Clinton will support and stand with them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s President Mary Kay Henry said in a statement\u00c2\u00a0Tuesday.\nSEIU said it spent months\u00c2\u00a0gauging its members\u00e2\u0080\u0099 support of the candidates, including through polls and tele-town hall meetings.

Members of a group called SEIU for Bernie had been voicing concern for weeks that an endorsement of Mrs. Clinton could undermine the Fight for $15 campaign. The SEIU-funded wage campaign began with New York fast-food workers and has evolved into a nationwide push for a $15 federal minimum wage. The campaign is also trying to use the wage issue to build a bloc of like-minded voters for the 2016 elections.\u00c2\nMr. Sanders backs a $15 federal minimum wage while Mrs. Clinton has said she supports a federal minimum of $12. When asked last week whether that would affect SEIU\u00e2\u0080\u0099s endorsement process, the union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president Ms. Henry suggested there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room for improvement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor us, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about driving the movement alongside of the candidates,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in an interview.\nFor its part, the Sanders campaign sought to downplay the union endorsements for Mrs. Clinton, focusing instead on the support it has received from rank-and-file union members.\n\u201cWe are gratified that hundreds of thousands of workers are part of the growing grassroots movement supporting Bernie\u2019s campaign to help working families by raising the minimum wage, providing health care for all and making college affordable,\u201d said Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign.\n\n______________________________________________________\n2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll Standings\n\n\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops. \r\n\nCapital Journal Daybreak Newsletter: Sign up to get the latest on politics, policy and defense delivered to your inbox every morning.\r\nFor the latest Washington news, follow @wsjpolitics\r\nFor outside analysis, follow @wsjthinktank", "byline": "", "description": "The giant and politically influential Service Employees International Union\u2019s endorsement of Hillary Clinton Tuesday gives the Democratic front-runner her 13th nod from a national labor union, underscoring the growing strength of her campaign.", "title": "SEIU\u2019s Clinton Nod Signals Campaign\u2019s Momentum Growing", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/17/seius-clinton-nod-signals-campaigns-momentum-growing/", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "health"], "people": ["Mary Kay Henry", "Bernie Sanders", "Hillary Clinton", "Michael Briggs"], "orgs": ["Service Employees International Union", "National Education Association", "SEIU", "WSJ", "Clintonas", "Capital Journal", "American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees"], "election_confidence": 0.8321429190264561, "authors": [{"author_id": 2297, "fullname": "melanie trottman", "primary_org": "wsj"}], "date_written": "2015-11-18 01:03:47", "org": "wsj", "article_id": "2f430655e6cca0f17f0cbee3282d955a", "date_access": "2015-11-18 01:59:39.697391"},

There were no amendments by, or co-sponsored by, Mr. Cruz that were voted on during the work of the so-called Gang of Eight.

{"body": "There is only one Hindu in Congress and she is a Democrat. But as of Tuesday, there will be a Republican Hindu Coalition, comprised of Indian Americans looking to amplify their voice in U.S. politics.\nThe group, which formally launches Tuesday evening, isn\u2019t aimed at bolstering the ranks of Hindus across the aisle from Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii). Instead, the coalition is focused on advancing conservative policies important to the Republican Hindu community, including fiscal discipline, expanded trade, and forceful defense, said its founder Shalabh Kumar. Mr. Kumar is the chief executive of AVG Group, a cluster of electronics-related companies.\nMr. Kumar said he modeled the group after the Republican Jewish Coalition, after attending its annual conference and leaving impressed by its influence on conservative policy toward Israel.\n\u201cI was sort of surprised at the way it caught fire,\u201d Mr. Kumar said of his idea. \u201cI went to my friend who I consider to be the smartest man on this earth, [former House] Speaker Newt Gingrich.

The political action committee connected to the coalition plans to raise at least $5 million, with the goal of raising $10 million for next year\u2019s elections, he said.\nThe wealth of the Indian-American community may help explain why the coalition\u2019s launch is drawing an all-star roster of Republicans, with appearances expected by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R., Calif.) and other influential GOP lawmakers.\nIn 2010, the median annual household income for Indian Americans was $88,000, higher than the $66,000 median for all Asian Americans and the $49,800 median of all U.S. households, according to the Pew Research Center. Indian Americans are also among the most highly-educated ethnic groups, with 70% of those 25 or older possessing a college degree. (About half of Indian Americans are Hindu, but more than 90% of all Asian-American Hindus have Indian heritage, according to Pew.)\nMr. Kumar said the coalition will be advocating for tighter federal spending, an overhaul of the legal immigration system, and boosted trade with India. It will also be making its voice known on foreign policy issues. The group could break with conservative Republicans over some issues, including the Export-Import Bank. Mr. Kumar backs reauthorizing the agency, which provides financing and other support to U.S. exporters and has become a favored target of conservative groups, which view it as corporate welfare.\nThe group and its political action committee will also work to register voters and boost turnout among Indian Americans.\n______________________________________________________\n2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll Standings\n\n\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops. \r\n\nCapital Journal Daybreak Newsletter: Sign up to get the latest on politics, policy and defense delivered to your inbox every morning.\r\nFor the latest Washington news, follow @wsjpolitics\r\nFor outside analysis, follow @wsjthinktank", "byline": "", "description": "There is only one Hindu in Congress and she is a Democrat.

{"body": "WASHINGTON A 12-nation Pacific Rim free-trade deal, facing stiff opposition from many Democrats and unexpected resistance from Republicans, is unlikely to be voted on by the U.S. Congress before President Barack Obama leaves office, according to some Republican lawmakers and aides.\nA veteran Senate Republican aide, who asked not to be identified, said Republican leaders intend to shelve the deal until after the November 2016 presidential election, which would dash administration hopes of a vote in the first half of next year.\nThe aide added that much of the Senate Republican rank and file \"is not supportive of the agreement\" negotiated by Obama and 11 other countries that aims to liberalize trade for 40 percent of the world economy.\n\"I doubt seriously that we're going to get that resolved by 2016,\" Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch told Reuters on Tuesday regarding the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).\n\nUPDATE  \n\"Nobody wants to do it in the lame duck either so it will probably carry over,\" Hatch said referring to the end-year session of Congress that occurs after the November elections but before the new Congress and president are sworn in.\nHatch previously had said it would be difficult to bring TPP to a vote in Congress during the 2016 election year. Congressional aides' comments suggested Hatch's sentiment was widely held.\nWith few Democrats in the House expected to vote for TPP, Obama has been relying on Republicans - who control both the Senate and the House of Representatives - to provide the votes needed for approval.\nOn Friday, Obama urged Congress to \"move promptly\" in early 2016 to approve the trade pact. He is scheduled to attend an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Manila this week, where he also hopes to build momentum for the TPP, a key plank of the administration's engagement with Asia.\nBut the outlook has soured in Congress. Although many farm lobby groups have come out in support, business groups are still mulling the fine print. New House Speaker Paul Ryan, a trade supporter, has yet to declare his view. A spokesman for Ryan said no decision had been made on the timing of a vote. \nAnother House Republican leadership aide said TPP needs a long, thorough review by Congress, calling it a \u201ccomplicated, lengthy deal.\u201d The aide added: \u201cThe president doesn\u2019t have the political capital (to get it passed) that he once had.\u201d\nHatch has criticized the deal for failing to secure 12 years of protection for some pharmaceuticals, a goal that U.S. officials say was just not possible given staunch opposition from countries like Australia. \nThe high-ranking Republican has said Obama might have to reopen negotiations with the other 11 countries to address his concerns. That idea has been firmly rejected by the White House and Japan, the second-biggest economy in the bloc.\n\"No one is in a hurry, and the message from many (Senate Republicans) will be we need to restart negotiations,\" the Senate aide told Reuters.\nComplicating TPP's prospects in Congress are opposition from aspiring presidential candidates, including Republican front-runner Donald Trump. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has split with Obama and said free-trade deals could do \"more harm than good.\"\nPete Sessions, a senior House of Representatives Republican who supported key trade legislation earlier this year, told Reuters that the Obama administration failed to follow markers put down by Congress when he negotiated TPP.\n\"It's a tough thing for a Republican to put a trade bill up (for a vote) and not support it when the whole concept was for us to offer an advantage against what the Chinese have done to the marketplace, and that's what this was about.\"\n\n (Reporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)", "byline": "", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A 12-nation Pacific Rim free-trade deal, facing stiff opposition from many Democrats and unexpected resistance from Republicans, is unlikely to be voted on by the U.S. Congress before President Barack Obama leaves office, according to some Republican lawmakers and aides.", "title": "Prospects dim for 2016 Pacific Rim trade vote in U.S. Congress", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/QIaAhZRtwh4/story01.htm", "topics": ["trade"], "people": ["Richard Cowan", "Hillary Clinton", "Pete Sessions", "Jonathan Oatis", "Donald Trump", "Barack Obama", "Paul Ryan", "Orrin Hatch"], "orgs": ["U.S. Congress", "Congress", "Senate Finance Committee", "Senate", "Senate Republicans", "House of Representatives", "TPP"], "election_confidence": 0.7624647548169273, "authors": [{"author_id": 33425, "fullname": "richard cowan", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 22:12:48", "org": "reuters", "article_id": "50aa75a77c60e3beb907c4c8bf3cd67e", "date_access": "2015-11-17 22:51:17.245733"},
{"body": "WASHINGTON American voters are evenly split between Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton as their top choice to address the issue of terrorism following the Paris attacks, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found.\nAsked to choose between the entire field of 2016 presidential hopefuls, 20 percent of 1,106 respondents surveyed between Nov. 16-17 opted for Trump. An equal share picked Clinton.(polling.reuters.com/#!poll/TM743CY15)\nGiven Clinton's background as a former secretary of state it is perhaps not surprising that she did reasonably well in the poll. However, Trump's good showing upends an emerging narrative that the Paris shootings and suicide bombings would prompt voters to rethink their support for the real estate billionaire, who leads the field of Republican presidential candidates.\nSome pollsters and political pundits had predicted that Republican voters would now gravitate toward establishment candidates like Florida Senator Marco Rubio and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who has been languishing in the polls. Both are seen as stronger on foreign policy than Trump and his main Republican rival, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Neither have any experience in government and are running as Washington outsiders.\nDuring a campaign rally on Saturday, Trump blamed stringent gun laws in Paris for the attacks, telling attendees that it would have been a \u201cmuch different situation\u201d if the victims had been armed. He has also said he would close some mosques to stop Muslim extremist attacks in the United States.\nMirroring national primary polls, Clinton and Trump also took the top marks in the Reuters/Ipsos survey when looking at just voters from their own party. Asked to pick the best Democratic candidate, 52 percent of Democrats polled selected Clinton. When Republicans were asked to choose among their potential nominees, 33 percent said Trump.\nAfter Trump, Republican voters viewed Rubio, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee known for his hawkish views, as the strongest candidate (17 percent) to deal with terrorism. Carson was tied with Bush at around 9 percent. \nOf the Republicans polled, 36 percent said they now have more confidence in Trump's ability to be president - the largest show of support in the primary field. Only 10 percent said they were less confident in his abilities following the attacks.\nCarson and Rubio were also viewed more favorably as potential presidents by Republicans in the poll. Bush, however, got no immediate bump in confidence of his ability to be president. And only 8 percent of Republicans polled thought he would be the best leader to address terrorism.\nThe biggest damage came to a trio of Republican candidates who have struggled to rise in the polls. \nOf those Republicans polled, 16 percent said they now have less confidence in former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, 22 percent felt the same about Ohio Governor John Kasich and 19 percent said they have less confidence in Kentucky Senator Rand Paul - who has distinguished himself as the least hawkish candidate in his party.\n The poll has a credibility interval of 3.4 percentage points for all voters. When looking at just Democrats or Republicans, the poll has a credibility interval of about 5.4 percentage points.\n\n (Additional reporting by Chris Kahn, Alana Wise, editing by Ross Colvin)", "byline": "", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American voters are evenly split between Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton as their top choice to address the issue of terrorism following the Paris attacks, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found.", "title": "Exclusive: After Paris, Americans see Trump, Clinton as most able to address terrorism - poll", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/O2blN43251w/story01.htm", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "John Kasich", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Alana Wise", "Ross Colvin", "Carly Fiorina", "Ben Carson"], "orgs": ["Senate Foreign Relations Committee", "United States."], "election_confidence": 0.9994244511019607, "authors": [{"author_id": 39032, "fullname": "ginger gibson", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 19:00:40", "org": "reuters", "article_id": "b6fc6cb220840be8e85e78a0b2af85f8", "date_access": "2015-11-17 19:49:10.329631"},

{"body": "WASHINGTON U.S. lawmakers called on Tuesday for even tighter scrutiny of Syrian refugees fleeing to the United States as last week's deadly Paris attacks recast America's long-running debate over immigration and national security.\nRepublican leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives, worried about Islamist attacks following Friday's killings of 129 people in France, threatened to suspend President Barack Obama's efforts to allow 10,000 more Syrian refugees into the country.\nDemocrats also called for close vetting of refugees from the four-year-old civil war in Syria in case they are linked to extremist groups such as Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the Paris killings.\nThe attacks focused the spotlight in Washington on national security with the November 2016 presidential election campaign heating up and Obama in the final year of his presidency.\n\"This is a moment where it is better to be safe than sorry,\" the Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters.\nSeparately, two influential senators, Republican Jeff Flake and Democrat Tim Kaine, responded to the Paris attacks by renewing their push for Congress to vote on a formal authorization for the use of military force for the campaign against Islamic State.\nBut most of the emphasis in the Republican-controlled Congress has been on the backlash against Syrian refugees.\nRyan called for a pause in Obama's program, announced in September, to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees in a year. The number of Syrians destined for the United States is low compared with figures in European countries such as Germany. \nThe issue has challenged America's image of itself as a nation that welcomes downtrodden newcomers, with some lawmakers suggesting all Syrians should be barred, or that Christian Syrians should be favored over Muslims.        \nRepublican Senator John McCain on Tuesday backed scrupulous vetting but strongly opposed such discrimination.\n\"All of us are God\u2019s children ... so I disagree with that assumption that only Christian children should be able to come to the United States,\" he told Reuters.\nRepublicans and Democrats have both voiced fears that housing refugees from a conflict zone in the Middle East could  leave the country open to attacks like those staged by al Qaeda  on Sept. 11, 2001.\nSenator Ben Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said Washington should look at the strongest possible vetting process to ensure \"terrorists cannot get into the United States through our refugee program.\"   \nThe current U.S. screening process takes 18 to 24 months and is tighter than that in Europe, he said.\nOther Western countries have begun to question their willingness to admit Syrians after reports that at least one of the Paris attackers passed through Greece in October.\nThe White House National Security Council said it was continuing to look for ways to tighten screening.\nSenior Obama administration officials including Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson held a classified briefing on Tuesday evening for all 435 members of the House about the aftermath of the Paris attacks. But many Republicans remained deeply concerned.\n\"I have great concerns about allowing people on our shores without knowing that we're able to find out information about them,\" said Republican Representative Matt Salmon. \"I'm leaving this briefing far less comfortable than when I came in.\"        \nIMMIGRATION FIGHTS\nU.S. politicians have debated for years over immigration, most recently about Latin Americans who entered the country illegally.\nConservative Republicans in the 2016 White House race are offering competing plans to limit illegal immigration. Republican presidential campaign front-runner Donald Trump has threatened to deport the 11 million already in the United States.     \nRepublican presidential candidate Jeb Bush broke with rivals by saying he would support the entry of some Syrian refugees but stressed that screening must be tough enough to bar militants.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Worrying refugee advocates, at least 26 mostly Republican governors say they are concerned about people resettling in their states after fleeing Syria's four-year-old civil war, saying some could be associated with Islamic State. Other governors, mostly Democrats, have said Syrians are welcome.\nSecretary of State John Kerry said that of 785,000 refugees accepted since 2001, only 12 \"were found to perhaps be problematic with respect to potential terror.\" \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But he told NBC that while screening is effective it will have to be increased and \"will probably go slower and cost more money.\" \nRyan did not offer details about proposed legislation to pause Obama's refugee plan, but said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that he would bring it to the House floor on Thursday.\nHe said he had spoken to the White House, congressional Democrats and senators about the bill.\nSeveral other Republicans are pushing to include a provision to block the resettlement of Syrians in a trillion-dollar budget bill that must be passed, and signed into law by Obama, by Dec. 11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Others have proposed measures setting strict conditions on admitting Syrians, such as requiring the FBI director to certify that refugees' background checks have been completed, and an audit of the vetting process.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Senate, where Republicans hold a smaller majority than in the House, would also have to approve any legislation before it could take effect. Rhetoric there has been less heated than in the House.\nA plan by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to accept 25,000 Syrian refugees by the end of the year ran into trouble on Monday as some local leaders said the timeline is too short.\n\n (Additional reporting by Richard Cowan, David Lawder and Susan Cornwell; Writing by Alistair Bell; Editing by Howard Goller, James Dalgleish and Ken Wills)", "byline": "", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers called on Tuesday for even tighter scrutiny of Syrian refugees fleeing to the United States as last week's deadly Paris attacks recast America's long-running debate over immigration and national security.", "title": "Paris attacks reshape U.S. debate on immigration, security", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/jl7wi84m4eM/story01.htm", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["John Kerry", "Howard Goller", "David Lawder", "Ben Cardin", "James Dalgleish", "Jeb Bush", "Justin Trudeau", "Jeh Johnson", "Donald Trump", "Matt Salmon", "Barack Obama", "Paul Ryan", "Ken Wills", "Richard Cowan", "Susan Cornwell", "Alistair Bell"], "orgs": ["Congress", "Senate", "al Qaeda", "U.S. House of Representatives", "Foreign Relations Committee", "Homeland Security", "United States.", "FBI"], "election_confidence": 0.5448428293822747, "authors": [{"author_id": 33517, "fullname": "patricia zengerle", "primary_org": "reuters"}, {"author_id": 33445, "fullname": "megan cassella", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-11-18 01:21:58", "org": "reuters", "article_id": "f105c042658c9f3a7a0e9a9d43c01a5c", "date_access": "2015-11-18 01:48:40.418413"},

{"body": "When it comes to Saddam Hussein, Senator Bernie Sanders appears to have learned a lesson from another Democratic presidential candidate from Vermont: former Gov. Howard Dean.\n\nIn an interview Tuesday with Katie Couric on Yahoo News, Mr. Sanders said the world would have been better off without the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 \u2013 and, by extension, better off if Hussein had remained in power. It is a remark that, if taken out of context, political opponents could use against Mr. Sanders. But it is also a more nuanced remark on Hussein than Mr. Dean made in December 2003, to disastrous effect.\n\nMr. Dean, who was running strongly in polls at the time because of his steadfast opposition to the Iraq war, gave a major foreign policy speech just two days after American forces had found Hussein hiding in a hole near Tikrit. Mr. Dean uttered 10 words that may have cost him the presidential nomination: \u201cThe capture of Saddam Hussein has not made America safer.\u201d \n\nHis Democratic rivals pounced, saying Mr. Dean\u2019s comment was a clear sign that he was not prepared to lead a nation at wartime; some voters, thrilled that Hussein was in custody, were taken aback by his view.\n\nMr. Sanders, like Mr. Dean, was against the Iraq war, and \u2013 like Senator Barack Obama in 2008 \u2013 has been using Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s vote authorizing the war to attack her judgment. But in the interview on Tuesday, Ms. Couric pressed Mr. Sanders on the link between the unpopular war and the popular ouster of Hussein.\n\n\u201cDo you believe that Iraq would be better off if Saddam Hussein had remained in power?\u201d Ms. Couric asked.\n\nMr. Sanders replied with a level of context and perspective that lacked the sort of easy sound bite that made Mr. Dean so vulnerable.\n\n\u201cDo I think the entire region would have been better off if we had not invaded that country and brought about the massive levels of destabilization which led to the death of 6,700 Americans, 500,000 coming back with P.T.S.D. or T.B.I., the death of many, many hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, the growth of ISIS and Al-Qaeda in that region?\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cDo I think the world have been better off? Yeah.\n\n\u201cSaddam Hussein was a brutal, disgusting tyrant, and the effort would have been, \u2018How do you get rid of him?\u2019 But to destabilize that region the way we did, to bring about that chaos, and the incredible cost to us in terms of human life and trillions of dollar of expenditure \u2013 yes, we should not have undertaken that invasion, and I think history will record that as one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the history of America.\u201d\n\nAs if imagining a television commercial using the remark against him, like happened to Mr. Dean, Mr. Sanders continued: \u201cI don\u2019t want people to be simply saying, \u2018Oh, Bernie Sanders doesn\u2019t have experience in foreign policy.\u2019 True, I was not a secretary of state for four years, I concede that,\u201d a reference to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s tenure. \u201cBut I think if you check my record, and the votes that I\u2019ve cast, and what I have said, you\u2019ll find that, in fact, we do have a lot of credibility in many foreign policy areas.\u201d", "byline": "PATRICK D.

Mr. Clarridge's input to Dr. Carson is appreciated but he is clearly not one of Dr. Carson's top advisers.

McCaskill\n\n11/17/15 05:03 PM EST\nTwo of Ben Carson's own top advisers are knocking his ability to grasp foreign policy despite aggressive tutoring sessions, according to a report in The New York Times. \nThe retired neurosurgeon has bobbled a number of foreign policy issues in recent days, claiming that China has a military presence in Syria and struggling on \"Fox News Sunday\" to name allies he would seek out to create an international military coalition to combat Islamic State, \nStory Continued Below\nNow, two of his advisers told The New York Times in interviews that Carson is having trouble absorbing facts on international affairs.\n\u201cNobody has been able to sit down with him and have him get one iota of intelligent information about the Middle East,\u201d said Duane Clarridge, a top adviser to Carson on terrorism and national security. Carson needs weekly foreign policy briefings to \u201cmake him smart,\u201d added Clarridge, a longtime CIA agent who is seen as a colorful figure. \n\n\n\n            By \nJake Sherman\n\nArmstrong Williams, one of Carson's lead advisers and closest friends, also expressed frustration to the newspaper about the \"Fox News Sunday\" interview. \u201cHe\u2019s been briefed on it so many times,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess he just froze.\u201d\nCarson's campaign has spent a good amount of energy trying to compensate for his comment in last week's debate in which he suggested China is involved in the conflict in Syria. \u201cWe also must recognize that it\u2019s a very complex place,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, the Chinese are there, as well as the Russians, and you have all kinds of factions there.\u201d \n The White House dismissed the notion that the Chinese are in Syria, but Carson stood by his comment. His campaign subsequently said he was referring to Chinese military weapons and equipment.\nBut Clarridge told The New York Times that Carson relied on a freelance American intelligence operative in Iraq who \"overleaped\" in implying that Chinese troops are in Syria.\nThe Carson campaign pushed back on the article, saying the paper took advantage of an \"elderly gentleman.\" \n\n\n\n            By \nEli Stokols\n\n\"Mr. Clarridge has incomplete knowledge of the daily, not weekly briefings, that Dr. Carson receives on important national security matters from former military and State Department officials,\" Doug Watts, a Carson campaign spokesman, told Business Insider in an email. \"He is coming to the end of a long career of serving our country. Mr. Clarridge's input to Dr. Carson is appreciated but he is clearly not one of Dr. Carson's top advisors. For the New York Times to take advantage of an elderly gentleman and use him as their foil in this story is an affront to good journalistic practices.\"\nDespite publicly aired doubts about Carson's ability to master foreign policy issues, voters still rank him relatively high in the GOP field on the topic. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Tuesday, 20 percent of Republican voters surveyed say Donald Trump is best suited to handle terrorism, followed by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at roughly 10 percent, and Carson with 8 percent.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Report: Carson&apos;s top advisers question his foreign policy grasp", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/ben-carson-foreign-policy-advisers-215993", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kenneth P.

But Republican leaders say its passage underscores their message to other world leaders: Congress is not behind Obama's agenda, and a GOP president would most likely abandon his focus on climate change.\nStory Continued Below\nThe House is expected to approve a similar set of resolutions as early as Nov. 30, the first day of the Paris climate summit.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Senate votes to reject Obama climate rule", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/senate-rejects-obama-climate-rule-215984", "topics": ["environment/energy"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kenneth P.

But now, after the terrorist attacks on an American ally, Republican elders think their party\u2019s flirtation with inexperience is nearing its end.\nThe reemergence of foreign policy atop the Republican agenda will force voters to reevaluate the outsider candidates, particularly as both Trump and Carson display a lack of knowledge about national security and the terrorist threat, party stalwarts said.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cThe losers are going to be Donald Trump and Ben Carson on national security,\u201d said Katon Dawson, the former chairman of the South Carolina GOP. \u201cAs the Republican base sobers up, they are the two, if this story lasts a long time, it's going to hurt.\"\nIndeed, in interviews with current and former GOP chairs, veteran operatives, lobbyists and strategists, the long-held conviction that neither Trump nor Carson will win the Republican nomination has only strengthened since the attacks in Paris last week.\nFred Malek, who has advised multiple Republican presidents and is not affiliated with any contender this cycle, said the inexperience Trump and Carson reveal in their rhetoric will drive GOP primary voters toward another candidate.\n\n\n\n            By \nEli Stokols\n\n\u201cThe severity of the attacks in Paris crystallize in people\u2019s minds the importance of having somebody in the commander-in-chief spot who has made the kinds of decisions, gone through the kind of decision-making process, that an experienced leader has,\u201d Malek said.\nCarson in particular is vulnerable on security and foreign policy issues, Republican leaders say. The pediatric neurosurgeon, who has no previous political experience, has already stunned with a meandering answer about the Middle East in last week\u2019s debate, before the attacks. He drew criticism in an earlier debate for suggesting that American brainpower was a substitute for military force and he shocked many by saying he had intelligence that the White House did not about Chinese forces engaging in Syria. \nWorse yet for the candidate, two of Carson\u2019s senior advisors on Tuesday told The New York Times, on the record, that their candidate was struggling to understand the Middle East. Intense tutoring, they told the paper, was having little effect.\nCarson has tried to correct course in recent days. On Friday, he said his message to Vladimir Putin is, \u201cWe are a peaceful country, but we are not a marshmallow.\u201d On Monday, on social media and in a press conference, sought to highlight his plan to take on ISIS and articulate a broader, more cogent foreign policy.\nBut GOP insiders say they aren't impressed, and think the foreign policy shift will take a visible toll on Carson, especially in next month\u2019s debate, which many expect will be filled with security questions. \n\u201cCarson I\u2019m not so worried about,\u201d said Fergus Cullen, the former chairman of the New Hampshire GOP who puts his overall concern level about Trump and Carson at a five, on a scale of 10. \u201cI respect him for his accomplishments in life, but he is completely unprepared to be president of the United States, and that will take care of itself at the polls.\u201d\n\n\n\n            By \nNolan D. McCaskill\n\nThe more exposure he gets, said Doug Gross, a longtime Iowa Republican, the more it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s \u201cnot ready to be president. Just from a policy standpoint, he\u2019s not prepared to deal with issues.\u201d\nLongtime Republicans don\u2019t have nearly as clear a theory of Trump\u2019s downfall. \n\u201cIt\u2019s always easier to predict how this ends up than how [we] get there,\u201d said Stuart Stevens, who was Mitt Romney\u2019s chief strategist. But as for Trump, \u201cI don\u2019t think he wins a single primary\u2026 I think he gets out.\u201d \nOthers agree that he will falter, even as some acknowledge that all predictions of his demise have been wrong thus far. Truly, Trump\u2019s resilience -- even after attacking prisoners of war, immigrants and even Iowans -- has flummoxed and alarmed party leaders.\nForeign policy-minded GOP veterans call Trump an amateur on the issue and say he should be pressed for more policy specifics. But they acknowledge that the fresh focus on security will not be as damaging in the short term to Trump, who can better rouse crowds with his \u201cbomb-the-sh**-out-of-ISIS\u201d rhetoric, as it is to Carson.\nYet, these party leaders and strategists said there\u2019s no feeling of panic. \n\u201cIt\u2019s too early for anyone to be hand-wringing about any particular candidate,\u201d said Matt Strawn, the former chairman of the Iowa GOP, speaking more broadly but offering a sentiment shared by many interviewed. \u201cBoth Iowa and New Hampshire historically make their decisions late.\u201d\nWhile Republican insiders argue that nominating Trump would lose the GOP the White House, they maintain that it\u2019s a nightmare that will never come to pass.\n\"If this was the middle of March and we had a Republican candidate racking up win after win after win in states and we looked like we were free falling into losing not only the White House but also the Senate and seats in the House, yeah, there would be every reason for the party to be deeply concerned about the direction of the country,\" said Henry Barbour, a Republican National Committeeman from Mississippi. \u201cBut it's November.\u201d \nExperienced operatives keep adjusting the timeline for Trump\u2019s decline: several months ago, some campaigns and Republican insiders said the debate would get more serious around Thanksgiving and hurt his standing in the polls but now they\u2019re looking out to January, even February.\n\u201cI\u2019m not totally discounting that this is a real problem,\u201d said Cullen, who now acknowledges he could see Trump winning some early contests. \u201cBut I also think that in the fullness of time this will eventually work itself out.\u201d \n\n\n\n            By \nNahal Toosi\n\nBut most of the Republicans interviewed said Trump in particular doesn\u2019t have the organization or appeal to last deep into the cycle (not to mention that should he show signs of actually winning any contests, plenty of Republicans are prepared to write big checks to a Stop Trump campaign). \n\u201cI\u2019m not too worried about it,\u201d said Charlie Black, another longtime adviser to Republican presidents and presidential campaigns. \u201cTrump\u2019s been losing a little steam since Labor Day, when he was up around 30, now he\u2019s in the low 20s. Carson is as high as he\u2019ll ever be, just because he\u2019s beginning to demonstrate he doesn\u2019t have real good knowledge of the issues. Either of them might win a primary or something, but that\u2019s it.\u201d\nOne indication of impending panic would be a mad scramble to organize an explicit anti-Trump effort. Dawson, who had been looking to form just such a super PAC, hasn\u2019t found a donor yet.\n\"I specifically did not find the right donor to get me to go to that effort. And then Trump's numbers started moving down, from the 30s to the 20s,\" Dawson said. \nThis all changes as the primaries near. If Trump is still on track to win one of the first four voting states, the GOP establishment will face perhaps its final moment to rally around another candidate.\n\u201cThe (Paris) attacks proved that a month is an infinite amount of political time, and that the shape of a campaign can flip dramatically in an instant,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a veteran Republican who served in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cAnd for that reason I believe it's a fair reading of the evidence to say that people don't get serious until, if, and when they vote. And so I want to see what the polls in New Hampshire look like a week, three days, the day before the actual primaries are held...If Donald is at 42 percent in New Hampshire a day before the primary, you may see the establishment freak out.

More than half of U.S. governors have said they do not want Syrian refugees resettled in their states, while House Speaker Paul Ryan says he wants a vote this week on GOP-drafted legislation to halt the administration's plans.\nWorld Relief is one of nine groups, several of them faith-based, that help the U.S. resettle up to 70,000 refugees from around the world in the United States each year. Others include the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, and the Church World Service. Many other faith-based groups, including evangelical Christian organizations, also perform aid work overseas specifically aimed at refugees fleeing conflicts.\n\n\n\n            By \nJake Sherman\n\nFor Republican presidential contenders such as former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who have been working hard at shoring up evangelical support in a crowded field, harsh words against refugees carries a risk of looking politically opportunistic instead of compassionate. Some advocates were particularly shocked when Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie, New Jersey's governor, said that the U.S. should bar Syrian orphaned toddlers if necessary.\n\"That was offensive. That was mean-spirited,\" said one advocate with a Christian group that resettles refugees. He added: \"it\u2019s disappointing because there have been Republican senators and presidents who have strongly supported this program over the years. There\u2019s a proud tradition in the Republican Party of welcoming those who are fleeing persecution, and this takes the party in a negative direction. It\u2019s easy to pick on vulnerable refugees who have no voice. But there are immigrant groups who have voting power that understand what is going on. They understand that it\u2019s an anti-immigrant message.\"\nEven though many on the Christian right have reservations about immigration overall, and may in particular be unhappy about people who illegally enter the United States, there's long been a recognition that refugees fall under a different category. The 11 million Syrians who have either fled the Arab country or are displaced within it are dodging terrorist groups such as the Islamic State or the barrel bombs of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Many are elderly, widowed or in need of medical care.\nSome Republican candidates have suggested that only Syrians who are Christian be allowed on U.S. soil, something President Barack Obama has blasted as shameful. Yang said many evangelical Christians would also oppose such a religious test, especially because many are eager to share their faith with new arrivals.\nThe United States so far has admitted roughly 2,100 Syrians since the conflict in the country began in March 2011. To be allowed in, refugees have to undergo the most stringent security checks of any traveler heading to the United States, according to the State Department. Officials from the Obama administration on Tuesday began reaching out to the media and lawmakers in a bid to explain the screening process, which takes an average of 18-24 months.\nMeanwhile, faith-based groups have also stepped up their advocacy efforts for refugees. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops released a statement expressing distress over calls by elected officials to halt the resettlement program.\n\n\n\n            By \nNahal Toosi\n\n\"These refugees are fleeing terror themselves \u2014 violence like we have witnessed in Paris,\" said the statement by Bishop Eusebio Elizondo, chairman of the conference's committee on migration. \"Instead of using this tragedy to scapegoat all refugees, I call upon our public officials to work together to end the Syrian conflict peacefully so the close to 4 million Syrian refugees can return to their country and rebuild their homes. Until that goal is achieved, we must work with the world community to provide safe haven to vulnerable and deserving refugees who are simply attempting to survive.\"\nSince the Paris attacks, World Relief has used a website to urge people to contact their governors to express their support for resettling Syrians. The Anti-Defamation League also have spoken out in favor of helping the Syrian refugees, noting that U.S. wariness to accept Jewish refugees during World War II is an example that must not be repeated.\nJonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive officer of the ADL and a former Obama aide, stressed that much remains unknown about the Paris attacks, including the exact nature of the allegation that a Syrian migrant was one of the eight or nine attackers. Even if a terrorist posed as a migrant to reach France, it's less likely that the U.S., with oceans to protect it and a stricter screening process, faces the same level of dangers, other advocates said.\n\"Republicans and Democrats have to tread very carefully here,\" Greenblatt said. \"Faith-based voters are very attentive to these issues. They\u2019re very sensitive to helping those in need.\"\nJoanne Kelsey, assistant director for advocacy with Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said she hoped that the sound and fury over refugees would soon be replaced with reason as Republican lawmakers and officials get more details about how the refugee program works.\n\"This is a very reactionary time,\" she said.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Evangelical Christians, as well as Christians more broadly, are a core group in the Republican electoral base and are among the most passionate advocates for aiding refugees.", "title": "Christian groups break with GOP over Syrian refugees", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/refugees-christians-215991", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kenneth P.

We don't make good decisions if its based on hysteria or an exaggeration of risks,\" Obama said while visiting the Philippines for the APEC economic summit. \"I cannot think of a more potent recruitment tool for ISIL than some of the rhetoric that's been coming out of here during the course of this debate.\"\nStory Continued Below\nIn the wake of the deadly attacks in Paris, more than half of U.S. governors, most of them Republican, have said they don't want refugees resettled in their states. House Republican leaders also are looking at legislation designed to stop the Obama administration from resettling up to 10,000 Syrian refugees next year. Several GOP presidential contenders have also slammed the idea of letting Syrians in, while some have suggested only letting in those who are Christian.\nObama earlier this week has expressed anger over the idea of discriminating based on religion, and reiterated that sentiment in his latest comments in Manila.\n\"When individuals say we should have a religious test and that only Christians, proven Christians should be admitted, that's offensive,\" he said.\nThe president also noted that many of the same people who have suggested stopping refugees from coming to the United States also claim they themselves are tough enough to stare down Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\n\n            By \nJake Sherman\n\n\"At first they were too scared of the press being too tough on them in the debates,\" Obama said. \"Now they are scared of three-year-old orphans. That doesn't seem so tough to me.\"\nThe president's comments appear to be a reference to remarks by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Monday: \u201cI don\u2019t think orphans under 5 are being, you know, should be admitted into the United States at this point. But you know, they have no family here.

President Barack Obama has said the U.S. will accept 10,000 refugees over the next year. Trump often cites a far higher figure \u2014 250,000 \u2014 that has no basis in fact. On Tuesday morning, Trump tweeted, \"Refugees from Syria are now pouring into our great country. Who knows who they are - some could be ISIS. Is our president insane?\"\nAt a rally in Knoxville, Tenn., on Monday, Trump said the refugees should stay within Syria. \"What I'd like is ... build a big beautiful safe zone and you have whatever it is so people can live, and they'll be happier,\" he said.\nIngraham said that she had spoken with Florida's Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, who told her his state is already hosting dozens of Syrian refugees because \u201ceverybody wants to come to Florida\u201d due to its low taxes and ample job opportunities.\n\u201cIn California, you have a Democrat as a governor; in Florida you have Rick Scott so they send them to the Republicans,\u201d Trump told Ingraham. \u201cTaking these people is absolutely insanity.\u201d\nAccording to the Associated Press, governors from both parties have accepted refugees, although the number is nearly double for GOP states. More than 1,000 Syrian refugees have been accepted into states with Republican governors since January 1, while just over 500 have moved to Democratic-led states. (The number of Republican governors outweighs Democrats, 31 to 18, however.)\nIngraham tried to steer Trump away from using exaggerated figures for the number of refugees, but he held firm. \u201cNo I\u2019m talking about now, I\u2019m talking about in terms of Syria. I\u2019ve heard numbers as high as 250,000 people.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Trump: Obama sending refugees to Republican states", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/trump-obama-syria-refugees-215975", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "economy"], "people": ["Sara Solovitch", "Susan Rice", "Michael Hirsh", "Kate Tummarello", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "Marc Caputo", "Tim Starks", "Steven Shepard", "Barack Obama", "Jenny Hopkinson", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Jeffrey Gedmin", "Howard Dean", "Theodoric Meyer", "Loretta Lynch", "Annie Karni", "Josh Gerstein", "Shane Goldmacher", "Nick Gass", "Bernie Becker", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Laura Ingraham", "Andrew Glass", "Jeremy Herb", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Paul Ryan", "Brianna Ehley", "David Pittman", "Lauren French", "John Podesta", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Donald Trump", "Paul Lindsay", "Howard Fineman", "Rick Scott", "Ben White", "Alex Spence", "Darren Samuelsohn", "Victoria Guida", "Alex Byers", "Eric Wolff", "Ernest Moniz", "Edward Snowden", "Caitlin Emma"], "orgs": ["Washington And The World", "FDA", "Congress", "Amtrak", "Senate", "Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee", "PAC", "FCC", "College", "Senate GOP", "Congressional Black Caucus", "CMS", "GOP", "Tenn"], "election_confidence": 0.8489157262844512, "authors": [{"author_id": 30728, "fullname": "nick gass", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 17:23:35", "org": "politico", "article_id": "cd5e09b1b594c2a016aec6a4d83da2eb", "date_access": "2015-11-17 17:47:15.450367"},

Sign up here.**\nBuzz Cut: \u2022 Cruz, Rubio sparring intensifies \u2022 Fiorina aces it with millennials in FBN debate \u2022 Oops: Clinton foundation finds more foreign donors \u2022 Gore still cool to Hillary \u2022 \u2018If your name is Keith, there\u2019s a pretty decent chance that we won\u2019t get along\u2019\nCRUZ, RUBIO SPARRING INTENSIFIES Broadly (and imprecisely) speaking, there are three main ideological channels in the Republican Party: business boosters, values voters and leave-us-alone libertarians.  Yes, voters can occupy more than one channel and, yes, voters sometimes change channels depending on the issue. But these are the basic divisions and, the most frequent sources of tension.  When big business wants the government funded no matter what and social conservatives refuse to budge on Planned Parenthood funding, you see the tension.  One of the uniting forces in Republican politics, at least since the Vietnam War, has been foreign policy. The GOP, even considering some strong isolationist roots, generally has identified itself as the party of a robust defense and a hardline stance on national security.  Just look at how quickly the 2016 presidential candidates and legislative leaders lined up behind a moratorium on accepting Syrian refugees.  But as we saw in a counter-volley Monday in the escalating conflict between Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, a probable final pairing for the nominating contest, national security is becoming increasingly fraught as a topic.  While this ideological split is not new, two events \u2013 the Iraq war and Edward Snowden\u2019s revelation of the extent of domestic spying \u2013 have sharpened the contours of the disagreement.  The refusal of all but a few third-tier candidates to commit to more ground troops for Syria and Iraq tells you the political effect of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq itself.  And now, here comes Snowden.  Speaking at a WSJ event, Rubio blasted Cruz for the Texas senator\u2019s vote in favor of a measure which stopped the federal government from what is euphemistically called \u201cbulk data collection\u201d but was scattershot domestic surveillance which remained available to be searched by investigators to try to \u201cconnect the dots.\u201d\nGiven that the strongest proponent of the domestic spying, Jeb Bush, and its strongest detractor, Rand Paul, are diminished, we have not heard that much about the issue. But Rubio reintroduced it with a sonic boom.  Rubio\u2019s accusation is that Cruz, who voted with libertarian-minded Paul to end the program \u201cweakening our intelligence-gathering capabilities\u201d which \u201cleaves America vulnerable.\u201d To level that charge when Americans are on high alert in the wake of the Paris attacks is a gloves-off move from Rubio, who found himself last week on the receiving end of a Cruz attack on \u201camnesty.\u201d  Now, while the charges are potentially incendiary, Republicans can at least be glad that they are fighting on issues of substance rather than the efficacy of a belt buckle at stopping a stabbing. Plus, on the issues of not just domestic surveillance but also how large the U.S. footprint in Iraq as Syria should be, these are fights the GOP needs to sort out.  The Cruz/Rubio duel has started sooner than expected and with plenty of intensity. This is likely just an early flare-up, but if it hints at what the two 44-year-old senators are going to be throwing down later, the Republican electorate will be treated to what promises to be a pointed and maybe even smart debate about its future.  Trump wants U.S., allies to buy \u2018a big, beautiful safe zone\u2019 for refugees in Syria - NYT: \u201c \u2018I predicted Osama bin Laden,\u2019 Mr. Trump declared in Knoxville, adding, \u2018In my book, I predicted terrorism. Because I can feel it, like I feel a good location, O.K.?\u2019 \u2018In real estate \u2014 my father always used to tell people, \u2018You know, he may be my son, but everything he touches turns to gold,'\u2018 Mr. Trump said. His father helped him begin his real estate career with a loan. \u2018When my father said that, that was a great compliment because he was a tough cookie. He said, \u2018He has an instinct for location.\u2019 You have an instinct about things. I really believe I have an instinct for this kind of thing.\u2019\u201d  Fiorina aces it with millennials in FBN debate - Fox Business: \u201cThe College Republican National Committee (CRNC) along with G2 Analytics hosted a web-based focused group during the FOX Business Network and Wall Street Journal debate surveying both Republican and Independent Millennial voters. In data provided exclusively to FOXBusiness.com, the CRNC found that overall Millennials aged 18-29 resonated the most with Carly Fiorina during the debate, with 81% more likely to support her.\u00a0The top five candidates that Millennials resonated with: Carly Fiorina, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, Dr. Ben Carson, Florida Senator Marco Rubio and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Written responses in the poll cited Fiorina as articulating her positions and policies clearly and providing answers that were solutions oriented.\u201d  Jeb\u2019s PAC burning through fat stacks of cash - Politico: \u201cAccording to media buyers and a POLITICO review of TV ad purchase data, Bush and his allies are on pace to spend $5 million more than Team Rubio on broadcast, cable and radio ads through the first four voting states \u2013 but for that sum, they will put fewer ads on the airwaves. That\u2019s because the vast majority of Bush\u2019s ads are paid for by his super PAC \u2013 roughly 85 percent for Bush versus only 40 percent for Rubio \u2013 and super PACs get far less bang for their buck.\u201d  You\u2019re going to want to bookmark this \u2013 Real Clear Politics has launched its delegate tracker for the 2016 GOP nomination. You\u2019ll be back\u2026  WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026 Is Martin Scorsese the best filmmaker of the last 50 years? If you look at \u201cGoodfellas,\u201d \u201cCasino,\u201d \u201cThe Departed\u201d and \u201cThe Last Waltz\u201d one would be sorely tempted to say so, especially American males, whom Scorsese treated to riveting action, macho codes of honor and stunning beauties. And given his peer group, which included Brian De Palma, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, Scorsese seems almost more remarkable for his ability to shine. But if you watched \u201cNew York, New York\u201d or suffered through the gritty grind of both \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and \u201cRaging Bull\u201d in close proximity, you might think that Scorsese was impossibly overrated.

The foundation also revealed that it raised $177 million in 2014, the year before Hillary Clinton announced her run for the presidency\u2026Critics have said that the foundation's dealings during her tenure as secretary of state represented a conflict of interest.\u00a0Critics have also slammed the foundation after it admitted earlier this year that it had not complied with an ethics agreement that had been insisted upon by the Obama administration and signed by Clinton prior to becoming secretary of state.\u201d  What they meant to say\u2026 - Forbes breaks down the amendments to the Clinton Foundation\u2019s reporting in three consecutive years it received\u00a0\u201cno donations from foreign government sources\u201d and to speeches by Bill, Hillary and Chelsea that were reported as charitable contributions, but actually, the speech fees were\u00a0payments for services.  Email from top aide says Hillary \u2018often confused\u2019 - The Hill: \u201cFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was \u201coften confused,\u201d according to a 2013 email from her longtime aide Huma Abedin\u2026 The comment\u2026was revealed on Monday following a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit from conservative legal group Judicial Watch.\u00a0In the\u00a0Jan. 26, 2013, message, Abedin gave the note about Clinton while discussing the secretary\u2019s schedule with another Clinton aide, Monica Hanley.  \u2018Have you been going over calls with her for tomorrow?\u2019 Abedin asked Hanley. \u2018So she knows [then-Indian Prime Minister Manmohan] singh is at 8?\u2019\n\u2018She was in bed for a nap by the time I heard that she had an 8am call,\u2019 Hanley responded. \u2018Will go over with her.\u2019\n\u2018Very imp to do that,\u2019 Abedin said in response. \u2018She\u2019s often confused.\u2019  The email was sent to Abedin via the email address that she kept on Clinton\u2019s personal server.\u201d  Gore still cool to Hillary - An aide to the former Vice President Al Gore told Politico he\u2019ll stay on the sidelines until his party has selected its nominee. \u201cGore\u2019s reticence, his friends and allies say, is in part to maximize his own leverage on fighting climate change. But\u2026also reflect[s] a complicated relationship with [Hillary]\u2026 [A] rivalry started when the two baby boomer policy wonks arrived in the White House in 1993. Gore got the new administration\u2019s environmental and technology portfolios. Bill Clinton raised eyebrows by assigning his wife what would become an ill-fated attempt to pass comprehensive health-care reform legislation\u2026Gore\u2019s own efforts to take the next big step in his political career suffered in no small part because of the roller coaster politics associated with the Lewinsky saga and the general drama that has become synonymous since then with anyone running for office named Clinton.\u201d  Too little, too late for Marty O? - Baltimore Sun: \u201cTrailing in polling and fundraising,\u00a0Martin O'Malley's presidential campaign is shifting staff from its Baltimore headquarters to early primary states such as Iowa. The shift comes just days after O'Malley's performance at the second debate was widely praised. Yet his campaign has struggled to raise the money needed to mount a campaign --\u00a0reporting less than $1 million on hand at the end of the third quarter.\u201d  SOUND OFF: READERS RESPOND TO THE 2016 POWER INDEX \u201cWith Islamic terrorism now the preeminent national issue, the GOP needs to nominate its best informed and fluent foreign policy candidates \u2013 Marco Rubio and Carly Fiorina \u2013 as the 2016 \u2018ticket\u2019.\u201d\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Jim Hartman  \u201cWhile I am having difficulty making a selection for the Republican candidate, I have begun to think that after the Friday massacres in France we need a very strong leader.\u00a0 It is now my thought that Chris Christie might be that guy.\u00a0 He certainly could debate Hillary Clinton also.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Chloe Gardner  \u201cRecent events have painfully illuminated the seriousness of the upcoming presidential election in terms of national security, the economy, and international relations and entanglements. Hopefully, we can count on sober voters to end their adolescent flirtations and give consideration to the most serious candidates as balloting dates approach.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Mary Heller  \u201cI understand why your index puts Cruz ahead of Rubio, but I feel that those who favor Cruz fail to understand that he is too extreme to win over unaffiliated voters in the general election.\u00a0Isn't the choice made by us in the primary to put up the best candidate to win in the general election?\u201d \u2013 Salvatore Pace  \u201cYour Power Index is laughable \u00a0!! It must be put together by morons \u00a0!!!\u201d - Ernst Gehrich  \u2018IF YOUR NAME IS KEITH, THERE\u2019S A PRETTY DECENT CHANCE THAT WE WON\u2019T GET ALONG\u2019 How\u2019s the strength of the legal disclaimer on your email signature?

AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026 \u201cWhat struck me above all was not the misstatement of facts or the delusions about what\u2019s going on, it's the president\u2019s tone.

Some Republicans in Congress are threatening a government shutdown over the issue in light of plans by the Obama administration to resettle 10,000 Syrians next year.\nIn a conference call with reporters Tuesday, senior administration officials reiterated that the federal government controls the refugee resettlement program, but they also acknowledged funding from Congress is critical to maintaining it and that local support is key to helping refugees integrate wherever they land.\n\"We don\u2019t want to send refugees anywhere where they would not be welcomed,\" one of the officials said, adding later: \"The thing I most fear about this current discussion going on in the United States is that we will lose the bipartisan support ... that (this program) has enjoyed for decades. This is a very precious thing. In the current day and age, it\u2019s been a rare thing.\" \nThe officials, all of whom spoke on condition they not be identified by name, said they will meet with lawmakers this week and also hold calls with governors and mayors to correct \"misimpressions\" about the refugee program. On Tuesday, for instance, GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has erroneously claimed some 250,000 Syrian refugees are headed for the country, tweeted, \"Refugees from Syria are now pouring into our great country. Who knows who they are \u2014 some could be ISIS. Is our president insane?\"\nSince the Syrian conflict erupted in 2011, the United States has admitted roughly 1,800 Syrian refugees, a tiny fraction of 4 million Syrians who have fled their country and registered as refugees with the United Nations. According to the U.N. and various aid agencies, another 7 million Syrians are displaced inside the Arab country, where they face dangers from both the Syrian government of Bashar Assad and groups such as the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, which is believed responsible for the Paris attacks. \n\n\n\n            By \nJake Sherman\n\nSyria's pre-war population was 23 million people, and 250,000 people have died since the conflict began there. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians -- seeing no end to the war and despairing of conditions in refugee camps -- have in recent months headed to Europe, making an often-dangerous land and sea journey. But others are still in camps or otherwise living in countries such as Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan, where their rights and mobility face restrictions.\nThousands of Syrians have already applied for resettlement, so most of the 10,000 Syrians that the Obama administration hopes to admit next year are likely going through security screening. Republican presidential candidates and others are now questioning whether those security procedures are rigorous enough, noting that it only takes one or a handful of people to carry out a terrorist attack. \n\"The problem is we can\u2019t background check them,\" Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a top GOP presidential contender, said Sunday. \"You can\u2019t pick up the phone and call Syria.\"\nAccording to the administration officials, the refugee vetting process takes an average of 18-24 months, and for Syrians it often takes longer because they face additional scrutiny. The refugees are first screened through the United Nations, which has its own vetting procedures. If they are referred to the United States for possible admission, they are then screened through a whole new process. \nThat involves checking their biographic and biometric data, as well as lengthy interviews and background checks involving multiple federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies. Some of the procedures involved are classified.\nOne way the officials screening the refugees can verify their stories is to double check the events they claim happened to them with intelligence and other known data about what was happening in Syria at the time. So if a Syrian says their home in particular neighborhood was bombed on a particular date, it's likely the defense department or other agencies can check to see if there was a bombing reported in the area at that time.\n\"Each element of the process is not the totality of the process,\" one of the officials said. \"All these things have to be synthesized and taken in the aggregate to make a decision.\"\n\n\n\n            By \nGabriel Debenedetti\n\nThe admission rate so far is just over 50 percent; the rest are either rejected or have their cases still pending, one of the officials said. Of the Syrians admitted, half are children and a quarter are adults over 60, the officials said. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for a religious breakdown, but roughly 10 percent of Syrians as a whole are Christian.\nThere are nine non-profit groups, several of them faith-based, that work with the federal government to help resettle the refugees in communities across the United States. Where a refugee is sent can depend on a range of factors, such as whether they have relatives there who can support them. If a child is a burn victim \u2014 which would not be unusual among Syrians fleeing the brutal civil war \u2014 they would likely be placed in a community with relevant medical facilities.\nTraditionally, the U.S. refugee program has had strong bipartisan support, and the numbers of Syrians is a trickle compared to the numbers of refugees admitted from other conflicts. For instance, the United States took in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Vietnam. \nOverall, the U.S. takes in 70,000 refugees a year, a number the administration planned to raise to 85,000 next year, and 100,000 the following year. Based on statistics released by the State Department, most the additional 15,000 planned for next year would not come from the Middle East. One of the administration officials on Tuesday said the U.S. has the capacity to absorb significantly more refugees than it does now, but noted that financial support makes all the difference. \n\"The program is absolutely dependent on funding from Congress,\" the official said. \"As we grow it we will require more assistance from Congress.\"\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "\"We don\u2019t want to send refugees anywhere where they would not be welcomed,\" one official said.", "title": "Obama Administration defends Syrian refugee program", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/obama-syria-refugee-program-215982", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Sara Solovitch", "Susan Rice", "Kenneth P.

Reporters Allie Jones and Sam Biddle will head out on the campaign trail; Ashley Feinberg will monitor the \"hilarious lunatic fringes and the right and left,\" while Tom Scocca and Pareene will get regular columns.\n\"Gawker won\u2019t just do horse-race coverage, of course\u2014it will take a Daily Show approach to covering the ever-intensifying culture wars, documenting, satirizing, and reporting on the ways that political disputes are refracted in every aspect of our popular culture,\" Cook wrote. \"Gawker\u2019s biggest stories have always had a political component, from Toronto\u2019s crack-smoking mayor to Roger Ailes\u2019 paranoia and power to Josh Duggar\u2019s rank hypocrisy. Pareene is doubling down on that tradition.\"\nIt's a coming home of sorts for Pareene, who first started at Gawker's Wonkette, the D.C. media and politics gossip site which the company subsequently sold in 2008\nThe move will also result in layoffs at the company, though the same number of jobs will be created, according to the New York Times which first broke the news.\nIn a separate memo to staff, Gawker founder and CEO Nick Denton said politics have provided \"the scene for some of Gawker's most recognized\" stories, including those about former Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, Fox News, Hillary Clinton's email practices and Bill Clinton's travels with a convicted pedophile. \nAlex Pareene\u2019s Gawker will ride the circus of the 2016 campaign cycle, seizing the opportunity to re-orient its editorial scope on political news, commentary and satire.\n\"Is there any doubt that the 2016 US presidential election campaign, a contest between reality-defying fabulists and the last representatives of two exhausted political dynasties, will provide rich new opportunities for sensation and satire?\" Cook wrote. \"I can appreciate the wonky contrarianism of Ezra Klein\u2019s Vox.com and high-metabolism micronews from Ben Smith\u2019s Buzzfeed Politics. But, more than any other facet of the American system, the politico-media blob begs puncturing by some sharp Gawker wit and probing by Gawker\u2019s inquisitive journalists.\"\nDeveloping....\nHadas Gold is a reporter at\u00a0Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Gawker Media plans to shift the focus of its flagship site Gawker.com to politics, editors at the company announced in memos to staff on Tuesday.", "title": "Gawker refocusing aim to politics", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2015/11/gawker-refocusing-aim-to-politics-215987", "topics": ["economy"], "people": ["Roger Ailes", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Ben Smith", "Josh Duggar", "Kenneth P.

But just as his campaign enters the critical primary phase, the fallen frontrunner is about to get outgunned on the airwaves by the man his campaign views as its chief rival, Marco Rubio.\n\u201cAccording to media buyers and a POLITICO review of TV ad purchase data, Bush and his allies are on pace to spend $5 million more than Team Rubio on broadcast, cable and radio ads through the first four voting states \u2013 but for that sum, they will put fewer ads on the airwaves. That\u2019s because the vast majority of Bush\u2019s ads are paid for by his super PAC \u2013 roughly 85 percent for Bush versus only 40 percent for Rubio \u2013 and super PACs get far less bang for their buck. \u2026 In Iowa and New Hampshire, \u2026 super PACs are confronting ad rates that can soar to nearly 1,000 percent more than the rates charged of candidates \u2026\n\u201cData from GOP analytics firm Echelon Insights shows that Rubio will run at least 5,000 more broadcast TV spots than Bush in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada through February, even as the former Florida governor and his super PAC spend more overall.\u201d http://politi.co/1NANYCZ\n**SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/1M75UbX\nJUST POSTED \u2013 \u201cWhy Al Gore won't endorse Hillary Clinton,\u201d by Politico\u2019s Darren Samuelsohn: An aide said Gore will \u201cstay on the sidelines [during the primaries]. Gore\u2019s reticence \u2026 is in part to maximize his own leverage on fighting climate change. But his repeated demurrals also reflect a complicated relationship with [Hillary] that dates back more than two decades. \u2026 The \u2026 rivalry started when the two baby boomer policy wonks arrived in the White House in 1993. Gore got the \u2026 environmental and technology portfolios. Bill Clinton \u2026 assign[ed] his wife what would become an ill-fated attempt to pass \u2026 health-care reform \u2026\n\u201cBill Clinton reportedly reconciled with Gore in the days after \u2026 Sept. 11 \u2026 But \u2026 the relationship between Gore and Hillary Clinton had never even gotten to a place where it could be smoothed over. \u2026 Gore\u2019s own efforts to take the next big step in his political career suffered in no small part because of the roller coaster politics associated with the Lewinsky saga \u2026\n\u201c[In 2008, Gore] got a call from Sen. Ted Kennedy urging him to endorse Obama. But Gore resisted, and he didn\u2019t go public for the future president until more than a week after Clinton had conceded.\u201d http://politi.co/1MP8TWk\nPIC DU JOUR -- @BernieSanders: \u201cWhat is this Snapshot thing and why do I only get ten seconds?\u201d http://bit.ly/1X42o3i\nUPDATED POLITICO APP -- dynamic new design.

And I have not,\" Obama said, despite a stir earlier this year generated by a photo of him with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.\nObama also laughed off the Jade Helm 15 conspiracy theories that he was going to begin martial law to stay in office longer, remarking, \"[a]nybody who thinks I could get away with telling Michelle I\u2019m going to be president any longer than eight years does not know my wife.\"\nDaughters Sasha and Malia are also apparently eager for their dad to leave the Oval Office.\n\"Not as much as Michelle, but certainly ready,\" Obama said.\nThe president also commented on the impression that he is feeling less burdened by the job now that he is well into his second term and does not have to face re-election.\n\n\n\n            By \nNahal Toosi\n\n\"There\u2019s no doubt that the longer I\u2019m in this job, the more confident I am about the decisions I\u2019m making and more knowledgeable about the responses I can expect. And as a consequence, you end up being looser,\" he said. \"There\u2019s not much I have not seen at this point, and I know what to expect, and I can anticipate more than I did before.\"\nBut that apparently does not mean he is willing to pick between his vice president (who is very much not running for his job) or former secretary of state (who certainly is).\n\"Which leadership style suits your vision of where America should go forward? Biden or Hillary?\"\n\"Come on, Bill,\" Obama said with a laugh.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Obama: Running against Trump &apos;would&apos;ve been fun&apos;", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/obama-trump-campaign-215966", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Matteo Renzi", "Susan Rice", "Kenneth P.

Bernie Sanders for proposals to raise taxes on the middle class that were part of the national single-payer health care bills he introduced in Congress.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cBernie Sanders has called for a roughly 9-percent tax hike on middle-class families just to cover his health-care plan,\u201d said Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon, referring to legislation Sanders introduced in 2013, \u201cand simple math dictates he'll need to tax workers even more to pay for the rest of his at least $18-20 trillion agenda. If you are truly concerned about raising incomes for middle-class families, the last thing you should do is cut their take-home pay right off the bat by raising their taxes.\u201d\nSanders introduced a single-payer healthcare bill in 2013 that included a 2.2 percent income tax across the board, as well as a 6.7 percent payroll tax for employers, the Washington Post reported Friday, and has introduced similar legislation in multiple sessions of Congress. While payroll taxes are split between the employer and the employee, economists and the Congressional Budget Office have said that most of those fees are carried by the workers in the form of lower wages.\nSanders has yet to announce the details of how he will pay for the national single-payer, Medicare for all Americans proposal that is a major plank of his presidential campaign. Economic experts have said it would be impossible to institute a single-payer system relying solely on tax hikes on the wealthy. Sanders camp has argued in response that in the long run, the single-payer system will save the country trillions of currently wasted dollars.\n\n\n\n            By \nJosh Gerstein\n             and \nKenneth P. Vogel\n\n\"On Medicare for all, the middle class would be far better off because it would save taxpayers money,\" Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said in response to Clinton's latest line of attack. \"More people would get better care at less cost. Didn't she used to be for that? We wouldn't throw money away on costly premiums for profit-making private insurance companies. Pharmaceutical companies would no longer be able to rip off Americans with the most expensive prescription drugs in the world. \n\"Didn't she used to be for that?\"\nFor months, Clinton\u2019s campaign has been highlighting issues where it can carve out a lane to the left of Sanders \u2014 gun control became a flashpoint in the first debate when Clinton attacked Sanders for his vote against the Brady Bill, and she doubled down on those attacks for days after on the campaign trail.\nThe latest attempt to draw a contrast on tax hikes and wage increases can be seen as an attempt by Clinton to undercut any momentum Sanders is building among union workers and middle class voters, and to position herself as the candidate most concerned with take home pay for working families.\n\u201cHillary Clinton believes strongly that middle class families deserve a raise, not a tax increase,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cShe has proposed a bold, aggressive agenda, but when it comes to paying for it, she will make sure the wealthiest Americans finally start paying their fair share, not force the middle class to pay even more than they already do.\"\n\n\n\n            By \nGabriel Debenedetti\n\nDuring the debate, Clinton stated that she will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for her debt-free public college program and her proposal to institute mandatory paid family leave \u2014but stopped short of drawing a contrast with Sanders\u2019 tax plans. \u201cI have made very clear that hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase,\u201d Clinton said Saturday night. \u201cI will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment and I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class.\"\nIn the debate, Sanders demurred when asked for details about his forthcoming tax plan. \u201cWe haven\u2019t come up with an exact number yet,\u201d he said when asked by how much he would raise the country\u2019s top marginal income tax rate to pay for his proposals.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "'The last thing you should do is cut their take-home pay right off the bat,' says Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon.", "title": "Clinton hits Sanders on middle class tax hikes", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/hillary-clinton-taxes-middle-class-bernie-sanders-215958", "topics": ["economy", "guns"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Susan Rice", "Michael Briggs", "Kenneth P.

Matt Salmon, a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the vetting process is far from adequate and I have great concerns about allowing people on our shores without knowing that we are able to find out information about them.\u201d\nThe House is set to vote this week on a bill, drafted by Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), that would strengthen the vetting process for individuals seeking refugee status. It includes a temporary moratorium on refugees from Syria entering the U.S. until the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI can implement those tougher standards.\nThe concern over refugees in the U.S. comes four days after terrorists killed 129 people in a series of attacks in Paris. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has taken credit for those attacks.\n\nDefense\n\n            By \nBryan Bender\n\nHudson said after the briefing that the administration needs to report to Congress on its efforts before GOP lawmakers feel comfortable seeing thousands of Syrian entering the U.S. \nBut Hudson offered a rebuke of Republican presidential candidates, such as Jeb Bush, who had suggested focusing on allowing Christian refugees to enter the country. \nThe Obama administration officials told lawmakers they were attempting to quickly distill information coming in from allies to rigorously vet individual who want refugee status. But Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) said he was \u201cnot satisfied\u201d with how the Homeland Security Department and the FBI screen individuals.\n \u201cThere is no database from Syria and that\u2019s pretty much it,\u201d King said.\nA leading Democrat, however, defended the vetting process, saying the administration had a \u201ccomprehensive answer\u201d to lawmakers' concerns.\n\u201cThe process takes on average 18 months to two years. There are background checks and bio-metric identifiers,\u201d California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s a very laborious process. My sense is that members want to make sure their constituents are safe \u2026 but at the same time we don\u2019t want to be deterred from helping those in need.\u201d\nRepublicans are hoping that at least some of the 188 House Democrats will back the Hudson bill when it comes to the House floor for a vote this week.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Republicans not satisfied after administration briefing on Syria", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/republicans-syria-obama-216006", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kenneth P.

But the Rubio campaign believes this is its opening to expose Cruz as being in step with Democrats on an issue that will drive the next three months of the campaign.\nLate Tuesday afternoon, Cruz fired back and said that Rubio is trying to distract from his record of working on the Senate\u2019s comprehensive immigration bill, the subject of a protracted dispute between the two campaigns over the past week.\n\u201cIt is not surprising that Marco\u2019s campaign wants to change the topic from Marco\u2019s partnership with President Obama to push a massive amnesty program,\u201d Cruz said with a theatrical chuckle. \u201cI understand politically why they want to change the topic from that, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be successful.\u201d\nRubio and his team went all in on Tuesday painting Cruz as weak on national security, an attack line that seizes on growing unease in the United States following the Paris attacks. In brief remarks following a closed Intelligence Committee briefing on the Paris attacks, Rubio stood by his comments the night before that Cruz and a number of other GOP senators had voted to \"weaken\" national security and intelligence gathering.\n\u201cIt eventually undermines our ability to collect information and to monitor those who seek to harm the United States,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nCongress\n\n            By \nJake Sherman\n             and \nSeung Min Kim\n\nAsked why he singled out Cruz among the 67 senators that ultimately voted for the reforms, Rubio replied: \u201cWe have a race for commander-in-chief and the most important obligation of a president is to keep our country safe.\u201d\nStill, Rubio\u2019s comments made life awkward for several of his surrogates who supported the USA Freedom Act, which made reforms to the surveillance dragnet that the Florida senator opposed. Rubio has been endorsed by a trio of his colleagues in the chamber, including Freedom Act supporting Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Steve Daines of Montana, who backed the bill.\nIn interviews, Gardner and Daines shrugged off Rubio\u2019s comments. Gardner said \u201cpeople have different opinions\u201d and then knocked Obama\u2019s leadership on Syria; Daines said he backed the legislation because of its privacy protections. \n\u201cBut I think Marco Rubio would be a great commander and chief,\u201d Daines added.\nMeanwhile, Cruz\u2019s team quickly pointed out that influential senators from early-voting states supported the USA Freedom Act, suggesting that Rubio was alienating potential supporters in Congress by criticizing their efforts to rein in the bulk data collection programs.\nBut other lawmakers, including Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), chafed at Rubio\u2019s attacks on Cruz and the surveillance bill. \n\u201cIf the presidential candidates want to talk against your personal liberties, let them do so to their own demise as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d said Heller, a supporter of Jeb Bush.\n\n2016\n\n            By \nBen Schreckinger\n\nFor the hard-charging Cruz, foreign policy is an area of relative moderation. He likes to say that there are two poles in the party, with Rand Paul at one end and Rubio and John McCain at the other.\nTo Rubio, the issue is more black and white: you're either with Paul or you\u2019re with Rubio. On Tuesday, Rubio\u2019s campaign aides circulated Cruz\u2019s equivocal reactions to the disclosures of national security programs by Edward Snowden, hoping to further paint Cruz as out of step within the GOP. \nCruz\u2019s campaign deemed the attacks as a distraction from Rubio\u2019s vulnerability on immigration, and an adviser said \u201cour campaign won't be taking the bait.\"\nStill, there was evidence among senior senators that Rubio\u2019s aggressive posture on national security and foreign policy is working.\n\u201cPeople who have extensive experience on national security issues and intelligence issues right now are going to have an advantage,\u201d said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.). \u201cMarco has sort of staked out for some time pretty strong positions on those issues and I think he\u2019s well positioned to make the arguments.\u201d\nAdded Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.): \u201cMarco is right on it, and he\u2019s got the intelligence to be right on it.\"\nRubio and Cruz have warily eyed one another on national security for years. They voted together for a filibuster of Chuck Hagel\u2019s nomination as defense secretary in 2013, but have experienced high-profile breaks as well: When Paul forced a vote on cutting aid to Egypt in 2013, Rubio spoke against it, while Cruz sided with Paul.\nPaul and Cruz were the only Republicans to oppose a compromise national defense policy bill last month, another area in Cruz\u2019s record that Rubio\u2019s team believe is ripe for inspection. And senior Republicans are still annoyed at those votes.\n\u201cI have a number of differences with Sen. Cruz. And I have some with Senator Rubio. But it was disturbing to me when Sen. Cruz voted against the defense authorization bill,\u201d said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz. \u201cI view that as a slap in the face to the men and women who are serving.\u201d\n\nDefense\n\n            By \nBryan Bender\n\nCruz is best known for insulting McConnell and being among the most conservative senators on practically any topic. But on surveillance reform he joined a bipartisan coalition early on, charting a middle course between Paul, whose views are to the left of much of the GOP, and Rubio, who Cruz believes is too close to McCain\u2019s position.\nIt\u2019s a difficult balance. Cruz is trying to court both Ron Paul voters and more mainstream conservatives. But on Tuesday, he stood by his vote on the surveillance bill and said conservatives across the country are more concerned with privacy issues than Rubio would like to believe.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, conservatives care about the Bill of Rights, care about protecting the privacy of law-abiding citizens and also about protecting our national security,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cAt the end of the day, this issue all comes down to their campaign\u2019s desire to change the subject from Marco\u2019s support for amnesty.\u201d\nMany Republicans bristled during the debate over government surveillance at how the program was portrayed. Senators close to the intelligence community said there had been no abuses.

And we pray for the recovery of all those who were injured, many of them seriously.\"\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cIn my view, now is the time for developing a serious and effective approach to destroy ISIS. Now is not the time for taking cheap political advantage of this tragedy. Now is the time \u2013 as President Obama is trying to do \u2013 to unite the world in an organized campaign against ISIS that will eliminate the stain of ISIS from this world,\u201d Sanders said. \nThe United States must not turn its backs on refugees fleeing violence from places like Syria or Afghanistan, he said, on the same day that governors of more than two dozen states said that they would try to stop the flow of immigrants from Syria out of concerns stemming from the fact that one of the terrorists in Friday's deadly attacks in France came from Syria.\n\"What terrorism is about is trying to instill terror and fear into the hearts of people. And we will not let that happen. We will not be terrorized or live in fear. During these difficult times, we will not succumb to Islamophobia,\" Sanders declared. \"We will not turn our backs on the refugees who are fleeing Syria and Afghanistan. We will do what we do best and that is be Americans \u2013 fighting racism, fighting xenophobia, fighting fear.\u201d\nHis top rival, Hillary Clinton, has remained silent this week on what to do about the refugees seeking asylum.\nDuring last Saturday's debate, the former secretary of state explained that screening refugees for potential terrorists should be \"the number one requirement.\" Clinton also reiterated her desire to increase the number of refugees allowed in to 65,000.\n\"I also said that we should increase numbers of refugees,\" she said. \"The administration originally said 10 [thousand]. I said we should go to 65 [thousand], but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes. I do not want us to in any way inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.\"\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Sanders: We will not turn our backs on Syrian refugees", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/bernie-sanders-syria-refugees-215967", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Susan Rice", "Kenneth P.

Some Republicans are threatening to hold up a government funding bill next month to stop money from flowing to the program. \nOne bill that's under consideration was penned by North Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson. It would force the government to certify refugees have passed a background check. \nFurthermore, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) announced during the meeting that he created a task force comprised of the chairmen of jurisdiction to consider further legislative action. Those committees are Homeland Security, Armed Services, Judiciary, Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Appropriations.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Ryan aims to address refugee situation this week", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/paul-ryan-syria-refugees-congress-215968", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Susan Rice", "Kenneth P.

(AP)\n\n            By \nJosh Gerstein\n\n11/17/15 11:29 AM EST\nPresident Barack Obama's public comments appearing to prejudge the outcome of Justice Department investigations don't affect the decisions in those inquiries, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Tuesday.\nIn her first appearance before the House Judiciary Committee since taking office in April, Lynch was questioned by panel chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) about remarks Obama made last year declaring there was \"not even a smidgen of corruption\" in the IRS's handling of applications from nonprofit groups and a statement the president made last month that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email set-up posed no national security problem.\n\"With respect to the president's comments, they have no influence or bearing on how the department manages these matters,\" Lynch said.\nGoodlatte tried a couple of times to get Lynch to comment on whether it was unwise for Obama to make such comments while an investigation was pending, but she declined to do so. \n\"I really don\u2019t have a comment on the president\u2019s expression of his view,\" Lynch said.\nThe Justice Department announced last month that no criminal charges would be brought in connection with the controversy over the IRS's targeting of nonprofit groups that were chiefly conservative in their outlook.\nThe FBI is conducting an ongoing inquiry into possible mishandling of classified information in connection with Clinton's use of a private email account during her four years as secretary of state. Some FBI agents complained that Obama's comments had the potential to undercut the agency's work.\nLater in the hearing, Lynch said she was unaware of any effort by the White House to interfere with the email investigation, but she declined to discuss where the probe stands or how long it is likely to take. \"I\u2019m not able to comment on the status of that matter,\" she said.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "&quot;I really don\u2019t have a comment on the president\u2019s expression of his view,&quot; Loretta Lynch said", "title": "Lynch: Obama remarks don&apos;t affect probes", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2015/11/lynch-obama-remarks-dont-affect-probes-215973", "topics": ["economy", "surveillance/privacy"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Susan Rice", "Kenneth P.

Vogel\n\n11/17/15 12:55 PM EST\nThe Koch network stepped up funding for its own groups in 2014, but also served as something of an ATM for some of the most powerful groups on the right \u2015 doling out millions in grants to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Club for Growth and National Rifle Association, among major backers of Republicans \u2015 according to a tax filing publicly released Tuesday morning.\nThe filings were submitted to the Internal Revenue Service by Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the central group in the increasingly powerful network of conservative public policy and political groups helmed by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch.\nStory Continued Below\nThe tax filings show that Freedom Partners, which was created in late 2011 to increase coordination within the Koch network, raised $162 million in 2013 and 2014. Three quarters of that haul came in last year, almost entirely from six-figure membership dues of wealthy donors who the Kochs convene twice a year for summits that highlight the virtues of fiscally conservative, small government policies \u2015 and that raise money for groups and candidates who support those policies. \nFreedom Partners and most of its grantees do not reveal their donors\u2019 names because they are registered under a section of the tax code \u2015 501(c) \u2015 that does not require them to do so.\nThe group\u2019s impressive haul constitutes the lion\u2019s share of the $290 million that the Koch network expected to spend in the run-up to the 2014 midterm elections. And its tax filings show that the group disseminated the majority of its cash to other groups, with the biggest donations going to a cluster groups that form the central core of the\u2019 network. \nAmericans for Prosperity, the network's most politically aggressive group,, received $22 million from Freedom Partners. Concerned Veterans for America, which seeks to engage veterans on fiscal issues, received $16 million. The LIBRE Initiative, which targets Latino voters, received $6.5 million. A group that disseminates money to reach evangelical voters received $6 million, while the American Energy Alliance, which opposes energy regulations, received $2 million.\nBut Freedom Partners also wrote grants to an array of groups that play key roles in the broader conservative coalition, but are not considered to be part of the network \u2015 including some that have differed sharply with the Kochs\u2019 public policy stances. \nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce received $2 million from Freedom Partners, despite lobbying for the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, a program vehemently opposed by the Koch network as market-skewing corporate welfare. The Club for Growth and Heritage Action for America \u2015 which supported a 2013 government shutdown that the Koch network said it opposed \u2015 received $1 million and $150,000, respectively.\nOther grantees outside the Koch network included the National Rifle Association\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action, which received $4.9 million, and a group called the Dr. Joseph Warren Institute that spreads the messages of medical professionals who oppose Obamacare. It received $300,000 from Freedom Partners.\nSome grantees used Freedom Partners\u2019 cash for highly specific campaigns that seemed to have at least the network's tacit endorsement. A $400,000 grant went to a group called Trees of Liberty, which, as POLITICO revealed last week, spent its cash attacking the leading rival of Koch-favorite Joni Ernst during her 2014 GOP primary campaign for the Iowa Senate seat she eventually won. Trees of Liberty was created in 2013 with the Kochs\u2019 blessing to cultivate candidates who share their commitment to free-market conservatism.\nThe tax filings show that Freedom Partners paid Aegis Strategic $1.3 million in consulting fees. And Freedom Partners donated $693,000 to an affiliated super PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, which last fall aired ads attacking Democratic Senate candidates, including Ernst\u2019s general election opponent, then-Rep. Bruce Braley.\nFreedom Partners Chamber of Commerce\u2019s tax filings reveal that the group is branching out beyond merely disseminating cash to other entities for political and public policy advocacy, and has built its own robust operation. Its staff, which numbered 60 employees in 2013, grew to 133 employees last year. They were paid a total of $13 million in salary and benefits, including $794,000 that went to the salary and benefits of the group\u2019s president Marc Short. \nFreedom Partners also spent heavily on functions it used to delegate to grantees. It spent $1.9 million on focus groups and $1.2 million on advertising production. It paid $1.5 million to the firm of Frank Luntz, a regular guest at Koch donor seminars, and $1.4 million to the Utah-based direct mail firm Arena Communications. \n\nKenneth P.

There's more to the story.\n\n            By \nDarren Samuelsohn\n\n11/17/15 05:14 AM EST\nAt least four times in the past year, Al Gore has passed up opportunities to endorse Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, brushing off questions from People magazine and other media outlets with the admonition that it\u2019s still too early in the Democratic primary process for him to take sides. On Monday, an aide to the former vice president told POLITICO he\u2019ll stay on the sidelines until his party has selected its nominee.\nGore\u2019s reticence, his friends and allies say, is in part to maximize his own leverage on fighting climate change. But his repeated demurrals also reflect a complicated relationship with his former boss\u2019s wife that dates back more than two decades. While Gore and Hillary Clinton may not be enemies, they\u2019re not exactly close friends, either.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cThey have a lot of history. More than the average bear,\u201d said one Democratic source close to Gore.\nThe Hillary Clinton-Gore rivalry started when the two baby boomer policy wonks arrived in the White House in 1993. Gore got the new administration\u2019s environmental and technology portfolios. Bill Clinton raised eyebrows by assigning his wife what would become an ill-fated attempt to pass comprehensive health-care reform legislation.\n\u201cUsually you give your vice president something of that level. You don\u2019t give it to the first lady,\u201d recalled a former Clinton White House staffer. \u201cPeople forget that sort of started the relationship on a downward spiral early on.\u201d\nWhile Gore and Bill Clinton maintained a strong relationship throughout the president\u2019s first term, things took a turn in the other direction after the Monica Lewinsky scandal emerged in 1998. Gore insisted on keeping the president away from his own White House bid in 2000. \u201cI understand the disappointment and anger that you feel toward President Clinton, and I felt it myself,\u201d he told New Hampshire voters during his primary campaign. The political headwinds were tough enough, the vice president reasoned, and they got only more complicated when Hillary Clinton pursued the next step of her own career.\n\nWhite House \n\n            By \nSarah Wheaton\n\n\u201cHer Senate race complicated things,\u201d another former White House aide said. \u201cIt took up a lot of the political oxygen and party money. It put the spotlight on the Clintons when it wasn\u2019t focused on his race. It didn\u2019t help.\u201d\nBill Clinton reportedly reconciled with Gore in the days after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks \u2014 bonding over a late-night chat at the former president\u2019s New York home, according to The New York Times. But sources close to the Democratic heavyweights explain that the relationship between Gore and Hillary Clinton had never even gotten to a place where it could be smoothed over.\n\u201cTheir worlds haven\u2019t really crossed,\u201d said a fourth source, this one also a former Clinton White House aide. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been that much connection.\u201d\nGore has several reasons for keeping out of the 2016 maelstrom. When he does interviews, and inevitably questions get asked about his own never-fulfilled presidential ambitions, the response typically comes with a disclaimer that he\u2019s a \u201crecovering politician\u201d driven by an almost obsessive desire to save the planet.\n\"It's still too early, in my opinion, to endorse a candidate or pick a candidate,\" Gore told People magazine in an interview published last week ahead of a planned 24-hour webcast from Paris to raise awareness about climate change.\nIn an email Monday to POLITICO, a Gore spokesperson went a step further, saying the former vice president wouldn\u2019t be endorsing in the primary at all. \u201c[Gore] has great respect for and long-standing relationships with all of the candidates running for the Democratic nomination for president,\u201d this person said. \u201cHe appreciates the emphasis each of the candidates has placed on advocating for solutions to the climate crisis and will do all that he can to ensure that climate change remains a priority throughout this debate. However, he has no plans to endorse a candidate in the Democratic primary.\u201d\nClose associates also note that Gore has burned bridges before when he has spoken up about other Democrats running for the White House. In 2004, he sat out a rematch with President George W. Bush and instead gave his endorsement to the surging anti-war candidacy of Howard Dean, snubbing his former Senate colleague and fellow 1985 freshman classmate John Kerry. Not only did Dean\u2019s bid fade in the Iowa cornfields, Gore also left some feelings hurt because he didn\u2019t back his own 2000 vice presidential running mate, Sen. Joe Lieberman, either.\n\n2016\n\n            By \nEli Stokols\n\nDuring the next presidential primary cycle, which featured then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, an upstart Illinois senator named Barack Obama and son-of-a-mill-worker John Edwards, Gore opted to keep his power dry. Multiple sources tell POLITICO the former vice president got a call from Sen. Ted Kennedy urging him to endorse Obama. But Gore resisted, and he didn\u2019t go public for the future president until more than a week after Clinton had conceded.\nGore has since specifically praised Clinton without going all in on an endorsement. Last fall, he told Bloomberg TV that the former secretary of state was \u201cextremely capable\u201d but insisted it was too soon to be so focused on the Democratic horse race. In an early 2014 interview with POLITICO Magazine at his Nashville office, published a full year before Clinton formally announced she was running for president, Gore did give a tepid sign of where his support could ultimately go.\n\u201cI\u2019m of course fully aware of the general expectation that she will run and that she\u2019ll get the nomination. And if that happens, I certainly hope that she wins and I certainly hope that if she wins she\u2019ll be an effective advocate on climate,\u201d he said.\nGore recalled in the interview that Hillary Clinton had called him in 2007 before she gave a major energy and climate change speech \u201casking for advice on what the most forward leaning positions she could take would be.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I really appreciated that,\u201d Gore added. \u201cI don\u2019t have any doubt that her heart is in the right place on the issue and that she would like to be an agent for positive change on the issue.\u201d\nIn that November 2007 speech, given in Iowa, Clinton did name-check Gore three times. She congratulated the former vice president for recently winning the Nobel Peace Prize, and she pitched one of his ideas: a new \u201cConnie Mae\u201d program that would help people get loans to pay for more energy efficient homes.\nThe Clinton campaign did not respond to a request for comment, and several former Gore aides shrugged off questions about the Hillary Clinton-Gore relationship and the former vice president\u2019s silence on making an official endorsement. Clinton, who had faced criticism from greens for years of dithering over the Keystone XL pipeline, has since picked up the backing of the League of Conservation Voters. Gore, with his own intense following on climate issues, could help buttress Clinton\u2019s left flank as she fends off a primary challenge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley. But the Gore spokeswoman said an endorsement would need to wait until after the Democratic primaries are over and the party\u2019s nominee is selected.\n\u201cShe\u2019s running for president in her own right and he\u2019s advocating on an issue that\u2019s the most important issue to him. Inevitably that\u2019s where these two will interact again on this campaign,\u201d said Michael Feldman, Gore\u2019s former traveling chief of staff from his 2000 White House run.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in it for Al to endorse anyone at this point?\u201d added Greg Simon, Gore\u2019s former chief domestic policy adviser. \u201cAt this stage of the game if he wanted to go out and campaign for somebody he\u2019d have gone out and campaigned for himself, not for Bernie or Hillary.\u201d\n\n\n\n            By \nDaniel Strauss\n\nOther sources explained that Gore\u2019s restraint \u2014 a recent Associated Press count of Democratic superdelegates in Tennessee found that he indeed remains uncommitted \u2014 also needed to be seen in the context of that longer-term, and oh-so complicated relationship with the Clintons. Sure, Gore owes President Clinton for making him a one-of-a-kind job offer back in 1992. But Gore\u2019s own efforts to take the next big step in his political career suffered in no small part because of the roller coaster politics associated with the Lewinsky saga and the general drama that has become synonymous since then with anyone running for office named Clinton.\n\u201cSome of the stuff that\u2019s been plaguing the Clinton campaign \u2026 is the stuff he doesn\u2019t like about serving with the Clintons,\u201d said a veteran Democratic operative who worked for Gore. \u201cMy guess is he\u2019ll endorse Hillary Rodham Clinton. But if he were to close his eyes and wish for a leader who he would want to lead the world it\u2019s not where he would land.\u201d\nAs Hillary Clinton suffered through her summer slump, BuzzFeed in mid-August reported on a tiny flicker of interest among Gore supporters for him to mount a 2016 primary challenge. But the former vice president\u2019s spokeswoman, Betsy McManus, quickly doused any speculation a campaign was coming. \u201cThere\u2019s no truth to it,\u201d she told POLITICO the next day. \u201cHe\u2019s laser-focused on solving the climate crisis.\u201d\nIndeed, Gore\u2019s allies repeatedly dismissed questions that the former vice president\u2019s endorsement silence had anything to do with any designs of his own on running for president.

But just as his campaign enters the critical primary phase, the fallen front-runner is about to get outgunned on the airwaves by the man his campaign views as its chief rival: Marco Rubio.\nAccording to media buyers and a POLITICO review of TV ad purchase data, Bush and his allies are on pace to spend $5 million more than Team Rubio on broadcast, cable and radio ads through the first four voting states \u2013 but for that sum, they will put fewer ads on the airwaves.\nStory Continued Below\nThat\u2019s because the vast majority of Bush\u2019s ads are paid for by his super PAC \u2013 roughly 85 percent for Bush versus only 40 percent for Rubio \u2013 and super PACs get far less bang for their buck.\n\u201cA dollar is not a dollar,\u201d explained Evan Tracey, a veteran political ad buyer at National Media, a Republican media firm. \u201cCandidate dollars go much farther than super PAC dollars go.\u201d\n\n\n\n            By \nJosh Gerstein\n             and \nKenneth P. Vogel\n\nIn Iowa and New Hampshire, for example, super PACs are confronting ad rates that can soar to nearly 1,000 percent more than the rates charged of candidates \u2014 an enormous markup that is sapping much of the punch from the $103 million Bush and his allies had amassed by mid-2015.\nData from GOP analytics firm Echelon Insights shows that Rubio will run at least 5,000 more broadcast TV spots than Bush in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada through February, even as the former Florida governor and his super PAC spend more overall.\nAnd that\u2019s the case despite Rubio reserving pricier prime-time advertising with bigger audiences. Echelon says Rubio has devoted 38 percent of its broadcast budget to prime time, versus 20 percent, on average, for the rest of the field. Echelon tracks only broadcast ad buys that are publicly reported to the Federal Communications Commission.\nThere are important caveats to this snapshot of the ad wars: Bush\u2019s super PAC, Right to Rise, could still redirect millions more into the crucial February states. Plus, Bush\u2019s super PAC is the only group to have reserved ads in states that will vote later, in March \u2013 nearly $15 million and counting \u2013 but those ads will only be of value if Bush remains a viable candidate then. In addition, Rubio needs to raise more money to fully fund his reservations.\nStill, that Bush \u2013 and his financial juggernaut of a super PAC \u2013 would get out-advertised in the winter of 2016 would have been unthinkable only a few months ago. But after slashing his staff dramatically this fall amid a fundraising slump, Bush\u2019s official campaign has reserved a little more than one-quarter as much airtime as Rubio: roughly $4.7 million to $16.7 million for Rubio\u2019s campaign between this week and the end of February in the first four states.\nOn the super PAC side of the ad-buying equation, Bush\u2019s team has reserved $17 million more than Rubio\u2019s outside allies in those states. But Rubio\u2019s $12 million advantage in candidate-booked ads more than makes up that difference: It is the equivalent, depending on the station, of between $24 million to $60 million in super PAC ads, as candidates are protected under federal law from TV station price-gouging but super PACs are not.\nTake the NBC affiliate in Des Moines, WHO. Over the two weeks between December 28 and January 11, Rubio will pay an average of $219 per 30-second spot while Bush\u2019s super PAC will pay nearly eight times that amount, $1,596 per 30 seconds, during the same period at the same station. \n\n\n\n            By \nLauren French\n\nThe gap is just as large within the same TV show. On the first Wednesday of 2016, for instance, Right to Rise will spend $2,750 for a single 30-second prime time ad on WHO; Rubio\u2019s campaign has booked two ads at the exact same time for $300 apiece.\nThis story repeats itself in early-state markets big and small \u2014morning, noon and night. \nAt KTIV in Sioux City, Rubio\u2019s campaign is paying $625 for 30 seconds on the 10 p.m. news on December 30. Bush\u2019s super PAC is paying $3,700 \u2013 a roughly 500 percent markup. The next morning, Rubio has two more 30-second ads during \u201cToday\u201d for $165 each. The rate for a single 30-second spot for Right to Rise is $650.\nIn other words, Rubio is getting twice the airtime for half the price.\nBush has long predicted that his television advertising advantage would lift his candidacy. \u201cI'm gonna do something really novel,\u201d he said last month in Iowa. \u201cIt's called advertising.\u201d So far, though, Right to Rise has spent more on television ads than any of his competitors \u2013 more than $17 million to date \u2013 only to see Bush flatline in the polls both nationally and in early states.\nInside the Bush operation, there is already some quiet grumbling about why Right to Rise, run by longtime Bush operative Mike Murphy, sat idle on its tens of millions during the summer \u2013 a time that saw Bush slip, Donald Trump surge, and New Hampshire rivals John Kasich and Chris Christie own that state\u2019s airwaves.\nAnd now, New Hampshire has emerged as an almost must-win state for Bush. Unfortunately for his super PAC, the state\u2019s most sought-after TV station for political ads, WMUR, has been among the most rapacious in up-charging super PACS. \nLast week, for instance, on WMUR\u2019s 5 p.m. news, the campaigns of Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Ben Carson were all paying $700 for a 30-second ad. But the nonprofit and super PAC backing Rubio and John Kasich, respectively, were paying $7,500 for 30 seconds during the same newscast. Bush\u2019s super PAC negotiated a relative bargain: only $5,000, though still more than seven times the candidate rate.\nThe Bush and Rubio campaigns declined to comment for this story.\nBut Right to Rise spokesman Paul Lindsay said it was unfair to compare super PAC and campaign ad rates. \u201cSuper PAC spending and campaign spending should always be viewed separately,\u201d he said.\nViewers, however, don\u2019t differentiate between what type of entity is paying when they watch political ads, and ultimately they are slated to see more such spots from Rubio and his allies.\nLindsay said that while Bush\u2019s super PAC can\u2019t pay candidate rates, it\u2019s maximizing its financial advantage by placing large ad buy early and locking in low rates in important markets. \u201cThat has helped us get better bang for our buck than other organizations, particularly the Rubio super PAC and the Rubio dark money organization,\u201d Lindsay said.\nThat is a swipe at Rubio\u2019s supporters\u2019 use of a secretive 501(c)4 nonprofit to bolster the Florida senator. The pro-Rubio nonprofit, the Conservative Solutions Project, shares staff and a name with Rubio\u2019s super PAC, the Conservative Solutions PAC, but it does not have to disclose its donors, who paid for millions in ads that aired over the summer and fall.\n\u201cHaven't seen the Rubio press release on frugality did it include the $6 million in secret money TV ads they saved money on?\u201d Bush communications director Tim Miller wrote on Twitter last month, as the campaigns sparred about their fundraising figures.\nJeff Sadosky, a spokesman for Rubio\u2019s nonprofit and super PAC, defended the use of the nonprofit for ad buys: \u201cAs it has for the past two years, Conservative Solutions Project remains focused on one thing\u2026advocating for a conservative agenda that will solve some of the most serious issues American families are facing.\u201d\nCampaign operatives acknowledge that super PACs buying TV ads is a poor use of resources, given the huge premiums they pay. But with their ability to raise unlimited money, and the strict $2,700 limits on direct campaign donations, the responsibility for TV ads has still mostly fallen on super PACs in the closing months, with the exception of Rubio.\n\u201cIdeally, super PAC's would do the bulk of voter contact and field work, and the campaign would focus their resources on TV, since you're getting 2-3 times your value for each spot,\u201d said a GOP strategist currently running a super PAC, though not for Bush or Rubio. \u201cThat said, most campaigns don't have the resources to make sufficient media buys so it falls back on the super PAC.\u201d\nRubio, like most candidates, has not yet paid for the ads he has reserved in advance. The roughly $17 million in booked ads amounts to more money than his campaign had on hand at the end of September but because ads are paid week by week, Rubio\u2019s team has been confident it will raise the funds to fulfill his orders through February. Top Republican bundlers, including GOP financier and billionaire Paul Singer, have gravitated toward Rubio as he has risen in the polls.\nThe Rubio campaign\u2019s first flight of ads is set to hit the airwaves in Iowa and New Hampshire next week.\nDaniel Lippman contributed to this report.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Rubio\u2019s campaign is getting twice the ads for half the price of Bush\u2019s super PAC, undercutting his rival\u2019s cash advantage.", "title": "Jeb Bush loses TV ad edge to Marco Rubio", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/marco-rubio-jeb-bush-super-pac-215962", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Jim Obergefell", "Kenneth P.

The survey was conducted earlier this month, prior to the terrorist attacks in France last week, and was supplemented by on-the-ground reporting in Iowa, which will cast the first votes in the presidential nominating process next February.\nStory Continued Below\nOffered identical lists of issues \u2014 economic inequality, economic growth, deficit reduction, taxes and unemployment \u2014 insiders differed dramatically by party. The overwhelming majority of Democrats, 81 percent, said inequality was the most important economic issue in their party's nominating contest, while nearly 65 percent of Republicans picked economic growth as the most important.\n\u201cDemocratic base voters see the country in stark terms: the small group at the top who've got it all, and everyone else struggling to make it in a country that won't even guarantee them modest sick time or family leave,\u201d said a Nevada Democrat, who, like all of the Caucus insiders, responded anonymously.\nMost Republicans, meanwhile, said growing the economy overall was more important than the other priorities listed. None of the 60 GOP insiders surveyed chose economic inequality as the most important issue. Deficit reduction was the only other priority for Republicans to register significantly; just under a quarter of GOP insiders said the national debt was most important.\nHere in the first-in-the-nation caucus state, those arguments are resonating acutely with potential caucusgoers in both parties. Conditions are improving nationwide \u2014 even more rapidly in Iowa \u2014 but serious problems persist.\nUnemployment has recovered close to historical norms nationally. And it\u2019s down to just 3.8 percent in Iowa, where the financial services and agricultural technology industries are booming, especially around Des Moines. \nDean Bowers, a farmer for decades before building a home-repair business, told POLITICO outside the Drake Diner on a windy day last week that he may eventually support one of the GOP candidates. But the 88-year-old balks at the way Republicans have talked about the economy during their highly watched debates.\n\u201cThey get up there and say, \u2018Oh, everything is so awful. America is falling apart.\u2019 And it makes me mad, because it just isn\u2019t true,\" said Bowers. \"It's not true here. There\u2019s plenty of work.\u201d \nBut growth remains slow both in Iowa and nationwide. Wages are sluggish, and the labor force participation rate is at its lowest level in nearly 40 years. The country faces an $18-trillion debt, and entitlement programs whose long-term financing is in peril. Many Americans think the nation is on the wrong track and that the deck is stacked for powerful interests in Washington and corporate America.\nThose feelings provide a ripe climate for Republican outsiders, who are dominating here in Iowa over more traditional candidates. They have also driven the rise of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has challenged Hillary Clinton\u2019s front-runner status in the Democratic race. \nThe frustrations were on clear display in Fort Dodge last Thursday, when thousands turned out for what turned into one of real estate billionaire Donald Trump\u2019s most epic rants of the 2016 campaign \u2014 in which he railed against illegal immigrants and \u201canchor babies,\u201d and likened rival Ben Carson to a child molester. \nAttendees at the event said Trump\u2019s appeal is rooted in his outsider status, business record and pledge to put America back on the right track. \n\u201cHe wants to bring jobs back here, and he knows how to do it,\u201d said Lindie Phipps, a self-described \u201cpoor dirt farmer\u201d from Boxholm, population 200. \u201cHe has got the confidence and the strength do it, and I respect that.\u201d\nAsked to pick which candidate would best handle the economy, fewer than 10 percent of POLITICO Caucus insiders chose Trump. But those who did valued his business experience \u2014 and expressed doubts that any other candidate could match it.\n\"Are you kidding with this question?\" an Iowa GOP Trump supporter asked. \"Only one answer.\"\nThe three candidates who scored highest on the question of handling the economy: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Bush was praised by one Iowa Republican for his emphasis on the need for growth.\n\u201cChina's new growth forecast is 6.5 percent,\u201d said the Iowa Republican. \u201cThe U.S. would crave achieving half that number. [Jeb] Bush and others who focus on growth have the right policy and political focus.\u201d\nMore than three-fourths of Democratic insiders, meanwhile, said Clinton would do the best job handling the economy \u2014 even as they acknowledge Sanders has driven the conversation on economic issues.\n\u201cThis is the crux of the Sanders' campaign, which has galvanized his base of support,\u201d said a Nevada Democrat. \u201cEven Clinton \u2013 who hails from an upper-middle-class background and is now at the top of the economic pyramid \u2013 has had to make economic inequality a point of attack against Republicans. The issue rings hollow coming from her, but Sanders spits the hot fire when he gets going on inequality, and his genuine passion fuels his supporters.\u201d\nOne reason for insiders\u2019 differing prescriptions for the U.S. economy? Disparate views on the state of the economy, including their own financial situation \u2013 a finding that mirrors public polling that shows Americans who identify as Democrats are significantly more likely to say they are doing better under President Barack Obama than Republicans.\nIn the POLITICO Caucus survey, 80 percent of Democratic insiders said they were better off now than when Obama took office in 2009, but fewer than three-in-10 Republicans agreed. Nearly half of GOP insiders said they were worse off, compared to fewer than 5 percent of Democrats.\nIt\u2019s a divide that is driving the parallel races for the two parties\u2019 respective nominations: Democrats are looking for a candidate to continue the economic recovery but make it more equitable, and Republicans are urging a more drastic change of course from what they see as a disastrous set of economic policies.\nThat's also true in Iowa, which is doing better than the rest of the nation. The state\u2019s unemployment rate is low, and home prices are rising. A recent USA Today/Wells Fargo poll found that 65 percent of Iowans rate local economic conditions as \u201cgood,\u201d well above the national average. The cost of living is manageable. And Forbes magazine recently named Des Moines the best city in America for young professionals.\n\u201cOur economy, quite frankly, has been booming,\u201d Jay Byers, CEO of the Greater Des Moines Partnership, said in an interview in his office in downtown Des Moines. \u201cWe have the largest concentration of insurance jobs per capita in the entire country. We are the third-largest employment hub for Wells Fargo. And our other world-class cluster is ag-bioscience and agriculture. Monsanto has more jobs in Iowa than they do in Missouri,\u201d where the company is based. \nFacebook and Microsoft are both building $2-billion data centers in Des Moines. Fancy new hotels are going up, and cranes are everywhere. \nBut low commodity prices are hurting the state\u2019s agricultural exports. So is the strong dollar, which hurts both agricultural and manufacturing exports.\nThe uneven economic environment presents political challenges to both parties. Democrats must deal with the overwhelming majority of voters who still view the nation\u2019s economy as moving in the wrong direction despite the longest economic expansion in decades. \nRepublicans have to address the fact that the unemployment rate is down by half since the first year of President Barack Obama\u2019s term and the nation has created 8 million new jobs under his watch, compared to the 1.3 million created under George W. Bush. They also have to shift away from their traditional base of support in corporate America and Wall Street to reflect a populist age in which distrust of big business \u2014 especially the financial industry \u2014 runs deeply through both parties. \n\u201cVoters don't trust people that are in public life,\u201d one Iowa GOP insider said. \u201cDo you want people running this country who are in bed with special interests, or someone who will say what he means and mean what he says?\"\nOn the Democratic side, Clinton has regained some momentum by moving left on Wall Street issues, saying she would break up the biggest banks if she had to. But Clinton may have a problem in Iowa on trade. The state is a major agricultural and manufacturing exporter, and big companies here are mostly in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the giant trade deal with Asia that Clinton recently said she opposes against despite supporting it while she served as secretary of state. \nThat is not likely to cost her a win in the Iowa caucuses, but it could prove damaging in the general election. Iowa is a classic \u201cpurple\u201d state, voting for the winner of the popular vote in every presidential election since 1992. \n\u201cThe TPP has a lot of components that really benefit the agriculture industry in the state, and former Gov. Tom Vilsack has strongly supported the TPP in Iowa for these reasons,\u201d said one Iowa Democratic insider. \u201cHowever, among Democratic caucus attendees, these policies are used to judge whether a candidate is truly progressive \u2014 it's no coincidence that Hillary has now come out against the TPP.\u201d\nThe Republican candidates, meanwhile, will have to toe the line between an Iowa GOP electorate that wants drastic, national change \u2014 but is also proud of how well the state has done compared to the rest of the nation and doesn\u2019t take kindly to people talking it down. \n\u201cWe didn\u2019t take the kind of hit other places did during the recession and we are doing pretty well now,\u201d said Chris Wilde, chief engineer at KCCI, the local CBS affiliate. Broadcasters in particular fare well during caucus seasons, which sees millions of dollars in political ad spending. \nBut Byers of the Greater Des Moines Partnership put the current economic attitude of Iowans in even stronger terms. \u201cIt\u2019s very different right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is swagger out there, there\u2019s pride.\u201d\nThese are the members of the POLITICO Caucus, not all of whom participated in this special survey:\nIowa: Tim Albrecht, Brad Anderson, Rob Barron, Jeff Boeyink, Bonnie Campbell, Dave Caris, Sam Clovis, Sara Craig, Jerry Crawford, John Davis, Steve Deace, John Deeth, Derek Eadon, Ed Failor Jr., Karen Fesler, David Fischer, Doug Gross, Steve Grubbs, Tim Hagle, Bob Haus, Joe Henry, Drew Ivers, Jill June, Lori Jungling, Jeff Kaufmann, Brian Kennedy, Jake Ketzner, David Kochel, Chris Larimer, Chuck Larson, Jill Latham, Jeff Link, Dave Loebsack, Mark Lucas, Liz Mathis, Jan Michelson, Chad Olsen, David Oman, Matt Paul, Marlys Popma, Troy Price, Christopher Rants, Kim Reem, Craig Robinson, Sam Roecker, David Roederer, Nick Ryan, Tamara Scott, Joni Scotter, Karen Slifka, John Smith, AJ Spiker, Norm Sterzenbach, John Stineman, Matt Strawn, Phil Valenziano, Jessica Vanden Berg, Nate Willems, Eric Woolson, Grant Young\nNew Hampshire: Charlie Arlinghaus, Arnie Arnesen, Patrick Arnold, Rich Ashooh, Dean Barker, Juliana Bergeron, D.J.

The Texas senator appeared in a Fox News segment reporting on the dilemma of what to do about refugees seeking asylum in the United States, and spoke generally about U.S. values. \n\"We have welcomed refugees, the tired huddled masses for centuries,\" he said during the two-and-a-half minute package about the broader situation. \"That\u2019s been the history of the United States. We should continue to do so,\" \n\n\n\n            By \nEliza Collins\n\nBut he also had a caveat: \u201cWe have to continue to be vigilant to make sure those coming are not affiliated with the terrorists, but we can do that.\"\nFast forward 21 months, with Syria's bloody civil war still raging and with fears stoked about ISIL fighters slipping into the U.S., Cruz is now saying he plans to introduce legislation that would bar Syrian refugees from entering the country.\n\"What Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are proposing is that we bring to this country tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees,\" Cruz told CNN. \"I have to say, particularly in light of what happened in Paris, that's nothing short of lunacy.\"\nHe also talked of taking the hardest line against Muslim Syrian refugees, while still allowing in displaced Christians whom he said do not pose a \"meaningful risk\" for committing acts of terror.\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who had positioned himself as a compassionate conservative on immigration who believes many people come illegally to the U.S. as an \"act of love,\" has also been shifting his tone since last week's attacks.\nSpeaking before a New Hampshire town hall in September, Bush said about the Syrian refugees: \"People are leaving not just because they are immigrants looking for a better life. They are leaving because, if not, they will die. It's that simple. And we have to play a role in providing support.\"\nOn Sunday, as talk of the attacks dominated the morning shows, Bush didn\u2019t call for halting the administration\u2019s plans, but said he would prioritize Christians over other refugees.\n\n\n\n            By \nJake Sherman\n\n\u201cI do think we have a responsibility to help with refugees after proper screening, and I think our focus ought to be on the Christians, who have no place in Syria anymore,\u201d he told CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \u201cThey\u2019re being beheaded, they\u2019re being executed by both sides.\u201d He added, \"We should focus our efforts as it relates to refugees on the Christians that are being slaughtered.\" \nBut after Obama on Monday appeared to lump Bush in with Cruz for imposing an inhumane \"religious test,\" the former Florida governor clarified in an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday that he didn't want to discriminate against Muslim refugees.\n\"There's no discrimination to simply say that you want to protect religious minorities that are being exterminated,\" he said.\nThe subtlety in Bush's way of speaking on the issue was nowhere in Chris Christie's response.\nThe New Jersey governor, in the days after the image of the drowned Syrian boy shocked the world, said a solution needed to be found to help the refugees.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d sit down with our allies and figure out how we can help, because America is a compassionate country. We saw the image of that 4-year-old little boy drowned in Syria, and we can\u2019t have those kinds of things,\u201d Christie said on \"Fox and Friends.\" \u201cI can\u2019t come up with an exact number. You\u2019d have to sit with our allies and work together.\u201d\nOn Monday, as governor, Christie put his foot down, and even took a hard line against young orphans.\n\"I do not trust this administration to effectively vet the people who are proposed to be coming in, in order to protect the safety and security of the American people, so I would not permit them in,\" he said on Hugh Hewitt's radio program.\n\"What if they were orphans under the age of five?\" Hewitt asked.\n\"You know, Hugh, we can come up with 18 different scenarios. The fact is that we need appropriate vetting, and I don\u2019t think orphans under five are being, you know, should be admitted into the United States at this point,\" he said. \"But you know, they have no family here. How are we going to care for these folks? The fact is you can come up with a number of different scenarios, Hugh. But in the end, I don\u2019t trust this administration to effectively vet the people that they\u2019re asking us to take in. We need to put the safety and security of the American people first.\"\nOn Tuesday, Christie formally notified Obama in a letter that he would not accept any Syrian refugees, in New Jersey.\n\n\n\n            By \nNahal Toosi\n\nDonald Trump, who has made his strident stances on immigration a central case for his presidency, has also taken a hard line against Syrian refugees. But he wasn't always talking that way. \nIn September, Trump told Bill O'Reilly about taking in the refugees, \"I hate the concept of it, but on a humanitarian basis, you have to.\"\nBut that tone quickly dissipated, and the billionaire businessman told supporters later that month that the refugees \"are going back,\" warning that they represent a potential \"Trojan horse\" for terrorists. Trump has instead advocated the construction of \"a big beautiful safe zone\" in Syria, as he told supporters in Knoxville, Tennessee, on Monday.\nAnother Republican who has changed his tone as the devastating images of refugees have been overtaken by the fallout from the Paris attacks is Marco Rubio.\nWhile he has battled critics who say his 2013 attempt at immigration reform casts doubt on his conservative credentials, the Florida senator in September told a CNN reporter at a South Carolina town hall that his administration would \"be potentially open to the relocation of some of these individuals at some point in time to the United States.\" \nBut on Sunday, Rubio said the doors must shut to more refugees.\n\"The problem is not the background checks. The problem is we can\u2019t background check them. You can\u2019t pick up the phone and call Syria. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why I said we won\u2019t be able to take more refugees,\" Rubio said on ABC's \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos.\" \n\"It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want to, it\u2019s that we can\u2019t,\" he explained, adding that there is also a threat of home-grown violent extremists, those \"who had been radicalized online.\" \nJohn Kasich, meanwhile, joined on Monday the growing list of governors who said they would no longer accept refugees, an about-face from September.\nBack then, Kasich told Fox News' \"Hannity\" that he \"wouldn\u2019t say to these people, \u2018You can\u2019t come in,'\" pointing to it as a place of cooperation between the U.S. and its European allies, whom he said should largely bear that issue.\n\"And I think at this point, I would actually welcome the Congress to weigh in and make sure that we have a procedure that can verify who these people are,\" Kasich added, in a preview of the Capitol Hill fight to come. \"I mean, there\u2019s nobody in this country that would want somebody connected to ISIS to be able could come in here.\"\nOn Tuesday, speaking in Washington, Kasich said he now believes an influx of Syrian refugees poses an unacceptable risk: \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m saying is for right now, until we get a handle on where we are, we need to stop.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "After the Paris attacks, the Republican field is taking a tougher stance against the refugees.", "title": "GOP candidates were for Syrian refugees before they were against them", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/gop-2016-syria-refugees-215978", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kenneth P.

I looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena. And specifically said to Wall Street, that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\nYet an examination of Clinton\u2019s remarks to Wall Street in December 2007 and her actions as a New York senator\u2014a period when she had the best opportunity to translate her words into deeds\u2014presents a more mixed picture of her record on the financial industry.\nThe bills Clinton introduced on banking and housing finance got no traction. When she had a chance to support a 2007 bill that aimed to curb a tax break she publicly decried for hedge-fund and private-equity executives, she failed to sign on.\nClinton also has some history with the shadow-banking world she says is a continuing risk to the financial system. While in the Senate, she made a little-noticed overture to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who was involved in talks to rescue giant insurer AIG with government funds. She was calling on behalf of wealthy investors who stood to lose millions and had hired two longtime Clinton associates to represent them.\n \u2018Cut it Out\u2019\nIn his most direct attack on Clinton\u2019s record to date, Sanders on Saturday suggested that she was in Wall Street\u2019s pocket. \n\u201cWhy, over her political career has Wall Street been a major\u2014the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton? You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so,\u201d the Vermont senator said.\nIn her defense, Clinton brought up her efforts to help Wall Street rebuild after the 2001 terrorist attacks, a reference that later led one panelist to suggest she was avoiding the original question. But Clinton also defended her record as tough on the banks, saying she is \u201cgoing right at them\u201d with a comprehensive plan. For the second time in the debates she referenced a speech she gave to executives before the economic meltdown. In October\u2019s debate she had described herself as going to Wall Street and saying, \u201cCut it out! Quit foreclosing on homes! Quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors.\u201d\nA review of that 28-minute talk at an office of the Nasdaq stock exchange in New York shows Clinton steered a middle ground. She presented a detailed analysis of the burgeoning dangers in the housing market and its threat to the economy. (ProPublica obtained a video of the speech, which hasn\u2019t previously been posted.)\nClinton gave a shout-out to her \u201cwonderful donors\u201d in the audience, and asked the bankers to voluntarily suspend foreclosures and freeze interest rates on adjustable subprime mortgages. She praised Wall Street for its role in creating the nation\u2019s wealth, then added that \u201ctoo many American families are not sharing\u201d in that prosperity.\nShe said the brewing economic troubles weren\u2019t mainly the fault of banks, \u201cnot by a long shot,\u201d but added they needed to shoulder responsibility for their role. While there was plenty of blame to go around for the spate of reckless lending, and while Wall Street may not have created the foreclosure crisis, it \u201ccertainly had a hand in making it worse\u201d and \u201cneeds to help us solve it.\u201d \nFinally, Clinton said, if the banks didn\u2019t take the voluntary steps she proposed, \u201cI will consider legislation to address the problem.\u201d\nBills Died\nThe lenders did not adopt Clinton\u2019s proposals. During 2007 and 2008, when the housing market collapsed and while she was also running for president, the Democrats controlled the Senate. Of the 140 bills Clinton introduced during that period, five were related to housing finance or foreclosures, according to congressional records, including one aimed at making it easier for homeowners facing foreclosure to get their loans modified. Only one of the five secured any co-sponsors -- New York Sen. Charles Schumer signed onto a bill that would have helped veterans refinance their mortgages.\n\n\n                                                2016\n\n\n                                            By TODD S.

These eventually led to a sweeping housing and mortgage law signed by President Bush in July 2008. That legislation was voted on three times in the Senate in 2008, in addition to a few procedural votes related to the bill. Clinton missed votes in February and April, when she was running for president, but also missed votes in late June, after she had dropped out of the contest. On July 26, when the bill passed, Clinton was there to vote in support.\nThe bill\u2019s main sponsor, Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, summarized the bill\u2019s journey and, in a floor speech, praised 13 other senators for their help. Clinton\u2019s name wasn\u2019t among them.\nBrian Fallon, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, declined to comment for this story. \n \u2018Something Wrong\u2019\nClinton\u2019s campaign referenced her Senate record in a fact sheet issued last month titled, \u201cWall Street Should Work for Main Street.\u201d It cited one bill \u2013 the executive compensation legislation that died. It also mentioned four press releases or speeches from 2007 and 2008 \u2013 including a March 15, 2007, talk in which she proposed a series of housing initiatives and her call later that year for higher taxes on hedge fund executives. \nJeff Gerth is a senior reporter at ProPublica.

Once sure-footed and decisive in expressing his view of the most important issue facing the country, income inequality, Sanders now appears to be holding back, hesitant to put meat on the bones of his big-picture ideas.\n\n\n\n            By \nGabriel Debenedetti\n\nThe socialism speech \u2013 billed by his campaign as a major address where Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist, would finally explain his definition of a politically loaded term that is deeply personal to him \u2013 provides perhaps the most concrete example.\nSanders first told reporters that he was planning to deliver a \u201cmajor speech\u201d outlining his political philosophy in October. \u201cI think we have some explaining to do,\u201d he said, admitting the tag of Democratic socialism wrongly makes some people \u201cvery, very nervous.\u201d\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re probably going to do to begin with is hold a major speech in the not-too-distant future, to define exactly what I mean by Democratic socialist,\u201d Sanders said during a campaign stop in Iowa. \u201cTo me, Democratic socialism means democracy. It means creating a government that represents all of us, not just the wealthiest people in the country.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s been postponed indefinitely because Sanders has not yet finished writing the high-risk speech, or agreed that he is ready to deliver it. The delay highlights another issue facing the Sanders camp \u2013 an apparent disconnect between the candidate and his staffers, who say they are pushing the senator to give his speech sooner rather than later.\n\u201cI personally think we\u2019re ready, he\u2019s just got to agree we\u2019re ready,\u201d said senior strategist Tad Devine. \u201cIt\u2019s very much on the horizon, it\u2019s just a question of timing. He wants to finish the speech first.\u201d\nSanders still likes to write all of his speeches himself \u2013 even when an aide offers a draft, he will typically rework the specific language. The mere prospect of the speech drew comparisons to other Democratic presidential candidates who confronted sensitive questions about faith or belief \u2013 putting it in line with Barack Obama's 2008 speech in Philadelphia about race, and John F. Kennedy's speech about his Roman Catholic faith in 1960. And Sanders camp said it was not backing away.\n\nFourth Estate\n\n            By \nJack Shafer\n\n\u201cWe want to do this,\u201d Devine said. \u201cIt\u2019s not because we don\u2019t want to talk about being a socialist. No way. Just the opposite. This is an opportunity for him to explain how his political philosophy fits squarely into the Democratic Party.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also not clear when Sanders will provide details of how he plans to pay for his health insurance plan. \u201cLike with the socialism speech, there\u2019s no set date,\u201d Devine said of the single-payer program, as well as the related tax policy details. \u201cI would admit there\u2019s delay. I would attribute that to a desire for it to be a fully costed analysis. We\u2019re not trying to be evasive. He\u2019s trying to be serious.\u201d\nDuring the second Democratic debate Saturday night, Sanders said he was not ready to say how much he would raise the country\u2019s top marginal income tax rate. \u201cWe haven\u2019t come up with an exact number yet,\u201d he told CBS news correspondent Nancy Cordes. \u201cBut it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent.\u201d\nHe wiggled out of providing specificity with humor. \u201cI\u2019m not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,\u201d he joked, landing his first applause line of the night.\nIn the past, Sanders has introduced single-payer legislation in Congress that included a 2.2 percent income tax across the board, as well as a 6.7 percent payroll tax for employers. While payroll taxes are split between the employer and the employee, economists and the Congressional Budget Office have said that most of those fees are carried by workers in the form of lower wages. Sensing opportunity, the Clinton camp went on offense against Sanders on Tuesday, hoping to cast an unflattering light on him for supporting legislation that would raise taxes on the middle class, while Clinton has promised that none of her proposals involve a middle class tax hike.\n\"Bernie Sanders has called for a roughly 9-percent tax hike on middle-class families just to cover his health care plan,\" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said, referring to his 2013 single-payer legislation, \"and simple math dictates he'll need to tax workers even more to pay for the rest of his at least $18-20 trillion agenda.\"\n\nWhite House \n\n            By \nSarah Wheaton\n\nIn an interview, Sanders\u2019 campaign appeared to be backing away from the senator's own previous bills, aware that any possible tax hike that could be a deal breaker for middle class voters. Devine said \u201cwhat Bernie wants to do now [in terms of his healthcare proposal] is not exactly like the one proposed in past legislation.\u201d\nAny proposal the campaign will unveil, said Devine, is unlikely to involve tax rate increases on the middle class. \u201cI don\u2019t really see that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see tax rate increases involving anyone other than people making a lot of money.\u201d\nDevine also pushed back against the idea that the Sanders campaign\u2019s delays in rolling out specifics \u2013 on his tax plan or anything else \u2013 reflected a calculated consideration of the political realities of the race and his approach.\n\u201cThat is a not a back of the envelope endeavor,\u201d Devine said of the tax plan. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the Congressional Budget Office itself will be involved, but it\u2019s going to be legit. The think tanks are going to say these are real numbers. This is not somebody\u2019s tax plan that makes no sense in the real world. He\u2019s a serious legislator.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Once sure-footed and decisive in expressing his views, the Vermont senator now appears to be holding back on the details of his big-picture ideas.", "title": "Sanders hesitates on socialism speech", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/bernie-sanders-socialism-speech-215965", "topics": ["economy"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Susan Rice", "Kenneth P.

{"body": "\n\n\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton walks on stage before speaking at the Central Iowa Democrats Fall Barbecue Sunday, Nov. 15, 2015, in Ames, Iowa. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)\n\n\nDALLAS \u2013 \u00a0Hillary Rodham Clinton won the endorsement of the Service Employees International Union on Tuesday, giving her the support of a labor powerhouse that backed President Barack Obama in 2008.\nThe nation's largest health care union represents about 2 million nurses, health care workers and other caregivers and is among the most ethnically diverse unions in the country. The decision is a blow to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose supporters had pushed against an endorsement.\n\"Hillary Clinton has proven she will fight, deliver and win for working families,\" said SEIU president Mary Kay Henry in a statement. \"SEIU members and working families across America are part of a growing movement to build a better future for their families, and Hillary Clinton will support and stand with them.\"\nClinton was holding a rally in Dallas later Tuesday in which she planned to discuss the health care overhaul under Obama. It represents another show of strength for Clinton, who has locked up most of the major unions despite Sanders' message of helping workers overcome income inequality.

{"body": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nEditor's note: The following column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com. \nEven before the recent terror attacks in Paris, the politics of war were intruding upon the presidential primary campaign.\nLast week, among Republicans, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush joined businesswoman Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich in supporting a no-fly zone in Syria.\u00a0\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) pointed out that candidates backing the no-fly zone have to be ready to shoot down Russian aircraft and handle the potential consequences, up to and including another world war.\n\nWithout new ideas from Republicans or his fellow Democrats for dealing with ISIS or the civil war in Syria, the president and his secretary of State John Kerry are trying to negotiate with Russia and Iran to create a coalition to jointly fight ISIS while protecting Syrian civilians as they try to flee.\n\nDespite those fireworks, the real U.S. political news on war in the Middle East is the growing divide among Democrats.\nHillary Clinton, President Obama\u2019s former secretary of State, backs the idea of American forces taking out any aircraft over the war-torn eastern region of the country. The president does not.\nWhen Clinton announced support for the idea of a no-fly zone in early October, Obama, who is resisting that approach for fear of rapid escalation, slapped back at her, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between running for president and being president.\u201d\nThere is a lot of history at play among Obama, Clinton and top Democrats in the Senate when it comes to war in the Middle East. Clinton famously remarked in 2014, after leaving the administration, that \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t do stupid stuff\u2019 is not a sufficient organizing principle,\u201d for the nation\u2019s foreign policy. The phrase is strongly identified with Obama. She also favored arming the Syrian rebels. Obama rejected the idea.\nClinton is backing the president\u2019s decision to send 50 special operations troops to Syria. Last week, before Friday's atrocities in Paris took place, her campaign issued a statement saying she \u201csees merit in the targeted use of special operations personnel to support our partners in the fight against ISIS, including in Syria\u2026Of course, she opposes the U.S. getting into a ground war in the Middle East.\u201d\nThose last words are critical because Clinton\u2019s opponent for the Democratic nomination this time is once again ready to portray her as a hawk who is ready to send Americans into yet another Middle Eastern war \u2014 just as then-Sen. Obama did back in 2008.\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has expressed doubt that the 50 troops will be the last of the Americans sent to Syria. He warned that this small first step could lead to \u201cperpetual warfare\u201d for the U.S. in the Middle East. And in debates he loudly reminds Democrats of Clinton\u2019s 2002 vote to authorize President Bush to go to war in Iraq.\u00a0\nThe divide among Democrats over Middle East war strategy is also on painful view in the Senate. Several top Democrats in the upper chamber are adopting a bizarre stance where they are pushing the president to make a stronger commitment to fight in Syria even as they resist having a vote themselves to authorize the president to use added force in Syria.\u00a0\nThe same type of political cowardice stopped the Senate from approving missile strikes against the Syrian regime to halt its use of chemical weapons against rebels when the war started in 2013.\nNow President Obama is not even waiting on Senate authorization to fight ISIS in Syria and Iraq. He is just sending in the troops.\u00a0\nAnd without new ideas from Republicans or his fellow Democrats for dealing with ISIS or the civil war in Syria, the president and his secretary of State John Kerry are trying to negotiate with Russia and Iran to create a coalition to jointly fight ISIS while protecting Syrian civilians as they try to flee.\nMeanwhile, the president is using American soldiers in tactical roles to advise local forces battling ISIS.\nBut with the president entering the last year of his presidency, his fellow Democrats prefer positioning themselves as skeptics of his policy.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is a strategy that will work long term,\u201d Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said in an interview on CBS. \u201cI think ISIS is a great threat.\u201d\n\u201cI think 50, that won\u2019t do it,\u201d Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said on NBC News. \u201cIf we are really going to use special forces, quick in, quick out, you have to do it in a much more comprehensive way.\u201d She added that bombing and the few troops have not \u201cchanged the dynamic\u201d in Syria.\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) also dismissed the Obama administration\u2019s claim that the 50 soldiers are not \u201cground troops\u201d because their role is to provide technical guidance to rebel troops fighting ISIS. Kaine said his position is that the Obama administration lacks a \u201ccomprehensive strategy\u201d to defeat ISIS.\nThe most damning assessment of the president\u2019s approach from a fellow Democrat came from Sen.

But, ultimately this time, his dreams of the White House fell short. \"Never in their wildest dreams did they think their son would have the opportunity to serve as Governor of Louisiana or to run for president,\" Jindal said on Fox News Channel's \"Special Report with Bret Baier.\" The two-term governor had struggled to raise money and to gain any traction in the race, consistently relegated to the lower undercard debates at each of the past four Republican debates. Overshadowed by outsider candidates like Donald Trump and neurosurgeon Ben Carson. for a time Jindal had focused his fire at the wealthy real estate magnate, blasting him \"a narcissist\" and \"a carnival act\" this fall.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a 2016 Republican presidential candidate, was among those who joined the early call in the wake of last week's terrorist attacks in Paris. But just months ago, Kasich had encouraged President Obama to accept the refugees. During a Tuesday speech at the National Press Club outlining his foreign policy agenda, Kasich called for a more robust U.S. military presence in the Middle East and pointed to his experience in Congress on the House Armed Services Committee. After his address, Kasich spoke to NPR's Audie Cornish, telling her that a critical part of U.S. success in toppling extremist organizations like ISIS would be spreading other ideas in the Middle East,including \"Jewish [and] Christian principles.\" In an interview with NBC, Kasich went even further, calling for a new U.S. agency to promote a Jewish and Christian belief system abroad in places like the Middle East, China and Russia. As for his low standing in recent polls, Kasich dismissed early national surveys and said the nominating process through Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina was \"excellent\" and would work.  Interview Highlights On why he changed his views on allowing Syrian refugees into the U.S.  Maybe there's a bit of a shift in the position, but in light of Paris and in light of the concern that people have, not just in my state but in my neighborhood, I think it's very reasonable to say that we need to have a pause. If we have a problem with our intelligence folks telling us we can't vet them, then of course we can't move forward. I don't think at this point that we should have any more come in and if we can establish proper protocols, procedures to know who they are so that we're not inviting people under the cover of refugee status who mean us harm. ... I have a big heart, and I also think I have a pretty good brain, and to me this is a very reasonable approach to take at this point in time. I think this is a reasonable approach that will strike the American people as reasonable, and let's try to improve the situation whereby we can determine who wants to come here. On a no-fly zone in Syria  I think we should establish a no-fly zone in Syria, with a sanctuary where families can be protected ... I think it's appropriate for the U.S. to increase financial assistance to countries that can keep these folks in the Middle East, in the region where they live. I was a little taken aback when the president said we should study [no-fly zones]. We should have been studying it a heck of a lot earlier once somebody like me made a suggestion that we ought to have one. These can be sanctuaries. This can be a no-fly zone that can be patrolled, and I think there is a way to invite our allies in the Middle East to make sure that those sanctuaries are safe. ... We need to support the opposition in Syria, remove [President Bashar] al-Assad. On his approach to the Middle East We win battles with bullets, but we win wars with ideas. And I think it is absolutely critical to invite our moderate Muslim friends, along with those who for centuries, have had a foundation of Jewish and Christian principles, to begin to tell the world about who we are, what we are, what we believe and why it's preferable to a force that sponsors murder [and] rape. I think that the Western culture is one of freedom, freedom of religion, equality for women.\n", "byline": "", "description": "The Ohio governor and 2016 GOP presidential hopeful outlined his foreign policy agenda in an interview with NPR, saying \"I think it is absolutely critical to invite our moderate Muslim friends.\"", "title": "Kasich: 'Reasonable' to 'Pause' Resettlement Of Syrian Refugees", "url": "http://www.npr.org/2015/11/17/456395261/kasich-reasonable-to-pause-resettlement-of-syrian-refugees", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Brendan Smialowski", "Audie Cornish", "John Kasich"], "orgs": ["House Armed Services Committee", "GOP", "Congress"], "election_confidence": 0.7111675521848687, "authors": [{"author_id": 23, "fullname": "npr staff", "primary_org": "npr"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 23:33:39", "org": "npr", "article_id": "d55f7e1024437274aa02c9b830de3be4", "date_access": "2015-11-17 23:36:26.128845"},

But Sen. Lindsey Graham, who's running for the Republican presidential nomination, wants to the U.S. to do more. He wants to send in upwards of 10,000 ground forces as part of a coalition to fight ISIS, also known as ISIL. Graham spoke to NPR's Audie Cornish about that coalition of Arab allies, and why he says Syrian refugees coming to the U.S. are \"a symptom of a failed strategy.\"  Interview Highlights On his strategy to fight Islamic State In the eyes of the Arabs in Turkey, ISIL is a completely different threat than Saddam Hussain, than the Taliban. They're the neighbor from hell. My strategy is pretty simple: rally the region who is ready to be led because they're directly threatened by ISIL and we'll provide a thickening of the force, a capability they don't provide. On Arab allies  They've been dropping bombs, but they're not going to go in without us. ... What I would do is go to Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and the region as a whole and say we share two goals. The destruction of ISIL, which is a threat to your societies and our way of life and our homeland. And we will also work together to make sure that Iran doesn't control Syria when this is all over and Assad's got to go. If you don't put the second component on the table, the Arabs are not just going to go in and destroy ISIL and give Syria to Iran. On Syrian refugees coming to the U.S. Number one, a lot of people who are seizing on the refugee issue are demagoguing to emotions behind it, and not addressing the problem. Refugees are symptom of a failed strategy. The reason they're leaving Syria is because they're getting raped and murdered. And could ISIL integrate into this refugee population? Absolutely. So I'm calling for a time out on our refugee program until we can ensure we have proper vetting. I'm more worried about getting it right than anything else. I'm willing to give money to international organizations who are dealing with the refugees in Jordan and Turkey ... I'm willing to help the region deal with refugees but if you don't go to the source of the problems, the refugees continue to flow and eventually ISIL hits us here at home. On his viability in the 2016 race given low poll numbers I'm going to stay in this race as long as I possibly can, and here's what I think. My voice is going to resonate over time. I don't believe you can deport 11 million illegal immigrants. I think a lot of what Trump is saying about illegal immigration is hurting the party ... and I want to go on the offense against radical Islam. New Hampshire is the way forward for me. I hope to do well in Iowa, but John McCain endorsed me last week in New Hampshire, he won there twice. I've gone there a bunch \u2013- I do weddings, funerals, bar mitzvahs, friendly divorces. If you're in New Hampshire I'm coming your way soon. That's whereo I think Lindsey Graham can break through.\n", "byline": "", "description": "Sen.
