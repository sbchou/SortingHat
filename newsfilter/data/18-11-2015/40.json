More than half of U.S. governors have said they do not want Syrian refugees resettled in their states, while House Speaker Paul Ryan says he wants a vote this week on GOP-drafted legislation to halt the administration's plans.\nWorld Relief is one of nine groups, several of them faith-based, that help the U.S. resettle up to 70,000 refugees from around the world in the United States each year. Others include the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, and the Church World Service. Many other faith-based groups, including evangelical Christian organizations, also perform aid work overseas specifically aimed at refugees fleeing conflicts.\nBy\nJake Sherman\nFor Republican presidential contenders such as former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who have been working hard at shoring up evangelical support in a crowded field, harsh words against refugees carries a risk of looking politically opportunistic instead of compassionate. Some advocates were particularly shocked when Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie, New Jersey's governor, said that the U.S. should bar Syrian orphaned toddlers if necessary.\n\"That was offensive. That was mean-spirited,\" said one advocate with a Christian group that resettles refugees. He added: \"it\u2019s disappointing because there have been Republican senators and presidents who have strongly supported this program over the years. There\u2019s a proud tradition in the Republican Party of welcoming those who are fleeing persecution, and this takes the party in a negative direction. It\u2019s easy to pick on vulnerable refugees who have no voice. But there are immigrant groups who have voting power that understand what is going on. They understand that it\u2019s an anti-immigrant message.\"\nEven though many on the Christian right have reservations about immigration overall, and may in particular be unhappy about people who illegally enter the United States, there's long been a recognition that refugees fall under a different category. The 11 million Syrians who have either fled the Arab country or are displaced within it are dodging terrorist groups such as the Islamic State or the barrel bombs of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Many are elderly, widowed or in need of medical care.\nSome Republican candidates have suggested that only Syrians who are Christian be allowed on U.S. soil, something President Barack Obama has blasted as shameful. Yang said many evangelical Christians would also oppose such a religious test, especially because many are eager to share their faith with new arrivals.\nThe United States so far has admitted roughly 2,100 Syrians since the conflict in the country began in March 2011. To be allowed in, refugees have to undergo the most stringent security checks of any traveler heading to the United States, according to the State Department. Officials from the Obama administration on Tuesday began reaching out to the media and lawmakers in a bid to explain the screening process, which takes an average of 18-24 months.\nMeanwhile, faith-based groups have also stepped up their advocacy efforts for refugees. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops released a statement expressing distress over calls by elected officials to halt the resettlement program.\nBy\nNahal Toosi\n\"These refugees are fleeing terror themselves \u2014 violence like we have witnessed in Paris,\" said the statement by Bishop Eusebio Elizondo, chairman of the conference's committee on migration. \"Instead of using this tragedy to scapegoat all refugees, I call upon our public officials to work together to end the Syrian conflict peacefully so the close to 4 million Syrian refugees can return to their country and rebuild their homes. Until that goal is achieved, we must work with the world community to provide safe haven to vulnerable and deserving refugees who are simply attempting to survive.\"\nSince the Paris attacks, World Relief has used a website to urge people to contact their governors to express their support for resettling Syrians. The Anti-Defamation League also have spoken out in favor of helping the Syrian refugees, noting that U.S. wariness to accept Jewish refugees during World War II is an example that must not be repeated.\nJonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive officer of the ADL and a former Obama aide, stressed that much remains unknown about the Paris attacks, including the exact nature of the allegation that a Syrian migrant was one of the eight or nine attackers. Even if a terrorist posed as a migrant to reach France, it's less likely that the U.S., with oceans to protect it and a stricter screening process, faces the same level of dangers, other advocates said.\n\"Republicans and Democrats have to tread very carefully here,\" Greenblatt said. \"Faith-based voters are very attentive to these issues. They\u2019re very sensitive to helping those in need.\"\nJoanne Kelsey, assistant director for advocacy with Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said she hoped that the sound and fury over refugees would soon be replaced with reason as Republican lawmakers and officials get more details about how the refugee program works.\n\"This is a very reactionary time,\" she said.\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Evangelical Christians, as well as Christians more broadly, are a core group in the Republican electoral base and are among the most passionate advocates for aiding refugees.", "title": "Christian groups break with GOP over Syrian refugees", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/refugees-christians-215991", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kenneth P.

Where it's maybe in Minnesota where it is 20 degrees below zero? I mean just I don't understand what we possibly can be thinking.\"\nHuckabee made the same comments to Breitbart News radio on Monday too. \n\"Why would we remove people from a desert climate,\" said Huckabee, again. \"There's no reason under god's earth to send people who have lived in a desert their whole life, who may speak Arabic or some other language and put them in Minnesota for the winter. Can anybody tell me that makes any sense, it simply does not.\"\nMinnesota has a rich history of accepting refugees going as far back as the Vietnam War, a tradition which continues to this day.\n\"According to the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement, Minnesota received 2,232 refugees from 24 countries during fiscal year 2014,\" the Minnesota Post wrote earlier this year.

Cruz has applied a \"religious test\" to judge which refugees to admit, in the words of the White House, telling reporters across South Carolina this weekend that he would admit all persecuted Christians to the U.S. but no persecuted Muslims.\nBut in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash on Monday, Cruz conceded that he would support measures to sift through the Christian refugees should ISIS militants try to disguise their identities.\n\"There is no doubt we would need to vet anyone coming in, but there is no indication that we have Muslims pretending to be Christians in the coming refugee wave,\" Cruz said before an event at the College of Charleston, concluding his three-day swing across the Palmetto State. \"If that develops to be a problem, then our first obligation should be protecting our national security.\"\nCruz, like other Republican hardliners, has argued that the risk of Islamic militants infiltrating the refugee population is too high for America to accept them with open arms. On the stump across South Carolina, Cruz argued that the percentage of refugees that are young men suggests that ISIS may look to take advantage of any relaxation of immigration laws.\nThe Texas senator instead thinks that Muslims fleeing the Syrian civil war should be repopulated to other Muslim countries. But the Christian population, he believes, has nowhere else to go, and Cruz batted away concerns by telling reporters in Myrtle Beach on Sunday that Christians posed \"no meaningful risk\" to national security.\nThat has made him vulnerable to charges of discrimination, both from liberal activists and the White House.\nCruz plans to introduce legislation in the Senate this week to cut off federal funding for refugee resettlement, allying himself with Ben Carson, perhaps Cruz's closest competitor in the presidential race. And he also said he supports governors who are closing their borders to the refugees.\n\"I was one of the very first to stake out this position. Now we're seeing more and more come over and agree with me,\" Cruz told Bash. \"And I think you're going to see more and more governors who say, 'I want to protect the citizens of my states and it doesn't make any sense for us to bring potential terrorists into this country'.\"\nThe Texas senator often tries to occupy a middle ground in foreign policy debates, bashing the nation-building, neoconservativism of the George W. Bush administration but being equally as critical of those who posit that America should abandon targeted military campaigns. For instance, Cruz does not support American intervention in Syria, instead calling for an offensive air operation and to arm the Kurds in the region.\nCruz's position on the \"religious test\" drew the scorn of President Barack Obama on Monday, which called out Cruz by name at a press conference and said his position was \"not American.\"\n\"It's not surprising that President Obama is attacking me personally,\" Cruz said. \"I'll tell you what is shameful is that we have a President that after 7 years still refuses to utter the words radical Islamic terrorism.\"\nObama's attack could be a political boon for a candidate energized by sparring with the White House from the pole position in the conservative movement. Cruz wouldn't quite go as far as his other conservative rival, Donald Trump, who suggested that some mosques should be closed, but Cruz's rhetoric on Monday is his latest try to race to the right on every issue in the GOP primary.\nWhat to do with the Syrian refugees is proving to be politically volatile. Just two hours after sitting down with Bash, Cruz met protestors at an event who heckled him loudly as he worked the crowd: \"We don't want a president who discriminates against Muslims!\" three young college students shouted at Cruz repeatedly for over 10 minutes. \"You can't let only Christians into the U.S.\"\n\"It's not Muslims, it's terrorists,\" one Cruz supporter volleyed back. \"Then go over to them and join them,\" yelled another.\nCruz, for his part, didn't seem rattled.\n\"I think it says something that speaking at a college campus, on the entire campus, only two protesters come out and yell,\" Cruz told CNN as he left the event. \"I'll take those numbers any day.\"", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Ted Cruz: Muslim refugees from Syria should go to other Islamic countries", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/17/politics/ted-cruz-refugees-syria/index.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Dana Bash", "Donald Trump", "George W.

Former Florida Gov.\nJeb Bush\nsounded a similar note, calling for special efforts to protect Christians in the region; never mind that\nIslamic State\njihadists\ntarget fellow Muslims with just as much viciousness\n.\nIt's preposterous that a serious contender for the presidency of the U.S. would bar war refugee status based on someone's religion. And the suggestion by GOP candidate\nBen Carson\nthat the U.S. bar all Syrian refugees for fear that a \"sleeper\" terrorist might slip in is an emotional, and ill-conceived, overreaction, as are pledges by several Republican governors to resist efforts to resettle refugees in their states.\nThe United States doesn't have the same challenge as Europe, whose relative proximity to the Middle Eastern war zone has left it inundated with millions of refugees. And the source isn't just Syria and Iraq; refugees \u2014 both political and economic \u2014 from Africa have landed in Europe as well. There are few good options for stopping that tide without first stabilizing the regions from which it arises; a political solution to the Syrian civil war is a crucial first step to achieving that stability.\nWe haven't faced this exodus simply because it is so much harder for Syrian refugees to arrive at the border and seek asylum. President Obama affirmed in Turkey on Tuesday that \"America has to step up and do its part\" in providing for war refugees, which presumably includes moving ahead with his plan to accept up to 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year, up from fewer than 2,000. This page has argued that the U.S. should take significantly more because there are too many for Europe to absorb and because of our history as a safe haven. Nothing in the Paris attacks changes that.\nThat's not to suggest that the U.S. should accept any and all comers. What the Republican candidates ignore, though, is that there is already a system in place to vet the refugees. To gain entry to the U.S., a Syrian refugee first must pass rigorous screening by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which verifies personal backgrounds and details before recommending individuals for resettlement to the United States. Then the Department of Homeland Security does its own screening before a refugee is granted entry and protection.\nIt makes sense to be prudent and diligent when accepting refugees from a region of such threat and instability. But it defies what the nation stands for to deny a safe haven for the persecuted based on their faith, nation of origin, or our fear.\nFollow the Opinion section on Twitter\n@latimesopinion\nand\nFacebook", "byline": "", "description": "<p>It was inevitable that the terrorism attacks in Paris last week would echo quickly through the U.S. presidential campaign.

President Barack Obama has said the U.S. will accept 10,000 refugees over the next year. Trump often cites a far higher figure \u2014 250,000 \u2014 that has no basis in fact. On Tuesday morning, Trump tweeted, \"Refugees from Syria are now pouring into our great country. Who knows who they are - some could be ISIS. Is our president insane?\"\nAt a rally in Knoxville, Tenn., on Monday, Trump said the refugees should stay within Syria. \"What I'd like is ... build a big beautiful safe zone and you have whatever it is so people can live, and they'll be happier,\" he said.\nIngraham said that she had spoken with Florida's Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, who told her his state is already hosting dozens of Syrian refugees because \u201ceverybody wants to come to Florida\u201d due to its low taxes and ample job opportunities.\n\u201cIn California, you have a Democrat as a governor; in Florida you have Rick Scott so they send them to the Republicans,\u201d Trump told Ingraham. \u201cTaking these people is absolutely insanity.\u201d\nAccording to the Associated Press, governors from both parties have accepted refugees, although the number is nearly double for GOP states. More than 1,000 Syrian refugees have been accepted into states with Republican governors since January 1, while just over 500 have moved to Democratic-led states. (The number of Republican governors outweighs Democrats, 31 to 18, however.)\nIngraham tried to steer Trump away from using exaggerated figures for the number of refugees, but he held firm. \u201cNo I\u2019m talking about now, I\u2019m talking about in terms of Syria. I\u2019ve heard numbers as high as 250,000 people.\u201d\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Trump: Obama sending refugees to Republican states", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/trump-obama-syria-refugees-215975", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "economy"], "people": ["Sara Solovitch", "Susan Rice", "Michael Hirsh", "Kate Tummarello", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "Marc Caputo", "Tim Starks", "Steven Shepard", "Barack Obama", "Jenny Hopkinson", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Jeffrey Gedmin", "Howard Dean", "Theodoric Meyer", "Loretta Lynch", "Annie Karni", "Josh Gerstein", "Shane Goldmacher", "Nick Gass", "Bernie Becker", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Laura Ingraham", "Andrew Glass", "Jeremy Herb", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Paul Ryan", "Brianna Ehley", "David Pittman", "Lauren French", "John Podesta", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Donald Trump", "Paul Lindsay", "Howard Fineman", "Rick Scott", "Ben White", "Alex Spence", "Darren Samuelsohn", "Victoria Guida", "Alex Byers", "Eric Wolff", "Ernest Moniz", "Edward Snowden", "Caitlin Emma"], "org": "politico", "election_confidence": 0.8489157262844512, "authors": [{"author_id": 30728, "fullname": "nick gass", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 17:23:35", "orgs": ["Washington And The World", "FDA", "Congress", "Amtrak", "Senate", "Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee", "PAC", "FCC", "College", "Senate GOP", "Congressional Black Caucus", "CMS", "GOP", "Tenn"], "article_id": "cd5e09b1b594c2a016aec6a4d83da2eb", "date_access": "2015-11-17 17:47:15.450367"}, {"body": "Once billed as a rising star in the Republican Party, Gov.

Mr. Jindal remained fiery on stump until the end, but his conservative message did not resonate in this cycle\u2019s crowded field.\nThe Beginning: Mr. Jindal kicked off his campaign in June in a suburb of New Orleans and touted his record as a two-term governor in the state. Framing himself as a social conservative who knows how to get things done, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had enough of talkers. It is time for a doer.\u201d\nThe Strategy: His poll numbers low from the beginning, Mr. Jindal set his sights on Iowa, hoping that the caucus state could propel his campaign forward. He managed to connect with the Hawkeye State\u2019s evangelical Christians at the July Family Leadership Summit and drew a loud ovation when he defended religious freedom. \u201cAmerica did not create religious liberty,\u201d Mr. Jindal said. \u201cReligious liberty created the United States of America.\u201d\nThe Policies: Mr. Jindal made repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act a hallmark of his candidacy, vowing to voters that he was the only one who could do it. He also looked to take the most conservative positions possible on most issues. In August he said at an education summit that mayors of \u201csanctuary cities\u201d should be prosecuted when undocumented immigrants commit crimes.\nThe Trump Factor: By September it was evident that Mr. Jindal\u2019s campaign was failing to catch on, and he took to loudly attacking Donald J. Trump in hopes of grabbing some of the spotlight. In a speech at the National Press Club, Mr. Jindal called Mr. Trump a \u201cnarcissist\u201d and an \u201cegomaniacal madman\u201d who had no principles. Mr. Jindal, a former Rhodes scholar, also said that Mr. Trump\u2019s hairstyle looked as if he were wearing a squirrel on his head.\nThe Debate: Mr. Jindal was relegated to the \u201cundercard\u201d in the Republican debates, and his frustration was clear. He threatened to skip the party\u2019s debate in late October, and in the most recent debate he spent most of his time attacking the record of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.\nThe End: Revealing his plans on Fox News, Mr. Jindal suspended his campaign on Nov. 17 and released a statement acknowledging, \u201cThis is not my time.\u201d", "byline": "ALAN RAPPEPORT", "description": "Once billed as a rising Republican star, Gov.

But Republican leaders say its passage underscores their message to other world leaders: Congress is not behind Obama's agenda, and a GOP president would most likely abandon his focus on climate change.\nStory Continued Below\nThe House is expected to approve a similar set of resolutions as early as Nov. 30, the first day of the Paris climate summit.\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Senate votes to reject Obama climate rule", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/senate-rejects-obama-climate-rule-215984", "topics": ["environment/energy"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kenneth P.

The Texas senator appeared in a Fox News segment reporting on the dilemma of what to do about refugees seeking asylum in the United States, and spoke generally about U.S. values.\n\"We have welcomed refugees, the tired huddled masses for centuries,\" he said during the two-and-a-half minute package about the broader situation. \"That\u2019s been the history of the United States. We should continue to do so,\"\nBy\nEliza Collins\nBut he also had a caveat: \u201cWe have to continue to be vigilant to make sure those coming are not affiliated with the terrorists, but we can do that.\"\nFast forward 21 months, with Syria's bloody civil war still raging and with fears stoked about ISIL fighters slipping into the U.S., Cruz is now saying he plans to introduce legislation that would bar Syrian refugees from entering the country.\n\"What Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are proposing is that we bring to this country tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees,\" Cruz told CNN. \"I have to say, particularly in light of what happened in Paris, that's nothing short of lunacy.\"\nHe also talked of taking the hardest line against Muslim Syrian refugees, while still allowing in displaced Christians whom he said do not pose a \"meaningful risk\" for committing acts of terror.\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who had positioned himself as a compassionate conservative on immigration who believes many people come illegally to the U.S. as an \"act of love,\" has also been shifting his tone since last week's attacks.\nSpeaking before a New Hampshire town hall in September, Bush said about the Syrian refugees: \"People are leaving not just because they are immigrants looking for a better life. They are leaving because, if not, they will die. It's that simple. And we have to play a role in providing support.\"\nOn Sunday, as talk of the attacks dominated the morning shows, Bush didn\u2019t call for halting the administration\u2019s plans, but said he would prioritize Christians over other refugees.\nBy\nJake Sherman\n\u201cI do think we have a responsibility to help with refugees after proper screening, and I think our focus ought to be on the Christians, who have no place in Syria anymore,\u201d he told CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \u201cThey\u2019re being beheaded, they\u2019re being executed by both sides.\u201d He added, \"We should focus our efforts as it relates to refugees on the Christians that are being slaughtered.\"\nBut after Obama on Monday appeared to lump Bush in with Cruz for imposing an inhumane \"religious test,\" the former Florida governor clarified in an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday that he didn't want to discriminate against Muslim refugees.\n\"There's no discrimination to simply say that you want to protect religious minorities that are being exterminated,\" he said.\nThe subtlety in Bush's way of speaking on the issue was nowhere in Chris Christie's response.\nThe New Jersey governor, in the days after the image of the drowned Syrian boy shocked the world, said a solution needed to be found to help the refugees.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d sit down with our allies and figure out how we can help, because America is a compassionate country. We saw the image of that 4-year-old little boy drowned in Syria, and we can\u2019t have those kinds of things,\u201d Christie said on \"Fox and Friends.\" \u201cI can\u2019t come up with an exact number. You\u2019d have to sit with our allies and work together.\u201d\nOn Monday, as governor, Christie put his foot down, and even took a hard line against young orphans.\n\"I do not trust this administration to effectively vet the people who are proposed to be coming in, in order to protect the safety and security of the American people, so I would not permit them in,\" he said on Hugh Hewitt's radio program.\n\"What if they were orphans under the age of five?\" Hewitt asked.\n\"You know, Hugh, we can come up with 18 different scenarios. The fact is that we need appropriate vetting, and I don\u2019t think orphans under five are being, you know, should be admitted into the United States at this point,\" he said. \"But you know, they have no family here. How are we going to care for these folks? The fact is you can come up with a number of different scenarios, Hugh. But in the end, I don\u2019t trust this administration to effectively vet the people that they\u2019re asking us to take in. We need to put the safety and security of the American people first.\"\nOn Tuesday, Christie formally notified Obama in a letter that he would not accept any Syrian refugees, in New Jersey.\nBy\nNahal Toosi\nDonald Trump, who has made his strident stances on immigration a central case for his presidency, has also taken a hard line against Syrian refugees. But he wasn't always talking that way.\nIn September, Trump told Bill O'Reilly about taking in the refugees, \"I hate the concept of it, but on a humanitarian basis, you have to.\"\nBut that tone quickly dissipated, and the billionaire businessman told supporters later that month that the refugees \"are going back,\" warning that they represent a potential \"Trojan horse\" for terrorists. Trump has instead advocated the construction of \"a big beautiful safe zone\" in Syria, as he told supporters in Knoxville, Tennessee, on Monday.\nAnother Republican who has changed his tone as the devastating images of refugees have been overtaken by the fallout from the Paris attacks is Marco Rubio.\nWhile he has battled critics who say his 2013 attempt at immigration reform casts doubt on his conservative credentials, the Florida senator in September told a CNN reporter at a South Carolina town hall that his administration would \"be potentially open to the relocation of some of these individuals at some point in time to the United States.\"\nBut on Sunday, Rubio said the doors must shut to more refugees.\n\"The problem is not the background checks. The problem is we can\u2019t background check them. You can\u2019t pick up the phone and call Syria. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why I said we won\u2019t be able to take more refugees,\" Rubio said on ABC's \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos.\"\n\"It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want to, it\u2019s that we can\u2019t,\" he explained, adding that there is also a threat of home-grown violent extremists, those \"who had been radicalized online.\"\nJohn Kasich, meanwhile, joined on Monday the growing list of governors who said they would no longer accept refugees, an about-face from September.\nBack then, Kasich told Fox News' \"Hannity\" that he \"wouldn\u2019t say to these people, \u2018You can\u2019t come in,'\" pointing to it as a place of cooperation between the U.S. and its European allies, whom he said should largely bear that issue.\n\"And I think at this point, I would actually welcome the Congress to weigh in and make sure that we have a procedure that can verify who these people are,\" Kasich added, in a preview of the Capitol Hill fight to come. \"I mean, there\u2019s nobody in this country that would want somebody connected to ISIS to be able could come in here.\"\nOn Tuesday, speaking in Washington, Kasich said he now believes an influx of Syrian refugees poses an unacceptable risk: \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m saying is for right now, until we get a handle on where we are, we need to stop.\u201d\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "After the Paris attacks, the Republican field is taking a tougher stance against the refugees.", "title": "GOP candidates were for Syrian refugees before they were against them", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/gop-2016-syria-refugees-215978", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kenneth P.

McCaskill\n11/17/15 05:03 PM EST\nTwo of Ben Carson's own top advisers are knocking his ability to grasp foreign policy despite aggressive tutoring sessions, according to a report in The New York Times.\nThe retired neurosurgeon has bobbled a number of foreign policy issues in recent days, claiming that China has a military presence in Syria and struggling on \"Fox News Sunday\" to name allies he would seek out to create an international military coalition to combat Islamic State,\nStory Continued Below\nNow, two of his advisers told The New York Times in interviews that Carson is having trouble absorbing facts on international affairs.\n\u201cNobody has been able to sit down with him and have him get one iota of intelligent information about the Middle East,\u201d said Duane Clarridge, a top adviser to Carson on terrorism and national security. Carson needs weekly foreign policy briefings to \u201cmake him smart,\u201d added Clarridge, a longtime CIA agent who is seen as a colorful figure.\nBy\nJake Sherman\nArmstrong Williams, one of Carson's lead advisers and closest friends, also expressed frustration to the newspaper about the \"Fox News Sunday\" interview. \u201cHe\u2019s been briefed on it so many times,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess he just froze.\u201d\nCarson's campaign has spent a good amount of energy trying to compensate for his comment in last week's debate in which he suggested China is involved in the conflict in Syria. \u201cWe also must recognize that it\u2019s a very complex place,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, the Chinese are there, as well as the Russians, and you have all kinds of factions there.\u201d\nThe White House dismissed the notion that the Chinese are in Syria, but Carson stood by his comment. His campaign subsequently said he was referring to Chinese military weapons and equipment.\nBut Clarridge told The New York Times that Carson relied on a freelance American intelligence operative in Iraq who \"overleaped\" in implying that Chinese troops are in Syria.\nThe Carson campaign pushed back on the article, saying the paper took advantage of an \"elderly gentleman.\"\nBy\nEli Stokols\n\"Mr. Clarridge has incomplete knowledge of the daily, not weekly briefings, that Dr. Carson receives on important national security matters from former military and State Department officials,\" Doug Watts, a Carson campaign spokesman, told Business Insider in an email. \"He is coming to the end of a long career of serving our country. Mr. Clarridge's input to Dr. Carson is appreciated but he is clearly not one of Dr. Carson's top advisors. For the New York Times to take advantage of an elderly gentleman and use him as their foil in this story is an affront to good journalistic practices.\"\nDespite publicly aired doubts about Carson's ability to master foreign policy issues, voters still rank him relatively high in the GOP field on the topic. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Tuesday, 20 percent of Republican voters surveyed say Donald Trump is best suited to handle terrorism, followed by Florida Sen.

But now, after the terrorist attacks on an American ally, Republican elders think their party\u2019s flirtation with inexperience is nearing its end.\nThe reemergence of foreign policy atop the Republican agenda will force voters to reevaluate the outsider candidates, particularly as both Trump and Carson display a lack of knowledge about national security and the terrorist threat, party stalwarts said.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cThe losers are going to be Donald Trump and Ben Carson on national security,\u201d said Katon Dawson, the former chairman of the South Carolina GOP. \u201cAs the Republican base sobers up, they are the two, if this story lasts a long time, it's going to hurt.\"\nIndeed, in interviews with current and former GOP chairs, veteran operatives, lobbyists and strategists, the long-held conviction that neither Trump nor Carson will win the Republican nomination has only strengthened since the attacks in Paris last week.\nFred Malek, who has advised multiple Republican presidents and is not affiliated with any contender this cycle, said the inexperience Trump and Carson reveal in their rhetoric will drive GOP primary voters toward another candidate.\nBy\nEli Stokols\n\u201cThe severity of the attacks in Paris crystallize in people\u2019s minds the importance of having somebody in the commander-in-chief spot who has made the kinds of decisions, gone through the kind of decision-making process, that an experienced leader has,\u201d Malek said.\nCarson in particular is vulnerable on security and foreign policy issues, Republican leaders say. The pediatric neurosurgeon, who has no previous political experience, has already stunned with a meandering answer about the Middle East in last week\u2019s debate, before the attacks. He drew criticism in an earlier debate for suggesting that American brainpower was a substitute for military force and he shocked many by saying he had intelligence that the White House did not about Chinese forces engaging in Syria.\nWorse yet for the candidate, two of Carson\u2019s senior advisors on Tuesday told The New York Times, on the record, that their candidate was struggling to understand the Middle East. Intense tutoring, they told the paper, was having little effect.\nCarson has tried to correct course in recent days. On Friday, he said his message to Vladimir Putin is, \u201cWe are a peaceful country, but we are not a marshmallow.\u201d On Monday, on social media and in a press conference, sought to highlight his plan to take on ISIS and articulate a broader, more cogent foreign policy.\nBut GOP insiders say they aren't impressed, and think the foreign policy shift will take a visible toll on Carson, especially in next month\u2019s debate, which many expect will be filled with security questions.\n\u201cCarson I\u2019m not so worried about,\u201d said Fergus Cullen, the former chairman of the New Hampshire GOP who puts his overall concern level about Trump and Carson at a five, on a scale of 10. \u201cI respect him for his accomplishments in life, but he is completely unprepared to be president of the United States, and that will take care of itself at the polls.\u201d\nBy\nNolan D. McCaskill\nThe more exposure he gets, said Doug Gross, a longtime Iowa Republican, the more it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s \u201cnot ready to be president. Just from a policy standpoint, he\u2019s not prepared to deal with issues.\u201d\nLongtime Republicans don\u2019t have nearly as clear a theory of Trump\u2019s downfall.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always easier to predict how this ends up than how [we] get there,\u201d said Stuart Stevens, who was Mitt Romney\u2019s chief strategist. But as for Trump, \u201cI don\u2019t think he wins a single primary\u2026 I think he gets out.\u201d\nOthers agree that he will falter, even as some acknowledge that all predictions of his demise have been wrong thus far. Truly, Trump\u2019s resilience -- even after attacking prisoners of war, immigrants and even Iowans -- has flummoxed and alarmed party leaders.\nForeign policy-minded GOP veterans call Trump an amateur on the issue and say he should be pressed for more policy specifics. But they acknowledge that the fresh focus on security will not be as damaging in the short term to Trump, who can better rouse crowds with his \u201cbomb-the-sh**-out-of-ISIS\u201d rhetoric, as it is to Carson.\nYet, these party leaders and strategists said there\u2019s no feeling of panic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early for anyone to be hand-wringing about any particular candidate,\u201d said Matt Strawn, the former chairman of the Iowa GOP, speaking more broadly but offering a sentiment shared by many interviewed. \u201cBoth Iowa and New Hampshire historically make their decisions late.\u201d\nWhile Republican insiders argue that nominating Trump would lose the GOP the White House, they maintain that it\u2019s a nightmare that will never come to pass.\n\"If this was the middle of March and we had a Republican candidate racking up win after win after win in states and we looked like we were free falling into losing not only the White House but also the Senate and seats in the House, yeah, there would be every reason for the party to be deeply concerned about the direction of the country,\" said Henry Barbour, a Republican National Committeeman from Mississippi. \u201cBut it's November.\u201d\nExperienced operatives keep adjusting the timeline for Trump\u2019s decline: several months ago, some campaigns and Republican insiders said the debate would get more serious around Thanksgiving and hurt his standing in the polls but now they\u2019re looking out to January, even February.\n\u201cI\u2019m not totally discounting that this is a real problem,\u201d said Cullen, who now acknowledges he could see Trump winning some early contests. \u201cBut I also think that in the fullness of time this will eventually work itself out.\u201d\nBy\nNahal Toosi\nBut most of the Republicans interviewed said Trump in particular doesn\u2019t have the organization or appeal to last deep into the cycle (not to mention that should he show signs of actually winning any contests, plenty of Republicans are prepared to write big checks to a Stop Trump campaign).\n\u201cI\u2019m not too worried about it,\u201d said Charlie Black, another longtime adviser to Republican presidents and presidential campaigns. \u201cTrump\u2019s been losing a little steam since Labor Day, when he was up around 30, now he\u2019s in the low 20s. Carson is as high as he\u2019ll ever be, just because he\u2019s beginning to demonstrate he doesn\u2019t have real good knowledge of the issues. Either of them might win a primary or something, but that\u2019s it.\u201d\nOne indication of impending panic would be a mad scramble to organize an explicit anti-Trump effort. Dawson, who had been looking to form just such a super PAC, hasn\u2019t found a donor yet.\n\"I specifically did not find the right donor to get me to go to that effort. And then Trump's numbers started moving down, from the 30s to the 20s,\" Dawson said.\nThis all changes as the primaries near. If Trump is still on track to win one of the first four voting states, the GOP establishment will face perhaps its final moment to rally around another candidate.\n\u201cThe (Paris) attacks proved that a month is an infinite amount of political time, and that the shape of a campaign can flip dramatically in an instant,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a veteran Republican who served in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cAnd for that reason I believe it's a fair reading of the evidence to say that people don't get serious until, if, and when they vote. And so I want to see what the polls in New Hampshire look like a week, three days, the day before the actual primaries are held...If Donald is at 42 percent in New Hampshire a day before the primary, you may see the establishment freak out. But I don't think today.\u201d\nThe Trump and Carson campaigns would not comment for this story.\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "GOP leaders: National security will end Carson and Trump campaigns", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/republicans-ben-carson-donald-trump-security-215999", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kenneth P.

As of this morning, CNN put the count at 27, with only seven governors, all Democrats, saying their states will welcome the Syrians. President Obama likely helped catalyze this cross-country revolt with a dreadful performance in a press conference yesterday at Antalya, Turkey.\nThe president came off as impassive as he discussed last week\u2019s attacks in Paris. He turned prickly under repeated questioning about his own underestimation of the Islamic State\u2014which he denied, even when a reporter mentioned his January 2014 dismissal of the group as \u201cthe jayvee team.\u201d\nBut he got passionate when the subject turned to Republicans who disagree with him on the refugee question:\nBut Yahoo! News\u2019s Michael Isikoff last week reported that the administration is in fact on the verge of imposing just the sort of \u201creligious test\u201d the president claims to disavow:\nThe Yazidi are a religious minority whose faith \u201cincorporates elements of Christianity and Islam.\u201d\n\u201cA genocide designation would have significant policy implications for American efforts to restore property and lands taken from the minority groups and for offers of aid, asylum, and other protections to such victims,\u201d the Hudson Institute\u2019s Nina Shea writes for National Review. Christians are not being considered for the genocide designation, Shea notes, although they are \u201calso among the most vulnerable religious minority groups that have been deliberately and mercilessly targeted for eradication by ISIS.\u201d\nSo Obama\u2019s objection is not to \u201creligious tests\u201d per se, but to favorable treatment of Christians. It is of a piece with his February speech to the National Prayer Breakfast, in which he bizarrely lectured Christians to get off their \u201chigh horse\u201d and remember the Crusades, while also claiming that ISIS and other Muslim terrorists are \u201cbetraying\u201d Islam.\nApprehension about admitting Muslim Syrian refugees is motivated by fear. It is \u201cThe Return of Republican Islamophobia,\u201d according to the title of a piece yesterday by New York magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait. He writes that \u201cfigures like Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush are calling for the United States to admit only Christian refugees, thereby positioning the United States as indifferent to ISIS\u2019s primary victims,\u201d by which he means Muslims. So are Yazidis secondary victims and Christians tertiary ones, or the other way around? Chait doesn\u2019t say.\nBut a phobia is an irrational fear, and the attacks in Paris are nothing if not a reminder that fear of Islamic terrorism is rational. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that one of the Paris attackers came in as part of the wave of Syrian refugees:\nReuters reported this morning that \u201cGerman police have detained an Algerian man in a refugee reception centre in connection with the attacks in Paris.\u201d\nThe Obama administration plans to admit some 10,000 Syrian refugees next year. At Saturday\u2019s debate, Hillary Clinton and Martin O\u2019Malley both said they\u2019d like to make it 65,000. \u201cAccommodating 65,000 refugees in our country today, people of 320 million, is akin to making room for 6\u00bd more people in a baseball stadium with 32,000,\u201d said O\u2019Malley.\nThe problem, however, is not one of numbers. If even a handful of terrorists were among the 10,000 or 65,000 admitted, that would be enough to cause carnage and serious disruption. As the president himself observed during yesterday\u2019s press conference: \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about the ability of a handful of people .\u00a0.\u00a0. who are willing to die, they can kill a lot of people.\u201d\nProponents of admitting Syrian refugees acknowledge the importance of vetting them. \u201cEven as we accept more refugees\u2014including Syrians\u2014we do so only after subjecting them to rigorous screening and security checks,\u201d Obama said in his opening statement yesterday. In the debate, Mrs. Clinton said that \u201cwe should go to 65 [thousand] but only if we have as carefully screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes.\u201d\nIn an interview yesterday with radio host Hugh Hewitt, New Jersey\u2019s Gov. Chris Christie\u2014one of those who\u2019ve said their states won\u2019t accept refugees\u2014made the obvious point in response: \u201cI do not trust this administration to effectively vet the people who are proposed to be coming in, in order to protect the safety and security of the American people.\u201d\nWe have no specialized knowledge here, but it seems to us that Christie easily has the better of this argument. To put it mildly, administrative competence has not been the hallmark of this administration. Obama has presided over, among other things, the abuses at the Internal Revenue Service, the Chinese hacking of millions of federal employees\u2019 private records, and the scandal at the Veterans Administration. His administration could not even design a properly functioning website for its central ideological vanity project, the federal health-insurance exchange. It seems crazy to place one\u2019s faith in its ability to do better even than the Greeks in vetting refugees.\nUSA Today points out that the governors have little formal authority to keep the feds from resettling refugees in their state:\nIt\u2019s certainly political, but resistance from governors in a majority of states\u2014including 11 states Obama carried in 2012, and including one Democrat, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, who is seeking a U.S. Senate seat\u2014it\u2019s more than posturing. This is not just a national-security crisis but a developing political crisis for the president and his party.\nWhy Do Bad Things Always Happen to Him?   \u201cMANILA, Philippines\u2014After years of red-eye flights across the Pacific and marathon summits, President Obama had hoped to arrive in this Southeast Asian capital and tout progress in his seven-year charm offensive in Asia: His campaign to move away from the cycle of crisis in the Middle East and toward the rising region was finally yielding results. Instead, the president was due to land Philippines Tuesday amid a fresh crisis\u2014a reminder of the trouble that has dogged his \u2018Asia rebalance\u2019 from its inception. The terrorist attacks in Paris and talk of reprisals for the Islamic State quickly threatened to overshadow Obama\u2019s good-news tour to the Philippines and Malaysia this week.\u201d\u2014Kathleen Hennessey, Associated Press, Nov.\u00a016\nMission Accomplished\nTwo Young-Adult Websites in One!\nFox Butterfield, Is That You?\nOut on a Limb   \u201cIf Donald Trump Is the Problem, Mitt Romney Isn\u2019t the Solution\u201d\u2014headline, FiveThirtyEight.com, Nov.\u00a016\nWhat Would We Do Without Experts?   \u201cSave Some Money, Experts Say Don\u2019t Buy Organic Produce\u201d\u2014headline, KXAN-TV website (Austin, Texas), Nov.\u00a017\nHe\u2019s Just Not That Into You   \u201cObama on His ISIS Strategy: I\u2019m Not Interested in \u2018American Leadership, or America Winning\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014headline, Federalist, Nov.\u00a016\nLongest Books Ever Written   \u201cAll the Questionable Statements on Defense From Saturday\u2019s Democratic Debate\u201d\u2014headline, Jalopnik.com, Nov.\u00a016\nProblem and Solution\u2014I\nProblem and Solution\u2014II\nThe Soft Bigotry of Low Expectations   \u201cAnyway, the results are in: Ruth Bader Ginsburg is more fun than Gloria Steinem.\u201d\u2014blogress Ann Althouse, Nov.\u00a016\n21st-Century Jobs   \u201cLocal Kids Learn to Give Heroin Antidote\u201d\u2014headline, Courier-Journal (Lexington, Ky.), Nov.\u00a017\nHey, Kids!

The group voted at its annual meeting in Atlanta to support a ban.\n\"Direct-to-consumer advertising also inflates demand for new and more expensive drugs, even when those drugs may not be appropriate,\" AMA Board Chair-elect Patrice Harris said in a statement.\nThe United States and New Zealand are the only two countries that allow direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs.\nAMA said drugmakers' spending on advertising has shot up 30 percent in the last two years to $4.5 billion. TV commercials for drugs such as Bristol-Myers Squibb's lung cancer medicine Opdivo and Gilead Sciences' Hepatitis C treatment Harvoni were among this year's ad campaigns.\nU.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has  proposed cracking down on direct-to-consumer advertising and other measures to stop what she called \"price gouging\" by pharmaceutical companies. Clinton's plan would prevent companies from deducting what they spend on direct-to-consumer ads from their tax bills.\nA series of court decisions has determined the ads cannot be banned outright because they are a form of commercial speech protected by the U.S. Constitution. The AMA did not address how the ban could be accomplished without being overturned in court.\nPhRMA, the largest U.S. trade group for the pharmaceutical industry, said the ads increase consumer awareness of available treatments for diseases, including undiagnosed conditions.\n\"Providing scientifically accurate information to patients so that they are better informed about their health care and treatment options is the goal of direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising about prescription medicines,\" PhRMA spokesman Tina Stow said in an email.\nAccording to a U.S. Food and Drug Administration analysis this year, 52 percent of Americans believe direct-to-consumer ads do not have enough information about risks and 46 percent say the ads lack information about benefits.\n(Reporting by Susan Kelly in Chicago; additional reporting by Bill Berkrot in New York; Editing by David Gregorio)", "byline": "", "description": "(Reuters) - The American Medical Association on Tuesday called for a ban on advertising prescription drugs and medical devices directly to consumers, saying the ads drive patients to demand expensive treatments over less costly ones that are also effective.", "title": "U.S. doctor group calls for ban on drug advertising to consumers", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/healthNews/~3/8RgygqQzitc/story01.htm", "topics": ["health", "trade"], "people": ["David Gregorio", "Hillary Clinton", "Bill Berkrot"], "org": "reuters", "election_confidence": 0.5167323907204779, "authors": [{"author_id": 35968, "fullname": "susan kelly", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 23:37:50", "orgs": ["AMA", "U.S. Constitution", "American Medical Association"], "article_id": "e909128eab03afeb4be0e334d74413d5", "date_access": "2015-11-18 00:08:58.143393"}, {"body": "There is only one Hindu in Congress and she is a Democrat. But as of Tuesday, there will be a Republican Hindu Coalition, comprised of Indian Americans looking to amplify their voice in U.S. politics.\nThe group, which formally launches Tuesday evening, isn\u2019t aimed at bolstering the ranks of Hindus across the aisle from Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii). Instead, the coalition is focused on advancing conservative policies important to the Republican Hindu community, including fiscal discipline, expanded trade, and forceful defense, said its founder Shalabh Kumar. Mr. Kumar is the chief executive of AVG Group, a cluster of electronics-related companies.\nMr. Kumar said he modeled the group after the Republican Jewish Coalition, after attending its annual conference and leaving impressed by its influence on conservative policy toward Israel.\n\u201cI was sort of surprised at the way it caught fire,\u201d Mr. Kumar said of his idea. \u201cI went to my friend who I consider to be the smartest man on this earth, [former House] Speaker Newt Gingrich. Before I said more than two sentences, he said, \u2018Great idea!\u2019\u201d Mr. Gingrich is the group\u2019s honorary chairman.\nMr. Kumar, an electronics engineer who was a Democrat before being convinced by former President Ronald Reagan on the campaign trail to become a Republican, is investing $2 million of his own funds. The political action committee connected to the coalition plans to raise at least $5 million, with the goal of raising $10 million for next year\u2019s elections, he said.\nThe wealth of the Indian-American community may help explain why the coalition\u2019s launch is drawing an all-star roster of Republicans, with appearances expected by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R., Calif.) and other influential GOP lawmakers.\nIn 2010, the median annual household income for Indian Americans was $88,000, higher than the $66,000 median for all Asian Americans and the $49,800 median of all U.S. households, according to the Pew Research Center. Indian Americans are also among the most highly-educated ethnic groups, with 70% of those 25 or older possessing a college degree. (About half of Indian Americans are Hindu, but more than 90% of all Asian-American Hindus have Indian heritage, according to Pew.)\nMr. Kumar said the coalition will be advocating for tighter federal spending, an overhaul of the legal immigration system, and boosted trade with India. It will also be making its voice known on foreign policy issues. The group could break with conservative Republicans over some issues, including the Export-Import Bank. Mr. Kumar backs reauthorizing the agency, which provides financing and other support to U.S. exporters and has become a favored target of conservative groups, which view it as corporate welfare.\nThe group and its political action committee will also work to register voters and boost turnout among Indian Americans.\n______________________________________________________\n2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll Standings\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.\nCapital Journal Daybreak Newsletter: Sign up to get the latest on politics, policy and defense delivered to your inbox every morning.\nFor the latest Washington news, follow @wsjpolitics\nFor outside analysis, follow @wsjthinktank", "byline": "", "description": "There is only one Hindu in Congress and she is a Democrat.
