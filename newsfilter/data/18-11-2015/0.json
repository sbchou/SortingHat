David Vitter\u2019s campaign has launched an attack ad blasting his Democratic opponent, John Bel Edwards, for his support of the administration\u2019s plan to resettle 10,000 Syrian refugees in the U.S.\nFollowing the terror attacks that struck Paris on Friday, more than two dozen Republican governors have voiced opposition to accepting Syrian refugees into their states.

John Bel Edwards has pledged to work with Obama to bring Syrian refugees to Louisiana.\u201d\nThe 30-second ad closes with a clip of Edwards saying, \u201cI supported the president,\u201d with the narrator concluding, \u201cHe always does.\u201d\nEdwards responded with a Facebook post accusing Vitter of \u201cbombarding\u201d voters with lies about his position. \u201cMany of you have expressed concern about how to respond to this, the most recent example of his deceptiveness,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have clearly and openly called for a complete stop to the entry of refugees to Louisiana. This is a shameful and desperate attempt by David to distort my position as well as my record as the only candidate with military experience.\u201d\nEdwards said he will stay in contact with law enforcement regarding the 14 refugees already in Louisiana but asked who voters trust more: \u201ca West Point graduate and former Army Ranger or David Vitter, who continues to lie to us in order to divide us?\u201d he added. \u201cThe choice is STILL clear, Louisiana.\u201d\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Vitter hits Edwards with ad knocking his support for Syrian refugees", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/david-vitter-john-edwards-syria-215969", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "economy"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Susan Rice", "Kenneth P.

But the idea that we'd turn away refugees because of religion is a new low,\" Clinton said.\nThe tweet comes after Sen. Ted Cuz said the United States should deny entry to Muslim refugees from Syria, but leave the door open to fleeing Christians. Allowing tens of thousands of Syrian Muslims into the country was \"nothing short of lunacy,\" the Texas senator said, citing concerns that terrorists may be among the refugees.\nA similar statement on religion was made by Florida governor Jeb Bush, who told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union\" Sunday that the U.S. should only accept Christian refugees.\n\"We should focus our efforts as it relates to refugees on the Christians that are being slaughtered,\" Bush said.\nRELATED: Donald Trump: 'Strongly consider' shutting mosques\nIn Saturday's second Democratic debate, Clinton supported accepting refugees, but called for \"as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine.\" Clinton, who has previously stated that the U.S. should accept as many as 65,000 new refugees, said \"I do not want us to in any way inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.\"\nAlmost all the major GOP candidates have taken a stance against allowing Syrian refugees to come to the United States, along with other Republican leaders.\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, at least 30 U.S. governors have said that they will not accept refugees form Syria. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Monday that the government is still \"steadfastly committed\" to admitting 10,000 Syrian refugees in 2016. He also said federal officials are taking \"seriously\" the states' concerns, and that he's not sure whether they have the legal authority to block the resettlements.\nCNN's MJ Lee, Eric Bradner, Ted Barrett, Diedre Walsh and Dan Merica contributed to this report", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Clinton: GOP's 'hateful rhetoric' on refugees 'a new low'", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/17/politics/hillary-clinton-gop-syrian-refugees/index.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Ted Barrett", "Eric Bradner", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Donald Trump", "Mark Toner", "Jake Tapper", "Dan Merica"], "org": "cnn", "election_confidence": 0.8658779151379163, "authors": [{"author_id": 41109, "fullname": "heather goldin", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 20:32:02", "orgs": ["State Department", "GOP"], "article_id": "2559c8d6675596c175c2527ca027f015", "date_access": "2015-11-17 21:01:41.946741"}, {"body": "The giant and politically influential Service Employees International Union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s endorsement of Hillary Clinton\u00c2\u00a0Tuesday\u00c2\u00a0gives the Democratic front-runner her 13th\u00c2\u00a0nod from a national labor union, underscoring the growing strength of her campaign.\nMrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief Democratic rival Bernie Sanders has received just two endorsements from national labor unions,\u00c2\u00a0reflecting the challenge ahead for the Vermont senator who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also trailing Mrs. Clinton in polls.\nWith SEIU\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backing, Mrs. Clinton has secured support from many of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest labor unions, including the National Education Association and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. The unions that have endorsed Mrs. Clinton collectively represent well over half of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 14.6 million union members in 2014.\nSEIU, which has nearly two million members, said it chose to support Mrs. Clinton because she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a leader who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll fight to raise wages and stand up for working people. The union also said she values the kind of care work that many SEIU members do daily, including the work of home-care aides who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been fighting for higher minimum pay.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSEIU members and working families across America are part of a growing movement to build a better future for their families, and Hillary Clinton will support and stand with them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s President Mary Kay Henry said in a statement\u00c2\u00a0Tuesday.\nSEIU said it spent months\u00c2\u00a0gauging its members\u00e2\u0080\u0099 support of the candidates, including through polls and tele-town hall meetings. Mrs. Clinton consistently received more than 72% of members\u00e2\u0080\u0099 support, an SEIU spokesman said.\nThat wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough to stop a backlash on social media\u00c2\u00a0Tuesday\u00c2\u00a0from disgruntled SEIU members who back Mr. Sanders. Members of a group called SEIU for Bernie had been voicing concern for weeks that an endorsement of Mrs. Clinton could undermine the Fight for $15 campaign. The SEIU-funded wage campaign began with New York fast-food workers and has evolved into a nationwide push for a $15 federal minimum wage. The campaign is also trying to use the wage issue to build a bloc of like-minded voters for the 2016 elections.\u00c2\nMr. Sanders backs a $15 federal minimum wage while Mrs. Clinton has said she supports a federal minimum of $12. When asked last week whether that would affect SEIU\u00e2\u0080\u0099s endorsement process, the union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president Ms. Henry suggested there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room for improvement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor us, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about driving the movement alongside of the candidates,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in an interview.\nFor its part, the Sanders campaign sought to downplay the union endorsements for Mrs. Clinton, focusing instead on the support it has received from rank-and-file union members.\n\u201cWe are gratified that hundreds of thousands of workers are part of the growing grassroots movement supporting Bernie\u2019s campaign to help working families by raising the minimum wage, providing health care for all and making college affordable,\u201d said Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign.\n______________________________________________________\n2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll Standings\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.\nCapital Journal Daybreak Newsletter: Sign up to get the latest on politics, policy and defense delivered to your inbox every morning.\nFor the latest Washington news, follow @wsjpolitics\nFor outside analysis, follow @wsjthinktank", "byline": "", "description": "The giant and politically influential Service Employees International Union\u2019s endorsement of Hillary Clinton Tuesday gives the Democratic front-runner her 13th nod from a national labor union, underscoring the growing strength of her campaign.", "title": "SEIU\u2019s Clinton Nod Signals Campaign\u2019s Momentum Growing", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/17/seius-clinton-nod-signals-campaigns-momentum-growing/", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "health"], "people": ["Mary Kay Henry", "Bernie Sanders", "Hillary Clinton", "Michael Briggs"], "org": "wsj", "election_confidence": 0.8321429190264561, "authors": [{"author_id": 2297, "fullname": "melanie trottman", "primary_org": "wsj"}], "date_written": "2015-11-18 01:03:47", "orgs": ["Service Employees International Union", "National Education Association", "SEIU", "WSJ", "Clintonas", "Capital Journal", "American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees"], "article_id": "2f430655e6cca0f17f0cbee3282d955a", "date_access": "2015-11-18 01:59:39.697391"}, {"body": "I would\u2019ve enjoyed campaigning against Trump.

Reporters Allie Jones and Sam Biddle will head out on the campaign trail; Ashley Feinberg will monitor the \"hilarious lunatic fringes and the right and left,\" while Tom Scocca and Pareene will get regular columns.\n\"Gawker won\u2019t just do horse-race coverage, of course\u2014it will take a Daily Show approach to covering the ever-intensifying culture wars, documenting, satirizing, and reporting on the ways that political disputes are refracted in every aspect of our popular culture,\" Cook wrote. \"Gawker\u2019s biggest stories have always had a political component, from Toronto\u2019s crack-smoking mayor to Roger Ailes\u2019 paranoia and power to Josh Duggar\u2019s rank hypocrisy. Pareene is doubling down on that tradition.\"\nIt's a coming home of sorts for Pareene, who first started at Gawker's Wonkette, the D.C. media and politics gossip site which the company subsequently sold in 2008\nThe move will also result in layoffs at the company, though the same number of jobs will be created, according to the New York Times which first broke the news.\nIn a separate memo to staff, Gawker founder and CEO Nick Denton said politics have provided \"the scene for some of Gawker's most recognized\" stories, including those about former Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, Fox News, Hillary Clinton's email practices and Bill Clinton's travels with a convicted pedophile.\nAlex Pareene\u2019s Gawker will ride the circus of the 2016 campaign cycle, seizing the opportunity to re-orient its editorial scope on political news, commentary and satire.\n\"Is there any doubt that the 2016 US presidential election campaign, a contest between reality-defying fabulists and the last representatives of two exhausted political dynasties, will provide rich new opportunities for sensation and satire?\" Cook wrote. \"I can appreciate the wonky contrarianism of Ezra Klein\u2019s Vox.com and high-metabolism micronews from Ben Smith\u2019s Buzzfeed Politics. But, more than any other facet of the American system, the politico-media blob begs puncturing by some sharp Gawker wit and probing by Gawker\u2019s inquisitive journalists.\"\nDeveloping....\nHadas Gold is a reporter at\u00a0Politico.\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Gawker Media plans to shift the focus of its flagship site Gawker.com to politics, editors at the company announced in memos to staff on Tuesday.", "title": "Gawker refocusing aim to politics", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2015/11/gawker-refocusing-aim-to-politics-215987", "topics": ["economy"], "people": ["Roger Ailes", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Ben Smith", "Josh Duggar", "Kenneth P.

Allowing tens of thousands of \"Syrian Muslims\" into the country was \"nothing short of lunacy,\" the Texas senator said, because there is no way to know who among them may be terrorists. \"It is a different situation with the Middle Eastern Christians,\" Cruz said in South Carolina.\nRepublicans to Obama: Keep Syrian refugees out\nJeb Bush echoed that view, saying U.S. efforts to assist refugees should focus on Christians.\n\"I do think there is a special important need to make sure that Christians from Syria are being protected because they are being slaughtered in the country,\" Bush said on CBS on Sunday. \"And but for us, who?\"\nDonald Trump, the Republican Party's months-long front-runner, declared that he would strongly consider closing down mosques. \"You're going to have to watch and study the mosques,\" Trump said on MSNBC Tuesday.\nMeanwhile, Republicans have mocked Democrats for refusing to label \"radical Islam\" as the enemy and force behind ISIS. Marco Rubio attacked Hillary Clinton for rejecting the term at the Democratic debate over the weekend.\n\"That would be like saying we weren't at war with Nazis because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi party, but weren't violent,\" Rubio said on ABC's \"This Week.\"\nThese comments come as a crowded field of GOP presidential candidates are fighting to win the support of Christian conservatives in early voting states like Iowa and across the South, in part by vowing to fiercely protect religious liberties.\nParis attacks become focus of 2016 race\nTrump, who regularly discusses his religion the stump, has recently taken to firing up supporters at campaign rallies by ranting against individuals and companies that he says refuse to use the phrase \"Merry Christmas.\" A significant part of Ben Carson's appeal among Christians, meanwhile, is the retired neurosurgeon's compelling story of redemption through faith.\nThe highly politicized and heightened language in the 2016 campaign has raised alarm about a potential backlash against the Muslim community and prompted calls for greater religious tolerance.\nSpeaking at a G-20 summit in Turkey, President Barack Obama chastised politicians across the aisle for advocating for a \"religious test\" for individuals fleeing persecution in war-torn countries.\n\"That's shameful. That's not American. That's not who we are,\" Obama said. The values we are fighting against ISIL for are precisely that we don't discriminate against people because of their faith. We don't kill people because they're different than us. That's what separates us from them.\"\nThe heated rhetoric since Friday's attacks in Paris is only the latest instance of heated comments toward Muslims in the 2016 campaign.\nTrump, the New York real estate mogul who has climbed to front-runner status in part through inflammatory rhetoric invoking fear about a United States under attack from outside forces, said in September that some Muslims are \"a problem.\" Carson, another unlikely presidential candidate, drew backlash when he said the United States should not elect a Muslim president.\nThe particular question of how the U.S. should respond to the flood of immigrants fleeing violence in countries like Afghanistan and Syria has partisan divides. In a CNN/ORC poll conducted in early September, most Republicans, 55%, were opposed to accepting some refugees, while the majority of Democrats, 65%, said they support it.\nConcerns about anti-Muslim sentiments bubbling up to the surface are hardly new in the United States. In the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush famously called on Americans to make a clear distinction between terrorists and people of Islamic backgrounds -- an example Obama urged Republicans to follow on Monday.\n\"The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam. That's not what Islam is all about,\" Bush said in 2001. \"Islam is peace.\"\nAt the time, Bush was anticipating anti-Muslim backlash in the aftermath of 9/11.

She regularly tells the story of how he wooed her into serving as his secretary of state and recites, typically to a roar of applause, the line: \u201cPresident Obama doesn\u2019t get the credit he deserves.\u201d\nBut the terrorist attacks in Paris on Friday, and a presidential election that has suddenly taken a turn toward foreign policy, have complicated Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strategy of aligning herself closely with Mr. Obama, who is widely popular among Democratic primary voters and whose support she will need should she advance to the general election.\nOn Saturday in the second Democratic debate, Mrs. Clinton declined to directly respond to a question about whether she thought Mr. Obama had underestimated the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, which French officials have said was responsible for the attacks.\nBut she did \u2014 indirectly and deftly \u2014 contradict Mr. Obama\u2019s comments, made in a television interview recorded a day before the attacks, that the Islamic State had been \u201ccontained\u201d in Iraq and Syria.\n\u201cWe have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cIt cannot be contained; it must be defeated.\u201d\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign has said for months that it sees no reason to break with Mr. Obama. Mrs. Clinton has instead positioned her agenda around plans to \u201cbuild on the progress\u201d of the Obama administration. In places like South Carolina where African-American voters, in particular, overwhelmingly support the president, Mrs. Clinton devotes much of her stump speech to effusively praising Mr. Obama\u2019s success in reviving the economy after the 2008 financial crisis.\nIn a New York Times/CBS News survey released last Thursday, 79 percent of Democrats said they were satisfied or very satisfied with Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency and 60 percent said they would like to see the next president continue his policies.\nBut the renewed emphasis on terrorism in the past few days has laid bare Mrs. Clinton\u2019s long-held differences with Mr. Obama on foreign policy and when the United States should intervene in conflicts abroad.\nFor four years as secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton played a prominent role in nearly every foreign policy issue of Mr. Obama\u2019s first term, often pushing the White House to embrace a more aggressive approach. She urged the administration to join a NATO-led coalition to oust Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya, proposed that more forces be left in Iraq and pushed to funnel arms to moderate Syrian rebels.\n\u201cI assume she and her advisers are trying to calibrate Obama\u2019s approval rating right now,\u201d said Paul R. Pillar, a former C.I.A. analyst who teaches at Georgetown University. But he added, \u201cI think the conventional wisdom, that Hillary Clinton is a more hawkish person and would be a more hawkish president, with everything that adjective implies, is correct.\u201d\nMrs. Clinton has gone further than Mr. Obama on Syria by proposing that a coalition put in place a no-fly zone to provide safe areas for Syrians, an approach several Republican presidential candidates have also embraced. And she frequently talks about how she pushed Mr. Obama to arm some Syrian rebels.\n\u201cI did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early on,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said Saturday. \u201cBecause I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum.\u201d\nThe images from France have not prompted Mr. Obama to abandon his deep reluctance to send additional American troops to Iraq and Syria.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe U.S. troops are the answer to the problem,\u201d Benjamin J. Rhodes, Mr. Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser, said Sunday. \u201cThe further introduction of U.S. troops to fully re-engage in ground combat in the Middle East is not the way to deal with this challenge.\u201d\n(In an interview with ABC News on Sunday, Mr. Rhodes sought to clarify Mr. Obama\u2019s comment that the Islamic State had been contained. Mr. Rhodes said, \u201cThe fact is, we have been able to stop that geographic advance and take back significant amounts of territory in both northern Iraq and northern Syria.\u201d)\nMr. Obama\u2019s reaction to the attacks in France reminded foreign policy experts of the gulf between the president and Mrs. Clinton, which first emerged in their 2008 primary contest as Mr. Obama contrasted his antiwar message with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2002 vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq.\n\u201cBoth when she was secretary of state and since, she has had a sense of focusing not just on the cost of action, but the cost of inaction,\u201d said Dennis B. Ross, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama who is now a distinguished fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cPresident Obama has been much more inclined to the cost of action versus the cost of inaction.\u201d\nBut for Mrs. Clinton, embracing an inclination toward intervention is potentially an even more precarious proposition in a Democratic primary than breaking with Mr. Obama.\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s Iraq war vote, which she has repeatedly said was a mistake, was a major factor in her defeat in the 2008 primary, and it remains a vulnerability.\nOn Saturday, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democratic rival, assailed her for supporting the war. \u201cI don\u2019t think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now,\u201d he said.\nAppearing acutely aware of how liberal primary voters, particularly in Iowa, view her hawkish reputation, Mrs. Clinton said on Saturday that \u201cthis cannot be an American fight\u201d and that the United States should not bear \u201cthe bulk of the responsibility.\u201d\nThose remarks allowed Republicans to tie Mrs. Clinton to an administration that they widely view as ineffective in combating the Islamic State. \u201cThe president has admitted he does not have a strategy as it relates to ISIS,\u201d Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor and a Republican presidential candidate, told CNN. \u201cHillary Clinton last night said that it\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s not our fight.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cIt is our fight, and without our leadership in building a coalition to destroy ISIS, it won\u2019t happen.\u201d\nAt a campaign event in Ames, Iowa, on Sunday, Mrs. Clinton tried to expand on her earlier statement, saying that the United States should play a leadership role and \u201cbe rallying our partners and allies, pulling countries off the sidelines.\u201d\nHer seemingly incongruous comments on the issue speak to the reality that there may be no real political upside for Mrs. Clinton in coming out early with a detailed plan for Syria, said Michael O\u2019Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\u201cEven if she could convince people she\u2019s right today, by a year from now, on Election Day, the situation will have morphed,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Hanlon said. \u201cAnd in the meantime, she would have scared a lot of people with a little too much of what the Democratic base doesn\u2019t want to hear right now.\u201d", "byline": "AMY CHOZICK", "description": "The presidential race\u2019s new emphasis on terrorism has laid bare Mrs. Clinton\u2019s long-held differences with President Obama on foreign policy.", "title": "Paris Attacks Complicate Hillary Clinton\u2019s Alignment With Obama", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/us/politics/paris-attacks-complicate-hillary-clintons-alignment-with-obama.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Michael O'Hanlon", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Barack Obama", "Bernie Sanders"], "org": "nyt", "election_confidence": 0.7401183880597504, "authors": [{"author_id": 1667, "fullname": "amy chozick", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 10:00:17", "orgs": ["Brookings Institution"], "article_id": "a310dc5d47425798195debce32f7638f", "date_access": "2015-11-17 10:27:40.091557"}, {"body": "According to legend, if not actual historians, Harold Macmillan was once asked what he most feared could derail his agenda.

Facts on the ground can deliver a fatal blow to one's most cherished plans.\nThe line kept coming to mind as I listened to\nPresident Obama\n's remarkable news conference Monday from the G-20 meeting in Turkey. Asked again and again whether he underestimated the threat from\nIslamic State\n, a group he once dismissed as a \"JV team,\" the president said, in effect, \"no.\"\nOf course, he used a lot more words, but that was the gist: \"It's important for us to get the strategy right, and the strategy that we are pursuing is the right one.\" He added that \"the terrible events in Paris were obviously a terrible and sickening setback.\"\nCritics who disagree, he said, shouldn't \"pop off\" with their half-baked and ill-considered opinions. He's \"not interested\" in what he sees as mere sloganeering about \"American leadership or America winning\" that distract him from his strategy.\nThe contrast with remarks by French President Francois Hollande, addressing Parliament on Monday, was remarkable. Had Hollande's speech been delivered by a Republican presidential candidate, Obama would probably have dismissed it as more popping off. Hollande pledged to wage war \"without a respite, without a truce.... It is not a question of containing but of destroying this organization.\"\nObama's bloodlessly detached and condescendingly professorial remarks seemed oddly reminiscent of those excruciating news conferences during the Iraq war when George W. Bush couldn't bring himself to admit he made any mistakes.\nJust days before the Paris attack, Obama insisted that Islamic State was \"contained.\" He may have meant, as he now claims, that he was merely talking about its territorial holdings in Iraq and Syria (leaving out its gains in Libya, Afghanistan, the Sinai and its successful terror attacks elsewhere). But when people hear that a threat has been contained, they can be forgiven for thinking that rules out mass killings in Paris.\nThe chilling takeaway from Friday\u2019s terrorist attacks in Paris is that\nIslamic State\nhas expanded its theater of operations beyond the Middle East. But that doesn\u2019t mean the group is about to unleash a wave of attacks on the United States.\nThe Homeland Security Department said Friday it knows of...\nThe chilling takeaway from Friday\u2019s terrorist attacks in Paris is that\nIslamic State\nhas expanded its theater of operations beyond the Middle East. But that doesn\u2019t mean the group is about to unleash a wave of attacks on the United States.\nThe Homeland Security Department said Friday it knows of...\nAnd that's the bedeviling thing about events \u2014 the enemy gets to create them. Obama has all but admitted that Islamic State forced his hand by chopping off the heads of American hostages.\nFor Republicans, the attacks in Paris \u2014 not to mention in Turkey, Beirut and above Egypt (Islamic State almost surely brought down that Russian plane) \u2014 are just more proof that Obama's foreign policy is a mess.\nIn a more rational climate, this would be a moment for presidential candidates with serious foreign policy chops to shine and for candidates such as Donald Trump and Ben Carson to recede. That is, unless you actually believe Trump when he says, \"I know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me.\"\nBut even Trump, in his own way, seems more attuned to events as they unfold than Obama and the Democrats running to replace him.\nIn Saturday's Democratic debate, all three of the candidates struggled as the ground shifted under their feet. They bristled at the suggestion that we are at war with \"radical Islam.\" Saying so, according to Hillary Rodham Clinton, would be \"painting with too broad a brush.\"\nSen. Bernie Sanders, whose campaign furiously protested CBS' decision to shift the focus to terrorism, seemed despondent that he had to talk about the subject.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley was far more comfortable with the change, insisting that we must take in even more refugees from Syria.\nThat was a minority view even before it was revealed that at least one of the Paris terrorists had been a \"refugee.\" You can be sure it's even less popular now, which is why the roster of U.S. states seeking measures to bar Syrian refugees is growing rapidly.\nFor now, most Democrats stand with Obama in his denial. One wonders how long that resolve will last in the face of even one more \"setback\" to Obama's successful strategy.\njgoldberg@latimescolumnists.com\nFollow the Opinion section on Twitter\n@latimesopinion\nand\nFacebook", "byline": "", "description": "<p>According to legend, if not actual historians, Harold Macmillan was once asked what he most feared could derail his agenda.

Once sure-footed and decisive in expressing his view of the most important issue facing the country, income inequality, Sanders now appears to be holding back, hesitant to put meat on the bones of his big-picture ideas.\nBy\nGabriel Debenedetti\nThe socialism speech \u2013 billed by his campaign as a major address where Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist, would finally explain his definition of a politically loaded term that is deeply personal to him \u2013 provides perhaps the most concrete example.\nSanders first told reporters that he was planning to deliver a \u201cmajor speech\u201d outlining his political philosophy in October. \u201cI think we have some explaining to do,\u201d he said, admitting the tag of Democratic socialism wrongly makes some people \u201cvery, very nervous.\u201d\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re probably going to do to begin with is hold a major speech in the not-too-distant future, to define exactly what I mean by Democratic socialist,\u201d Sanders said during a campaign stop in Iowa. \u201cTo me, Democratic socialism means democracy. It means creating a government that represents all of us, not just the wealthiest people in the country.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s been postponed indefinitely because Sanders has not yet finished writing the high-risk speech, or agreed that he is ready to deliver it. The delay highlights another issue facing the Sanders camp \u2013 an apparent disconnect between the candidate and his staffers, who say they are pushing the senator to give his speech sooner rather than later.\n\u201cI personally think we\u2019re ready, he\u2019s just got to agree we\u2019re ready,\u201d said senior strategist Tad Devine. \u201cIt\u2019s very much on the horizon, it\u2019s just a question of timing. He wants to finish the speech first.\u201d\nSanders still likes to write all of his speeches himself \u2013 even when an aide offers a draft, he will typically rework the specific language. The mere prospect of the speech drew comparisons to other Democratic presidential candidates who confronted sensitive questions about faith or belief \u2013 putting it in line with Barack Obama's 2008 speech in Philadelphia about race, and John F. Kennedy's speech about his Roman Catholic faith in 1960. And Sanders camp said it was not backing away.\nFourth Estate\nBy\nJack Shafer\n\u201cWe want to do this,\u201d Devine said. \u201cIt\u2019s not because we don\u2019t want to talk about being a socialist. No way. Just the opposite. This is an opportunity for him to explain how his political philosophy fits squarely into the Democratic Party.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also not clear when Sanders will provide details of how he plans to pay for his health insurance plan. \u201cLike with the socialism speech, there\u2019s no set date,\u201d Devine said of the single-payer program, as well as the related tax policy details. \u201cI would admit there\u2019s delay. I would attribute that to a desire for it to be a fully costed analysis. We\u2019re not trying to be evasive. He\u2019s trying to be serious.\u201d\nDuring the second Democratic debate Saturday night, Sanders said he was not ready to say how much he would raise the country\u2019s top marginal income tax rate. \u201cWe haven\u2019t come up with an exact number yet,\u201d he told CBS news correspondent Nancy Cordes. \u201cBut it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent.\u201d\nHe wiggled out of providing specificity with humor. \u201cI\u2019m not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower,\u201d he joked, landing his first applause line of the night.\nIn the past, Sanders has introduced single-payer legislation in Congress that included a 2.2 percent income tax across the board, as well as a 6.7 percent payroll tax for employers. While payroll taxes are split between the employer and the employee, economists and the Congressional Budget Office have said that most of those fees are carried by workers in the form of lower wages. Sensing opportunity, the Clinton camp went on offense against Sanders on Tuesday, hoping to cast an unflattering light on him for supporting legislation that would raise taxes on the middle class, while Clinton has promised that none of her proposals involve a middle class tax hike.\n\"Bernie Sanders has called for a roughly 9-percent tax hike on middle-class families just to cover his health care plan,\" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said, referring to his 2013 single-payer legislation, \"and simple math dictates he'll need to tax workers even more to pay for the rest of his at least $18-20 trillion agenda.\"\nWhite House\nBy\nSarah Wheaton\nIn an interview, Sanders\u2019 campaign appeared to be backing away from the senator's own previous bills, aware that any possible tax hike that could be a deal breaker for middle class voters. Devine said \u201cwhat Bernie wants to do now [in terms of his healthcare proposal] is not exactly like the one proposed in past legislation.\u201d\nAny proposal the campaign will unveil, said Devine, is unlikely to involve tax rate increases on the middle class. \u201cI don\u2019t really see that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see tax rate increases involving anyone other than people making a lot of money.\u201d\nDevine also pushed back against the idea that the Sanders campaign\u2019s delays in rolling out specifics \u2013 on his tax plan or anything else \u2013 reflected a calculated consideration of the political realities of the race and his approach.\n\u201cThat is a not a back of the envelope endeavor,\u201d Devine said of the tax plan. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the Congressional Budget Office itself will be involved, but it\u2019s going to be legit.

But he's running into a problem: Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon the establishment underestimated, who continues to show surprising durability and backing from evangelicals.\nNow, with his three-day tour of the Palmetto State, Cruz and his supporters are looking to pinch the evangelical firewalls of Carson and other Christian favorites.\nCruz isn't saying that he's a better Christian -- he's arguing that he's a better defender of Christians. Even candidates of deep faith who themselves have been born again aren't in step with the Republican base on questions of religious liberty, he says.\n\"I've been blessed to have had the opportunity to stand and defend religious liberty over and over and over again,\" Cruz said during a script-less 55-minute sermon at Florence Baptist Church in the state's Pee Dee region Sunday.\nIt is a tough needle to thread: Carson, whose inspirational life story is rooted in his religious revival, has the highest favorability ratings in the Republican field, which discourages Cruz from attacking him directly. In fact, Cruz said recently that he \"likes and trusts\" Carson.\nBut the pitch on religious issues puts Carson squarely in the crosshairs in the area where he is supposed to be untouchable: questions of Christian leadership. It brings Cruz's central calling card -- that he has taken arrows for the conservative cause while others haven't -- onto Carson's turf.\n\"I like Ben Carson, but this one has been in the fight a lot longer,\" said Sheila Ayres, a 50-year-old secretary, as she pointed to Cruz working the post-church pews. \"Dr. Carson doesn't have the background in the political part of it.\"\nJames Galbraith, a 73-year-old part-time worker at Florence Baptist, was quick to dismiss Carson due to his faith. \"He's Seventh-day Adventist,\" said Galbraith. \"I just don't believe in that Saturday worshipping is better than Sunday. I'm a Sunday worshipper.\"\nCruz relies heavily on his tenure as solicitor general of Texas, during which he led several high-profile fights to the Supreme Court. And others learned of him through a different religious avenue: his father, a former preacher, whose fiery crusades sometimes verge on the impolitic.\nAt the same time, Cruz isn't directly criticizing Carson. That troubles some boosters who say he needs to get moving against Carson and Donald Trump. Rival campaigns have hoped that Carson and Trump's penchant for impolitic statements would ultimately be his undoing but that hasn't happened.\nCarson also surprised by raising $20 million in the third quarter, undermining a Cruz credo that he was the only well-funded conservative in the race.\n\"He's got character running out his ears,\" said Bill Monroe, the pastor who invited Cruz here to preach said of the senator. \"But I don't think he's been in the trenches fighting these kinds of things.\"\n\"Cruz needs to start swinging,\" said one strategist close to the campaign. \"He's in third or fourth. He can't keep waiting for Trump and Carson to fall apart.\"\nCruz trails Carson in every Iowa and South Carolina poll, sometimes badly, as Carson continues to hold on to the evangelical voters Cruz counted on. The latest CNN/ORC poll shows Cruz in fourth place with 11%. Trump leads at 25%, Carson second at 23% and Marco Rubio is in third at 13%.\nHe told an interviewer in June that his chief rival among evangelicals was not Carson, but Mike Huckabee, who now barely registers in opinion polls. When the Cruz-affliated super PAC Keep the Promise compared their candidate to the rest of the field in a 51-page slideshow this past summer to donors, the only mention of Trump was on a list of \"well-funded campaigns.\"\nCarson's name didn't appear in the slideshow at all.\nReligious conversions underpins both the Cruz and Carson life stories, with each talking proudly about how faith transformed their history from one of alcoholism in their family or violence to Ivy League educations. And both have predicated their political success on cornering their co-religionists, with each visiting Bob Jones University in the northwest corner of the state on back-to-back days this weekend.\n\"Dr. Carson wears his faith,\" said his senior strategist Ed Brookover. \"Dr. Carson has been saying all along that we think it's time for someone who has a new approach and has a new way of doing things.\"\nCruz's campaign has intentionally courted the leading lights of the evangelical movement, assembling a document with 411 national leaders whose support they want. They've won over almost half, 191, according to a campaign official.\nThat's in contrast to Carson, who despite his grassroots evangelical support, has not been successful winning over national faith leaders, according to one of them.\n\"He's not built relationships with conservative leaders,\" said Tony Perkins, an influential Christian leader who oversees a broad network of conservative advocacy groups. \"I don't know that he's actually looking for endorsements from conservative leaders. He may have a different approach to his campaign.\"\nAnd after Monday's endorsement by Steve King, Cruz will try to win the biggest evangelical endorsement in 2016 this Friday: that of Iowa powerbroker Bob Vander Plaats.\nCarson's best argument is to point to the scoreboard.\n\"We've been organizing as well,\" Brookover said. \"We don't talk about it as much.\"", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Ted Cruz's challenge: Winning Ben Carson's evangelicals", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/17/politics/ted-cruz-ben-carson-evangelical-voters/index.html", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Steve King", "Ed Brookover", "Bob Vander Plaats", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Mike Huckabee", "Tony Perkins", "Ben Carson", "Ted Cruz"], "org": "cnn", "election_confidence": 0.9907460206380774, "authors": [{"author_id": 23575, "fullname": "theodore schleifer", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 10:56:59", "orgs": ["Supreme Court"], "article_id": "503952059b438189942b3d630c1ba6bb", "date_access": "2015-11-17 11:18:14.329946"}]
