Bush says he'd back Trump as Republican presidential candidate,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/4oCnw98Ff_Y/story01.htm,reuters,"WASHINGTON Jeb Bush said on Thursday he would back fellow Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump if the businessman-turned-politician wins the party's nomination for the 2016 presidential election and Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee.

Asked if he would support Trump as Republican nominee over Clinton in the November 2016 contest, Bush said, ""I would, of course.""

""We need to be unified. We need to win,"" Bush, the former Florida governor, said in an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" television program, one day after Trump told the same show he would back Bush over Clinton.

Bush and Trump have been engaged in public attacks on each another as they vie for the party's nomination.

Trump has spent weeks taunting Bush, one of his closest rivals in public opinion polls in the large Republican field. The real estate mogul and television personality has mocked Bush as ""low-energy,"" and this week criticized him for answering a question in Spanish.

The Bush campaign initially had avoided engaging in a war of words with Trump. But on Wednesday, Bush's advisers signaled a new effort to fight back with campaign ads and social media efforts.

On Thursday, Bush took issue with Trump's tactics and called on his rival to tone down his attacks. Trump has made controversial remarks about immigration and Latinos. Bush, whose wife was born in Mexico, told ABC that diversity adds vitality to the country.

""I think Donald Trump trying to insult his way to the presidency is not going to work. People want an uplifting, hopeful message,"" he said.

Bush added that Trump should ""figure out a way to lessen the divisive language, the hurtful language and talk about the aspirations of the American people, rather than trying to prey on their fears.""

Reuters/Ipsos polling shows Trump with support among nearly 31 percent of self-identified Republicans as of Sept. 1, with Bush garnering support among nearly 12 percent, behind former neurosurgeon Ben Carson.

Trump expected to sign Republican loyalty pledge Thursday: report,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/ojHLn_Yu25E/story01.htm,reuters,"WASHINGTON U.S. presidential hopeful Donald Trump is expected on Thursday to pledge that he will not run as an independent candidate if he loses the Republican Party's nomination, ABC News reported, citing a source familiar with Trump's conversations with the party.

Trump, a real estate mogul, has suggested he would consider an independent run if Republicans did not nominate him as their candidate. The Republican National Committee has asked its pool of 17 candidates to sign a loyalty pledge to ensure future party unity.

ABC News reported that Trump has not told Republican leaders directly how he planned to handle the pledge, but a Trump spokeswoman said he would make a decision Thursday.

One of Trump's key rivals, Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Thursday he would back Trump if the businessman-turned-politician won the party's nomination for the 2016 presidential election and Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee.

Trump, on the same program, also said he would back Bush over Clinton.

Christie knocks Paul dismissal of heroin crisis,http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/chris-christie-rand-paul-heroin-crisis/index.html,cnn,"Washington (CNN)New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie knocked opponent Rand Paul Thursday for appearing to dismiss the growing heroin crisis in the U.S. at a recent campaign event New Hampshire.

Paul, speaking in Manchester, said people who work don't do heroin.

""People always come up to me and say, 'We got heroin problems and all these other problems.' You know what? If you work all day long, you don't have time to do heroin,"" Paul had said Wednesday night.

Played the clip on CNN's ""New Day,"" Christie said that drug addiction needs to be taken seriously.

""Drug addiction is a disease. And it's a failing to try drugs in the first place,"" Christie told CNN. ""But, there but for the grace of God, go I. And everyone makes mistakes that they look back on and would like to do differently. And we should treat it as a disease.""

RELATED: Paul says people who work don't do heroin

Christie touted his use of drug courts in New Jersey and treatment programs to help fight the growing epidemic.

The White House announced last month that it would spend $2.5 million to fight heroin trafficking along the East Coast. Overdose deaths from heroin have nearly quadrupled since 2002.

The issue has risen to the center of the presidential debate in New Hampshire, where heroin use has spiked.

Paul supported improved drug treatment in a proposal earlier this year.",0.911966211164425

Mandatory Credit: Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports

We're just one week away from the start of the NFL regular season as teams and fans prepare for Week 1.

The Miami Dolphins kick off their season against the Washington Redskins on Sunday, Sept. 13, where Ndamukong Suh will make his team debut. Before he gets the chance to wreak havoc on the Redskins' offensive line, he'll be terrifying readers with his front page photo for the Miami Herald's football preview section.

Whether Suh is actually standing in the Atlantic Ocean or not is unclear, but it's terrifying, nonetheless. That's what Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins will see in his face early and often next Sunday as he'll be doing his best to elude Suh all game long.

For now, Cousins should probably shy away from looking at the Miami Herald.

U.S. Trade Gap Narrows in July,http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-trade-gap-narrows-in-july-1441283529,wsj,"WASHINGTON—The U.S. trade gap narrowed in July as demand grew overseas for American-made autos and industrial supplies.

The trade deficit with other nations shrank 7.4% from June to a seasonally adjusted $41.86 billion in July, the Commerce Department said Thursday. That was slightly lower than the $42 billion gap projected by a Wall Street Journal survey of economists.

Exports increased 0.4% to $188.5 billion, despite a strong dollar and economic weakness in major trade partners like China and Europe.

Imports fell 1.1% to $230.36 billion, reflecting slowing American demand for consumer goods like pharmaceuticals and mobile phones.

Trade figures can be volatile from month to month. Broader trends suggest international trade has slowed thanks to weak global growth. The U.S. trade deficit grew 3.6% in the first seven months of this year compared to the same period a year earlier. Exports fell 3.5% over that period while imports declined 2.2%.

Exports contributed to the post-recession comeback but have been uneven in the past 18 months. Europe’s ongoing economic woes and slowing growth in Asian trading partners like China have dampened demand for U.S. goods.

The U.S. trade deficit with China grew 8.5% in the first seven months of 2015 compared to the same period last year, Thursday’s report showed. The deficit with Japan grew 2.5%.

"Cheryl Mills, Hillary Clinton Lawyer, Appears Before House Panel",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/us/hillary-clinton-email-benghazi.html,nyt,"WASHINGTON — Cheryl Mills, a longtime lawyer and aide for Hillary Rodham Clinton, walked into a Capitol Hill conference room shortly before 8 a.m. on Thursday for an interview under oath about Mrs. Clinton’s email account and the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. As Ms. Mills entered the room, she declined to talk to reporters who asked her whether she would answer questions about Mrs. Clinton’s server and whether there was classified information on it.

The interview before the House Benghazi committee is expected to last several hours.

The committee’s chairman, Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, did address reporters for a few minutes before the hearing, saying he had rejected Ms. Mills’ request to hold the interview in public because the committee has conducted its other interviews in private.

“If you’re serious about getting the most amount of information, you are going to get it in a transcribed interview session, not in a public session where members are limited to five or 10 minutes,” Mr. Gowdy said. “So we have not had a public fact finding interview with a single witness, and I’m not going to treat her any differently.”

On Wednesday it was revealed that Byran Pagliano, a former information technology official at the State Department who helped set up the server that housed Mrs. Clinton’s private email account, plans to invoke his Fifth Amendment right in response to questions from the committee. Mr. Pagliano’s lawyer declined to comment.

A Clinton campaign aide said that Mr. Pagliano’s decision was “both understandable and disappointing to us, because we believe he has every reason to be transparent about his I.T. assistance.”

“We had hoped Bryan would also agree to answer any questions from the committee and had recently encouraged him to grant the committee’s request for an interview,” the aide said.

The aide added, “Bryan is an utter professional and a wonderful young man who does not live in the public eye and understandably may not wish to be drawn into a political spectacle.”

Mr. Gowdy addressed the issue briefly before stepping into the interview. “You’re free to claim whatever inference you want from the fact that” he does not want to testify, Mr. Gowdy said.",0.66381759508220328
