"Trump, RNC leader meet on pledge",http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/donald-trump-2016-rnc-pledge-meeting/index.html,cnn,"New York (CNN)Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus arrived at Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan on Thursday around 1:35 p.m. for a private meeting with GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump.

On the agenda: whether Trump will sign an RNC pledge ruling out a future third-party run.

Trump has enjoyed a sustained lead in national polls, and the sit-down with Priebus comes amid unease about whether the billionaire businessman would rebuff the party and seek the White House as an independent. Though he's expressed a strong preference for running as a Republican, Trump has yet to definitively rule out a third-party run.

RNC officials began circulating a pledge to various GOP presidential campaigns this week, measuring up how much appetite there is in the field to commit to supporting the eventual nominee.

""I, ________, affirm that if I do not win the 2016 Republican nomination for President of the United States I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is,"" it reads.

RELATED: Source says Trump likely to rule out independent bid

The pledge continues: ""I further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party.""

Sources familiar with the discussions said Wednesday that all signs indicate Trump will sign the paper. And advisers to the candidate have said all along that Trump was never seriously interested in launching an independent run, which is an arduous -- and costly -- process.

The pledge is not only putting pressure on Trump to commit to the party, it's also forcing some of his rivals to promise to support Trump if he were to clinch the GOP nomination.

It's a particularly uncomfortable position for a candidate like Jeb Bush, who in recent weeks has publicly clashed with Trump. The two men have released attack videos on social media, and openly criticized one another on the trail.

On ABC's ""Good Morning America"" Thursday morning, Bush lashed out at Trump again, saying, ""I think Donald Trump is trying to insult his way to the presidency and it's not going to work.""

However, pressed on whether he would support Trump if he were to become the nominee, the former Florida governor answered in the affirmative.

""Yes, I would, of course. We need to be unified. We need to win,"" Bush said.

Meanwhile, others are raising questions about just how enforceable a loyalty pledge is.

""You're right, it's unenforceable,"" said Carly Fiorina on CNN's ""New Day."" ""It is, more than anything else, your word.""",0.9999999555825847
Normally loquacious Biden hits the road but stays mum on 2016,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/JFspO2hOSe0/story01.htm,reuters,"MIAMi, Fla When you are Joe Biden, it's not easy being quiet.

While the normally loquacious vice president got the feel and taste for the campaign trail during a two-day trip to the political battleground of Florida, he really didn't want to talk about it.

On his first public trip since he began pondering whether to jump into the presidential race, Biden ignored reporters’ shouted questions about his plans and poked fun at the booming media interest in him.

He defended President Barack Obama's nuclear deal with Iran and backed policies to ease economic equality and help the middle class in speeches that would have fit nicely at a Democratic campaign rally.

Biden remained as garrulous as ever. He told Jewish leaders at a gathering on Thursday that he would speak for 10 minutes and then take questions.

He wrapped up more than 40 minutes later, drawing a laugh after promising several times he was making his ""last point.""""I know I've said that a few times,"" he said.Each step of the campaign-style trip, which also featured a Democratic fundraiser and concludes with a foreign policy speech in Atlanta on Thursday night, has been overshadowed by the overriding question: Will he or won't he launch a challenge to former Senate and Cabinet colleague Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Biden joked about his newfound celebrity status, acknowledging that the dozens of camera crews and reporters who greeted him at a Miami community college were not there for his planned talk on education initiatives.

""Their interest in community colleges impresses me,"" he joked to students, gesturing to the media mob. ""I hope that's what they're going to write about.""

The timing of the trip ramped up speculation about his intentions and opened up even his most innocent comments to new interpretations - a potentially dangerous trend for a man known for his verbal gaffes.

""People who aren't willing to risk failure never succeed,"" Biden said during the education speech, in what could be the motto for his deliberations on whether to run for the White House.

Earlier, on a tour of a biotech lab at the college, he told one of the students he preferred to watch rather than help with her experiment.

""I can see the press headline: 'Biden screws up experiment,'"" he said.

Biden, 72, has been huddling with advisers for weeks to determine whether he will challenge Clinton, who has seen her favorability ratings plummet from the fallout over her use of a private email server while working as the nation's top diplomat.

On a conference call with Democratic National Committee members last week, Biden said he was still trying to see if he had the energy and commitment for a campaign. He has been recovering from the death of his son, former Delaware attorney general Beau Biden, from cancer in May.

But his travel schedule is picking up as he nears a decision, with trips to Pittsburgh and an appearance on Stephen Colbert’s talk show scheduled next week.

His trip to south Florida, a Democratic enclave in one of the biggest presidential battleground states, included a fundraiser for the Democratic Senate campaign committee. But Biden didn't even address a possible run, or get asked about it, during that private event, participants said.

And he ignored a well wisher who had some advice for him after his education speech. ""Run, Joe!"" he yelled.

Biden didn't respond.

Gretchen's Take: Will he or won't he? Trump's bid decision,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/IAfTaPZrrSw/gretchens-take-will-or-wont-trumps-bid-decision.html,fox,"Will he or won't he?

GOP front-runner Donald Trump has a big decision to make today. Trump will meet with RNC chair Reince Preibus in New York City about signing the ""pledge"" to promise to support the Republican nominee for president (if it is not Trump) and more importantly for the RNC -- pledge to not run as a third party candidate.

Every other GOP candidate in the field has vowed to sign the pledge or has done so already -- but why wouldn't they? None have the bravado of a Trump to make any kind of a case as an independent voice.

So will Trump do it? I say yes -- especially with Dr. Ben Carson now tied with him for first place at 23 percent in the latest poll out of Iowa.

I also think signing the pledge takes a huge hit away from other candidates at the next GOP debate in two weeks.

If Trump doesn't sign the pledge they could have gone after him for not being a true Republican and handing the election to the Democrats if he decided to run as an independent.

But -- Donald Trump is always full of surprises and defies conventional wisdom almost daily.

Be sure to tune into ""The Real Story"" today at 2 ET to hear Trump himself with his decision.

Sanders campaign cool to O'Malley's more aggressive approach to forcing more debates,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/03/sanders-campaign-cool-to-omalleys-more-aggressive-approach-to-forcing-more-debates/,washpo,"Democratic presidential candidates, from left, Bernie Sanders, Martin O'Malley, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Lincoln Chafee stand on stage during the Iowa Democratic Party's Hall of Fame Dinner, July 17 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) The campaign of presidential hopeful Martin O’Malley has made several unsuccessful overtures to rival Bernie Sanders’s camp in recent weeks to jointly buck the Democratic National Committee’s schedule of six debates. In private conversations, confirmed by aides to both candidates, O’Malley representatives have suggested that both Sanders and O’Malley agree to accept invitations to debates not sanctioned by the DNC in a bid to open up the process, which O’Malley last week characterized as being “rigged” to limit the exposure of front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton. The DNC has threatened to exclude candidates from its debates if they take part in a non-sanctioned gathering. But aides to O’Malley, the former Maryland governor, say they are skeptical of the threat, particularly if Sanders and O’Malley stand up together against the DNC. [O’Malley blasts Democratic leaders for ‘rigged’ 2016 debate process] Though Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont, has been vocal about wanting more debates, aides say his campaign is more reticent to cross the DNC, reasoning that a chance to appear with O'Malley and other lower-polling Democrats is not worth the risk of losing his shots on stage with Clinton. Recent polling has shown Sanders with an apparent lead over Clinton in New Hampshire and closing in on her in Iowa. O'Malley remains mired in the single digits in both early nominating states. ""At the end of the day, I do want to be on the stage with Hillary Clinton,"" Sanders said in an interview last week. Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said Thursday that the campaign’s thinking has not changed in recent days, emphasizing that Sanders would like there to be more debates in which all the Democratic candidates participate [Sanders to Democratic Party elite: Consider me, not Hillary Clinton] Briggs said Sanders would also like to debate Republican candidates, a dynamic that could highlight differences between the competing agendas of the major parties without running afoul of DNC debate rules. O’Malley aides suggest that if both O'Malley and Sanders agree to take part in other debates, it is unlikely that Clinton would skip the gathering. DNC officials defend the debate schedule as a sufficient opportunity to size up candidates against one another, noting that multiple groups will also be hosting less formal forums. Critics of the schedule note that only four of the six debates are scheduled to occur before the Iowa caucuses. On Thursday, DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz declined to answer several questions from reporters on the subject following a meeting she hosted between Vice President Biden and prominent Jewish activists and Democratic donors at a Jewish community center in Davie, Fla. She said she was appearing there only in her role as a Florida congresswoman. O’Malley aides say they have also been heartened by what appears to be growing pressure on the DNC from a variety of sources to open up the schedule. A grass-roots group, for example, has been formed to pressure the party for more debates and plans a demonstration later this month outside DNC headquarters in Washington. [O’Malley forwards a ‘flattering’ Clinton e-mail in an attempt to make a point] O'Malley has made the cry for more debates part of his pitch on the campaign trail for a few weeks now. During an appearance in Hollis, N.H., last week, for example, he told his audience at a house party that Democratic debates would be an effective way to advance issues important to the middle class that are getting drowned out by all the media attention on the Republicans. ""What is our message in the Democratic party?"" O'Malley said. ""It seems our brand is what did Hillary Clinton know about her e-mails and when did she know it, and did she wipe her server or did she not?""

Jeb Bush to unveil tax proposals,http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/jeb-bush-tax-proposals-north-carolina-2016/index.html,cnn,"Hampton, New Hampshire (CNN)Jeb Bush will announce his tax plan next week in Raleigh, North Carolina, the former Florida governor said Thursday.

Speaking in Hampton, New Hampshire, Bush said he'll lay out his tax proposals next Wednesday. The speech marks the next phase of a series of policy address he's already given on government reform and foreign policy.

While he didn't unveil specific details about his plan, he said he wants to lower corporate and personal rates ""as low as you possibly can, eliminating as many of the deductions as you can.""

""The tax code is rife with all sorts of deductions and credits that make people feel compelled to kind of follow the script rather than say I want to invest in this business cause I know if I take recycled plastic bottles and use the right technology with the right workers, that we can out compete China,"" he said.

His remarks came during a campaign event at Foss Manufacturing, which creates polyester fiber out of recycled plastic PET bottles.

""If you create a system where you're providing real incentive to capital investment that you are going to create higher wage jobs and that should be the objective,"" he said.

Bush also drew a contrast with Donald Trump, who favors raising taxes on the wealthy.

Bush spokeswoman Allie Bradenburger said next week's event will take place at Morris & Associates in North Carolina.

""Morris is the sort of small manufacturer that will benefit from Governor Bush's economic policies that will foster an environment to create 19 million news jobs and raise middle-class incomes,"" she said.",0.93819739960048054

"Hillary Clinton's email controversy, explained",http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/hillary-clinton-email-controversy-explained-2016/index.html,cnn,"Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton's email controversy is older than her 2016 presidential campaign -- and it's been forced into the headlines again Thursday and Friday when two top aides testify behind closed doors for a House committee.

The former secretary of state's use of a private email server might not have been broken laws, particularly if her claims that she never knowingly shared information that was classified at the time holds true.

But the Justice Department's investigation, the State Department's processing and release of her emails, a House panel's separate investigation and dozens of impending lawsuits are weighing on the 2016 Democratic presidential front-runner's campaign.

Here's what's happened so far:

News broke in March that Clinton used personal email addresses connected to a privately-owned server, rather than a government email, during her four years as President Barack Obama's first-term secretary of state.

Some previous secretaries of state -- including Colin Powell -- have also used private email accounts, but Clinton's approach was particularly controversial because it's out of step with typical government practice now and gave Clinton a major measure of control over what remains private and what's public.

Clinton's lawyers turned over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department, and the department has since processed those -- releasing some, under a judge's orders, at the end of each month.

But she didn't hand in the server itself until last month, after five months of intense scrutiny over whether she flouted transparency laws or put government secrets at risk.

Clinton has chalked it all up to convenience, saying she preferred not to carry two phones -- one with a personal email address and one with a work email.

There's some legitimacy to that: Government BlackBerrys could only include one address.

But having her own personal server also gave Clinton -- as well as her closest aides -- much greater control over which emails were accessible under public records requests.

Clinton acknowledged, both in March when her private email use was first reported and again in Iowa last month, that it ""clearly wasn't the best choice"" to skip using a government email address.

It's mostly innocuous -- with Clinton asking for scheduling updates, fitting in trips to her hair stylist, checking on a strange trade dispute over gefilte fish and receiving notes about the balance of a career and a family from a top policy aide.

But the emails also offer insight into Clinton's closest contacts. Among them: Sidney Blumenthal, who sent what Clinton has said were unsolicited -- yet were clearly warmly received -- notes with advice and guidance on domestic and international politics.

Many of the emails are, in part or in full, redacted. That makes it tough to tell what behind-the-scenes policy conversations were taking place as Clinton navigated tricky international waters.

Of the 7,000 emails released by the State Department this week, 125 were retroactively classified.

There are laws intended to keep government records transparent -- but one that requires officials to transfer emails sent to private addresses onto government servers wasn't enacted until 2014, after Clinton departed the State Department.

Still, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan suggested last month that Clinton violated government policy and made the process of responding to open records requests more difficult.

""We wouldn't be here today if this employee had followed government policy,"" he said at a hearing on one of the dozens of lawsuits over Clinton's emails.

Looming larger is the question of how classified information was handled -- the subject of a Justice Department investigation and the question that ultimately forced Clinton to turn over her private server to the FBI.

Clinton has insisted she never sent or received information that was classified at the time -- though many of her emails have been classified retroactively as the State Department has prepared them for release.

Probably not, said Anne M. Tomkins, the former U.S. attorney who oversaw the prosecution of Gen. David Petraeus over his having showed classified materials to his mistress and biographer.

Tomkins wrote this week in USA Today that Clinton committed no crime because she didn't ""knowingly"" share classified materials.

""Clinton is not being investigated for knowingly sending or receiving classified materials improperly,"" Tomkins wrote.

""Indeed, the State Department has confirmed that none of the information that has surfaced on Clinton's server thus far was classified at the time it was sent or received,"" she wrote. ""Additionally, the Justice Department indicated that its inquiry is not a criminal one and that Clinton is not the subject of the inquiry.""

All government agencies are responsible for determining which of their own materials are classified.

But Clinton's emails are being reviewed by a team of about 12 interagency officials, who are making recommendations on what should and shouldn't be classified.

State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters in August that ""there's an exhaustive, extensive review process for each and every email, which includes not just State Department reviewers going through them but having intelligence community reviewers with us at the time as we go through them in real-time to help make determinations.""

Kirby added, ""Some of those determinations are fairly easy -- yes or no. Some of them require additional review and discussion.""

It's not just the State Department's email releases forcing fresh headlines about the issue.

The House's Benghazi committee chaired by Rep. Trey Gowdy is calling two top Clinton aides in for closed-door depositions this week. Cheryl Mills, Clinton's State Department chief of staff, will appear Thursday, while policy adviser Jake Sullivan is expected Friday.

Another former State Department employee Bryan Pagliano who worked on Clinton's private email server has informed Congress that he will invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid testifying before the House Select Committee.

Clinton herself will appear before the committee for an open hearing -- one likely to attract the most television cameras of any congressional hearing in recent memory -- on Oct. 22.

There are also dozens of lawsuits seeking Clinton's emails. They range from news organizations like Gawker and The Associated Press to conservative groups like Judicial Watch.

The State Department said Tuesday that it will ask for all of those lawsuits to be consolidated under a single judge.

Among Clinton's biggest challenges in the presidential race is demonstrating her authenticity -- and part of that is showing voters she's trustworthy.

Increasingly, though, voters say they distrust Clinton. The numbers have shifted dramatically since news of her private email server was first reported in March.

Her campaign has shifted tactics in recent weeks, dropping the jokes Clinton had cracked about what she'd once portrayed as a non-issue and sending aides out in an attempt to diffuse the issue in television appearances -- signaling that it's an increasingly serious challenge.",0.99967737470474594
Bush confronted by voter over immigration,http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/jeb-bush-voter-confrontation-immigration/index.html,cnn,"Hampton, New Hampshire (CNN)Just minutes after Jeb Bush bashed Donald Trump in his stump speech on Thursday, Bush was questioned by a frustrated voter on what he would do about illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border.

In the six-minute exchange that grew tense at times, the former Florida governor was asked why he didn't support the idea of cutting off aid or other funds to Mexico until the country does more to stop illegal crossings into the United States.

""They don't do anything about the border. We're being defensive. Why don't we be offensive for once?"" the voter asked, echoing sentiments that have been trumpeted by Trump.

He described himself as ""pissed off"" about the flood of undocumented immigrants and argued that ""they're all criminals because they are breaking the law.""

""(Mexico) should enforce their Southern border -- that I agree with,"" Bush responded, pointing out that most undocumented immigrants who have streamed into the U.S. in recent years have come from Central America.

But Bush argued that a ""wall won't solve this problem.""

RELATED: Jeb Bush to unveil tax proposals next week

While he conceded it makes sense to have a wall in urban areas like in between Juarez and El Paso, Texas, or by San Diego, California, there are other places where it doesn't make sense.

""The notion that another country is going to pay for a wall that we're building is just ludicrous beyond belief,"" he said, referring to Trump's proposal.

Bush went on to lay out his immigration plan, saying he would use technologies at the border to help detect illegal crossings and pointed to his own experience as a ""border governor"" because of migrants who came from the Caribbean to Florida.

He reiterated that he supports earned legal status for those that are already in the country illegally if they meet certain criteria.

The voter, however, argued that the government has already been granting amnesty to too many people.

""You tell me if this is amnesty,"" Bush said, before launching into the requirements he would enforce for anyone wanting legal status.

""You come out from the shadows. You receive a provisional work permit. You pay taxes. You don't receive federal government assistance. You learn English ...You work,"" he said. ""You don't commit crimes ... You earn legal status, not citizenship. That, to me, is the most practical way of dealing with this problem.""

Bush also found himself on defense, standing by his position that most immigrants come to the country out of good intentions -- a position that Trump attacked him on this week with an Instagram video.

""99% of people that come across the border ... are coming to provide for their families. The ones that are criminals, we ought to be kick them out. There's no disagreement about that,"" Bush said. ""To ascribe bad motives people who are trying to provide for their families, I'm not going to change my views on that.""

Earlier in the event, Bush described Trump as a doomsayer who espouses ""pessimistic"" views that are dividing the country by preying on peoples' ""angst and fears.""

""Donald Trump's view is that the end is near,"" Bush said. ""His pessimistic view is let's close the borders, let's create tariffs, let's do this, let's do that--all based on negativity, and the net result is all of us will suffer if that philosophy gains favor.""

His comments come as Bush has stepped up his attacks against his Republican rival.

Bush spent considerable time explaining how the two candidates differ not only on immigration, but on taxes and health care.

""Whatever the issue is, there is one path that is aspirational and hopeful, and there is one path that is negative, and it is not the right path for this country,"" he said. ""So here I am.""

The former governor also ripped into President Barack Obama and Democrats for making immigration a wedge issue.

""You're angry. I'm frustrated. A bunch of people are angry. The left loves it,"" he told the voter. ""They don't care about fixing this problem. President Barack Obama could have fixed this his first year in office...he didn't even lift a finger to do it 'cause they want to win elections.""
