"Trump, RNC leader meet on pledge",http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/donald-trump-2016-rnc-pledge-meeting/index.html,cnn,"New York (CNN)Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus arrived at Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan on Thursday around 1:35 p.m. for a private meeting with GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump.

On the agenda: whether Trump will sign an RNC pledge ruling out a future third-party run.

Trump has enjoyed a sustained lead in national polls, and the sit-down with Priebus comes amid unease about whether the billionaire businessman would rebuff the party and seek the White House as an independent. Though he's expressed a strong preference for running as a Republican, Trump has yet to definitively rule out a third-party run.

RNC officials began circulating a pledge to various GOP presidential campaigns this week, measuring up how much appetite there is in the field to commit to supporting the eventual nominee.

""I, ________, affirm that if I do not win the 2016 Republican nomination for President of the United States I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is,"" it reads.

RELATED: Source says Trump likely to rule out independent bid

The pledge continues: ""I further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party.""

Sources familiar with the discussions said Wednesday that all signs indicate Trump will sign the paper. And advisers to the candidate have said all along that Trump was never seriously interested in launching an independent run, which is an arduous -- and costly -- process.

The pledge is not only putting pressure on Trump to commit to the party, it's also forcing some of his rivals to promise to support Trump if he were to clinch the GOP nomination.

It's a particularly uncomfortable position for a candidate like Jeb Bush, who in recent weeks has publicly clashed with Trump. The two men have released attack videos on social media, and openly criticized one another on the trail.

On ABC's ""Good Morning America"" Thursday morning, Bush lashed out at Trump again, saying, ""I think Donald Trump is trying to insult his way to the presidency and it's not going to work.""

However, pressed on whether he would support Trump if he were to become the nominee, the former Florida governor answered in the affirmative.

""Yes, I would, of course. We need to be unified. We need to win,"" Bush said.

Meanwhile, others are raising questions about just how enforceable a loyalty pledge is.

""You're right, it's unenforceable,"" said Carly Fiorina on CNN's ""New Day."" ""It is, more than anything else, your word.""",0.9999999555825847
Normally loquacious Biden hits the road but stays mum on 2016,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/JFspO2hOSe0/story01.htm,reuters,"MIAMi, Fla When you are Joe Biden, it's not easy being quiet.

While the normally loquacious vice president got the feel and taste for the campaign trail during a two-day trip to the political battleground of Florida, he really didn't want to talk about it.

On his first public trip since he began pondering whether to jump into the presidential race, Biden ignored reporters’ shouted questions about his plans and poked fun at the booming media interest in him.

He defended President Barack Obama's nuclear deal with Iran and backed policies to ease economic equality and help the middle class in speeches that would have fit nicely at a Democratic campaign rally.

Biden remained as garrulous as ever. He told Jewish leaders at a gathering on Thursday that he would speak for 10 minutes and then take questions.

He wrapped up more than 40 minutes later, drawing a laugh after promising several times he was making his ""last point.""""I know I've said that a few times,"" he said.Each step of the campaign-style trip, which also featured a Democratic fundraiser and concludes with a foreign policy speech in Atlanta on Thursday night, has been overshadowed by the overriding question: Will he or won't he launch a challenge to former Senate and Cabinet colleague Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Biden joked about his newfound celebrity status, acknowledging that the dozens of camera crews and reporters who greeted him at a Miami community college were not there for his planned talk on education initiatives.

""Their interest in community colleges impresses me,"" he joked to students, gesturing to the media mob. ""I hope that's what they're going to write about.""

The timing of the trip ramped up speculation about his intentions and opened up even his most innocent comments to new interpretations - a potentially dangerous trend for a man known for his verbal gaffes.

""People who aren't willing to risk failure never succeed,"" Biden said during the education speech, in what could be the motto for his deliberations on whether to run for the White House.

Earlier, on a tour of a biotech lab at the college, he told one of the students he preferred to watch rather than help with her experiment.

""I can see the press headline: 'Biden screws up experiment,'"" he said.

Biden, 72, has been huddling with advisers for weeks to determine whether he will challenge Clinton, who has seen her favorability ratings plummet from the fallout over her use of a private email server while working as the nation's top diplomat.

On a conference call with Democratic National Committee members last week, Biden said he was still trying to see if he had the energy and commitment for a campaign. He has been recovering from the death of his son, former Delaware attorney general Beau Biden, from cancer in May.

But his travel schedule is picking up as he nears a decision, with trips to Pittsburgh and an appearance on Stephen Colbert’s talk show scheduled next week.

His trip to south Florida, a Democratic enclave in one of the biggest presidential battleground states, included a fundraiser for the Democratic Senate campaign committee. But Biden didn't even address a possible run, or get asked about it, during that private event, participants said.

And he ignored a well wisher who had some advice for him after his education speech. ""Run, Joe!"" he yelled.

Biden didn't respond.

Gretchen's Take: Will he or won't he? Trump's bid decision,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/IAfTaPZrrSw/gretchens-take-will-or-wont-trumps-bid-decision.html,fox,"Will he or won't he?

GOP front-runner Donald Trump has a big decision to make today. Trump will meet with RNC chair Reince Preibus in New York City about signing the ""pledge"" to promise to support the Republican nominee for president (if it is not Trump) and more importantly for the RNC -- pledge to not run as a third party candidate.

Every other GOP candidate in the field has vowed to sign the pledge or has done so already -- but why wouldn't they? None have the bravado of a Trump to make any kind of a case as an independent voice.

So will Trump do it? I say yes -- especially with Dr. Ben Carson now tied with him for first place at 23 percent in the latest poll out of Iowa.

I also think signing the pledge takes a huge hit away from other candidates at the next GOP debate in two weeks.

If Trump doesn't sign the pledge they could have gone after him for not being a true Republican and handing the election to the Democrats if he decided to run as an independent.

But -- Donald Trump is always full of surprises and defies conventional wisdom almost daily.

Be sure to tune into ""The Real Story"" today at 2 ET to hear Trump himself with his decision.

Sanders campaign cool to O&#8217;Malley&#8217;s more aggressive approach to forcing more debates,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/03/sanders-campaign-cool-to-omalleys-more-aggressive-approach-to-forcing-more-debates/,washpo,"Democratic presidential candidates, from left, Bernie Sanders, Martin O'Malley, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Lincoln Chafee stand on stage during the Iowa Democratic Party's Hall of Fame Dinner, July 17 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) The campaign of presidential hopeful Martin O’Malley has made several unsuccessful overtures to rival Bernie Sanders’s camp in recent weeks to jointly buck the Democratic National Committee’s schedule of six debates. In private conversations, confirmed by aides to both candidates, O’Malley representatives have suggested that both Sanders and O’Malley agree to accept invitations to debates not sanctioned by the DNC in a bid to open up the process, which O’Malley last week characterized as being “rigged” to limit the exposure of front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton. The DNC has threatened to exclude candidates from its debates if they take part in a non-sanctioned gathering. But aides to O’Malley, the former Maryland governor, say they are skeptical of the threat, particularly if Sanders and O’Malley stand up together against the DNC. [O’Malley blasts Democratic leaders for ‘rigged’ 2016 debate process] Though Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont, has been vocal about wanting more debates, aides say his campaign is more reticent to cross the DNC, reasoning that a chance to appear with O'Malley and other lower-polling Democrats is not worth the risk of losing his shots on stage with Clinton. Recent polling has shown Sanders with an apparent lead over Clinton in New Hampshire and closing in on her in Iowa. O'Malley remains mired in the single digits in both early nominating states. ""At the end of the day, I do want to be on the stage with Hillary Clinton,"" Sanders said in an interview last week. Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said Thursday that the campaign’s thinking has not changed in recent days, emphasizing that Sanders would like there to be more debates in which all the Democratic candidates participate [Sanders to Democratic Party elite: Consider me, not Hillary Clinton] Briggs said Sanders would also like to debate Republican candidates, a dynamic that could highlight differences between the competing agendas of the major parties without running afoul of DNC debate rules. O’Malley aides suggest that if both O'Malley and Sanders agree to take part in other debates, it is unlikely that Clinton would skip the gathering. DNC officials defend the debate schedule as a sufficient opportunity to size up candidates against one another, noting that multiple groups will also be hosting less formal forums. Critics of the schedule note that only four of the six debates are scheduled to occur before the Iowa caucuses. On Thursday, DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz declined to answer several questions from reporters on the subject following a meeting she hosted between Vice President Biden and prominent Jewish activists and Democratic donors at a Jewish community center in Davie, Fla. She said she was appearing there only in her role as a Florida congresswoman. O’Malley aides say they have also been heartened by what appears to be growing pressure on the DNC from a variety of sources to open up the schedule. A grass-roots group, for example, has been formed to pressure the party for more debates and plans a demonstration later this month outside DNC headquarters in Washington. [O’Malley forwards a ‘flattering’ Clinton e-mail in an attempt to make a point] O'Malley has made the cry for more debates part of his pitch on the campaign trail for a few weeks now. During an appearance in Hollis, N.H., last week, for example, he told his audience at a house party that Democratic debates would be an effective way to advance issues important to the middle class that are getting drowned out by all the media attention on the Republicans. ""What is our message in the Democratic party?"" O'Malley said. ""It seems our brand is what did Hillary Clinton know about her e-mails and when did she know it, and did she wipe her server or did she not?""

Jeb Bush to unveil tax proposals,http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/jeb-bush-tax-proposals-north-carolina-2016/index.html,cnn,"Hampton, New Hampshire (CNN)Jeb Bush will announce his tax plan next week in Raleigh, North Carolina, the former Florida governor said Thursday.

Speaking in Hampton, New Hampshire, Bush said he'll lay out his tax proposals next Wednesday. The speech marks the next phase of a series of policy address he's already given on government reform and foreign policy.

While he didn't unveil specific details about his plan, he said he wants to lower corporate and personal rates ""as low as you possibly can, eliminating as many of the deductions as you can.""

""The tax code is rife with all sorts of deductions and credits that make people feel compelled to kind of follow the script rather than say I want to invest in this business cause I know if I take recycled plastic bottles and use the right technology with the right workers, that we can out compete China,"" he said.

His remarks came during a campaign event at Foss Manufacturing, which creates polyester fiber out of recycled plastic PET bottles.

""If you create a system where you're providing real incentive to capital investment that you are going to create higher wage jobs and that should be the objective,"" he said.

Bush also drew a contrast with Donald Trump, who favors raising taxes on the wealthy.

Bush spokeswoman Allie Bradenburger said next week's event will take place at Morris & Associates in North Carolina.

""Morris is the sort of small manufacturer that will benefit from Governor Bush's economic policies that will foster an environment to create 19 million news jobs and raise middle-class incomes,"" she said.",0.93819739960048054

"Hillary Clinton's email controversy, explained",http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/hillary-clinton-email-controversy-explained-2016/index.html,cnn,"Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton's email controversy is older than her 2016 presidential campaign -- and it's been forced into the headlines again Thursday and Friday when two top aides testify behind closed doors for a House committee.

The former secretary of state's use of a private email server might not have been broken laws, particularly if her claims that she never knowingly shared information that was classified at the time holds true.

But the Justice Department's investigation, the State Department's processing and release of her emails, a House panel's separate investigation and dozens of impending lawsuits are weighing on the 2016 Democratic presidential front-runner's campaign.

Here's what's happened so far:

News broke in March that Clinton used personal email addresses connected to a privately-owned server, rather than a government email, during her four years as President Barack Obama's first-term secretary of state.

Some previous secretaries of state -- including Colin Powell -- have also used private email accounts, but Clinton's approach was particularly controversial because it's out of step with typical government practice now and gave Clinton a major measure of control over what remains private and what's public.

Clinton's lawyers turned over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department, and the department has since processed those -- releasing some, under a judge's orders, at the end of each month.

But she didn't hand in the server itself until last month, after five months of intense scrutiny over whether she flouted transparency laws or put government secrets at risk.

Clinton has chalked it all up to convenience, saying she preferred not to carry two phones -- one with a personal email address and one with a work email.

There's some legitimacy to that: Government BlackBerrys could only include one address.

But having her own personal server also gave Clinton -- as well as her closest aides -- much greater control over which emails were accessible under public records requests.

Clinton acknowledged, both in March when her private email use was first reported and again in Iowa last month, that it ""clearly wasn't the best choice"" to skip using a government email address.

It's mostly innocuous -- with Clinton asking for scheduling updates, fitting in trips to her hair stylist, checking on a strange trade dispute over gefilte fish and receiving notes about the balance of a career and a family from a top policy aide.

But the emails also offer insight into Clinton's closest contacts. Among them: Sidney Blumenthal, who sent what Clinton has said were unsolicited -- yet were clearly warmly received -- notes with advice and guidance on domestic and international politics.

Many of the emails are, in part or in full, redacted. That makes it tough to tell what behind-the-scenes policy conversations were taking place as Clinton navigated tricky international waters.

Of the 7,000 emails released by the State Department this week, 125 were retroactively classified.

There are laws intended to keep government records transparent -- but one that requires officials to transfer emails sent to private addresses onto government servers wasn't enacted until 2014, after Clinton departed the State Department.

Still, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan suggested last month that Clinton violated government policy and made the process of responding to open records requests more difficult.

""We wouldn't be here today if this employee had followed government policy,"" he said at a hearing on one of the dozens of lawsuits over Clinton's emails.

Looming larger is the question of how classified information was handled -- the subject of a Justice Department investigation and the question that ultimately forced Clinton to turn over her private server to the FBI.

Clinton has insisted she never sent or received information that was classified at the time -- though many of her emails have been classified retroactively as the State Department has prepared them for release.

Probably not, said Anne M. Tomkins, the former U.S. attorney who oversaw the prosecution of Gen. David Petraeus over his having showed classified materials to his mistress and biographer.

Tomkins wrote this week in USA Today that Clinton committed no crime because she didn't ""knowingly"" share classified materials.

""Clinton is not being investigated for knowingly sending or receiving classified materials improperly,"" Tomkins wrote.

""Indeed, the State Department has confirmed that none of the information that has surfaced on Clinton's server thus far was classified at the time it was sent or received,"" she wrote. ""Additionally, the Justice Department indicated that its inquiry is not a criminal one and that Clinton is not the subject of the inquiry.""

All government agencies are responsible for determining which of their own materials are classified.

But Clinton's emails are being reviewed by a team of about 12 interagency officials, who are making recommendations on what should and shouldn't be classified.

State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters in August that ""there's an exhaustive, extensive review process for each and every email, which includes not just State Department reviewers going through them but having intelligence community reviewers with us at the time as we go through them in real-time to help make determinations.""

Kirby added, ""Some of those determinations are fairly easy -- yes or no. Some of them require additional review and discussion.""

It's not just the State Department's email releases forcing fresh headlines about the issue.

The House's Benghazi committee chaired by Rep. Trey Gowdy is calling two top Clinton aides in for closed-door depositions this week. Cheryl Mills, Clinton's State Department chief of staff, will appear Thursday, while policy adviser Jake Sullivan is expected Friday.

Another former State Department employee Bryan Pagliano who worked on Clinton's private email server has informed Congress that he will invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid testifying before the House Select Committee.

Clinton herself will appear before the committee for an open hearing -- one likely to attract the most television cameras of any congressional hearing in recent memory -- on Oct. 22.

There are also dozens of lawsuits seeking Clinton's emails. They range from news organizations like Gawker and The Associated Press to conservative groups like Judicial Watch.

The State Department said Tuesday that it will ask for all of those lawsuits to be consolidated under a single judge.

Among Clinton's biggest challenges in the presidential race is demonstrating her authenticity -- and part of that is showing voters she's trustworthy.

Increasingly, though, voters say they distrust Clinton. The numbers have shifted dramatically since news of her private email server was first reported in March.

Her campaign has shifted tactics in recent weeks, dropping the jokes Clinton had cracked about what she'd once portrayed as a non-issue and sending aides out in an attempt to diffuse the issue in television appearances -- signaling that it's an increasingly serious challenge.",0.99967737470474594
Bush confronted by voter over immigration,http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/jeb-bush-voter-confrontation-immigration/index.html,cnn,"Hampton, New Hampshire (CNN)Just minutes after Jeb Bush bashed Donald Trump in his stump speech on Thursday, Bush was questioned by a frustrated voter on what he would do about illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border.

In the six-minute exchange that grew tense at times, the former Florida governor was asked why he didn't support the idea of cutting off aid or other funds to Mexico until the country does more to stop illegal crossings into the United States.

""They don't do anything about the border. We're being defensive. Why don't we be offensive for once?"" the voter asked, echoing sentiments that have been trumpeted by Trump.

He described himself as ""pissed off"" about the flood of undocumented immigrants and argued that ""they're all criminals because they are breaking the law.""

""(Mexico) should enforce their Southern border -- that I agree with,"" Bush responded, pointing out that most undocumented immigrants who have streamed into the U.S. in recent years have come from Central America.

But Bush argued that a ""wall won't solve this problem.""

RELATED: Jeb Bush to unveil tax proposals next week

While he conceded it makes sense to have a wall in urban areas like in between Juarez and El Paso, Texas, or by San Diego, California, there are other places where it doesn't make sense.

""The notion that another country is going to pay for a wall that we're building is just ludicrous beyond belief,"" he said, referring to Trump's proposal.

Bush went on to lay out his immigration plan, saying he would use technologies at the border to help detect illegal crossings and pointed to his own experience as a ""border governor"" because of migrants who came from the Caribbean to Florida.

He reiterated that he supports earned legal status for those that are already in the country illegally if they meet certain criteria.

The voter, however, argued that the government has already been granting amnesty to too many people.

""You tell me if this is amnesty,"" Bush said, before launching into the requirements he would enforce for anyone wanting legal status.

""You come out from the shadows. You receive a provisional work permit. You pay taxes. You don't receive federal government assistance. You learn English ...You work,"" he said. ""You don't commit crimes ... You earn legal status, not citizenship. That, to me, is the most practical way of dealing with this problem.""

Bush also found himself on defense, standing by his position that most immigrants come to the country out of good intentions -- a position that Trump attacked him on this week with an Instagram video.

""99% of people that come across the border ... are coming to provide for their families. The ones that are criminals, we ought to be kick them out. There's no disagreement about that,"" Bush said. ""To ascribe bad motives people who are trying to provide for their families, I'm not going to change my views on that.""

Earlier in the event, Bush described Trump as a doomsayer who espouses ""pessimistic"" views that are dividing the country by preying on peoples' ""angst and fears.""

""Donald Trump's view is that the end is near,"" Bush said. ""His pessimistic view is let's close the borders, let's create tariffs, let's do this, let's do that--all based on negativity, and the net result is all of us will suffer if that philosophy gains favor.""

His comments come as Bush has stepped up his attacks against his Republican rival.

Bush spent considerable time explaining how the two candidates differ not only on immigration, but on taxes and health care.

""Whatever the issue is, there is one path that is aspirational and hopeful, and there is one path that is negative, and it is not the right path for this country,"" he said. ""So here I am.""

The former governor also ripped into President Barack Obama and Democrats for making immigration a wedge issue.

""You're angry. I'm frustrated. A bunch of people are angry. The left loves it,"" he told the voter. ""They don't care about fixing this problem. President Barack Obama could have fixed this his first year in office...he didn't even lift a finger to do it 'cause they want to win elections.""

Larry Lessig hits the presidential campaign trail,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/03/larry-lessig-just-hit-the-presidential-campaign-trail/,washpo,"He's running. (Courtesy Lessig Equal Citizens Exploratory Committee) SALEM, N.H. -- Larry Lessig has been a Harvard Law professor, an author, an copyright innovator, and the leader of an anti-corruption ""super PAC to end super PACs."" On Wednesday night, he took on a new role: A potential candidate for president, taking a whack at a rival. Standing in an Italian restaurant's dining room, addressing two dozen local Democratic activists, Lessig argued that his Citizens Equality Amendment was the best weapon the party could take into the 2016 election. ""We have an extraordinary opportunity right now to claim a big idea that America can rally around,"" said Lessig, ""as opposed to the idea that everyone should have equal wealth. I agree with Bernie Sanders about that -- there is a terrible inequality in our society. But the reality is, in America, if you stand up and say we become Sweden, America is not going to rally around you. As much as I wish we would, that's not America. But if you stand up and say, citizens should be equal, who is on the other side of that?"" The crowd was not initially on his side. Lessig made a late, surprise entry into the presidential race, saying that he would run to become ""the first referendum president"" -- winning, passing his reform bill, then resigning -- if he raised $1 million by September 8. By the time he said that, a wave had already built behind the democratic socialist presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Sure, Lessig had literally walked through New Hampshire to raise awareness of campaign finance reform. In conversations, many of the Salem Democrats said they'd already gotten behind the Vermont senator. But Lessig, who said he had raised ""around $750,000"" of the needed Kickstarter funds, got a friendly reception. He showed up for his first New Hampshire event since the announcement in his standard traveling TED Talk outfit of black blazer, black pants and blue shirt, fiddled with a temperamental microphone, and got plenty of polite admiration. ""It was fun,"" said Cecilia Cassidy, 66. ""It was like a free lecture at Harvard Law School."" Lessig had a tougher time selling Democrats on the one-term pledge, especially as he praised everyone else running -- even Hillary Clinton. ""I think it's very promising, and it's very clear what his goals are,"" said Valerine Roman, 59. ""Whether he can actually run for president, I'm not sure. He would win, and then resign? I haven't lived my life to watch that sort of thing happen."" [Lawrence Lessig wants to run for president -- in a most unconventional way] Lessig spoke and took questions for an hour, and the topic rarely moved from campaign finance reform. A Monday trip to Ferguson, Missouri, taught Lessig that too many people were being ruined by petty fines, ""taxation by citation,"" and the lesson was that ""the people who pay the taxes are not effectively represented."" The almost-candidate cautioned Democrats not to blame all the ills of the system on the 2011 Citizens United decision. ""Democracy was already dead by then,"" Lessig said. ""The Supreme Court might have shot the body, but the body was already cold."" Everything came back to political money, and the failure of current candidates to address it before they addressed anything else. Lessig noted that former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley had issued a 15-point itinerary for a first presidential term, and ""campaign reform came in at number 15."" Exactly wrong, said Lessig. ""Bernie Sanders put it at number eight on his list,"" he added, ""and after we made our announcement it went to number two. Okay. That was a little better."" On the way into the speech, Lessig had noticed a Donald Trump bumper sticker on someone's car. The owner of the car, a man unironically wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" baseball cap, occasionally ambled over to the open dining room to hear what the fuss was about. ""I'll say this about Donald Trump,"" said Lessig. ""As much as I think his views about immigrants are vile -- immigrants are some of the hardest-working people in our country, and in my view they should be citizens -- and his views about women are outrageous; when he stands on the Republican debate stage and says 'I own you guys,' Republicans begin to acknowledge that this money is corrupting our democracy. That is progress. That is hopeful."" At 8 p.m., an hour after the presentation started, Lessig apologized -- he had to make a 9:30 train from Boston to New York. On the way to a car, accompanied by a single aide, Lessig gave a positive assessment of his audience, and said they'd proved Brookings Institution scholar Thomas Mann wrong. ""I thought that they were right there with every step,"" he said. ""They could see the value of talking about this in a more fundamental and elevated wall. Tom Mann says that what Donald Trump and I are doing is dumbing down this campaign -- I think I'm elevating it, getting out of this partisan squabble. The equality thing that Bernie Sanders is pushing -- I personally love it. But I don't think it's an idea that's going to resonate across America, the way this one will.""",0.99944993412300565
"Committee grills Clinton aides, ramps up email scrutiny",http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/hillary-clinton-bryan-pagliano-cheryl-mills/index.html,cnn,"Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton says her use of a private email server didn't break the law -- but she could be damaged by a former State Department employee's refusal to testify before Congress about it.

Two of Clinton's top State Department staffers, chief of staff Cheryl Mills and policy aide Jake Sullivan, are answering questions behind closed doors Thursday and Friday from the House's committee investigating Benghazi.

But Bryan Pagliano, who worked on Clinton's private email server, tried to fend off a subpoena by telling lawmakers Monday that he'll invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination rather testify.

In doing so, he raised the specter of criminal actions -- even if only out of caution.

That could create a fresh opening for Clinton's opponents in the 2016 presidential race to attack her, this time citing a former staffer's actions rather than leveling their own charges, like Donald Trump's suggestion that the controversy surrounding Clinton's emails could force the end of her campaign.

Clinton's aides sought to minimize the damage, saying they'd encouraged Pagliano to testify because he has nothing to hide.

""We had hoped Bryan would also agree to answer any questions from the committee, and had recently encouraged him to grant the committee's request for an interview,"" a Clinton aide told CNN.

""Bryan is an utter professional and a wonderful young man who does not live in the public eye and understandably may not wish to be drawn into a political spectacle,"" the aide said. ""So his decision is both understandable and yet also disappointing to us, because we believe he has every reason to be transparent about his IT assistance.""

A Clinton aide said full cooperation has been encouraged with the Benghazi investigation.

""From the beginning, Hillary Clinton has continued to encourage cooperation even as the committee's inquiry has ventured beyond the events at Benghazi, which had been the original scope of its mandate, to also include her use of a personal email account,"" a Clinton aide said. ""Already, several of Clinton's senior-most aides from the State Department are scheduled to give interviews to the committee, as Clinton herself will do at an open hearing in October.""

Even without Pagliano's testimony, the House panel will hold several hearings connected to Clinton's private email server.

Mills is on Capitol Hill on Thursday, and Sullivan is due Friday. Both hearings are private -- a decision made by the committee's chairman, Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, despite Mills' request for hers to be made public amid fears that Republicans will selectively leak bits and pieces.

""We have not had a public interview with any other witness, and is there a myriad of reasons for that ... not the least of which is, if you're serious about getting the most amount of information, you're going to do it in a transcribed interview session not a public session,"" Gowdy told reporters Thursday outside the hearing room.

The committee's top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings, disagreed with Gowdy's decision and said he hoped that her entire transcript would be released immediately.

""This has turned into a derail Clinton mission,"" he said just outside the hearing room. ""$4 million in taxpayer money spent, and not looking at the issues we should be looking at.""

Clinton herself is due to answer the committee's questions publicly on October 22.

The contents of Clinton's emails have increasingly come into the committee's focus as it seeks evidence that members argue might have been deleted from a private server, but would have been maintained had Clinton used a government email account.

The committee's meetings with Clinton and her aides come as the Justice Department investigates whether Clinton's emails contained classified information -- and whether that information was kept secure.

Clinton has insisted she never sent or received information that was classified at the time -- though many of her emails have been classified retroactively as the State Department has prepared them for release.

Responding to dozens of open records requests, the department is releasing new batches of emails at the end of each month.

Before Clinton's emails are released, though, they are being reviewed by a team of about 12 inter-agency officials, who are making recommendations on what should and shouldn't be classified.

State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters in August that ""there's an exhaustive, extensive review process for each and every email, which includes not just State Department reviewers going through them but having intelligence community reviewers with us at the time as we go through them in real-time to help make determinations.

""Some of those determinations are fairly easy -- yes or no. Some of them require additional review and discussion,"" Kirby said.

Legion of Tech Volunteers Lead a Charge for Bernie Sanders,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/us/politics/bernie-sanders-presidential-campaign-tech-supporters.html,nyt,"Dawn crept into Daniela Perdomo’s Brooklyn apartment, her bleary eyes still focused on her bright computer screen. The founder of a nearly three-year-old communications start-up, she had been up all night again, orchestrating the work of more than 100 other developers, web designers, researchers and writers.

But they were not working for Ms. Perdomo’s company. They were not even getting paid. Instead, the all-night sessions were devoted to the Aug. 12 unveiling of FeeltheBern.org — a website they created to explain Bernie Sanders’s positions on issues in the 2016 presidential campaign.

Throughout the summer, a largely unseen legion of technology professionals across the country — software developers and designers, product managers and more — have been moonlighting online on Mr. Sanders’s behalf. They have been applying their initiative, creativity, organizational skills and, above all, technical prowess in their off hours to support an underdog candidate who has been more than grateful for the help.

They have built interactive maps of campaign events and are working on an automated flier generator to spit out polished promotional materials with a few clicks. They have set up an app to let volunteers and staff members at Mr. Sanders’s huge rallies use iPads to collect donations by swiping supporters’ credit cards. They have pioneered a tool to pair volunteers with lists of voters to call, automating what otherwise requires many paid campaign workers. And they have built dozens of websites for supporters of Mr. Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, like Ms. Perdomo’s FeeltheBern.org.

Like so many online minutemen, they have given Mr. Sanders an enormous lift in his campaign for the Democratic nomination. But this is no ragtag militia: The people who have enlisted include top-flight digital talent.

“It really blows me away,” Mr. Sanders said of the coders donating their services. “The volunteers we’ve mobilized all over this country, especially all the young people, are helping our campaign move to the next level.”

Indeed, while every political campaign relies on the enthusiasm of youthful volunteers, Mr. Sanders has quickly — and effortlessly — tapped into an unexpectedly large and capable cadre of computer jockeys with years and years of experience. They came forward of their own volition, with hundreds joining a Coders for Sanders thread on Reddit. And they organized themselves so thoroughly that one built an Internet “bot” to help match newcomers to tasks appropriate to their skills.

They are a diverse bunch, too: Ms. Perdomo said FeeltheBern.org grew to 125 volunteers “from every demographic I could imagine.” They include former aides to Mitt Romney, self-described libertarians, high school students (“Because I’m young, I can’t vote, so this is a great way to get involved,” said Justin Zheng, 14, of San Mateo, Calif.) and even an Australian programmer, Jordie Bodlay, who said that a Sanders administration would indirectly improve his own life in Sydney. Nearly everyone interviewed had never been politically involved before, and most cited Mr. Sanders’s views on issues like income inequality or his unconventional style of campaigning.

Most are younger than 35, members of the so-called millennial generation, one that has been dismissed at times as too focused on “hashtag activism,” lazily posting harangues on social media while shying away from the difficult work of organizing. But several who described themselves as introverted to begin with said the chance to do valuable political work from the sanctuary of their computers was irresistible.

“When the opportunity came along to do something I love doing anyway, to make a difference somewhere, I’ll always jump on that boat,” said Rob Pieta, 23, a mobile developer in Illinois.

Kenneth Pennington, the digital director for the Sanders campaign, said features like the donation app, which incorporates the Square credit card processing software, were “the kind of tech that other organizations would pay expensive app developers for.”

But Federal Election Commission regulations treat donated tech work like “the 21st-century equivalent of having volunteers build a stage for a campaign event,” said Brett G. Kappel, a partner at the law firm Akerman LLP and an expert on campaign law. “As long as the volunteers aren’t compensated for their services by anyone, their work is not considered an in-kind contribution.”

Other gifts to the Sanders campaign that could have cost tens of thousands of dollars on the open market include a custom interactive map of events and rallies, which wound up on the campaign website to promote a national organizing day and continues to be highlighted there.

“They asked, ‘What do you want for it?’ and I said, ‘Nothing,’ ” said Ralph Castillo, a software engineer from Queens who built the map over one weekend. “ ‘I just want my husband and me to meet Bernie.’ ”

The stampede of coders to Mr. Sanders’s aid can be traced to Kyle Pierce, a mobile software developer who, on a whim, created the Coders for Sanders thread on Reddit in June.

“I have a decent amount of free time, and I can put together a website in a few hours,” Mr. Pierce said. He said he was curious to see if he had much company. Within weeks, hundreds more had joined in.

Their buzzing nerve center is not on Reddit, though, but on Slack, an online chat program popular in the tech world, where the volunteers brainstorm at all hours, ask for help on projects, swap code and design mock-ups.

To help speed the integration of new volunteers, Atticus White, a 26-year-old developer from Boston, built a bot — an app programmed to respond to chat commands — that points users in the right direction. The tuxedo-avatared-app, @butler, begins a conversation with new arrivals (often peppered with an encouraging “Awesome” or “Great”) about their skills and points them toward suitable projects.

Slack is also the volunteers’ pipeline back to the campaign. Sanders aides check in regularly there, offering feedback, encouragement, requests and guidance, like asking those building the flier generator to make sure that union shops were hired to do the printing. Aides also ask that new sites be designed differently from the campaign’s own and include disclaimers saying they have no official tie to Mr. Sanders.

Unaffiliated or not, builders of those websites are free to amplify on Mr. Sanders’s campaign message: “We’re regular people, unassociated with any super PACs or billionaires,” says the fine print at FeeltheBern.org.

Ms. Perdomo said she had been spurred to seek out coders who shared her admiration for Mr. Sanders after she contributed to his campaign and was laughed at. “I was telling friends that I donated this money and they should do it, too, and I got a bunch of L.O.L.’s back saying, ‘He’s great and everything, but I don’t see it happening,’ ” she said.

Her website had more than a million page views in its first two weeks.

As their projects take off, or become absorbed by the Sanders campaign, the coders keep coming back for more. The volunteers who worked with Ms. Perdomo, for example, now are putting together a message board to help people car-pool to campaign events.

“There were too many nights when I would go to sleep with the sun coming up, and I felt like a zombie and would question my sanity,” Ms. Perdomo said with a laugh. “But now, it’s so worth it.”",0.99714927310130486
