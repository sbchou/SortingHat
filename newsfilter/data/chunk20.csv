"NEW YORK The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation's flagship health project changed its mind again on Wednesday on the matter of its erroneous tax returns, saying it would refile them with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service after all.
The Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) said the decision to refile its 2012 and 2013 returns was in response to ""recent media interest."" 
Its brief statement made no mention of Republican criticism earlier in the week, when CHAI said it had decided against refiling the returns, known as form 990s. That, in turn, was a switch from the spring, when it said it would refile them after Reuters discovered it had misreported funding sources by millions of dollars.
""As previously stated, the minor errors on the 2012 and 2013 CHAI 990s are immaterial and do not require refiling, yet in response to recent media interest in the forms, CHAI has decided to refile the returns in order to be fully transparent,"" CHAI spokeswoman Maura Daley said in the statement.
With Hillary Clinton viewed as the favorite to become the Democratic nominee in the November, 2016, presidential election, Republicans have attacked her family's globe-straddling charities. 
The charities have received millions of dollars of funding from foreign governments for their work on health and environmental projects. Republicans and other critics say this is an insoluble conflict of interest for a would-be U.S. president. CHAI is best known for helping reduce the cost of HIV drugs in the developing world.
Clinton has said her family's charities do worthy work and disclose more information about the donors than the law requires, mitigating that concern. 
But she has not addressed the charities' admission to Reuters earlier this year that they did not comply with an ethics agreement Clinton signed with Barack Obama's incoming presidential administration in 2008 in order for her to become secretary of state. That agreement required the names of every donor be published annually, with the State Department ethicists screening new funding from foreign governments. The charities did not do this or did so incompletely, citing ""oversights"".
On Tuesday, Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee's chairman, sent a letter calling on the IRS to audit CHAI and to compel the charity to amend the errors. On Wednesday, he responded to CHAI's decision to refile by saying an audit remained the only way to ensure all foreign government funding had been accounted for.
""CHAI has failed to comply with federal tax rules or the ethics agreement the Clintons negotiated with the Obama Administration,"" he said in a statement, ""and re-filing erroneous returns seven months after the fact amid political pressure is hardly a show of good faith.""
The IRS is barred by law from discussing specific cases. Spokesmen for Hillary Clinton did not respond to questions about the charities.
CHAI says the total amount of donations was correctly reported to the IRS in 2012 and 2013, but that the breakdown for how much came from government sources compared to non-government donors was incorrect. 
Charities do not pay taxes on their donations, but must complete tax returns and make them public to demonstrate compliance with assurances made to get tax-exempt status.

"WASHINGTON Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders on Wednesday unveiled a climate-change bill that would crack down on fossil fuel extraction, a move sure to please activists who want party front-runner Hillary Clinton to make the same commitment.
Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, wants to halt new leases for fossil fuel extraction on public lands and for offshore drilling in the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico. He would prohibit drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic Ocean.
Sanders pushed for the proposal at a rally at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, alongside environmental leaders such as Bill McKibben, co-founder of the grassroots climate group 350.org.
The bill, which Sanders introduced with a fellow Democrat, U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, will face fierce opposition in the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and is unlikely to become law. 
But it should help Sanders appeal to environmental activists and could pressure Clinton, who has said that abruptly halting extraction on federal lands would disrupt the U.S. economy.
""You can't talk the talk...and at the same time say we are going to extract,"" Sanders said on Wednesday, adding that the U.S. must protect workers as it moves away from fossil fuels.
Sanders, who calls himself a democratic socialist, has been Clinton's main rival to be the party's nominee for president in the November 2016 elections. 
His liberal stances on the environment, trade and more have pressured Clinton to move to the left on those issues. Still, polls have shown the former U.S. secretary of state appeared to gain ground against Sanders after a strong showing in October.
Climate activists want Clinton to commit to be tougher on environmental issues if she is elected president. 
Clinton told an activist at a New Hampshire town hall in July that it would be irresponsible to abruptly halt oil, natural gas and coal extraction on federal lands. She instead called for phasing it out and increasing fees on companies operating on public lands.
""We still have to run our economy, we still have to turn on the lights,"" Clinton said.
Clinton in August opposed Arctic oil exploration, putting her at odds with the Obama administration, which had just given Royal Dutch Shell PLC final approval to resume drilling off the coast of northern Alaska.

"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump has officially filed for New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary -- and he took more shots at Marco Rubio's personal finances while he was at it. 
Trump, a Republican front-runner, and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, a Democratic long-shot, were the first two candidates to file for a primary expected to be slated for February 9, submitting their paperwork Wednesday. 
The real estate mogul used his appearance at the New Hampshire statehouse to bash one of his chief rivals: Rubio, the Florida senator who has surged in the polls on the heels of strong debate performances and is due to file in the state on Thursday. 
RELATED: Marco Rubio dismisses questions about his finances
Trump pointed to Rubio's use of a Florida GOP credit card during his tenure as the state's House speaker, as well as Rubio's personal finances, which were also the subject of a New York Times article in June.
""Marco Rubio has a disaster on his finances -- he has a disaster on his credit cards,"" Trump said. 
""When you check his credit cards, take a look at what he has done with the Republican Party when he had access, what he had to put back in, and whether or not something should have happened,"" he said. ""You'll understand it. Marco Rubio has a basic disaster on finance."" 
RELATED: Live from New York, it's Donald Trump!
Rubio defended his credit card use Wednesday on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" saying it was a charge card -- with its balance paid off each month -- and that he paid for his own expenses.
And later on Fox News, Rubio pointed out that his use of the card was also the subject of attacks in his 2010 Senate race against Charlie Crist. 
""I was secured under my personal credit and it was in conjunction with the Republican Party, and every month, I would go through the bills and if there was something on there, I'd pay it to American Express, and if it was the party's, the party paid for it,"" Rubio said. ""And the media convoluted all of this and it creates these stories.""
Trump's trip to Concord was a symbolic nod to the state's importance in the presidential nominating process. 
RELATED: With New Hampshire filing opening Wednesday, Bill Gardner is ready
Anyone can run in the state's primary -- as long as they have $1,000 plus the necessary paperwork. New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner, in office since 1976, has tentatively set February 9 as the state's election date but is waiting to be sure no other states will move their primaries earlier to challenge the Granite State's prominence.

"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump and Ben Carson continue to dominate the GOP presidential field, according to a new national poll. 
About half of those surveyed supported either Trump or Carson, with Trump earning 26% support and the prominent neurosurgeon 23%, according to a Fox News survey released Wednesday. 
Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz each earned 11% support, followed by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul each with 4% support. Former tech CEO Carly Fiorina garnered 3% and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie just 2%.
The last batch of public polling has shown similar groupings, with Carson and Trump dominating the rest of the Republican field. The Fox poll is also the second straight survey that Bush, a former front-runner, with only 4% support.
The entire Fox survey was fielded November 1-3, after the last CNBC debate, where Rubio and Cruz impressed. The poll surveyed 476 registered Republican voters has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.

" (AP) â Republican Jeb Bush's campaign revival tour is getting louder and more colorful as he charges across early voting states with a can-do slogan, a tour bus and critiques of rivals who have become threats to his claim as the GOP mainstream favorite.
""We're Americans, dammit!"" he shouted Wednesday at a pharmacy in Hollis, N.H., as he complained that the U.S. was not leading in key foreign policy disputes.
He saved special words for Donald Trump, the former reality show star who remains a leader in the unpredictable GOP nomination fight.
""A president can't say 'You're fired,' and go to commercial break,"" Bush told more than 100 people at a senior center in Raymond, New Hampshire, Tuesday night. ""A president has to roll up their damn sleeves and get to work.""
A night earlier, his voice showed signs of strain as he railed against what he called anemic economic growth.
""That means more people stuck in poverty. That means one in five children on food stamps,"" Bush said, raising his voice during an event Tuesday in Rye, N.H. ""That's the new normal. I hope you agree with this: we need to reject that out of hand. And we can do it.""
The volume and feeling reflect the urgency of Bush's drive to push his campaign into a winning position ahead of the first votes of the GOP nomination fight in Feb. Once seen as the probable favorite, Bush's viability has never really thrived in the face of unexpectedly strong support from outsiders Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who are leading the pack. Also a thorn for Bush: Marco Rubio, his onetime protege, who has approached the dynamics as an opportunity to win over the GOP establishment turned off by Trump and Carson.
Bush took a more restrained tone on Rubio, with whom he'd clashed in last week's debate.
""He hasn't changed the culture in Washington,"" Bush told reporters aboard his campaign bus. He refused to answer questions on Rubio's personal spending habits, which had had come up during last week's debate.
""It's not my job to worry about that,"" Bush said.
Priority No. 1 for Bush, acknowledged even by him, is injecting some life into his campaign. That has meant a new motto â ""Jeb Can Fix It âa heavier travel schedule to early voting states and more attention-grabbing performances. After New Hampshire this week, he'll tour South Carolina.
Traveling in a blue tour bus with the slogan plastered on its side, Bush stopped Wednesday at a Manchester area school in the morning, the pharmacy in Hollis later and was headlining a law enforcement and drug abuse roundtable in Goffstown in the early afternoon. He was headed north to the lake country for two events later in the day. Bush plans to wrap up the three-day visit Thursday.
During a Republican debate in Colorado last week, Bush criticized Rubio for missing Senate action as he campaigns for president. Bush joked that the Senate's schedule was hardly demanding by suggesting it was akin to ""a French workweek.""
Traveling with reporters in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Bush joked that comparing the French to Congress was really unfair to the French. ""I really did a disservice to the French,"" he said, according to multiple press reports.",,"MANCHESTER, N.H.

It is hard to overstate the importance of New Hampshire for the presidential hopes of Jeb Bush. He entered the year as the clear frontrunner. Now, after months of unfocused answers in interviews, unimpressive performances in the three GOP debates, and a general lack of enthusiasm on the campaign trail, he's in the middle of the pack in polls and stunned to be looking up at the likes of Donald Trump and Ben Carson. And with the New Hampshire primary barely three months away, he arrives in the state knowing that it's his best chance to re-establish his credibility and get his campaign back on track. Unlike other moments in recent weeks and months when Bush needed to demonstrate to voters and his donors, that he wants to be president and is ready to fight for the nomination, Tuesday was marked by a Jeb Bush who seemed relaxed, confident, substantive — even enjoying himself. At an informal town hall and BBQ in the small town of Rye, near the coast, more than 200 people packed a barn where Bush spoke. Some climbed a ladder to the upper loft to get a better view of the speech.

Bush laughed out loud when a man asked his question in a raspy voice, explaining the he's allergic to leaves, a problem in the otherwise gorgeous Fall season in New England. A couple hours later, some 30 minutes away at a town hall at a senior citizen center in Raymond there were some clear signs of a campaign looking to get back on track. When an audience member complimented Bush's father, President George H.W. Bush, the candidate remarked ""If I could have all of the people that love my dad and I could have half of the people who don't like me, I'd probably come out ahead on that pretty good."" He described his opponents in the race not by name, but as ""the big personalities on the stage"" who ""think they have it all figured out"" when it comes to the nation's problems. He said our politics are a mirror image of our culture, before adding ""It's a circus mirror, okay."" He said that the nation can again have an approach to politics where people who disagree can work together to build consensus. 

It's a circus mirror, okay.


Jeb Bush, on politics being a mirror image of culture


One of those ""big personalities"" is Donald Trump, of course, who belittles Bush as ""low energy"" or as someone who falls asleep at the microphone. At the Raymond event, 66-year-old retiree Richard Caron stood up and asked about entitlements, and punctuated his question with a cheeky ""by the way, good energy tonight."" The crowd — and Bush — laughed, before the candidate retorted that he actually has good energy every night. For the record, Caron said his line was a joke. He doesn't think Bush's performance in debates and on the trail has been low energy.

No political consultant could write an ad as glowing as billionaire Paul Singer's email for Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio. ""He is ready to be an informed and assertive decision-maker,"" Singer wrote in the email, which was first published by the New York Times. He went on for nearly two pages about Rubio: ""his youth and vigor.... his unmatched ability to articulate a public argument.... the best explainer of conservatism in public life today."" What makes Singer's email noteworthy is its author. Singer was the Republicans' top individual donor in the 2014 elections, giving $11.5 million, based on federal data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. A cornerstone of Wall Street conservatism, he founded the cautious and successful hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. So far this year, the Federal Election Commission has logged $3.4 million in Singer money. He's given to dozens of congressional campaigns, plus $250,000 to Future 45, a new anti-Clinton superPAC, and another $250,000 to the opposition-research superPAC America Rising. Most notably, Singer this year has sent more than $1 million to American Unity PAC, which he established three years ago as a pioneering voice among conservatives for LBGT rights. But there's something he hasn't done, nor have many other top donors. He hasn't started pumping money into the superPAC of a chosen presidential contender. Now, however, the crowded field of candidates has begun to thin out, and the Iowa caucuses are less than three months away. Singer's endorsement of Rubio may mark the awakening of the upper-echelon donor class. ""Paul Singer is a real opinion leader,"" said Darrell West of the Brookings Institution, author of the book Billionaires. ""He's someone with lots of political experience. People respect him within Republican circles. He's been very active."" And he has that email list, reaching others in the Republican establishment. Singer declined to comment for this story. But his move isn't a complete surprise. Last April he gave Rubio's campaign committee $2,700, the legal limit for the primaries. Other top donors from the 2014 cycle have also given small sums to presidential candidates. Marlene Ricketts, wife of Joe Ricketts, founder of AmeriTrade, gave $4.9 millon to a superPAC for Scott Walker, who has since withdrawn. Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam have written checks to Lindsey Graham and Rubio, plus an earlier PAC for Rubio – just over $20,000 in all. Their totals from the last presidential race, in 2012, give a hint of what might come: The Adelsons gave $93 million, mainly to the superPAC backing Newt Gingrich's White House bid, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Joe and Marlene Ricketts gave $13 million. Singer's more cautious giving totaled $3.7 million.

"Paul Sracic is chair of the Department of Politics and International Relations at Youngstown State University in Ohion and co-author of ""Ohio Government and Politics."" The views expressed are his own.
 (CNN)Commentators were virtually unanimous in their praise of Marco Rubio's performance at last week's Republican debate. In particular, the freshman senator from Florida was lauded for more than holding his own in a testy exchange with his former friend and mentor, Jeb Bush, over his poor voting attendance record in the U.S. Senate. 
But was his evening-defining comeback as smart as many have said?
The key moment came early in the debate, when Bush accused Rubio of shirking his responsibilities to his constituents, suggesting that he ought to resign. Rubio shot back that Bush hadn't been critical of John McCain's 2008 presidential run, which had seen the Arizonan senator missing numerous Senate votes.
On one level, this was a clever response by Rubio (and probably one he had ready in advance -- Bush had telegraphed the attack in interviews before the debate). 
The response allowed the Florida senator to attack Bush for attacking him (in the world of politics this somehow makes sense). And, having established that Bush did not really have a problem with absentee senators, Rubio stated that Bush only brought the issue up because he wanted to score political points. Rubio then pivoted to the high ground, suggesting that he himself is only interested in attacking Democrats.
Yet despite the plaudits, Rubio's response was actually pretty terrible. 
The first and most obvious problem with Rubio's answer is that it was no answer at all. Pointing out that ""everybody else does it"" is more a childish retort than a valid explanation. If the senator worked for a company and his supervisor criticized him for not showing up, would it be sufficient for him to answer that other employees had missed work in the past and no one had said anything?  
Whether he likes it or not, Rubio agreed to be the voice for Florida residents on the floor of the Senate. But keep in mind that Rubio was often absent from the Senate even before he announced that he was running for president. 
For example, in 2014, Rubio missed 36 votes, or about one out of every 10 votes that were taken. In comparison, Rubio's fellow senators on the main debate stage, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, missed, respectively, 28 votes and 7 votes. 
Even as the campaign has heated up for all the candidates, Rubio's absences have still outstripped those of his colleagues -- Rubio has missed over half of the 76 votes that have occurred since the start of July. In comparison, Ted Cruz has missed just under a quarter of the votes, and Rand Paul about 15% of them.
This should matter to Republican voters, who have been throwing their support behind nontraditional candidates such as Donald Trump and Ben Carson largely out of fatigue with the ""political class."" Those who are in the government are thought to be out of touch with everyday Americans. What better evidence could there be of this that politicians -- and senators being paid $174,000 per year -- can simply decide they are too busy with other things to turn up to work?
Rubio's chronic absence from Senate votes is also directly tied to his biggest weakness as a candidate: his thin and completely political resume. 
Rubio is a career politician -- a ""man in a hurry,"" as one of the moderators prefaced a question on Wednesday -- and so his only real argument for higher office is his brief performance in his current and previous offices. True, Rubio did serve as speaker for the Florida House of Representatives. But this hardly seems adequate training to be the next leader of the free world.  
So Rubio's incomplete Senate term is what we have to judge him on, including all those missed votes. 
Of course, his defenders will note that from 2011 until 2013, Rubio missed only about 5% of votes, but this is still above the median of less than 2% for all senators now serving, and it doesn't change the fact that Rubio missed 36 votes last year, presumably as he geared up to run. In contrast, in 2006, the year before launching her first campaign for president, Hillary Clinton missed only four votes, while her opponent for the nomination, Barack Obama, missed only three votes. 
If Rubio had been in the Senate longer, perhaps 2014 could be dismissed as an anomaly. As it stands, however, it is nearly a quarter of the record that we have for him. It is therefore understandable that other candidates might want to make this an issue during the primaries. 
Next Tuesday, during the next Republican debate, Sen. Rubio's colleagues will have an opportunity to challenge him again. Let's see whether they do a better job of it than Jeb Bush.

"Donald J. Trump has mockingly accused Sheldon Adelson, a casino developer and one of the biggest Republican megadonors, of wanting a “puppet” to back when it was reported that Mr. Adelson was considering throwing his support to Senator Marco Rubio. 

But Mr. Trump, many weeks ago, called Mr. Adelson to talk about the state of the race, according to a person told of the discussion, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to characterize the conversation publicly. 

Mr. Adelson has told associates in the weeks since that conversation, which took place over the summer, according to the person briefed, that he considered the outreach an effort by Mr. Trump to secure his support. 

Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said he could neither confirm nor deny any private conversations that Mr. Trump might have had. A spokesman for Mr. Adelson did not respond to requests for comment. 

During the conversation, the person briefed on the discussion said, Mr. Adelson told Mr. Trump that his most important issue when considering a candidate is the safety of Israel. Mr. Trump then emphasized his personal and family ties to the Jewish community in New York.

Mr. Adelson could be a troublesome foe for Mr. Trump, or anyone, should he line up behind a rival candidate. He spent more than $20 million backing the former House Speaker Newt Gingrich’s presidential bid in 2012. 

But when a report in Politico late last month indicated that Mr. Adelson was leaning toward Mr. Rubio, Mr. Trump took to Twitter, his preferred medium, and wrote: “Sheldon Adelson is looking to give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet. I agree!” 

Mr. Adelson remains uncommitted to a  candidate, and people with whom he has spoken recently say he is not immediately planning on an endorsement. But Mr. Adelson is known as being  mercurial about his political leanings.",MAGGIE HABERMAN,"This summer, Mr. Trump called Mr. Adelson, who spent more than $20 million backing Newt Gingrich’s presidential campaign in 2012, to talk about the state of the race, according to a person told of the discussion.",First Draft: Donald Trump Is Said to Have Reached Out to the Megadonor Sheldon Adelson,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/04/donald-trump-is-said-to-have-reached-out-to-the-megadonor-sheldon-adelson/,"[u'immigration', u'personality', u'foreign policy/national security']","[u'Corey Lewandowski', u'Sheldon Adelson', u'Donald Trump', u'Marco Rubio', u'Donald J.

"In a fascinating (and, for some, frustrating) year in politics, the latest polls, including this week’s Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey, provide some telling insights into the trajectory of the 2016 presidential race. I see five key points that give us a sense of where things are going:
1. While Hillary Clinton has solidified her lead and standing among Democratic primary voters, she remains unlikeable to and distrusted by most Americans. Those likeability and trustworthy numbers didn’t move despite all the “success” she has had in the last month. Add to that the fact that two-thirds of the country believe we are on the wrong track, with an incumbent Democratic president with a 49% disapproval at the helm, and it appears she is a weak November candidate (in some ways weaker than a Bernie Sanders candidacy).
2. Donald Trump and Ben Carson continue to solidify their positions as dominant players in the GOP primary. Between the two of them, they represent more than 50% of Republican voters. My question from August still stands: Is the GOP on the verge of nominating an unelectable November candidate as Republicans did in 1964 with Barry Goldwater?
3. This GOP race is coming into a much firmer structure, with three dominant candidates running in the outsider lane (Mr. Trump, Mr. Carson, and Ted Cruz) and three or four in the more establishment lane (Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, and John Kasich). Someone will emerge as the leader in each lane and ultimately face off against the other in the spring of 2016. Today it looks like that will be Sen. Rubio for the establishment; right now, Mr. Carson is leading the outsider lane, but Mr. Cruz could come on strong soon. Sen. Rubio is highly popular among Cruz and Carson voters so if their numbers drop he is likely to be the beneficiary.
4. Jeb Bush is in an incredibly difficult position. He has campaigned everywhere, has a huge organization, and spent millions on television ads–and the numbers haven’t moved. This goes to a simple point: Money matters much less this year, and TV ads are ineffective. And when you look at head-to-head numbers in a GOP primary, the only person Mr. Trump beats one on one is Mr. Bush by 18 points. In addition, Mr. Bush is very unpopular among Carson, Trump, and Cruz voters. He has no real way to grow support.
5. Americans are very frustrated with our government and political institutions, and a majority think the systems are stacked against them. Voters are upset with both political parties, and it looks like each party may be on the verge of nominating “unelectable” candidates to face off next November. And so, having only a choice between the two parties, the generic ballot for president and for Congress is tied. Right now, no one is getting rewarded in this debate.
While the recent polling begins to give us a shape for this presidential contest, a number of twist and turns are likely before the Iowa caucuses are held in 90 days. So far, debates seem to have had more impact than any other events in the campaign. With several GOP and Democratic debates on the horizon, candidates have an opportunity to shift the trajectory with their performance on-stage. Fasten your seat belt.

"Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House. He is a consultant to the pro-Hillary Clinton super-PAC Priorities USA Action. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.
 (CNN)Back in July, when Donald Trump was first insulting his way to the top of the polls, I told CNN's Anderson Cooper, ""He speaks for a lot of people.  The Republican base: the technical term [is] they're crazy.  And he speaks to the crazy base voters.""    
That description of the GOP base has been borne out.  I believe what's driving the GOP base crazy is anger.  Anger at stagnant wages, anger at immigration and the changing demography of the U.S., anger at losing the culture wars, at seeing gay marriage enshrined in the Constitution.  These people are ticked off.
They are, as Howard Beale said in Network ""as mad as hell, and ... not going to take this anymore.""  For some, this anger crosses into despair: Hence the study released this week about the spike in mortality rates for middle-aged white people, primarily those with a high school degree or less. The study showed a spike in diseases of despair: alcoholism and alcohol-related liver disease, drug addiction and poisoning and suicide.  When a sizeable chunk of America is driven to deadly despair, attention must be paid.
Some of those not driven to the point of drugs and death are driven to, umm, eccentric political expression:  
-- Matt Bevin was a fringe nut a few years ago, getting creamed by Mitch McConnell (whose spokesman called him an ""East Coast con man""). Now he's governor-elect of the great Commonwealth of Kentucky after a campaign in which he embraced Kim Davis, the controversial anti-gay-marriage county clerk, and promised to eliminate the expanded Medicaid program under Obamacare.  Bevin once spoke at a rally in support of -- get this -- cockfighting.  He later apologized, but the message was sent: If you're into cockfighting, I'm your man. 
-- Ben Carson compares pretty much everything he doesn't like to slavery and Hitler. He's leading in the national polls.   
-- Donald Trump says America is ""crippled,""  has asserted that many Mexican migrants are murderers and rapists, and that John McCain is not a war hero because he was a POW.  And he has led in the polls for months, now basically tied with Carson.  I am old enough to remember when Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, was a right-wing crackpot leading the charge to impeach my boss, President Bill Clinton. Today he isn't even crazy enough to make it onto the main stage at the debates.  
-- In my beloved hometown of Houston, anti-gay, anti-transgender zealots prevailed in a referendum to repeal the city's equal rights ordinance.  Never mind that most major cities have such an ordinance. The conspiratorial right told Houstonians that equal rights would mean men could pee in the ladies room.  I am not kidding.  Worse, a sizeable majority of Houston voters fell for it.  They could have called their cousin in, say, Dallas (hardly a hotbed of PC excess) and asked him, ""Hey, Buford, y'all got any guys peein' in front of your daughters?  No?  OK.  Just wonderin'.""
I know it is fashionable -- actually, required -- to pretend that both parties' bases are equally crazy.  But that is simply not the case.  Sure, there are some loopy lefties out there, but even Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders is not, for example, calling for nationalizing the oil companies or socializing the banks.  
No Democratic presidential candidate is saying Ted Cruz can't be president because he was born in Canada.  No progressive is attacking Ben Carson's profound faith.   That is why both Hillary Clinton and Sanders are succeeding by addressing some pretty mainstream issues: raising the minimum wage, equal pay protections for women, paid family leave, making college affordable, and universal background checks for gun purchases.  
The Democrats are not insulting each other and they are not spinning fantastic conspiracy theories.  They also aren't getting their voters out.  The impressive -- stunning, really -- victory of Bevin in Kentucky, paired with the overwhelming victory of the anti-gay forces in Houston teaches Republicans a sobering lesson:  crazy sells.  
So here's my prediction:  It's about to get a whole lot crazier.  How crazy?  Consider this:
 
• 44% of Republicans believe the President was not born in the USA; 
• 54% think our President is a Muslim. (Never mind the fact that they were freaking out about his Christian minister back during the 2008 campaign -- only 14% of Republicans think the President is a Christian.)  
• And, perhaps most ominous: According to a September YouGov poll, 43% of Republicans could imagine supporting a military coup in the United States. 
 Keep in mind that we're still 89 days from the Iowa caucuses and 98 days from the New Hampshire primary.  We have not even begun to see the full blooming of right-wing crazy.  We may look back on November 2015 as the calm before the storm.

Tough night for Democrats last night in several key elections.
In Kentucky, Matt Bevin won the statehouse. He’s only the 2nd Republican in four decades to be a governor there. Ohio rejected a measure to legalize marijuana. In Virginia, Democrat Terry McAuliffe lost his battle to have Democrats control the state Senate. The Republicans will control both houses of the Virginia statehouse. In Houston, an anti-discrimination measure failed. And in San Francisco, a crackdown on Airbnb failed to pass.  
Today is the deadline for filing in New Hampshire to run for President. Lots of candidates are there today and holding campaign events including Jeb Bush, Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, and Martin O’Malley.
There are new Quinnipiac polls out today. There’s good news for Carson and Trump. Carson gets 23%, Trump gets 24%. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz rising. Rubio gets 14%, and Cruz gets 13%. Not such great news for Jeb Bush who has dropped to 4%.
On the Dem side, Clinton gets 53% to Bernie Sanders’ 35%. But the news isn’t great for Clinton in head to head matchups where Clinton loses to Carson, Rubio, Cruz and even Chris Christie. She does beat Trump.  
New Fox polls come out at 6pm tonight.

Donald Trump was on CNN today complaining about his treatment in the press. He also took more shots at Carson and Rubio. He describes Carson as having no chance and Rubio as being overrated.
China has been using up to 17% more coal than reported.. a huge blow to efforts to control the rise of carbon dioxide. The New York Times reports the amount is greater than all of Germany’s emissions!
Volkswagen shares are falling again today after the company revealed it under-reported the carbon dioxide emissions from another 800,000 cars. Up to 11 million of its vehicles had software installed design to fool regulators and drastically under-reported emissions. U.S. officials say now that more cars including Audi and Porsche brand are also implicated.
The investigation into the crash of that Russian jet in the Sinai desert continues today.. it remains unclear just what happened, but the black boxes are being analyzed now.
Another plane crash of a Russian jet. A Soviet-era plane crashed in South Sudan killing at least 25 people. It’s reported it was overloaded.

" (CNN)Another retweet has landed Donald Trump in hot water — but this time, the campaign isn't blaming an intern. 
Trump, a prolific Twitter user, retweeted a message Tuesday that read: ""ADIOS, JEB aka JOSÉ."" Unfortunately for the Republican presidential candidate, that tweet was accompanied by more than a dozen images seeming to attack his rival Jeb Bush and his family, and one of those graphics featured a swastika next to Bush's face.
One of the other pictures showed Bush standing next to cactus plants wearing a sombrero. 
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement to CNN that Trump retweeted the tweet in question ""like hundreds of others,"" confirming that the candidate himself had personally sent out the retweet. 
""He did not see the accompanying image and the retweet has since been deleted,"" Hicks said. 
Trump's latest retweet drew sharp condemnation from Bush's campaign. His national spokesperson, Kristy Campbell, wrote on Twitter: ""Trump tweets swastika as part of latest attack on Jeb. T-minus 8 hours until another 'young intern' is fired.""
Tuesday is not the first time that Trump has stirred up controversy on the social media site. This summer, Trump's twitter account posted a photo showing men wearing Nazi uniforms. At the time, the campaign blamed a ""young intern"" for the mistake. 
And last month, Trump retweeted an insult to Iowans that read: ""Too much #Monsanto in the #corn creates issues in the brain?"" The campaign also deleted this retweet, before, again, blaming a ""young intern.""
Though Trump's retweet has been deleted, the original tweet by user @AndreaWeslien was still live on Wednesday morning.

"Hollis, New Hampshire (CNN)Jeb Bush didn't weigh in on questions about Marco Rubio's finances, saying Wednesday that it's the media's job to vet his presidential rival, though the former Florida governor continued to criticize the first-term senator's legislative record.
Speaking to reporters on his new campaign bus while driving through New Hampshire, Bush was pressed repeatedly about reports that Rubio misused a Republican Party credit card in Florida.
""It's not my job to worry about that. It's your job,"" Bush said. ""A candidate running for president that has a chance to be president will be thoroughly vetted.""
Bush, in an apparent effort to look more transparent, pointed to the 33 years of tax returns and thousands of emails that he released this year.
""I'm probably the most vetted so far. My past has been discussed in all sorts of ways -- sometimes comfortable, sometimes not so,"" he continued. ""And Marco and every other candidate who is a viable candidate will go through that same process. That's up to you guys, not me.""
Rubio hit back on attacks of his financial history on Wednesday, describing them as inaccurate. ""I only have one debt in the world, which is my mortgage on the home that me and my family live in in Miami,"" Rubio said on ""Good Morning America,"" adding, ""I obviously don't come from a wealthy family.""
Tensions between the two candidates have escalated as Rubio has surged in the polls, while his former mentor, Bush, has fallen to the middle of the pack.
Bush continued to say Wednesday that Rubio lacks much of a legislative record and argued that he's done little to bring reform to the nation's capital. 
""He hasn't changed the culture in Washington,"" Bush said, when asked whether Rubio has lived up to expectations since he rode the tea party wave into the Senate in 2010.
As he has in the past, Bush pointed out that Rubio, along with Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, have only sponsored a total of two bills that have actually become law.
""That's one path,"" Bush said. ""The other path is a path of public service where you accomplish things and that's my lane. And I'm going to talk about my lane.""
Pressed on whether he'd support Rubio should he become the nominee, Bush said, ""Absolutely.""
""I will support every person on the stage running against Hillary Clinton,"" he said. ""I'll be the nominee, though.""

"Washington (CNN)Sen. Marco Rubio on Wednesday dismissed attacks on his financial history as inaccurate, and pushed back on reports that he misused a Republican Party credit card in Florida. 
In fact, the Florida Republican said, the card in question was a charge card -- not a credit card at all. 
The freshman senator has enjoyed climbing poll numbers at the early state as well as national level, buoyed by a positively reviewed debate performance, but with his rise, has come increased scrutiny. 
Speaking with ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Wednesday, Rubio answered questions about his financial history brought up by his opponents and media investigations. 
He refuted GOP front-runner Donald Trump's attacks that he has a poor personal financial record and responded to a Tampa Bay Times story that found he charged personal expenses to a Republican Party of Florida card.
""It wasn't a credit card, it was an American Express charge card secured under my personal credit in conjunction with the party,"" Rubio said.
RELATED: Rubio rises in N.H. poll
The primary difference between a charge card and a credit card is that charge cards must be paid off each month, while credit cards allow a balance to be rolled over.
Rubio said bills were sent to his home and he determined what was personal and what wasn't.
""If there was a personal expense, I paid it. If it was a party expense, the party paid it,"" Rubio said. ""Now, I recognize in hindsight, I would do it different to avoid all this confusion. But the Republican Party never paid a single expense of mine -- personal expense.""
According to the Tampa Bay Times story, Rubio has failed to release information about two years of using the card, and two years of records that were analyzed by the Times during his Senate campaign found that he ""routinely"" charged personal expenses on the card, sending about $16,000 to American Express to cover charges.
Rubio said Wednesday his campaign will release records ""soon.""
He called the story ""not accurate"" and said all the records are out there, even if they're not under his name.
""Every expense on that card is detailed in the Republican Party accounts that they file every month,"" Rubio said. ""It doesn't say who they belong to, but every expense is on there, and as we've said, we'll release those soon.""
He also rejected Trump's recent onslaught of comments saying his finances are a ""disaster.""
""I only have one debt in the world, which is my mortgage on the home that me and my family live in in Miami,"" Rubio said, adding, ""I obviously don't come from a wealthy family.""

"Donald J. Trump is buying radio air time in three early states, his campaign manager confirmed, marking the billionaire candidate’s first foray into paid advertising since he began his presidential campaign in June. 

The 60-second radio ads will run in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina over the next two weeks, said Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager.

The ads are not expected to feature attacks on any of Mr. Trump’s rivals, despite his penchant for such criticism in interviews and stump speeches. 

And they are not television ads, which are substantially more expensive than radio spots. Those are the types of ads that some political watchers assumed Mr. Trump was referring to when he told Fox News on Tuesday evening that he planned to begin small advertising buys in early states over the coming days. 

The purchase for a week of radio ads usually costs only several thousands of dollars, as opposed to the hundreds of thousands of dollars that television spots could cost a campaign to air at this point in the race. 

Mr. Trump is making the move after seeing his poll numbers begin to sag in Iowa and nationally, although he has maintained his lead in recent public polls in New Hampshire. 

Pundits and people who have long been involved with national races have been skeptical about whether Mr. Trump would ultimately spend his own money on advertisements to try to regain his lead. Mr. Trump has ridden a wave of so-called earned media, meaning all of his television publicity so far has come at no cost to him. 

It remains to be seen whether Mr. Trump will buy television air time, although his aides have insisted he is prepared to do so. ",MAGGIE HABERMAN,"Donald J.

"WASHINGTON (AP) â Two of the Republican Party's rising young stars â House Speaker Paul Ryan and presidential hopeful Marco Rubio â made similar calculations on the way to political advancement: Both abandoned efforts to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul.
The about-faces by Ryan and Rubio underscore the GOP's difficulties with the issue of immigration, where policies that appeal to young and minority voters can invite a backlash from the conservative base. And in a campaign season where Donald Trump's incendiary rhetoric has seemed to drive the debate, they renew questions about whether Washington will ever be able to come up with a solution for the nation's dysfunctional immigration system.
In Ryan's case, he emerged as the unity candidate for speaker of the House last week after offering assurances to conservatives that he would not pursue comprehensive immigration legislation with President Barack Obama in the White House. Rubio, in campaigning for president, has repeatedly sworn off the bipartisan Senate immigration bill he co-authored two years ago, and he is now rising in the polls.
Both Ryan, 45, and Rubio, 44, have treaded with care on the issue, never specifically disavowing the goals of comprehensive immigration reform but instead shifting their focus to border security and enforcement, and blaming process or politics.
Ryan says immigration reform cannot happen with Obama in the White House because the president showed he could not be trusted by going around Congress to issue executive actions limiting deportations.
""He has already demonstrated he is not serious about enforcing the law. Passing comprehensive reform during his presidency would merely render it meaningless,"" the Wisconsin Republican wrote in an opinion piece Wednesday in USA Today, adding that the focus should instead be on bills to secure the border or enforce immigration rules inside the U.S.
Rubio says he's concluded that a comprehensive bill like the one he helped write, which passed the Senate in 2013 but stalled in the House, is not the way to go.
""The only way forward is through a series of steps that begins with border security,"" the Florida senator said Wednesday on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" ''This issue cannot be tackled in one massive piece of legislation.""
Both tend to downplay their past support for potential eventual citizenship for many of the 11.5 million immigrants living in this country illegally, which was the most contentious element of the Senate's immigration bill and decried as ""amnesty"" by many conservatives.
Ryan once called potential citizenship ""a very important part of immigration reform,"" but he's avoided discussing it since becoming speaker even when directly asked. For his part, Rubio emphasizes a piecemeal approach. His campaign website includes a section devoted to his opposition to ""sanctuary cities"" that shield immigrants from prosecution, but does not highlight his broader immigration policies. When asked earlier this week on Fox News Channel, Rubio said he is open to immigrants in the country illegally becoming citizens after 15 years under certain circumstances.
The maneuvering comes from lawmakers who were hailed in the past by immigration activists for their leadership roles, Rubio for taking on the Senate bill and trying to sell it to the conservative community, and Ryan for working behind the scenes in the House and trying to find a legislative solution there.
But it's against the backdrop of a presidential campaign that's been dominated by Trump, who's said immigrants who come here illegally are ""rapists"" bringing drugs and crime. Such pronouncements have pushed the GOP to the right, even as some leading Republicans insist they need a nominee who will embrace immigration legislation and win back some of the Latino and Asian voters who've been abandoning the party.
""It's an issue that as much as we would like, it's not going away,"" said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. ""If we don't do something about immigration reform and people are going around saying they're rapists and murderers, then obviously the reaction in the Hispanic community is very negative.""
Ryan's efforts to find a House GOP consensus on immigration fizzled after former Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., was upset in his primary race last year by a conservative who accused him of backing amnesty. A crisis of unaccompanied minors arriving from Central America also helped end any faint hopes for action in the House â well before Obama took the executive actions that Ryan and other Republicans now blame for congressional inaction.
Now immigration activists are bemoaning the changed focus from Ryan and Rubio.
""We all know that Ryan supports reform, yet he's letting the Steve King wing of the party call the shots, and same thing with Rubio,"" said Frank Sharry, executive director of pro-immigrant group America's Voice, naming the leading immigration hardliner in the House. ""If they want to expand the Republican Party they have to lead, and neither of them are doing that right now.""

Maryland Republicans seeking to reinstate a challenge to the stateâs 2011 congressional map made headway early in Wednesdayâs Supreme Court arguments. But concern from some justices over a possible flood of political gerrymandering litigation later raised doubts whether they would prevail.
The plaintiffs claim that the remap, engineered by former Gov. Martin OâMalley to shift a Republican seat into the Democratic column, violated constitutional speech and association rights. The allegation raised âabout as important a question as you can imagine,â Justice Stephen Breyer said.
âThey want to sayâ¦that the state legislators are forbidden to draw district boundaries the way that has been done here,â he said. âAnd if they are right, that would affect congressional districts and legislative districts throughout the nation.â
A federal district judge in Baltimore had dismissed the lawsuit, shutting down the lawsuit without putting it before an expedited process Congress authorized for redistricting lawsuits. Under federal law, a three-judge district court is supposed to hear challenges to electoral maps, then bypass the appellate courts for a direct appeal before the Supreme Court.
Justice Elena Kagan suggested the district judge was too hasty in dismissing the case.
âWe’ve basically said that’s only [appropriate] when it’s completely ridiculous,â she said, not merely an unsuccessful legal theory but âa laughing stock of a case.â
While the Supreme Court never has thrown out a political map for partisan gerrymandering, neither has it foreclosed the possibility that drawing lines to favor a political party could be unconstitutional. In a 2004 concurring opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy invited litigants to propose reasons and methods for judicial review of partisan gerrymanders, a point the court underscored in June when it upheld an Arizona voter initiative transferring political map making to an independent commission from the state legislature.
âIt’s Justice Kennedy’s concurrenceâ¦ that provides the basis for the complaint in this case,â plaintiffsâ attorney Michael Kimberly told the justices. As a result, Republican voters at least were entitled to their day in three-judge court, he said.
Just as it seemed a majority had been sewn up, Chief Justice John Roberts raised a troubling implication. If practically any challenge to a political map brings an automatic appeal to the Supreme Court, the justices could find themselves flooded with gerrymandering litigation.
âThat’s a serious problem,â he said.
Marylandâs lawyer, Steven Sullivan, immediately stoked such fears, noting that seven separate challenges to the 2011 map had been filed.
âThe cases we’ve had in recent years that were dismissed by a single judge, they would have all come here. And we’re one state times 50,â Â¬ Mr. Sullivan, a state assistant attorney general, said.
âThere is this concern to control this court’s mandatory docket, which Congress cares deeply about,â he said.
âWe care even more than Congress. Trust me,â Justice Antonin Scalia said.
A decision in the case, Shapiro v. McManus, is expected before July.

"Republican presidential candidate Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is defending his use of an American Express card issued to him by the Republican Party of Florida when he served in the state’s legislature, a day after rival Donald Trump called his credit card use “a disaster.â
Though the party gave the card to legislative leaders to cover their political expenses, Mr. Rubio repeatedly used it in 2007 and 2008 to cover personal expenses, from a $10.50 movie ticket to a four-day, $10,000 family reunion, The Miami Herald and Tampa Bay Times reported. In response to a request from the Times, Mr. Rubioâs campaign saidÂ it wouldÂ release an additional two years of credit card statements that were not previously examined publicly.
In an interview Wednesday morning on ABCâs Good Morning America, Mr. Rubio said he reviewed the bills âevery monthâ and paid for any personal expenses. The Times and the Herald reported thatÂ Mr. Rubio did not make monthly payments and made no contribution during one six-month stretch in 2007.
âIt wasnât a credit card,â Mr. Rubio said Wednesday. âIt was an American Express charge card secured under my personal credit in conjunction with the party.
âI recognize in hindsight I would do it different to avoid all this confusion but the Republican Party never paid a single expense of mine, personal expense.â
