Choose who makes the GOP debate stage!,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/03/choose-who-makes-the-gop-debate-stage/,washpo,"Thanks to CNN’s amended debate rules, Carly Fiorina will almost certainly appear in the Sept. 16 Republican debate. That’s a pretty impactful political decision for a news network -- and one that comes with significant repercussions: Fiorina in the main stage debate means she will get exposed to lots and lots more people than if she was in the JV debate earlier in the day. Before you -- or the other people not named Fiorina who won't make the main stage -- bash CNN for its rules and its willingness to change them, remember that it's not easy to decide on a set of criteria to pick the top 10 (or 11) out of the 17 people running. How many polls would you include as you tried to thin the herd? Should cheaper, less-rigorous Internet polls dilute the more expensive – and therefore less abundant – polls with solid methodology? Should candidates with a certain percentage be allowed to participate, or should the number of participants be capped? See for yourself how much power the news networks wield by deciding who makes the main stage for their debates -- and how hard it is. Make your own debate rules below!",0.40113659734951729
Global economic losses from drought to top $8 bln - report,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/financialsNews/~3/z2kjEwS5hdQ/story01.htm,reuters,"LONDON, Sept 3 Global economic losses from

drought are likely to reach more than $8 billion in the next few

months as the El Nino weather pattern intensifies, reinsurance

broker Aon Benfield said on Thursday.

Total economic losses from drought in the United States are

likely to reach at least $3 billion, mainly due to agricultural

damage in California, Aon Benfield said in its monthly

catastrophe report.

""As we continue to see the prospect of El Nino becoming one

of the strongest in decades, more and more impacts will be

apparent around the world,"" Steve Bowen, associate director of

Aon Benfield's catastrophe modelling team and meteorologist,

said in a statement.

The current El Nino weather phenomenon is expected to peak

between October and January and could turn into one of the

strongest on record, experts from the World Meteorological

Organisation said this week.

Boston brothers in Trump-inspired attack on Mexican to remain in custody,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/domesticNews/~3/1CfDeRXIVNg/story01.htm,reuters,"BOSTON Two Boston brothers charged with urinating on and beating a homeless Mexican man in an attack allegedly inspired by Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump's views on immigrants agreed on Thursday to remain in custody until their trial in October.

The brothers, 38-year-old Scott Leader and 30-year-old Steve Leader, were arrested last month and charged with assault and battery for the purpose of intimidation because of national origin.

Through their attorneys, Gary McGillivray and John Flanagan, the pair agreed to waive a hearing that could have determined whether they would be released on bail ahead of trial.

The judge set an Oct. 1 trial date.

The men told police they targeted their 58-year-old victim, whose name has not been released, because they believed he was an illegal immigrant. According to a police report, they told officers, ""Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported.""

Trump, the New York property developer and former reality TV personality, has jumped to the front of the pack of candidates seeking the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, driven in part by promises to deport all illegal immigrants and order the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border.

Trump, who initially described the attack as an outcome of passionate views on immigration, called it ""terrible"" on Twitter on Friday.

One of the brothers went on to threaten police officers, saying from his cell that he would attack them if he were not locked up.

Are Marketers Overhyping Millennials' Role in the Future Economy?,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/national/~3/LJSF6Y0egn4/,fox,"Millennials are the hottest topic of the moment, especially when it comes to marketers, who never seem to tire of millennial talk. They are slicing and dicing everything related to this generation -- from what they like and what they don’t, to their growth in the workplace and their future impact on the economy. In short, everything that will help them attract this lucrative group. But being obsessed with capturing the millennial mind share, are today’s marketers turning a blind eye to more obvious truths of generational marketing? Let’s take a closer look at where marketers may be going wrong while targeting Gen Y.

Ignore other age groups at your own risk

It makes no sense for any brand to focus on only one generation, unless it sells products meant solely for that particular age group. For instance, a brand selling walking sticks will probably do ok if they choose to target only the elderly -- although, it’s safe to assume that many of their purchases are made by their boomer offspring! But, let’s say, you sell eco-friendly products. The millennials’ much-known proclivity towards sustainability issues and positive brand images may have you believing they are your prospective buyers. And, while a recent study found that 63 percent of millennials prefer eco-friendly product packaging, more than half of both Gen-Xers and baby boomers have the same preference. You can imagine the cost of targeting only millennials and ignoring the rest.

Related: Everything You Know About Millennials Is Wrong

The biggest problem in targeting only millennials is you risk alienating buyers who don’t fall within that age bracket. And let’s not forget, as your millennial clientele age, they will be more attracted to brands that serve older generations, which you have missed the boat on because you failed to catch their eye as they were growing up.

Smart targeting or sweeping generalization?

While millennials are a huge generation, much like the boomers, there may be a bit too much emphasis on them as a whole and not enough sub-context around the vast difference between older millennials and younger millennials. The same holds true when discussing gender roles. Most of the brand messages and ads targeting millennial consumers are male-centric, overlooking the Gen-Y women—an emerging financial force.

Therefore, if a brand targets millennials, a marketer’s best chance for success will be through smart segmentation.

Is there too much hype around the M-word?

With so much more data and information about millennials at our fingertips, are we turning too much attention to them? My answer is: yes and no. Here’s why.

Related: The Truth About Facebook and Millennials

Many brands are smitten by statistics gushing about millennials’ big buying power. However, to conclude that they possess the most spending dollars is a near-sighted approach. I’d like to put it this way. Young adults may be buying more now because most of them have just stepped into new jobs or are still at an early stage of financial stability. With marriage and children will come expenses, such as daycare costs, school fees, mortgages or rent and other necessities. This will cause their spending power to decline over time. So, it’s safe to assume millennial-centric marketing might set you up for failure in the long run.

At the same time, we can’t ignore the fact that millennials are a challenging market. They take to technology like a fish to water. It sometimes feels like their first words have a hashtag attached and smartphones are an extra appendage. When marketing to millennials, what has worked for past generations doesn’t work for them. This is why brands need to adapt and adopt a different set of strategies to attract them.

Rather than targeting any specific age group, I think it’s more important to understand the next generation of business leaders and investors. So while there is too much hype around millennials and brands need to cut through it, it’s also very important for marketers to understand the behaviors, shopping patterns and work habits of this generation, as well as where they will be in a decade or two. The key lies in using that information to segment and power the proper type of marketing to each millennial category, rather than lumping them all of them into one big group, or, even worse, ignoring them altogether.

The most Trump thing Trump has ever said about leadership,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2015/09/03/the-most-trump-thing-trump-has-ever-said-about-leadership/,washpo,"(Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images) Bloomberg BusinessWeek's new cover story on Donald Trump examines the presidential candidate's business operation: how he built it up, how he survived various crises and how his company makes its money. It also takes a look at his managerial style: how he hires, promotes people and gets involved in minute details. And it includes what may just be the most Trump thing Trump has ever said about leadership. The reporter, Max Abelson, asked Trump to name the leader he looks to for advice on managing his company. Some CEOs might name a leadership sage, like Howard Schultz did when he called the late professor and author Warren Bennis an influential mentor. Others might offer up some pat answer about listening to their board, their employees or their customers. Well, Trump says Trump. As Abelson writes near the beginning of the story: ""His mouth, just as acrobatic as his more famous hair, pulls tight, snaps open, and lets out its most important syllable. 'Me,' Trump says. ... 'I look at me.' "" Abelson follows that up by asking if he admires any other business leaders. His reported response: “I,” Trump says, “don’t like the word admire.” Read also: It’s on: Jeb Bush embraces a risky fight with Donald Trump McCain's response to Trump is everything it should be, and more Like On Leadership?

"Trump to sign GOP pledge, commit to back party nominee",http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-to-sign-gop-pledge-commit-to-back-party-nominee/2015/09/03/c5d9ea7c-5242-11e5-9812-92d5948a40f8_story.html,washpo,"GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump will sign a pledge Thursday to support the Republican nominee in next year’s general election, effectively ruling out a third-party or independent run, according to two Republicans familiar with the move. The promise, which Trump has long avoided making, brings him closer to a party whose rank-and-file activists he has thrilled this summer but whose leadership has at times viewed his rapid ascent with alarm, especially the prospect of an outside bid that could siphon away votes from the eventual standard-bearer. The Republicans familiar with Trump’s decision requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. They also said that Trump may have caveats or conditions upon signing that have not yet been shared beyond the businessman’s tight-knit inner circle. These Republicans said that even as Trump wants to be a team player and plans to abide by the pledge, his priority is to be treated with he often refers to as “respect” by the national GOP. If that relationship should ever sour, he could consider changing his mind. But for now, Trump’s embrace of the Republican Party is a victory for the officials who have been unsure about his political intentions. Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s campaign manager, declined to comment about whether Trump would put pen to paper later today, and cautioned that the billionaire contender can be unpredictable. “Only DJT speaks for DJT,” Lewandowski wrote in a text message to The Washington Post, referencing the candidate. Trump will make the announcement at an afternoon news conference at Trump Tower, his campaign headquarters in New York, where he will sign the loyalty statement alongside its author, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus. That appearance will follow a meeting with Priebus. One of the Republicans who has been briefed said Trump believes that pledge provides him with two political assets: increased pressure on his many rivals to give assurance that they will back him should he be the nominee, and possible new support from Republicans who so far have been wary of his reluctance to commit to supporting the GOP through the end of the 2016 race. For months, Republican leaders have been trying to prevent Trump, the real-estate mogul who has rocketed to the top of GOP polls, from running as an independent candidate if he does not win the Republican nomination. In the Aug. 6 debate in Cleveland, Trump memorably refused to rule out a third-party run, though he has since signaled a possible change of heart as some state parties are requiring loyalty oaths as a condition of appearing on their state’s primary ballots. RNC staffers reached out this week to campaigns requesting that their candidates sign a sheet pledging loyalty to the party’s eventual nominee, according to campaign officials. The one-page pledge is not a legal contract or binding. Rather, it is a political document and a symbol of Republican fealty. “I [name] affirm that if I do not win the 2016 Republican nomination for president of the United States I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is,” reads the document. “I further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party.” Former RNC chairman Jim Gilmore, who is one of 17 GOP presidential candidates, said he supports the national party’s push for candidates to pledge loyalty. “If someone is going to go to the party and ask for their support, if they’re going to ask the rank and file for their vote, that comes with an obligation for loyalty, in my mind,” said Gilmore, a former Virginia governor. “Generally speaking, if you want the party’s support, that loyalty should be there.” Michael Steele, another former RNC chairman, said Priebus had wanted to get Trump’s flirtation with a third-party run “cleared up” before the next debate, scheduled for Sept. 16 on CNN. “I appreciate what he is trying to do, trying to bring some level of order to this situation,” Steele said. “The expectation should be if you’re running to be nominee of the party, you should support the nominee of the party.” Steele added that Trump may have calculated that “there is no real upside to poking the party in the eye. He doesn’t want people to peel off from him because they don’t see him as being a team player. I think that’s the way he sees it.” Philip Rucker contributed reporting.",0.99999997045202194
