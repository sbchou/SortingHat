Choose who makes the GOP debate stage!,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/03/choose-who-makes-the-gop-debate-stage/,washpo,"Thanks to CNN’s amended debate rules, Carly Fiorina will almost certainly appear in the Sept. 16 Republican debate. That’s a pretty impactful political decision for a news network -- and one that comes with significant repercussions: Fiorina in the main stage debate means she will get exposed to lots and lots more people than if she was in the JV debate earlier in the day. Before you -- or the other people not named Fiorina who won't make the main stage -- bash CNN for its rules and its willingness to change them, remember that it's not easy to decide on a set of criteria to pick the top 10 (or 11) out of the 17 people running. How many polls would you include as you tried to thin the herd? Should cheaper, less-rigorous Internet polls dilute the more expensive – and therefore less abundant – polls with solid methodology? Should candidates with a certain percentage be allowed to participate, or should the number of participants be capped?

Global economic losses from drought to top $8 bln - report,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/financialsNews/~3/z2kjEwS5hdQ/story01.htm,reuters,"LONDON, Sept 3 Global economic losses from

drought are likely to reach more than $8 billion in the next few

months as the El Nino weather pattern intensifies, reinsurance

broker Aon Benfield said on Thursday.

Total economic losses from drought in the United States are

likely to reach at least $3 billion, mainly due to agricultural

damage in California, Aon Benfield said in its monthly

catastrophe report.

""As we continue to see the prospect of El Nino becoming one

of the strongest in decades, more and more impacts will be

apparent around the world,"" Steve Bowen, associate director of

Boston brothers in Trump-inspired attack on Mexican to remain in custody,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/domesticNews/~3/1CfDeRXIVNg/story01.htm,reuters,"BOSTON Two Boston brothers charged with urinating on and beating a homeless Mexican man in an attack allegedly inspired by Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump's views on immigrants agreed on Thursday to remain in custody until their trial in October.

The brothers, 38-year-old Scott Leader and 30-year-old Steve Leader, were arrested last month and charged with assault and battery for the purpose of intimidation because of national origin.

Through their attorneys, Gary McGillivray and John Flanagan, the pair agreed to waive a hearing that could have determined whether they would be released on bail ahead of trial.

The judge set an Oct. 1 trial date.

The men told police they targeted their 58-year-old victim, whose name has not been released, because they believed he was an illegal immigrant. According to a police report, they told officers, ""Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported.""

Trump, the New York property developer and former reality TV personality, has jumped to the front of the pack of candidates seeking the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, driven in part by promises to deport all illegal immigrants and order the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border.

Trump, who initially described the attack as an outcome of passionate views on immigration, called it ""terrible"" on Twitter on Friday.

One of the brothers went on to threaten police officers, saying from his cell that he would attack them if he were not locked up.

Are Marketers Overhyping Millennials' Role in the Future Economy?,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/national/~3/LJSF6Y0egn4/,fox,"Millennials are the hottest topic of the moment, especially when it comes to marketers, who never seem to tire of millennial talk. They are slicing and dicing everything related to this generation -- from what they like and what they don’t, to their growth in the workplace and their future impact on the economy. In short, everything that will help them attract this lucrative group. But being obsessed with capturing the millennial mind share, are today’s marketers turning a blind eye to more obvious truths of generational marketing? Let’s take a closer look at where marketers may be going wrong while targeting Gen Y.

Ignore other age groups at your own risk

It makes no sense for any brand to focus on only one generation, unless it sells products meant solely for that particular age group. For instance, a brand selling walking sticks will probably do ok if they choose to target only the elderly -- although, it’s safe to assume that many of their purchases are made by their boomer offspring! But, let’s say, you sell eco-friendly products. The millennials’ much-known proclivity towards sustainability issues and positive brand images may have you believing they are your prospective buyers. And, while a recent study found that 63 percent of millennials prefer eco-friendly product packaging, more than half of both Gen-Xers and baby boomers have the same preference. You can imagine the cost of targeting only millennials and ignoring the rest.

Related: Everything You Know About Millennials Is Wrong

The biggest problem in targeting only millennials is you risk alienating buyers who don’t fall within that age bracket. And let’s not forget, as your millennial clientele age, they will be more attracted to brands that serve older generations, which you have missed the boat on because you failed to catch their eye as they were growing up.

Smart targeting or sweeping generalization?

While millennials are a huge generation, much like the boomers, there may be a bit too much emphasis on them as a whole and not enough sub-context around the vast difference between older millennials and younger millennials. The same holds true when discussing gender roles. Most of the brand messages and ads targeting millennial consumers are male-centric, overlooking the Gen-Y women—an emerging financial force.

Therefore, if a brand targets millennials, a marketer’s best chance for success will be through smart segmentation.

Is there too much hype around the M-word?

With so much more data and information about millennials at our fingertips, are we turning too much attention to them? My answer is: yes and no. Here’s why.

Related: The Truth About Facebook and Millennials

Many brands are smitten by statistics gushing about millennials’ big buying power. However, to conclude that they possess the most spending dollars is a near-sighted approach. I’d like to put it this way. Young adults may be buying more now because most of them have just stepped into new jobs or are still at an early stage of financial stability. With marriage and children will come expenses, such as daycare costs, school fees, mortgages or rent and other necessities. This will cause their spending power to decline over time. So, it’s safe to assume millennial-centric marketing might set you up for failure in the long run.

At the same time, we can’t ignore the fact that millennials are a challenging market. They take to technology like a fish to water. It sometimes feels like their first words have a hashtag attached and smartphones are an extra appendage. When marketing to millennials, what has worked for past generations doesn’t work for them. This is why brands need to adapt and adopt a different set of strategies to attract them.

Rather than targeting any specific age group, I think it’s more important to understand the next generation of business leaders and investors. So while there is too much hype around millennials and brands need to cut through it, it’s also very important for marketers to understand the behaviors, shopping patterns and work habits of this generation, as well as where they will be in a decade or two. The key lies in using that information to segment and power the proper type of marketing to each millennial category, rather than lumping them all of them into one big group, or, even worse, ignoring them altogether.

"Trump to sign GOP pledge, commit to back party nominee",http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-to-sign-gop-pledge-commit-to-back-party-nominee/2015/09/03/c5d9ea7c-5242-11e5-9812-92d5948a40f8_story.html,washpo,"GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump will sign a pledge Thursday to support the Republican nominee in next year’s general election, effectively ruling out a third-party or independent run, according to two Republicans familiar with the move. The promise, which Trump has long avoided making, brings him closer to a party whose rank-and-file activists he has thrilled this summer but whose leadership has at times viewed his rapid ascent with alarm, especially the prospect of an outside bid that could siphon away votes from the eventual standard-bearer. The Republicans familiar with Trump’s decision requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. They also said that Trump may have caveats or conditions upon signing that have not yet been shared beyond the businessman’s tight-knit inner circle. These Republicans said that even as Trump wants to be a team player and plans to abide by the pledge, his priority is to be treated with he often refers to as “respect” by the national GOP. If that relationship should ever sour, he could consider changing his mind. But for now, Trump’s embrace of the Republican Party is a victory for the officials who have been unsure about his political intentions. Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s campaign manager, declined to comment about whether Trump would put pen to paper later today, and cautioned that the billionaire contender can be unpredictable. “Only DJT speaks for DJT,” Lewandowski wrote in a text message to The Washington Post, referencing the candidate. Trump will make the announcement at an afternoon news conference at Trump Tower, his campaign headquarters in New York, where he will sign the loyalty statement alongside its author, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus. That appearance will follow a meeting with Priebus. One of the Republicans who has been briefed said Trump believes that pledge provides him with two political assets: increased pressure on his many rivals to give assurance that they will back him should he be the nominee, and possible new support from Republicans who so far have been wary of his reluctance to commit to supporting the GOP through the end of the 2016 race. For months, Republican leaders have been trying to prevent Trump, the real-estate mogul who has rocketed to the top of GOP polls, from running as an independent candidate if he does not win the Republican nomination. In the Aug. 6 debate in Cleveland, Trump memorably refused to rule out a third-party run, though he has since signaled a possible change of heart as some state parties are requiring loyalty oaths as a condition of appearing on their state’s primary ballots. RNC staffers reached out this week to campaigns requesting that their candidates sign a sheet pledging loyalty to the party’s eventual nominee, according to campaign officials. The one-page pledge is not a legal contract or binding. Rather, it is a political document and a symbol of Republican fealty. “I [name] affirm that if I do not win the 2016 Republican nomination for president of the United States I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is,” reads the document. “I further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party.” Former RNC chairman Jim Gilmore, who is one of 17 GOP presidential candidates, said he supports the national party’s push for candidates to pledge loyalty. “If someone is going to go to the party and ask for their support, if they’re going to ask the rank and file for their vote, that comes with an obligation for loyalty, in my mind,” said Gilmore, a former Virginia governor. “Generally speaking, if you want the party’s support, that loyalty should be there.” Michael Steele, another former RNC chairman, said Priebus had wanted to get Trump’s flirtation with a third-party run “cleared up” before the next debate, scheduled for Sept. 16 on CNN. “I appreciate what he is trying to do, trying to bring some level of order to this situation,” Steele said. “The expectation should be if you’re running to be nominee of the party, you should support the nominee of the party.” Steele added that Trump may have calculated that “there is no real upside to poking the party in the eye. He doesn’t want people to peel off from him because they don’t see him as being a team player. I think that’s the way he sees it.” Philip Rucker contributed reporting.",0.99999997045202194

Mortgage rates rise heading into holiday weekend,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/where-we-live/wp/2015/09/03/mortgage-rates-rise-heading-into-holiday-weekend/?wprss=rss_business,washpo,"(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press) Mortgage rates moved higher ahead of the holiday weekend, according to the latest data released Thursday by Freddie Mac. This week’s rise follows last week’s decline, and it seems unlikely that the market’s skittishness will abate soon. Besides the turmoil in the world economy, many observers are trying to figure out what the Federal Reserve will do later this month at its meeting. All this uncertainty is causing volatility in the mortgage market. The 30-year fixed-rate average climbed to 3.89 percent with an average 0.6 point. (Points are fees paid to a lender equal to 1 percent of the loan amount.) It was 3.84 percent a week ago and 4.1 percent a year ago. This was the sixth week in a row the 30-year fixed rate has stayed below 4 percent. The 15-year fixed-rate average rose to 3.09 percent with an average 0.6 point. It was 3.06 percent a week ago and 3.24 percent a year ago. [How borrowers can help make the mortgage application process go smoother] Hybrid adjustable rate mortgages were mixed. The five-year ARM average increased to 2.93 percent with an average 0.4 point. It was 2.9 percent a week ago and 2.97 percent a year ago. The one-year ARM average held steady at 2.62 percent with an average 0.3 point, same as it was a week ago. “ ‘Fasten your seat belts. It’s going to be a bumpy night,’ said Bette Davis in ‘All About Eve,’ ” Sean Becketti, Freddie Mac chief economist, said in a statement. He continued: “That could just as well have been Janet Yellen, or a specialist at the New York Stock Exchange, or the head of the People’s Bank of China on yet another week with lots of volatility on essentially no new information.” “The 30-year mortgage rate increased [five] basis points, but don’t read too much into that. The Fed took great pains at the Jackson Hole conference to keep all their options open and to avoid making too much — or too little — of the situation in China and the volatility in global equity markets. This Friday’s employment report is the last piece of significant, solid evidence the [Federal Open Market Committee] will have to consider before their September decision. [Wall Street] appears to be calling it a coin flip. There won’t be a clear direction for mortgage rates until the Fed makes its September decision, at the earliest.” [Global market chaos throws Federal Reserve’s rate hike plan into doubt] Meanwhile, mortgage applications soared following last week’s rate drop, according to the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. The market composite index — a measure of total loan application volume — climbed 11.3 percent from the previous week. The refinance index jumped 17 percent, while the purchase index increased 4 percent. The refinance share of mortgage activity accounted for 58.7 percent of all applications.  ",0.30143912730947486
"For His Unconventional Campaign, Donald Trump Looks to an Unorthodox Manager",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/us/politics/donald-trump-corey-lewandowski-campaign-manager.html,nyt,"He was a lobbyist who represented one client who sought funds from the federal stimulus program and then another, a group backed by the Koch brothers, who opposed it. He was a political operative who once debated a cardboard cutout of the Democratic governor of New Hampshire to protest tax rates.

And he was a congressional aide who was arrested after he brought a gun to work, then sued when he did not get it back.

Perhaps not surprisingly, the campaign manager for Donald J. Trump’s unorthodox bid for president, Corey Lewandowski, a 40-year-old New Hampshire resident, does not have a conventional résumé.

In searching for someone to steer his effort, Mr. Trump went not to someone with a depth of experience in national elections, but to someone he appears to see as a kindred spirit: a deeply ambitious, sometimes-mercurial master of self-reinvention (he has also been a New Hampshire state public safety officer and a real estate agent). And, like Mr. Trump, exactly what his political leanings are beyond a belief in small government is uncertain.

Mr. Lewandowski’s unconventional background is matched by his unconventional approach to managing a campaign.

While some candidates look for a manager who will rein in their impulses, Mr. Lewandowski channels them. He is not interested in telling Mr. Trump what to do or in being a master strategist. His greatest attribute, Mr. Trump said in an interview, is that “he knows when to speak up.”

“He leaves me alone, but he knows when to make his presence felt,” Mr. Trump said.

Mr. Lewandowski spends his days traveling with the candidate or working out of his boss’s Trump Tower headquarters in Manhattan, putting together the schedules, speaking with organizers in early-voting states and handling a staff that is mostly based elsewhere.

At one point, Mr. Lewandowski was part of the fabric of establishment Washington, working for former Representative Bob Ney of Ohio, and, later, with the Republican National Committee.

But, said David N. Bossie, president of the conservative group Citizens United, who helped connect the candidate with his campaign manager, Mr. Lewandowski “is as antiestablishment as Mr. Trump.”

He is also relatively parochial, having spent most of his life in New England.

Even now, he tries to get home as much as he can to New Hampshire, where he lives with his family, and where the many Republicans who know him or know of him decline to speak ill of him for the record, even as a few privately question whether he is playing at a level that is over his head.

Mr. Trump, who rarely brings new people into his small circle of advisers, has been content to let Mr. Lewandowski consolidate power after the departure of Roger J. Stone Jr., a long-serving adviser. Mr. Stone has said that he has taken issue with the tone that the campaign had begun to take, but that he still supports Mr. Trump.

Mr. Trump told one friend that he liked Mr. Lewandowski “because he doesn’t get emotional.”

But that is not a view that is universally shared about Mr. Lewandowski, who is known to have a temper and who had a mixed reputation at Americans for Prosperity, the group sponsored by Charles G. and David H. Koch he first represented as a lobbyist and for which he later went to work.

He held various jobs in the Kochs’ political world, including as a state director in New Hampshire and, last year, as the head of a national voter registration drive. He promoted the Kochs’ views of small government, which led to his stunt debating a cardboard cutout of Gov. John Lynch of New Hampshire on national tax day in 2010.

After seven years with Americans for Prosperity, Mr. Lewandowski moved on, leaving behind some fans who found him to be efficient and effective, but also some detractors, who found his abrasiveness off-putting.

Mr. Lewandowski is hardly media-shy — he has been a frequent CNN guest promoting Mr. Trump’s candidacy — but he is not eager to discuss himself. He declined requests for an interview.

Two of his former bosses described him as less of an innovator than an executor.

“I would have positions, and he would carry them out,” recalled Mr. Ney, the former congressman, who was ensnared in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal, and whose 1998 race was managed by Mr. Lewandowski.

A tall, reedy man with the features of a young Robert Duvall in “To Kill a Mockingbird,” with close-cropped hair, pale skin and dark circles under his eyes, Mr. Lewandowski began his political career in his hometown, Lowell, Mass., when he ran unsuccessfully for a state legislative seat in 1994.

A few years later, he ended up working for Mr. Ney.

“I remember he was doing the interview, and he had a frayed cuff” on his shirt, Mr. Ney recalled. “And I thought, ‘That’s just a regular working guy.’ ”

After the election, Mr. Lewandowski went to work in Washington as Mr. Ney’s chief of staff, and made headlines when he brought an unloaded gun into a House office building in the bottom of his laundry bag. He was charged with a misdemeanor. He said it was an accident, and his lawsuit, charging that he had been denied due process when his gun was taken away, was thrown out by a judge.

After Mr. Ney was convicted of corruption charges in the Abramoff scandal and forced to resign in 2006, Mr. Lewandowski wrote a letter to the court defending him.

“I know the true Bob Ney,” Mr. Lewandowski wrote. Years later, Mr. Ney said, his parents still ask about Mr. Lewandowski, who was seen as a member of their family.

In 2002, Mr. Lewandowski managed the re-election effort of Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who had a complicated history with the Republican Party and who had switched his affiliation to independent when he ran for president for a short while in 2000.

By the time Mr. Lewandowski joined the re-election effort, establishment Republicans were trying replace Mr. Smith with Representative John E. Sununu, the son of a former governor.

“To the best of my knowledge, he had never managed anything at the level of the Senate prior to me,” Mr. Smith said, recalling Mr. Lewandowski. “We lost, but I don’t blame him for that.”

During that race, the Smith camp raised questions about Mr. Sununu’s credibility as a supporter of Israel (he has a Lebanese background), criticisms that the congressman’s allies saw as having anti-Arab undertones.

After Mr. Smith had lost, and with Mr. Lewandowski’s relationship to the party establishment deeply frayed, he held different jobs, including working with the New Hampshire Department of Public Safety.

He then became a lobbyist with the government affairs firm Schwartz Communications in Massachusetts, taking on some clients interested in the stimulus spending program proposed by President Obama and enacted by congressional Democrats to help the economy recover from the financial meltdown of 2008.

Another client was Americans for Prosperity, which has criticized the stimulus spending.

Mr. Lewandowski worked closely with the group as it tried to establish a foothold in New Hampshire, and eventually went to work for it full time.

Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, said in a statement that Mr. Lewandowski was “valued” and that “he left on good terms.”

But he also had his enemies, who recall some controversies around his tenure, including over his efforts to oversee the group’s national voter registration drive for the 2014 midterm election, according to people who spoke on the condition of anonyity to discuss internal business.

Despite Mr. Lewandowski’s connections to the Koch brothers’ world, Mr. Trump, like several other candidates, has not been invited to the group’s recent donor network gatherings.

Mr. Trump has told friends he was surprised by the snub, describing the Kochs as “good friends.”

As for his campaign manager, Mr. Trump insisted that he had to woo Mr. Lewandowski away from Americans for Prosperity. But even then, he suggested, he made clear that he was going to decide for himself how he was going to run.

“This is going to be a different kind of campaign,” he told his new hire.",0.99998900194164553
Patriots rookie DE Trey Flowers won't let injuries slow him down,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/sports/~3/4Af_GZ7IJYE/,fox,"New England Patriots rookie defensive end Trey Flowers got off to a great start in his first NFL preseason. He recorded a sack on arguably the best quarterback in the league, Aaron Rodgers, in his first NFL action.

More impressively, it came against the team's starting left tackle, David Bakhtiari. Shortly thereafter, though, Flowers left the game with a shoulder injury.

""It was a pretty good start [to the preseason],"" Flowers said, via Jeff Howe of the Boston Herald. ""I came out there, tried to do the best I can, just worked hard, made sure I prepared for the first preseason game. I went down with a minor injury, but I did everything, the protocol the doctors and everyone wanted me to do, and got back out there as soon as possible.""

Flowers did miss time due to the shoulder injury, but he was able to make his way back onto the field for the game against the Carolina Panthers. Although he didn't record a sack as he did in the first preseason game, he still showed the ability to pressure the quarterback.

""I'm just trying to take it one day at a time, getting myself ready, working on myself, diving into the playbook, working on my technique and things like that,"" Flowers said. ""I'm not worried about the depth chart. I'm just trying to get better myself.""

He figures to play a fairly big role for the Patriots this season, even as a fourth-round rookie. He'll be in the pass rush rotation and should see opportunities in passing situations. For now, he's just working on refining his game and preparing for the regular season.

Betting big on South Carolina - Unintimidated PAC plans to spend a total of more than $9 million boosting Walker in South Carolina, New Hampshire and Nevada before nominating contests in each state, WSJ reports. “The super PAC is devoting the bulk of the new spending, more than $8 million, to advertising in South Carolina.” PLEADING INSANITY: HILLARY’S CAMPAIGN WOES MOUNT Imagine that it’s the day of Hillary Clinton’s defiant March press conference at the United Nations in which she dismissed any claims of mishandling sensitive material or taking any undue risks. If we had told you then that the biggest story six months later would be her IT guy invoking his right to not incriminate himself in an ongoing FBI probe into her sketchy server, what would you have said? How about “Yikes!” You would have figured that her candidacy had sustained tremendous, perhaps irreparable damage. And you would have been right. The substance here matters. People here say the Clintons always survive because of her husband’s multiple near-death political experiences. But those things were about the pleasures of the flesh and his own weaknesses. What got him out of trouble as a candidate and in his impeachment was that Democrats could say that Republicans are sex-obsessed weirdos, and do so with a wink and a nudge. The Clinton mojo only worked because of the underlying subject. A senior aide invoking his constitutional right against self-incrimination is a big deal no matter what – just imagine if this were Jeb Bush’s or Scott Walker’s IT guy. But it’s consequence grows exponentially when the underlying substance involves potential for criminal charges for the mishandling of state secrets and exposing them to our enemies abroad because of Hillary Clinton’s desire to keep her own communications secret from her political enemies here at home. That’s not something that a campaign can wave away as prurient or misplaced. We add to that the allegations of payola, reinforced today by the discovery of emails from Clinton pushing to help a company that would hire her husband months later and pay him more than $16 million. Clinton’s campaign has been saying for months that the damage from these ongoing scandals will abate once Republicans are judged to be overplaying their hands. On national security and corruption, the table limits are pretty high. Clinton with her brazen response in March that she destroyed evidence she claims would clear her name certainly looks like the one who has done the overplaying here. Emails show Hillary helping firm that paid Bubba big bucks - Inside Higher Ed: “On the campaign trail Hillary Clinton has been critical of for-profit colleges and has called for tougher regulation of the sector. During her first year as secretary of state, however, Clinton pushed for the inclusion of a large for-profit education company at a higher education policy dinner hosted at the U.S. Department of State. Clinton wrote in an email to a top aide that she wanted to add Laureate Education to the guest list for the event. Describing Laureate as ‘the fastest growing college network in the world,’ Clinton said the company was ‘started by Doug Becker who Bill likes a lot.’ ""It's a for-profit model that should be represented,"" she added in the August 2009 email. A senior vice president at Laureate was added to the guest list, a separate email shows. Former President Bill Clinton several months later became an honorary chancellor for Laureate International Universities, a role for which he was paid $16.5 million between 2010 and 2014. Clinton stepped down from the position earlier this year.” BAIER TRACKS: HEY, JOE… “When one of your aides decides to plead the Fifth to avoid answering questions about setting up your personal computer server that is now in FBI custody, it’s not the best news for your political campaign. When your main ally on the Benghazi committee that is investigating you offers this explanation to the Washington Post – ‘ranking Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), said about the Clinton aide’s decision, ‘Although multiple legal experts agree there is no evidence of criminal activity, it is certainly understandable that this witness’s attorneys advised him to assert his Fifth Amendment rights, especially given the onslaught of wild and unsubstantiated accusations by Republican presidential candidates, members of Congress and others based on false leaks about the investigation’ – you know there is an issue. And when every day seems to bring another nugget from the mining of information in the released emails, you can probably expect another challenger in the form of the current Vice President very soon.” – Bret Baier Biden fired up in stump speech - WashEx: “Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday was scheduled for a Miami speech on the importance of community colleges, but ended up delivering a rousing address on how to strengthen the middle class and renew the American dream, one that’s likely to fuel more speculation that Biden will soon enter the 2016 race for the White House. The swirl of speculation about his entrance into the presidential race, especially at a speech in the critical swing state of Florida, wasn’t lost on the vice president.” Early Hillary backer Cuomo now says Biden run good for Dems - The Hill: “New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), who endorsed Hillary Clinton months ago, said Wednesday that a Joe Biden run could be good for Democrats. ‘If he did run, I think all Democrats would be in a bind, because they’d have a choice of a number of good candidates,’ Cuomo said in Manhattan, according to multiple reports. ‘But that’s a good situation to be in, right?’ he added. Cuomo’s comments came following an event at New York University when he was asked if he would be ‘in a bind’ over whom to support in the race, The New York Times noted.” Redford: Dem race is bland, boring and empty - “I’m glad [Donald Trump is] in there because him being the way he is, and saying what he says the way he says it, I think shakes things up and I think that’s very needed. Because on the other side it’s so bland, it’s so boring, it’s so empty.” – Actor Robert Redford in an interview with Larry King. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE… History: “[On this day in 1935] A new land-speed record is set by Britain’s famed speed demon, Sir Malcolm Campbell. On the Bonneville Salt Flats of Utah, Campbell and his 2,500-hp motor car Bluebird made two runs over a one-mile course at speeds averaging 301.129 mph. In breaking the 300-mph barrier, he surpassed the world record of 276.82 mph that he had set earlier in the year…Sir Malcolm went on to set three more consecutive land-speed records at Daytona Beach: 253.968 mph in 1932, 272.465 mph in 1933, and 276.710 mph in early 1935. Seeking a surface fast enough to propel him over the 300-mph mark, Campbell took Bluebird to the searing Bonneville Salt Flats of Utah, where the very level, smooth flats are as solid as concrete by summer’s end. On September 3, 1935, he set a new record of 301.129 mph. The attempt almost ended in disaster when Bluebird suffered a burst tire near the end of the first run, but Campbell managed to maintain control and then make the requisite second run within the hour.” Got a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

After all, parties are designed to win elections, not be ideological vessels or to advance individuals. But the pledge being circulated to the GOP campaigns from the Republican National Committee is definitely a dagger pointed at Donald Trump’s heart. Other candidates are stampeding to sign up today to show they’re committed to breaking the party’s presidential drought next year. Trump has called a press conference for this afternoon at his Manhattan fortress and RNC Chairman Reince Priebus is headed to Trump’s tower to make the case for party unity. Unlike most politicians, with Trump we can hardly guess what he’ll ever do. As Fox News colleague Serafin Gomez reported, the plan for a loyalty oath had been in the works for weeks. It’s tricky stuff. If he signs it, as Politico reports he will, Trump loses, as he called it, his leverage and some of his appeal as a dangerous man. Plus, his scoring standard changes and his various apostate views -- tax increases, Planned Parenthood funding, his support for impeaching George W. Bush for the Iraq war -- become bigger deals. Trump wants to be judged as an independent running as a Republican, not a Republican, per se. If he is being scored for loyalty and consistency, things get dicier. But, depending on what his response is and what the enforcement mechanisms are, not signing would almost certainly keep him from the nomination and the presidency, but if he chose to burn down the GOP starting tomorrow he could certainly help deliver the White House back to the Clintons. Club for Growth might go for Trump blitz - The Hill: “Fresh from Club for Growth’s Twitter fight with Trump on Tuesday night, the group’s president David McIntosh wants to warn every conservative voter he can about the economic policies of the GOP front-runner…Asked how far he would go to destroy Trump’s candidacy; McIntosh would not rule out using Club for Growth’s super-PAC to blitz the billionaire during the lead up to the primaries.” [Trump could’ve been even richer, says National Journal. How so? By doing nothing but watching his inheritance grow.] The Judge’s Ruling: Immigration debate gets ugly - Citing the Constitution’s protection of travel as a natural right, Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano says: “Hispanics here without documentation are being demonized because of the politics of nativism. Nativism -- we are exceptional; we are better people than they are; we were here first -- is very dangerous and leads to ugly results.” Read more here. Carson’s $9 million summer - USA Today: “Dr. Ben Carson, who is surging in Republican presidential polls, also is raking in campaign dollars. Officials with the retired neurosurgeon’s campaign say they have collected $9 million in July and August, a time when political fundraising typically slows. The summer haul means Carson’s total fundraising has hit nearly $20 million.” Cruz woos Jews in Florida ahead of Iran vote - Miami Herald: “Texas Sen. Ted Cruz came to South Florida to woo Jewish donors as Congress prepares to vote on President Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran. And while he didn't hold any public events -- and doesn’t plan to anytime soon -- Cruz said in a phone interview with the Miami Herald…‘We have tremendous support in Florida, and I have been very, very encouraged. We’ve been down to Florida quite a number of times,’ he said.” Kasich backs off on minimum wage hike - WaPo: “At his first two events of a two-day New Hampshire swing, Gov. John Kasich (R-Ohio) drew a mix of Republican voters, independents and curious Democrats. At the home of Republican donors, and at a historic general store in this town, he talked at length about how he worked with both parties, and how reforming government programs didn't mean shredding them. He did the same earlier in Michigan, even telling a reporter that he favored a ""reasonable"" federal minimum wage, and that Ohio's $8.10 -- higher than the federal wage -- made sense locally. But after a town hall here, Kasich rebuffed the idea of raising the federal minimum wage. He told reporters that any increase in the minimum wage should be done state by state, but that it should obviously increase.” POWER PLAY: ROGINSKY TAKES FIVE Democratic strategist and all-around smart person Julie Roginsky says her party is in good shape to retake the Senate next year despite the bruising defeats of 2014.

Wesh: “A king cobra has reportedly escaped from its owner in the Orlando area, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The escaped king cobra was reported Wednesday by its owner, who is a licensed and bonded to care for exotic animals, but the snake actually went missing Tuesday, officials said. The privately owned, non-native, venomous snake was reported to have escaped from its cage at a home in the 4800 block of North Apopka Vineland Road in Orlando. ‘It wasn’t deliberately let out from what we can see. Looks like it escaped its cage it was in,’ said Capt. Chris Roszkowiak of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The snake is approximately 8 feet and is green and yellow. A permit is required to possess a king cobra and owners are required to report escaped animals immediately. The owner, Mike Kennedy, is an exotic animal dealer and star of the Discovery Channel reality show ‘Airplane Repo.’ Officials said he could face criminal penalties for not telling authorities about the escape immediately.” AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES… “…It used to be if you were a police officer in a confrontation your instant one thought would be how do I escape alive? How do I protect the people?  Now he has to think, how is this going to look on video.  How will I be treated tonight in the evening news and how will I be ultimately treated by the legal system. And once you have to add that factor, the policeman is defenseless.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier” Watch here.

U.S. judge tosses quarterback Tom Brady's four-game NFL suspension,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/domesticNews/~3/h8ZKSJVxpeo/story01.htm,reuters,"NEW YORK New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady's ""Deflategate"" suspension was thrown out by a federal judge in New York on Thursday, following a seven-month standoff between the National Football League and its players union.

U.S. District Judge Richard Berman vacated NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's decision in July to uphold Brady's four-game suspension over his alleged role in a scheme to deflate footballs used during a January playoff victory.

Goodell's ruling, Berman found, was plagued by ""several significant legal deficiencies,"" including a failure to notify Brady beforehand that his alleged conduct could be punished by suspension.

""The court finds that Brady had no notice that he could receive a four-game suspension for general awareness of ball deflation by others or participation in any scheme to deflate footballs,"" Berman wrote.

The ruling is unlikely to be the last word on the matter, which has dominated sports radio, made national headlines and inspired nicknames like ""Deflategate"" and ""Ballghazi."" The NFL can appeal Berman's decision, a process that will take months to resolve.

Neither the NFL nor the players union immediately commented on the decision.

Renowned Stanford professor launches new education think tank,http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/renowned-stanford-professor-launches-new-education-think-tank/2015/09/03/114424be-522f-11e5-933e-7d06c647a395_story.html,washpo,"Renowned Stanford education professor Linda Darling-Hammond is launching a new think tank aimed at shaping education policies nationwide. With offices in Palo Alto, Calif., and Washington, the new Learning Policy Institute will seek to link research and policy, two worlds that are too often disconnected, Darling-Hammond said. “It is time to get serious about how to support and enable our education system to respond to the massive changes in learning that some other nation’s systems have been addressing more systemically, with much better results, over the last two decades,” Darling-Hammond wrote in the Huffington Post on Thursday. A former teacher, Darling-Hammond has testified often before Congress and was an adviser to Barack Obama during his 2008 campaign and transition to the presidency. But she has since been critical of the administration’s education policies, particularly the push to judge schools and teachers based on standardized tests that she argues fail to adequately measure students’ critical thinking and deeper learning. She is seen as an ally of the teachers’ unions, but in announcing her new think tank, Darling-Hammond emphasized that it will be an independent advocate for policies shown by research to improve learning for children. “We will follow the evidence wherever it leads, and will work with those of any political affiliation or point of view who share that commitment,” she wrote. Darling-Hammond will serve as the Institute’s president and chief executive. Now an emeritus professor at Stanford, she will continue to teach part-time at its graduate school of education. The executive director is Patrick M. Shields, who previously led education work at SRI International, a nonprofit independent research outfit headquartered in Silicon Valley. The Learning Policy Institute will conduct its own research and will synthesize and communicate the work of others. It has an initial budget of $5 million and expects to hire between 30 and 50 staff members, according to EdSource, a Web site for California education news. Funders include the San Francisco-based Sandler Foundation, as well as the Atlantic Philanthropies and the Ford Foundation, the S.D. Bechtel Jr. Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the Stuart Foundation. The organization will focus on research to inform “pressing policy questions” at the local, state and federal levels, according to Darling-Hammond. She wrote Thursday that the nation’s public schools must be transformed into a system that asks children to think deeply and critically, and that assesses them “authentically” — i.e., not with multiple-choice tests. Darling-Hammond — who once spoke of the nation’s “aggressive neglect” of its children — has also long urged policymakers to pay more attention to equity in public schools and to the deepening problem of child poverty in America. She said those will continue to be important themes for the Learning Policy Institute. “Today, the U.S. system provides the most unequal educational inputs and outcomes in the industrialized world,” she wrote in the Huffington Post. “Inequality is the single most fundamental reason for our country’s lackluster performance.”",0.32383500608384663
Former Clinton aide will not testify in House probe: lawmaker,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/MostRead/~3/VGlWop5KbTw/story01.htm,reuters,"WASHINGTON A former U.S. State Department staff member who worked for Hillary Clinton will not testify before U.S. lawmakers probing the former top diplomat and the 2012 attacks on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, according to a congressional memo.

Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, was secretary of state at the time of the attacks, in which four Americans were killed. The Republican-led House Select Committee is investigating the incident as well as Clinton's use of a private email during her tenure.

In a memo released on Thursday, the ranking Democrat on the committee said lawyers for the information technology aide, Bryan Pagliano, earlier this week told lawmakers he was invoking his constitutional right not to testify.

""The letter from Mr. Pagliano's attorneys expresses concern about 'the current political environment,'"" U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings said in the memo to fellow Democrats on the committee. It was dated Wednesday and released publicly on Thursday.

Clinton's campaign said in a statement that she had encouraged current and former aides to answer questions and ""be as helpful as possible,"" according to the Washington Post.

Her use of a private email server based at her house in the New York area while secretary of state has become a controversial issue as she seeks the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in the November 2016 election.

MSNBC reported Pagliano set up the email server in 2009.

According to the Washington Post, he previously worked on Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. Two other committees in the U.S. Senate have also contacted him in the past week, the newspaper reported, citing a copy of the lawyers' letter.

Republican Representative Trey Gowdy, head of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, last month issued the subpoena for Pagliano to appear to give a deposition to the committee.

Representatives for Gowdy as well as Pagliano's lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment.

Clinton is scheduled to appear before the committee on Sept. 22. Two of her other aides are scheduled to testify this week, the Post said, citing her campaign.

Alcoa plans new R&D center for advanced 3D printing processes,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/cyclicalconsumergoodsNews/~3/tuor5AjpCp4/metals-alcoa-idUSL1N1181N620150903,reuters,"CHICAGO, Sept 3 Metals company Alcoa Inc

said on Thursday it will invest $60 million to expand its

research and development center in Pennsylvania to explore ways

to make 3D printing viable on an industrial scale to produce

parts for the aerospace, automotive and construction sectors.

The move is part of New York-based Alcoa's strategy of

investing in more advanced aerospace and automotive products

while selling off some of its more traditional yet costly

smelting facilities.

Also known as additive printing, 3D printers build

three-dimensional metal parts by layering and heating metal

alloy powder, which are then treated in a forge to make them

stronger.

The 3D process has been used to build prototypes for 25

years, but only now is making its way into regular production.

Alcoa's chief technology officer, Ray Kilmer, said the

current available alloys are expensive, and part of the focus of

the expanded R&D center will be to explore new aluminum,

titanium, nickel and other metal alloys.

""The (alloy) powders need to be improved upon, they need to

be cost effective, and they need to work better in the additive

printing process,"" Kilmer said. ""What's new now is the machines

are getting better, faster and cheaper. Alcoa is stepping into

the process so we can get the performance and the cost to where

they need to be.""

Kilmer said additive printing could be used to manufacture

anything from fasteners to wheels and jet engine turbine blades.

The R&D center would also look at different additive printing

technologies and ways to reduce the waste of costly metal alloys

that occurs in traditional manufacturing processes.

Construction on the new facility is due to be completed in

the first quarter of 2016.

Proponents of 3D printing say it can help aircraft

manufacturers cut the cost of parts made from titanium, which

costs seven times more than aluminum.

Norwegian titanium component manufacturer Norsk Titanium AS

recently announced plans to establish the world's first

industrial-scale 3D printing facility in the United States.

U.S. conglomerate General Electric Co has said it

will introduce its first 3D-printed parts in an aircraft engine

platform in 2016, saying that the lighter and simpler parts will

improve engine performance.
