UPDATE 1-Healthy export growth helps cut Canada's trade deficit in July,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/news/usmarkets/~3/yr56uKjMIto/story01.htm,reuters,"(Adds details of release, background)

OTTAWA, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Canada's export sector posted

healthy growth for the second month in a row in July, helping

cut the country's trade deficit to an eight-month low of C$593

million ($446 million), Statistics Canada said on Thursday.

The trade shortfall for the month was much less than the

C$1.30 billion forecast by market operators and was the smallest

since the C$381 million deficit recorded in November 2014.

Exports grew by 2.3 percent from June to C$45.46 billion,

the second highest figure on record, on shipments of motor

vehicles, consumer goods and aircraft. Exports of energy

products dropped by 5.7 percent, largely due to lower prices.

The data will be closely studied by the Bank of Canada,

which cited disappointing non-energy exports as one reason it

cut interest rates in July, for a second time this year.

Imports increased by 1.7 percent to a record C$46.05 billion

on higher shipments of energy products, aircraft and other

transportation equipment as well as electronic and electrical

equipment.

Exports to the United States, which accounted for 76.4

percent of Canada's global total in July, rose by 2.1 percent,

while imports grew 4.3 percent. As a result, Canada's trade

surplus with the United States dropped to C$3.79 billion from

C$4.36 billion in June.

First Draft: Calls Intensify for More Debates on the Democratic Side,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/09/03/calls-intensify-for-more-debates-on-the-democratic-side/,nyt,"Martin O’Malley’s call for more Democratic presidential debates at the party’s summer meeting last week may have been the loudest, but it was neither the first nor the last.

A growing number of party activists, from New Hampshire to Iowa, are voicing concern about the Democratic National Committee’s plan to hold six debates over all, with only four coming before the first four states finish voting. The party fears a lower number will of debates will diminish its ability to drive the discussion as the Republican contest, led by Donald J. Trump, dominates the news, and that a flabby process will leave the ultimate nominee unprepared for the general election.

The timing of the New Hampshire debate, sandwiched between the Hanukkah and Christmas holidays, has particularly rankled activists in the state, who have openly protested the decision.

Martha Fuller Clark, a state senator in New Hampshire who is not yet backing a candidate, said that she approached the party chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, at the meeting in Minnesota last week and expressed her disappointment.

“She seemed unwilling to consider a revision of the schedule,” Ms. Fuller Clark said. “She just said that whatever schedule she put out, people would be unhappy with.”

“If there isn’t an opportunity for lots of debates and consideration, it’s just really, I think, making it much more difficult” for the candidates to reach voters before the voting begins, she said.

Many activists have argued that the decision to abbreviate the debate schedule was done to benefit Hillary Rodham Clinton, the front-runner in most polls for the nomination.

Former State Senator Burt Cohen, who is supporting Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, accused Ms. Wasserman Schultz of “putting her finger on the scale” to help Mrs. Clinton.

“Debbie Wasserman Schultz has to schedule more debates and do it with more sensitivity to the primary schedule,” he said, adding that if she did not, she should consider leaving her post, a comment he later tried to play down, saying it was premature to suggest such a thing.

A spokeswoman for the national party declined to comment. But party officials have insisted they were trying to bring as much voter interaction through forums and other means as possible, and suggested they began looking toward the Republican Party’s efforts to control its own debate process as far back as January. Ms. Wasserman Schultz has strenuously objected in private conversations to claims she tried to help Mrs. Clinton.

Still, in past cycles, there were many more debates, including unsanctioned debates, and they began earlier. But in 2004 and 2008, there were no penalties for taking part in the unsanctioned debates, which made up the majority of them in those years. This cycle, David Mercer, a former party official, noted, candidates who take part in unsanctioned debates risk being barred from the official forums.

During the spring of negotiations between the party committee and the campaigns, the Clinton campaign had pushed for a lower number on the debate spectrum, while Mr. O’Malley’s campaign had called for many more.

When Mr. O’Malley, the former Maryland governor who has been struggling to gain traction in the polls, but trying to position himself as the best alternative to Mrs. Clinton, used his speech at the summer meeting to condemn the party, he was met with cheers. Many high-ranking party activists have privately shared their concerns over the debate schedule, complaining that the criticisms risk getting amplified on places like MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program.

A spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton declined to comment. But even some of her supporters are encouraging a change in the schedule.

“I’m very supportive of the more the merrier in terms of debate,” said State Senator Lou D’Allesandro of New Hampshire, a Clinton supporter. “It’s a stage that’s ready-made for her. Why limit anything in this business? That’s not the American way.”

Sandy Opstvedt, an uncommitted party committee member from Iowa, said she also wants to make her voice heard to Ms. Wasserman Schultz.

“I think the debates actually help the candidates, and they just become more adept at debating,” said Mrs. Opstvedt, who, like Mr. O’Malley, described it as an opportunity to showcase the party’s ideas.

Donna Brazile, a national party vice chairwoman, said that she could understand the perspective from both sides.

But she also noted that there’s the possibility of another candidate joining the race: Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

His presence “might turn all of this upside-down,” she said. “Starting out with six is productive, but it could grow.”",0.99993730085607724
U.S. trade deficit smallest in five months,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/businessNews/~3/87aQgkd3WQM/story01.htm,reuters,"WASHINGTON, Sept 3 The U.S. trade deficit fell in July to its lowest level in five months as exports rose, signaling underlying strength in the economy amid concerns about a global growth slowdown.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday the trade gap narrowed 7.4 percent to $41.9 billion, the smallest since February. June's trade deficit was revised to $45.2 billion from the previously reported $43.8 billion.

Economists had forecast the trade gap shrinking to $42.4 billion. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit fell to $56.2 billion in July from $59.0 billion in the prior month.

The smaller deficit implied a modest contribution to gross domestic product from trade early in the third quarter. Trade contributed 0.3 percentage point to the economy's 3.7 percent annualized growth rate in the second quarter.

Data ranging from consumer spending to employment and housing have suggested the economy retained much of its momentum from the second quarter and was on solid footing when global financial markets were rocked by turbulence triggered by worries over China's economy.

In July, exports increased 0.4 percent to $188.5 billion.

While that was the first increase since April, exports remain constrained by a strong dollar. The dollar has gained 16.8 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014.

There were increases in exports of food, industrial supplies and materials, and capital goods in July. Automobile exports also rose.

Imports fell 1.1 percent to $230.4 billion. However, automobile imports were the highest on record. Imports of consumer goods fell in July.

Exports to China fell 1.9 percent and imports from that country dipped 0.2 percent. That left the politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit at $31.6 billion, up 0.4 percent from June. The trade deficit with China will be closely watched in the coming months after that country devalued its currency in August.

Exports to Canada fell 8.3 percent in July and could come under more pressure after the Canadian economy slipped into recession in the second quarter. Exports to recession-hit Brazil were the lowest since February 2010.

Exports to the European Union fell 5.3 percent.

Applications for US unemployment benefits rose last week but remain historically low at 282k,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/national/~3/_TU4YSqBnEw/,fox,"WASHINGTON –  More Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, but applications remain at historically near low levels in a positive sign for the U.S. economy amid a broader global slowdown.

The Labor Department says weekly applications for unemployment aid rose 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 282,000. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, increased 3,250 to 275,500. That average has fallen 9.2 percent over the past 12 months.

The relatively meager number of layoffs generally corresponds with strong hiring levels in the monthly jobs report being released Friday.

Economists expect that employers added 207,500 jobs in August as the unemployment rate dips to 5.2 percent from 5.3 percent. Hiring at that pace suggests the U.S. economy has been insulated from uncertainty about China's financial health that sparked a recent stock sell-off.",0.34253155724324602

WASHINGTON –  The U.S. trade deficit fell in July to the lowest level in five months as exports posted a small gain while imports declined, reflecting a big drop in shipments of consumer goods such as cell phones.

The Commerce Department says the deficit narrowed to $41.9 billion in July, a 7.4 percent decline from a June imbalance of $45.2 billion. Exports were up a small 0.4 percent to $188.5 billion, helped by stronger sales of U.S.-made autos and machinery, while imports declined 1.1 percent to $230.4 billion.

So far this year, the deficit is running 3.6 percent above last year's level, reflecting weaker export sales. The concern is that U.S. growth will be hurt by further declines in exports, reflecting a stronger dollar and overseas weakness in nations such as China.",0.321895896748429
