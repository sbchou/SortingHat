[{"body": "Organized labor took a major step in coalescing around\nHillary Rodham Clinton\non Tuesday, as one of its heavyweights voted to endorse her despite loud objections from backers of her rival and longtime labor stalwart\nBernie Sanders\n.\nThe Service Employees International Union, which represents 2 million workers in service industries such as healthcare and child care, made the endorsement following a lengthy debate at a meeting of its executive board here.\n\u201cWe feel very confident about Hillary Clinton\u2019s capacity to fight, win and deliver for working people,\u201d SEIU International President Mary Kay Henry said in an interview immediately following the endorsement vote. Henry said the 77-member board overwhelmingly approved the move in a voice vote. \u201cWe looked at the analytics and believe that this is the woman who can win in a general election,\u201d Henry said.\nThough\u00a0Sanders, a senator from Vermont, has received the support of a few smaller unions, including those that represent nurses and postal workers, the major organizations have been lining up with Clinton, a former senator and secretary of State. With the SEIU endorsement, she now has unions representing roughly two-thirds of the country\u2019s unionized workers supporting her.\n\u201cAs president, I will be proud to stand with SEIU and fight alongside them \u2014 to defend workers\u2019 right to organize and unions\u2019 right to bargain collectively, to raise incomes for working people and the middle class, and to ensure that hardworking Americans can retire with dignity and security,\u201d Clinton said in a statement.\nThe SEIU support is particularly meaningful among the labor endorsements Clinton has been racking up. The union is at the forefront of the push to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour, which Sanders has endorsed but not Clinton. Some local SEIU chapters had urged the board not to endorse Clinton, warning she was a status quo candidate.\nYet Clinton has long been popular among the SEIU rank and file, a racially diverse group with a large presence in Western states. And union leaders at SEIU and elsewhere are anxious about the possibility of losing the White House at a time when their organizations are under siege in Congress and at the Supreme Court. They see Clinton as a more viable contender in the general election, and they want to start doing what they can now to strengthen her candidacy.\nAsk Allysha Almada why she supports Bernie Sanders, and Almada, a Glendora nurse who tried to form a union and was later fired, shoots right back with her own question: How could she not?\nSanders, the Vermont senator, doesn\u2019t hedge with labor.

She held a large event with union members in which she talked in detail about the particular challenges faced by the healthcare and child care workers SEIU represents and how she would confront them.\n\u201cAll the Democratic candidates are similar on the issues,\u201d said Henry. \u201cWhat we think distinguishes Hillary Clinton is she understands home care and child care work in her bones.\u201d\nSEIU\u2019s resources are formidable. The union is one of the top political spenders in the country, with a history of investing tens of millions of dollars on Democrats in presidential election cycles. The union is also a key source of boots on the ground. In a statement, it promises that in the upcoming elections it will make \u201chundreds of thousands of face-to-face and door-to-door contacts, millions of phone calls, robust digital engagement and other activities to get out the vote.\u201d\nThe union is already plotting how it can mobilize to help the Clinton campaign beat Sanders in the Iowa caucus. \u201cWe are going to start immediately,\u201d said Henry.", "byline": "", "description": "<p>Organized labor took a major step in coalescing around Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday, as one of its heavyweights voted to endorse her despite loud objections from backers of her rival and longtime labor stalwart Bernie Sanders.</p> <p>The Service Employees International Union, which represents 2 million...</p>", "title": "Hillary Clinton wins major endorsement from service workers' union", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/la-na-hillary-clinton-seiu-20151117-story.html", "topics": ["economy", "personality"], "people": ["Mary Kay Henry", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Hillary Clinton", "Bernie Sanders"], "org": "latimes", "election_confidence": 0.755535986105521, "authors": [{"author_id": 40355, "fullname": "evan halper", "primary_org": "latimes"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 20:25:00", "orgs": ["Service Employees International Union", "Congress", "SEIU", "Supreme Court"], "article_id": "891f351100614be04265e2047b6318e8", "date_access": "2015-11-17 21:00:06.939874"}, {"body": "Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com.\nEven before the recent terror attacks in Paris, the politics of war were intruding upon the presidential primary campaign.\nLast week, among Republicans, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush joined businesswoman Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich in supporting a no-fly zone in Syria.\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) pointed out that candidates backing the no-fly zone have to be ready to shoot down Russian aircraft and handle the potential consequences, up to and including another world war.\nWithout new ideas from Republicans or his fellow Democrats for dealing with ISIS or the civil war in Syria, the president and his secretary of State John Kerry are trying to negotiate with Russia and Iran to create a coalition to jointly fight ISIS while protecting Syrian civilians as they try to flee.\nDespite those fireworks, the real U.S. political news on war in the Middle East is the growing divide among Democrats.\nHillary Clinton, President Obama\u2019s former secretary of State, backs the idea of American forces taking out any aircraft over the war-torn eastern region of the country. The president does not.\nWhen Clinton announced support for the idea of a no-fly zone in early October, Obama, who is resisting that approach for fear of rapid escalation, slapped back at her, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between running for president and being president.\u201d\nThere is a lot of history at play among Obama, Clinton and top Democrats in the Senate when it comes to war in the Middle East. Clinton famously remarked in 2014, after leaving the administration, that \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t do stupid stuff\u2019 is not a sufficient organizing principle,\u201d for the nation\u2019s foreign policy. The phrase is strongly identified with Obama. She also favored arming the Syrian rebels. Obama rejected the idea.\nClinton is backing the president\u2019s decision to send 50 special operations troops to Syria. Last week, before Friday's atrocities in Paris took place, her campaign issued a statement saying she \u201csees merit in the targeted use of special operations personnel to support our partners in the fight against ISIS, including in Syria\u2026Of course, she opposes the U.S. getting into a ground war in the Middle East.\u201d\nThose last words are critical because Clinton\u2019s opponent for the Democratic nomination this time is once again ready to portray her as a hawk who is ready to send Americans into yet another Middle Eastern war \u2014 just as then-Sen. Obama did back in 2008.\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has expressed doubt that the 50 troops will be the last of the Americans sent to Syria. He warned that this small first step could lead to \u201cperpetual warfare\u201d for the U.S. in the Middle East. And in debates he loudly reminds Democrats of Clinton\u2019s 2002 vote to authorize President Bush to go to war in Iraq.\nThe divide among Democrats over Middle East war strategy is also on painful view in the Senate. Several top Democrats in the upper chamber are adopting a bizarre stance where they are pushing the president to make a stronger commitment to fight in Syria even as they resist having a vote themselves to authorize the president to use added force in Syria.\nThe same type of political cowardice stopped the Senate from approving missile strikes against the Syrian regime to halt its use of chemical weapons against rebels when the war started in 2013.\nNow President Obama is not even waiting on Senate authorization to fight ISIS in Syria and Iraq. He is just sending in the troops.\nAnd without new ideas from Republicans or his fellow Democrats for dealing with ISIS or the civil war in Syria, the president and his secretary of State John Kerry are trying to negotiate with Russia and Iran to create a coalition to jointly fight ISIS while protecting Syrian civilians as they try to flee.\nMeanwhile, the president is using American soldiers in tactical roles to advise local forces battling ISIS.\nBut with the president entering the last year of his presidency, his fellow Democrats prefer positioning themselves as skeptics of his policy.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is a strategy that will work long term,\u201d Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said in an interview on CBS. \u201cI think ISIS is a great threat.\u201d\n\u201cI think 50, that won\u2019t do it,\u201d Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said on NBC News. \u201cIf we are really going to use special forces, quick in, quick out, you have to do it in a much more comprehensive way.\u201d She added that bombing and the few troops have not \u201cchanged the dynamic\u201d in Syria.\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) also dismissed the Obama administration\u2019s claim that the 50 soldiers are not \u201cground troops\u201d because their role is to provide technical guidance to rebel troops fighting ISIS. Kaine said his position is that the Obama administration lacks a \u201ccomprehensive strategy\u201d to defeat ISIS.\nThe most damning assessment of the president\u2019s approach from a fellow Democrat came from Sen. Chris Murphy (Conn.). He criticized the administration for not keeping its word to the American people. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not be concerned when the president very clearly ruled out putting troops on the ground in Syria and now they\u2019re on their way into the battle,\u201d Murphy told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019ve crossed a line that is hard to understand.\u201d\nIt is obvious that Democrats will have to deal with the consequences of Obama\u2019s foreign policy legacy long after he leaves the White House. What\u2019s hard to understand is why they feel the need to isolate him now \u2014 so long before he leaves \u2014 instead of working with their fellow Democrat.\nJuan Williams is a co-host of FNC's \"The Five,\" where he is one of seven rotating Fox personalities.\n+ FollowFoxNewsOpinion on Facebook", "byline": "", "description": "Even before the recent terror attacks in Paris, the politics of war were intruding upon the presidential primary campaign.", "title": "Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and the growing divide among Democrats over the Middle East", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/juz2pP_wI5I/hillary-clinton-barack-obama-and-growing-divide-among-democrats-over-middle-east.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "John Kerry", "Juan Williams", "Kirsten Gillibrand", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "John Kasich", "Barack Obama", "Dianne Feinstein", "Bernie Sanders", "Chris Murphy", "Carly Fiorina", "Tim Kaine"], "org": "fox", "election_confidence": 0.5647385598974557, "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-11-17 17:50:00", "orgs": ["Senate", "FNC"], "article_id": "ec5c4ed866b1c1badf76a2fa1ffec174", "date_access": "2015-11-17 20:20:46.070287"}, {"body": "Updated 11/17/15 09:38 PM EST\nBy\nNahal Toosi\n.\n11/17/15 07:56 PM EST\nBy\nLauren French\nRepublicans exiting the members-only, classified meeting say they remain concerned that the vetting system used to screen refugees.\n2016\nUpdated 11/17/15 07:49 PM EST\nBy\nAlex Isenstadt\nHe struggled to gain traction in the race, often failing to poll at even 1 percent.\n2016\n11/17/15 07:46 PM EST\nBy\nBurgess Everett\nThe Florida senator sees Cruz as vulnerable and in line with Democrats on what could become a dominant issue.\nDefense\n11/17/15 07:08 PM EST\nBy\nBryan Bender\nMilitary officials worry that leaders in Washington haven't absorbed the lessons of America's last big wars.\nUpdated 11/17/15 07:06 PM EST\nBy\nNolan D.

We don't make good decisions if its based on hysteria or an exaggeration of risks,\" Obama said while visiting the Philippines for the APEC economic summit. \"I cannot think of a more potent recruitment tool for ISIL than some of the rhetoric that's been coming out of here during the course of this debate.\"\nStory Continued Below\nIn the wake of the deadly attacks in Paris, more than half of U.S. governors, most of them Republican, have said they don't want refugees resettled in their states. House Republican leaders also are looking at legislation designed to stop the Obama administration from resettling up to 10,000 Syrian refugees next year. Several GOP presidential contenders have also slammed the idea of letting Syrians in, while some have suggested only letting in those who are Christian.\nObama earlier this week has expressed anger over the idea of discriminating based on religion, and reiterated that sentiment in his latest comments in Manila.\n\"When individuals say we should have a religious test and that only Christians, proven Christians should be admitted, that's offensive,\" he said.\nThe president also noted that many of the same people who have suggested stopping refugees from coming to the United States also claim they themselves are tough enough to stare down Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nBy\nJake Sherman\n\"At first they were too scared of the press being too tough on them in the debates,\" Obama said. \"Now they are scared of three-year-old orphans. That doesn't seem so tough to me.\"\nThe president's comments appear to be a reference to remarks by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Monday: \u201cI don\u2019t think orphans under 5 are being, you know, should be admitted into the United States at this point.

Matt Salmon, a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the vetting process is far from adequate and I have great concerns about allowing people on our shores without knowing that we are able to find out information about them.\u201d\nThe House is set to vote this week on a bill, drafted by Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), that would strengthen the vetting process for individuals seeking refugee status. It includes a temporary moratorium on refugees from Syria entering the U.S. until the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI can implement those tougher standards.\nThe concern over refugees in the U.S. comes four days after terrorists killed 129 people in a series of attacks in Paris. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has taken credit for those attacks.\nDefense\nBy\nBryan Bender\nHudson said after the briefing that the administration needs to report to Congress on its efforts before GOP lawmakers feel comfortable seeing thousands of Syrian entering the U.S.\nBut Hudson offered a rebuke of Republican presidential candidates, such as Jeb Bush, who had suggested focusing on allowing Christian refugees to enter the country.\nThe Obama administration officials told lawmakers they were attempting to quickly distill information coming in from allies to rigorously vet individual who want refugee status. But Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) said he was \u201cnot satisfied\u201d with how the Homeland Security Department and the FBI screen individuals.\n\u201cThere is no database from Syria and that\u2019s pretty much it,\u201d King said.\nA leading Democrat, however, defended the vetting process, saying the administration had a \u201ccomprehensive answer\u201d to lawmakers' concerns.\n\u201cThe process takes on average 18 months to two years. There are background checks and bio-metric identifiers,\u201d California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s a very laborious process. My sense is that members want to make sure their constituents are safe \u2026 but at the same time we don\u2019t want to be deterred from helping those in need.\u201d\nRepublicans are hoping that at least some of the 188 House Democrats will back the Hudson bill when it comes to the House floor for a vote this week.\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Republicans not satisfied after administration briefing on Syria", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/republicans-syria-obama-216006", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kenneth P.

Clarridge, a top adviser to Mr. Carson on terrorism and national security, said in an interview. He also said Mr. Carson needed weekly conference calls briefing him on foreign policy so \u201cwe can make him smart.\u201d\nAs the deadly assaults in Paris claimed by the Islamic State reframe the presidential race, the candidates\u2019 foreign policy credentials are suddenly under scrutiny. And Mr. Carson has attracted extra attention because his repeated dubious statements give rise to questions about where, as a retired neurosurgeon without government experience, he turns for information and counsel on complex global issues. What is unusual is the candor of those who are tutoring him about the physician\u2019s struggle to master the subject.\nIn last week\u2019s Republican debate, speaking of the turmoil in Syria, Mr. Carson said that \u201cthe Chinese are there.\u201d\nBoth the White House and China denied that China had intervened militarily in Syria.\nThis week, Mr. Carson\u2019s advisers said that his source for claiming Chinese involvement in Syria was a telephone conversation he had had with a freelance American intelligence operative in Iraq.\nAccording to notes of the briefing kept by a Carson aide who was also on the line, the operative had said, \u201cMultiple reports have surfaced that Chinese military advisers are on the ground in Syria, operating with Russian special operations personnel.\u201d\nMr. Clarridge, a former C.I.A. agent who had connected Mr. Carson with the operative in Iraq, said on Monday that the information was wrong. The operative in Iraq had \u201coverleaped\u201d in suggesting Chinese troops are in Syria, Mr. Clarridge said, adding of the operative, \u201cYou know how it goes when people are desperate for some headline.\u201d\nMr. Clarridge, described by Mr. Carson\u2019s top adviser, Armstrong Williams, as \u201ca mentor for Dr. Carson,\u201d is a colorful, even legendary figure in intelligence circles, someone who could have stepped out of a Hollywood thriller. He was a longtime C.I.A. officer, serving undercover in India, Turkey, Italy and other countries. During the Reagan administration, he helped found the agency\u2019s Counterterrorism Center and ran the C.I.A.\u2019s Latin American division.\nIndicted on charges of lying to Congress in the Iran-contra scandal (he was later pardoned), Mr. Clarridge today runs a private network of intelligence sources, including, he said, experts on Iran, China and the Middle East, who have all briefed Mr. Carson in phone calls or Skype sessions.\nMr. Clarridge, who contacted Mr. Carson nearly two years ago to offer his services without pay, has helped the candidate prepare for debates. But the briefings do not always seem to sink in, Mr. Clarridge acknowledged. After Mr. Carson struggled on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d to say whom he would call first to form a coalition against the Islamic State, Mr. Clarridge called Mr. Williams, the candidate\u2019s top adviser, in frustration. \u201cWe need to have a conference call once a week where his guys roll out the subjects they think will be out there, and we can make him smart,\u201d Mr. Clarridge said he told Mr. Williams.\nMr. Williams, one of Mr. Carson\u2019s closest friends, who does not have an official role in the campaign, also lamented the Fox News interview. \u201cHe\u2019s been briefed on it so many times,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess he just froze.\u201d\nMr. Carson, 64, who retired as one the world\u2019s foremost pediatric neurosurgeons, has sometimes struggled to adapt his thoughtful manner and speaking style to the rat-a-tat of debates and TV interviews. \u201cSometimes he overthinks things,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said, adding that he spoke to Mr. Carson after the Fox News stumble. \u201cI could tell, talking to him, it was a bummer for him.\u201d\nOnce written off by political insiders, Mr. Carson has rocketed to the top tier of candidates and has traded off a lead in recent polls with Donald J. Trump.\nBut the stress of his ascent has revealed an inexperienced political operation and a lack of connections to informed and respected advisers. Whereas Jeb Bush can call on dozens of experts from the foreign policy establishment who once worked for the presidential administrations of his father and brother, Mr. Carson so far has only one paid national security adviser, Robert F. Dees, a retired Army general on the staff of Liberty University, the institution founded by Jerry Falwell.\nThe Carson campaign has also set up conversations between the candidate and former senior foreign affairs officials in past presidential administrations, including former secretaries of state, Mr. Williams said.\nOne official, Michael V. Hayden, a former C.I.A. director, described a conversation he had had with Mr. Carson to MSNBC last week. \u201cI had one lengthy phone call with Ben Carson two months ago,\u201d Mr. Hayden said, \u201cand his instincts are all right, but this is a database in which he\u2019s very unfamiliar.\u201d\nMr. Dees, a West Point graduate whose biography lists commands in Korea and Europe, met Mr. Carson at a conference at a Baptist church in February. He said he and the candidate had since \u201clocked ourselves up in a hotel room a couple of different sessions and took walks around the world.\u201d\nHe also provides Mr. Carson with a regular national security update, with input from a group of retired military officers, business leaders and \u201cambassador-level type guys,\u201d he said, some of whom the campaign plans to identify shortly.\nMr. Dees offered a different portrait of Mr. Carson than Mr. Clarridge. \u201cDr. Carson is an amazing intellect,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has the right stuff to be commander in chief.\u201d\nOn Facebook, where the campaign connects to its vast grass-roots army, two of his top campaign aides posted a video on Monday highlighting his \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d interview with no hint of Mr. Carson\u2019s private acknowledgment that he had performed poorly. The Facebook page included what it said was supporting evidence of Mr. Carson\u2019s claim of Chinese involvement in Syria: a satellite image of a purported Chinese-made radar system in Syria, and a Syrian soldier posing on a Chinese-made armored vehicle.\nBut the effort to claim that Mr. Carson had meant only that there was Chinese-made material in Syria, not military personnel, was contradicted by his own top Middle East adviser, Mr. Clarridge.\nHe blamed his operative, who had spoken to Mr. Carson ahead of last week\u2019s Republican debate. The operative, who had visited the Kurd-controlled city of Erbil in Iraq, described unconfirmed intelligence he had gleaned about disguised Russian soldiers working in Kurdistan.\n\u201cRussian special forces are staying in the Titanic Hotel in Sulaymaniya,\u201d the operative said, according to notes recorded by Mr. Williams. \u201cThey frequent an Irish pub in the hotel bar.\u201d\n\u201cThe jump from Erbil and Soviets,\u201d Mr. Clarridge said, to the Chinese \u201cin Damascus is a long leap.\u201d", "byline": "TRIP GABRIEL", "description": "The candidate\u2019s remarks on the Middle East and national security have raised questions about his knowledge of the subject, and advisers say tutoring is having little effect.", "title": "Ben Carson Is Struggling to Grasp Foreign Policy, Advisers Say", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/us/politics/ben-carson-is-struggling-to-grasp-foreign-policy-advisers-say.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Armstrong Williams", "Jeb Bush", "Andrew Williams", "Donald J.

The decision is a blow to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose supporters had pushed against an endorsement.\n\"Hillary Clinton has proven she will fight, deliver and win for working families,\" said SEIU president Mary Kay Henry in a statement. \"SEIU members and working families across America are part of a growing movement to build a better future for their families, and Hillary Clinton will support and stand with them.\"\nClinton was holding a rally in Dallas later Tuesday in which she planned to discuss the health care overhaul under Obama. It represents another show of strength for Clinton, who has locked up most of the major unions despite Sanders' message of helping workers overcome income inequality. In a statement, Clinton said she was \"deeply honored\" by the endorsement.\nThe third main Democratic candidate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, is shifting staff from his Baltimore headquarters to Iowa and other early states as he struggles to raise money.\nSEIU endorsed Obama over Clinton in early 2008, giving the future president a boost in the lengthy Democratic primary battle. Union officials said Clinton received a strong majority in the vote of its leadership and a recent poll of its membership found about 70 percent back Clinton.\nSanders spokesman Michael Briggs said the campaign was \"gratified that hundreds of thousands of workers are part of the growing grassroots movement supporting Bernie's campaign to help working families.\"\nThe union has been at the forefront in the fight to get cities to adopt a $15 an hour minimum wage.\nClinton has endorsed raising the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour, a level below the $15 an hour that Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley have sought.

Ted Cruz told CNN that the country should deny entry to Muslim refugees from Syria, but leave the door open to fleeing Christians. Jeb Bush said that refugee resettlement should \"focus\" on Christians.\nTuesday's announcements from the Catholic bishops and evangelical association, which represents some 45,000 churches, put several candidates squarely at odds with their religious leaders. Sen. Marco Rubio, Bush and Chris Christie are Catholic. Cruz and Mike Huckabee are evangelicals.\n\"I am disturbed ... by calls from both federal and state officials for an end to the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the United States,\" Bishop Eusebio Elizondo, Chairman of the Catholic bishops' committee on migration, said on Tuesday.\n\"These refugees are fleeing terror themselves -- violence like we have witnessed in Paris. They are extremely vulnerable families, women, and children who are fleeing for their lives. We cannot and should not blame them for the actions of a terrorist organization.\"\nOnly 1,500 Syrian refugees have been accepted into the United States since 2011, but the Obama administration announced in September that 10,000 Syrians will be allowed entry next year.\nAt least one of the suspects believed to be involved in the Paris terrorist attacks that killed 129 entered Europe among the current wave of Syrian refugees. He had falsely identified himself as a Syrian named Ahmad al Muhammad and was allowed to enter Greece in early October.\nBut the United States has a \"strong track record\" for screening refugee applicants, Anderson said.\n\"It is more thorough and careful than the screening for tourist and student visas to the United States. A tourist with a French passport does not need screening or a visa; a refugee from Syria must pass multiple careful tests for eligibility.\"\nElizondo echoed that thought, noting that refugees must pass security checks and multiple interviews before entering the United States.\n\"Instead of using this tragedy to scapegoat all refugees,\" the bishop continued, \"I call upon our public officials to work together to end the Syrian conflict peacefully so the close to 4 million Syrian refugees can return to their country and rebuild their homes.\"\nMany, but not all, American religious leaders have likewise called on the United States to forge ahead with plans to resettle Syrian refugees. Franklin Graham, the son of famed evangelist Billy Graham, posted this message on November 14:\n\"We cannot allow Muslim immigrants to come across our borders unchecked while we are fighting this war on terror. If we continue to allow Muslim immigration, we'll see much more of what happened in Paris -- it's on our doorstep.\"", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Don't scapegoat Syrian refugees, evangelicals and bishops say", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/17/politics/catholics-evangelicals-refugees/index.html", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Chris Christie", "Billy Graham", "Jeb Bush", "Marco Rubio", "Mike Huckabee", "Paul Ryan", "Franklin Graham", "Ted Cruz"], "org": "cnn", "election_confidence": 0.5662879265632375, "authors": [{"author_id": 2580, "fullname": "daniel burke religion editor", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 21:09:35", "orgs": ["United States.", "U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops", "GOP"], "article_id": "e38166d1b47dcfd7516b8e49ac6e69de", "date_access": "2015-11-17 21:22:10.419155"}, {"body": "11/17/15 11:43 AM EST\nBy\nLauren French\nJohn Podesta will talk to members of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n11/17/15 11:31 AM EST\n11/17/15 11:29 AM EST\nBy\nJosh Gerstein\n\"I really don\u2019t have a comment on the president\u2019s expression of his view,\" Loretta Lynch said\nUpdated 11/17/15 11:20 AM EST\nBy\nNolan D.

An equal share picked Clinton.(polling.reuters.com/#!poll/TM743CY15)\nGiven Clinton's background as a former secretary of state it is perhaps not surprising that she did reasonably well in the poll. However, Trump's good showing upends an emerging narrative that the Paris shootings and suicide bombings would prompt voters to rethink their support for the real estate billionaire, who leads the field of Republican presidential candidates.\nSome pollsters and political pundits had predicted that Republican voters would now gravitate toward establishment candidates like Florida Senator Marco Rubio and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who has been languishing in the polls. Both are seen as stronger on foreign policy than Trump and his main Republican rival, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Neither have any experience in government and are running as Washington outsiders.\nDuring a campaign rally on Saturday, Trump blamed stringent gun laws in Paris for the attacks, telling attendees that it would have been a \u201cmuch different situation\u201d if the victims had been armed. He has also said he would close some mosques to stop Muslim extremist attacks in the United States.\nMirroring national primary polls, Clinton and Trump also took the top marks in the Reuters/Ipsos survey when looking at just voters from their own party. Asked to pick the best Democratic candidate, 52 percent of Democrats polled selected Clinton. When Republicans were asked to choose among their potential nominees, 33 percent said Trump.\nAfter Trump, Republican voters viewed Rubio, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee known for his hawkish views, as the strongest candidate (17 percent) to deal with terrorism. Carson was tied with Bush at around 9 percent.\nOf the Republicans polled, 36 percent said they now have more confidence in Trump's ability to be president - the largest show of support in the primary field. Only 10 percent said they were less confident in his abilities following the attacks.\nCarson and Rubio were also viewed more favorably as potential presidents by Republicans in the poll. Bush, however, got no immediate bump in confidence of his ability to be president. And only 8 percent of Republicans polled thought he would be the best leader to address terrorism.\nThe biggest damage came to a trio of Republican candidates who have struggled to rise in the polls.\nOf those Republicans polled, 16 percent said they now have less confidence in former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, 22 percent felt the same about Ohio Governor John Kasich and 19 percent said they have less confidence in Kentucky Senator Rand Paul - who has distinguished himself as the least hawkish candidate in his party.\nThe poll has a credibility interval of 3.4 percentage points for all voters. When looking at just Democrats or Republicans, the poll has a credibility interval of about 5.4 percentage points.\n(Additional reporting by Chris Kahn, Alana Wise, editing by Ross Colvin)", "byline": "", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American voters are evenly split between Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton as their top choice to address the issue of terrorism following the Paris attacks, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found.", "title": "Exclusive: After Paris, Americans see Trump, Clinton as most able to address terrorism - poll", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/O2blN43251w/story01.htm", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "John Kasich", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Alana Wise", "Ross Colvin", "Carly Fiorina", "Ben Carson"], "org": "reuters", "election_confidence": 0.9994244511019607, "authors": [{"author_id": 39032, "fullname": "ginger gibson", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 19:00:40", "orgs": ["Senate Foreign Relations Committee", "United States."], "article_id": "b6fc6cb220840be8e85e78a0b2af85f8", "date_access": "2015-11-17 19:49:10.329631"}, {"body": "(AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign is launching a new offensive on taxes, saying Bernie Sanders' health care plan would require middle-class workers to pay higher taxes.\nClinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon says in a statement that a 2013 proposal by Sanders in the Senate to create a single-payer health care system showed middle-class families would face higher taxes.

Bernie Sanders for proposals to raise taxes on the middle class that were part of the national single-payer health care bills he introduced in Congress.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cBernie Sanders has called for a roughly 9-percent tax hike on middle-class families just to cover his health-care plan,\u201d said Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon, referring to legislation Sanders introduced in 2013, \u201cand simple math dictates he'll need to tax workers even more to pay for the rest of his at least $18-20 trillion agenda. If you are truly concerned about raising incomes for middle-class families, the last thing you should do is cut their take-home pay right off the bat by raising their taxes.\u201d\nSanders introduced a single-payer healthcare bill in 2013 that included a 2.2 percent income tax across the board, as well as a 6.7 percent payroll tax for employers, the Washington Post reported Friday, and has introduced similar legislation in multiple sessions of Congress. While payroll taxes are split between the employer and the employee, economists and the Congressional Budget Office have said that most of those fees are carried by the workers in the form of lower wages.\nSanders has yet to announce the details of how he will pay for the national single-payer, Medicare for all Americans proposal that is a major plank of his presidential campaign. Economic experts have said it would be impossible to institute a single-payer system relying solely on tax hikes on the wealthy. Sanders camp has argued in response that in the long run, the single-payer system will save the country trillions of currently wasted dollars.\nBy\nJosh Gerstein\nand\nKenneth P. Vogel\n\"On Medicare for all, the middle class would be far better off because it would save taxpayers money,\" Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said in response to Clinton's latest line of attack. \"More people would get better care at less cost. Didn't she used to be for that? We wouldn't throw money away on costly premiums for profit-making private insurance companies. Pharmaceutical companies would no longer be able to rip off Americans with the most expensive prescription drugs in the world.\n\"Didn't she used to be for that?\"\nFor months, Clinton\u2019s campaign has been highlighting issues where it can carve out a lane to the left of Sanders \u2014 gun control became a flashpoint in the first debate when Clinton attacked Sanders for his vote against the Brady Bill, and she doubled down on those attacks for days after on the campaign trail.\nThe latest attempt to draw a contrast on tax hikes and wage increases can be seen as an attempt by Clinton to undercut any momentum Sanders is building among union workers and middle class voters, and to position herself as the candidate most concerned with take home pay for working families.\n\u201cHillary Clinton believes strongly that middle class families deserve a raise, not a tax increase,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cShe has proposed a bold, aggressive agenda, but when it comes to paying for it, she will make sure the wealthiest Americans finally start paying their fair share, not force the middle class to pay even more than they already do.\"\nBy\nGabriel Debenedetti\nDuring the debate, Clinton stated that she will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for her debt-free public college program and her proposal to institute mandatory paid family leave \u2014but stopped short of drawing a contrast with Sanders\u2019 tax plans. \u201cI have made very clear that hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase,\u201d Clinton said Saturday night. \u201cI will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment and I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class.\"\nIn the debate, Sanders demurred when asked for details about his forthcoming tax plan. \u201cWe haven\u2019t come up with an exact number yet,\u201d he said when asked by how much he would raise the country\u2019s top marginal income tax rate to pay for his proposals.\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "'The last thing you should do is cut their take-home pay right off the bat,' says Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon.", "title": "Clinton hits Sanders on middle class tax hikes", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/hillary-clinton-taxes-middle-class-bernie-sanders-215958", "topics": ["economy", "guns"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Susan Rice", "Michael Briggs", "Kenneth P.

His exit left 14 Republicans in the presidential race.\nJindal, 44, was the first person of Indian-American heritage to run for U.S. president. A Christian who converted from Hinduism as a teenager, his message was aimed at social conservatives and evangelical Christians.\nJindal's campaign focused especially on Iowa, which votes first in the series of state contests to choose the Republican nominee. Conservative evangelicals often do well there, and several candidates hoped for a strong showing.\nBut he struggled after entering the race in June to separate himself from the pack seeking the Republican nomination for the November 2016 election. He received 0.8 percent support in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll.\nJindal spent more money than he raised in the third quarter. Other Republican candidates had already quit after burning through cash too quickly.\nHe failed to qualify for the prime-time Republican debate on Nov. 10, but during the forum for lower-polling candidates, he went on the attack against his rivals onstage.\nOn Monday, Jindal's campaign said he would continue his tour of Iowa's 99 counties this week.\n\"But this is not my time,\" Jindal said in a statement on Tuesday, \"so I am suspending my campaign for President.\"\nFormer Iowa Republican Party Chairman Matt Strawn said Jindal's withdrawal would buoy U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who appeals to the same evangelical voters and on Monday won the backing of an influential Iowa lawmaker.\n\"It means a good week for Senator Cruz just got better as he attempts to consolidate evangelical and anti-establishment support in Iowa,\" Strawn said.\nLouisiana voters will go to the polls on Saturday to pick Jindal's successor as governor.\nJindal said that after leaving office, he would work on a think tank he formed. He did not endorse another Republican presidential candidate on Tuesday, saying he would support the party's nominee.\nFor more on the 2016 U.S. presidential race and to learn about the undecided voters who determine elections, visit the Reuters website.

It comes after a weeklong argument between Mr. Rubio, of Florida, and Mr. Cruz, of Texas, over which of them can credibly say he is tough on illegal immigration \u2013 and it strikes directly at Mr. Rubio\u2019s biggest vulnerability in the Republican presidential primary.\n\u201cWhen Marco Rubio teamed up with John McCain, Chuck Schumer and Bob Menendez to push his Gang of Eight amnesty scheme, he said he wanted to secure the border,\u201d a narrator says in the 60-second commercial, linking Mr. Rubio with two Democrats and to Mr. McCain, a Republican who is nonetheless loathed by many hard-line conservatives.\n\u201cBut then Rubio voted against every border security amendment Ted Cruz and Jeff Sessions proposed,\u201d the narrator says. \u201cEvery one. It was part of the deal Rubio made with Obama: no amendments, even on border security.\u201d\nThe ad credits Mr. Cruz with having stopped \u201cthe Obama-Rubio Gang of Eight amnesty bill,\u201d though he was one of 32 senators who voted against it.\n\u201cMarco Rubio betrayed our trust, failed us, and he\u2019s done nothing since coming to Washington but push for amnesty,\u201d the narrator says, urging voters to support Mr. Cruz \u201cnow, before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\nThe group behind the ad has spent relatively little since it was set up in September, according to federal filings, especially compared to the tens of millions of dollars raised, but as yet mainly unspent, by four super PACs that were formed in the spring to support Mr. Cruz. It has so far disclosed only a single donation: $5,000 so far from a Texas investor.\nA spokesman for Mr. Rubio did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Shaftan said the ad would run solely on radio, not television, though the group released the ad in video form.\nMr. Rubio has been running a counteroffensive against Mr. Cruz for days, pointing out that he offered amendments that would have stripped a pathway to citizenship from the immigration overhaul effort but would have provided legal status to the millions of undocumented immigrants already in the country.\nMr. Cruz sought to counter that\u00a0on Monday\u00a0with the endorsement of Representative Steve King of Iowa, one of the most hawkish voices against illegal immigration.\nIn reality, the spot takes license with the facts. There were no amendments by, or co-sponsored by, Mr. Cruz that were voted on during the work of the so-called Gang of Eight. And Mr. Rubio voted in favor of a border security amendment sponsored by Senator John Cornyn of Texas.\nStill, the group being run by Mr. Shaftan has sought to nudge the better-financed outside groups supporting Mr. Cruz to become more aggressive on his behalf.", "byline": "MAGGIE HABERMAN", "description": "An ad from a small new \u201csuper PAC\u201d assails Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s work to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013 as an \u201camnesty scheme\u201d and part of a pact with the so-called Group of Eight lawmakers and President Obama.", "title": "First Draft: New Radio Ad Hammers Marco Rubio Over Immigration, on Ted Cruz\u2019s Behalf", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/17/new-radio-ad-hammers-marco-rubio-over-immigration-on-ted-cruzs-behalf/", "topics": ["immigration", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Steve King", "Bob Menendez", "John Mccain", "Chuck Schumer", "Marco Rubio", "John Cornyn", "Jeff Sessions", "Ted Cruz"], "org": "nyt", "election_confidence": 0.8712966854400207, "authors": [{"author_id": 7421, "fullname": "maggie haberman", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-11-17 17:50:59", "orgs": ["PAC", "PACs"], "article_id": "319bb7ab6fe757c3aba30ea298ac836b", "date_access": "2015-11-17 18:35:15.231777"}, {"body": "11/17/15 12:55 PM EST\nBy\nKenneth P.

Vogel\n11/17/15 12:55 PM EST\nThe Koch network stepped up funding for its own groups in 2014, but also served as something of an ATM for some of the most powerful groups on the right \u2015 doling out millions in grants to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Club for Growth and National Rifle Association, among major backers of Republicans \u2015 according to a tax filing publicly released Tuesday morning.\nThe filings were submitted to the Internal Revenue Service by Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the central group in the increasingly powerful network of conservative public policy and political groups helmed by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch.\nStory Continued Below\nThe tax filings show that Freedom Partners, which was created in late 2011 to increase coordination within the Koch network, raised $162 million in 2013 and 2014. Three quarters of that haul came in last year, almost entirely from six-figure membership dues of wealthy donors who the Kochs convene twice a year for summits that highlight the virtues of fiscally conservative, small government policies \u2015 and that raise money for groups and candidates who support those policies.\nFreedom Partners and most of its grantees do not reveal their donors\u2019 names because they are registered under a section of the tax code \u2015 501(c) \u2015 that does not require them to do so.\nThe group\u2019s impressive haul constitutes the lion\u2019s share of the $290 million that the Koch network expected to spend in the run-up to the 2014 midterm elections. And its tax filings show that the group disseminated the majority of its cash to other groups, with the biggest donations going to a cluster groups that form the central core of the\u2019 network.\nAmericans for Prosperity, the network's most politically aggressive group,, received $22 million from Freedom Partners. Concerned Veterans for America, which seeks to engage veterans on fiscal issues, received $16 million. The LIBRE Initiative, which targets Latino voters, received $6.5 million. A group that disseminates money to reach evangelical voters received $6 million, while the American Energy Alliance, which opposes energy regulations, received $2 million.\nBut Freedom Partners also wrote grants to an array of groups that play key roles in the broader conservative coalition, but are not considered to be part of the network \u2015 including some that have differed sharply with the Kochs\u2019 public policy stances.\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce received $2 million from Freedom Partners, despite lobbying for the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, a program vehemently opposed by the Koch network as market-skewing corporate welfare. The Club for Growth and Heritage Action for America \u2015 which supported a 2013 government shutdown that the Koch network said it opposed \u2015 received $1 million and $150,000, respectively.\nOther grantees outside the Koch network included the National Rifle Association\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action, which received $4.9 million, and a group called the Dr. Joseph Warren Institute that spreads the messages of medical professionals who oppose Obamacare. It received $300,000 from Freedom Partners.\nSome grantees used Freedom Partners\u2019 cash for highly specific campaigns that seemed to have at least the network's tacit endorsement. A $400,000 grant went to a group called Trees of Liberty, which, as POLITICO revealed last week, spent its cash attacking the leading rival of Koch-favorite Joni Ernst during her 2014 GOP primary campaign for the Iowa Senate seat she eventually won. Trees of Liberty was created in 2013 with the Kochs\u2019 blessing to cultivate candidates who share their commitment to free-market conservatism.\nThe tax filings show that Freedom Partners paid Aegis Strategic $1.3 million in consulting fees. And Freedom Partners donated $693,000 to an affiliated super PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, which last fall aired ads attacking Democratic Senate candidates, including Ernst\u2019s general election opponent, then-Rep. Bruce Braley.\nFreedom Partners Chamber of Commerce\u2019s tax filings reveal that the group is branching out beyond merely disseminating cash to other entities for political and public policy advocacy, and has built its own robust operation. Its staff, which numbered 60 employees in 2013, grew to 133 employees last year. They were paid a total of $13 million in salary and benefits, including $794,000 that went to the salary and benefits of the group\u2019s president Marc Short.\nFreedom Partners also spent heavily on functions it used to delegate to grantees. It spent $1.9 million on focus groups and $1.2 million on advertising production. It paid $1.5 million to the firm of Frank Luntz, a regular guest at Koch donor seminars, and $1.4 million to the Utah-based direct mail firm Arena Communications.\nKenneth P.
