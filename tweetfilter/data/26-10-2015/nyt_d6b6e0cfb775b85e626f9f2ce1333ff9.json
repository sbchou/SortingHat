{"body": "Hillary Rodham Clinton has seized on remarks Senator Bernie Sanders made in the first Democratic debate that \u201call the shouting in the world\u201d would not keep guns out of the wrong hands, suggesting that Mr. Sanders used those words because of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s gender.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been shouting, but sometimes when a woman speaks out, some people think it\u2019s shouting,\u201d she said at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Des Moines, Iowa, on Saturday.\n\nBut Mr. Sanders\u2019s past comments about gun control suggest that his \u201cshouting\u201d line is just that \u2013 a favored turn of phrase that he has used regularly in the past few months, long before Mrs. Clinton released her plan to address gun violence.\n\nIn July, Mr. Sanders, senator of Vermont, said that people needed to \u201cstop shouting at each other\u201d on the issue of guns. In August, he said that \u201cpeople shouting at each other\u201d about gun control \u201cis not doing anybody any good.\u201d And on Oct. 1, reacting to the mass shooting at a community college in Oregon, he said that the nation needed to \u201cget beyond the shouting\u201d on the issue.\n\nMrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, announced her proposals to curb gun violence on Oct. 5, and in recent weeks she has been particularly vocal on the issue of gun control, a subject on which Mr. Sanders has a mixed record.\n\nIn an interview Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d \u2013 which played a clip of Mrs. Clinton making a similar comment on Friday about Mr. Sanders\u2019s word choice \u2013 the senator defended himself.\n\n\u201cAll that I can say is I am very proud of my record on women\u2019s issues,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI certainly do not have a problem with women speaking out, and I think what the secretary is doing there is taking words and misapplying them.\u201d", "byline": "THOMAS KAPLAN", "description": "Hillary Rodham Clinton seemed to suggest that Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s comment that \u201call the shouting in the world\u201d would not keep guns out of the wrong hands was phrased that way because of her gender.", "title": "First Draft: Hillary Clinton Takes Jab at Bernie Sanders\u2019s \u201cShouting\u201d Remark", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/10/25/hillary-clinton-takes-jab-at-bernie-sanderss-shouting-remark/", "topics": ["guns"], "people": ["Bernie Sanders", "Hillary Clinton", "Hillary Rodham Clinton"], "orgs": [], "election_confidence": 0.5614261936743942, "authors": [{"author_id": 737, "fullname": "thomas kaplan", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-10-25 20:18:41", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "d6b6e0cfb775b85e626f9f2ce1333ff9", "date_access": "2015-10-25 19:31:55.985265"}
