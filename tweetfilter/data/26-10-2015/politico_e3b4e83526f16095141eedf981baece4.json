Goldman\n\n\n                                            By \nTodd S. Purdum\n\nPaul Ryan has been abundantly clear: As speaker of the House, he won\u2019t spend all of his time jetting across the country to keep the National Republican Congressional Committee flush.\nBut far from being concerned, top GOP moneymen believe the Wisconsin Republican will be a major boon financially for the party. The national network he\u2019s amassed as a vice presidential candidate and from coordinating the national party's spending in presidential elections give him advantages that even the highly prolific John Boehner didn\u2019t enjoy.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cHe has really strong numbers among the conservative community across the board, and across the country. He has deep developed strong relationships with some of our best supporters around the country,\u201d said National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.). \"Frankly, I don\u2019t know more than maybe one or two other members that have that level of relationships.\u201d\n\"He\u2019s kind of a fresh new product on the market, if you will, and he will be enormously helpful and successful,\" Walden added.\n\n\n\n            By \nAdam Sneed\n\nThere's no question Ryan has big shoes to fill. Boehner has raised $300 million for the NRCC since 2009. There was grumbling and some fear in the House Republican Conference when Ryan said he wanted to be with his family on the weekends, which Boehner often spent on the road raising cash. The speakership is \"not a 9-to-5 job,\" Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kansas), a Ryan critic, said this week.\nBut party officials are already plotting creative ways to compensate for Ryan's demand for family time. Boehner held a lot of fundraisers on the golf course. Ryan isn\u2019t a golfer. So instead of a five-hour event playing golf, allies say, Ryan can hold two events in the same time and can bring in five times as much money by attracting many more donors. Associates also say he is unusually efficient with his time, even tending to donors on drives between events.\nAs Ryan nears the speakership, his political operation is beginning to take shape.\nAs Ways and Means chairman, Ryan had dual agreements with the NRCC and Republican National Committee, whereby he gave them each a day or two during Congressional recesses where they could send him around the country for events. Ryan has told the RNC that he will no longer do regular events for them, and instead will focus solely on the NRCC. \nDuring a private meeting in which he announced his candidacy, Ryan also told the House Republican Conference that he would focus solely on raising money for the NRCC . \nRyan was prolific for the RNC during the 2012 cycle. Even before he became the vice presidential nominee, he raised $23 million for the party.\n\n\n\n            By \nKevin Robillard\n\nWhile Ryan\u2019s departure will certainly be a hit for the RNC, Sean Spicer, a spokesman for the committee, said Ryan\u2019s fundraising heft will help the broader GOP \u201cfamily\u201d of committees.\n\u201cPaul Ryan has been an unbelievable fundraiser and supporter of the RNC and the party writ large,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cIf he becomes speaker, it would be a huge help to have him at the NRCC.\u201d\nTop NRCC officials agree. Despite his desire to go home on weekends, many top officials think Ryan can be as prodigious as Boehner. He\u2019s already a top surrogate for the NRCC. He has contributed $2.7 million to the party committee since 2011 \u2013 not counting events he has held for candidates and colleagues, according to a source familiar with the committee\u2019s fundraising.\n\"He is in high demand,\" said Walden, \"because he can articulate the issues, he gives a great vision discussion about the future of the party and where we can go. And he\u2019s very likable. And so, we\u2019ve helped him manage that demand ... at the NRCC to maximize his time because it\u2019s so valuable.\u201d\nRyan still has a lot of work to do. As his staff prepares for the enormity of the speakership, they also have to build a political operation. Boehner had his own political staff, dubbed \"Team Boehner,\" that had office space at the NRCC and worked closely with the committee in scheduling events and Boehner\u2019s travel. Ryan can go that route, or he could hand over his political operation to the committee itself. \nBoehner's operation was massive. He traveled for an entire month every summer, in addition to holding events throughout the year. \n\nCongress\n\n            By \nJohn Bresnahan\n             and \nJake Sherman\n\nBoehner and Ryan also have different styles and demeanors. Boehner is a back-slapping political animal, while Ryan is an affable policy wonk.\n\"Donors tend to be as attracted to the personality as much as they are to the office,\u201d said Dan Senor, a close Ryan confidant who works with billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Singer in New York. \u201cThe donor community likes spending time with Paul because he's a very smart guy and he's very thoughtful and he's not just buried in process but he can also talk about policy and a governing agenda.\u201d\nSenor added that while he understands the concerns about Ryan's family time cutting into fundraising time, \"when he is out fundraising he is very efficient and he accomplishes a lot.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "His cash network will more than compensate for weekends at home, allies say.", "title": "GOP moneymen: Ryan a fundraising juggernaut", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/paul-ryan-fundraising-house-speaker-215116", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Katy O'Donnell", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Sean Spicer", "Rachael Bade", "Henry C.
