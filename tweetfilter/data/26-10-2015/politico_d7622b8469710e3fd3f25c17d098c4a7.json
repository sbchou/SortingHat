In March, he said through a spokesman that he has only sent two email messages in his life, back when he was in the White House.\nClinton was in mid-campaign form, enjoying the spotlight during his first foray onto the campaign trail. \n\"The American people in the last six weeks have learned a lot about Hillary \u2014 what she\u2019s for, why she\u2019s running, and what kind of president she\u2019d be,\" he said. \"If they watched Saturday Night Live, they know she\u2019s a pretty good bartender, too.\"\n\n\n\n            By \nAnna Palmer\n\nReferring to the recent Democratic debate, he said, \"I was proud to be a Democrat because I watched five hours of the Republicans debate. [On our side] every disagreement they had was over an issue. that\u2019s politics at its best. Nobody insulted anyone else. no one was out there to get people to stop thinking.\"\nAbout 15 minutes into his speech, some of the crowd cheered when he said he was almost finished. While Clinton was on stage, a plane flying a banner \u201cRevolution Starts Now: FEEL THE BERN,\u201d flew over the modest stage set up in front of the Hy-Vee Hall, a sign of the challenge she still faces in the face of the best stretch of her campaign.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Bill Clinton rallies Iowa crowd with talk of emails", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/clinton-des-moines-iowa-215132", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Katy O'Donnell", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Katy Perry", "Rachael Bade", "Helena Bottemiller Evich", "Henry C.
