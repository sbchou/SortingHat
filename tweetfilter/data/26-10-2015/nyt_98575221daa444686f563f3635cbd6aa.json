{"body": " DES MOINES \u2014 Appearing at his first rally of the campaign on behalf of his wife, Bill Clinton exhorted the crowd to rise above the deeply partisan tone of this election cycle and said that Hillary Rodham Clinton had shown voters her truest self in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s still got the best friends that she had in grade school,\u201d said Mr. Clinton, whose wife has seen a decrease in the number of voters who view her as \u201chonest and trustworthy\u201d in polls after a summer spent fending off questions about her use of a private email server while she was the secretary of state.\n\nSomeone who can make that boast about their friends is by \u201cdefinition a trustworthy, reliable good person unless they had a toy theft gang going\u201d as a child, Mr. Clinton said.\n\nThe last month has been \u201cinteresting\u201d for his family, Mr. Clinton said, citing the first birthday of his granddaughter, Charlotte, and his 40th wedding anniversary with Mrs. Clinton.\n\nBut over the past few weeks of the campaign the country has finally gotten to see the person he met decades ago, Mr. Clinton said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the person I got to see again, without all those barnacles, in the debate and in those 11 hours of testimony,\u201d said Mr. Clinton, referring to her marathon testimony before the House committee investigating the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nEarlier, Mr. Clinton said that \u201cthe\u00a0American people in the last six weeks have learned a lot about Hillary \u2014 what she\u2019s for, why she\u2019s running, and what kind of president she\u2019d be.\u201d They also learned from Saturday Night Live that she\u2019s \u201ca pretty good bartender, too.\u201d\n\nHe said that he had received gushing emails from their friends praising her testimony. He wrote back, \u201cI think I\u2019ll vote for her.\u201d\n\nMr. Clinton\u2019s aides have long said that he does not use email.\n\nHis wife\u2019s policy goals in the campaign are crucial, Mr. Clinton said, using one of his signature phrases in describing them as a \u201cbig deal.\u201d\n\nMr. Clinton largely kept to a short speech, with his love of the stage threatening to take over only occasionally. Several times he promised to say \u201cone more thing,\u201d before remarking on just one more thing.\n\nMr. Clinton also decried the tenor of the debate in the Republican race, sounding the type of aspirational note that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. urged Democrats to engage in when he announced he would not seek the presidency himself last week.\n\n\u201cIf you want an end to negative politics, you have to stop rewarding it,\u201d Mr. Clinton told the rally. He denounced negative ads cut in \u201cdark rooms.\u201d And he suggested that ending wage stagnation was crucially important. The Democratic debate focused on issues, he said, while the Republicans have devolved into tearing each other apart.\n\nMr. Clinton said that America\u2019s political leaders had to \u201cstop running each other down and start building everybody up.\u201d By contrast, Mrs. Clinton used her remarks to laud President Obama\u2019s accomplishments and warn about what she called Republican efforts to \u201crip it away.\u201d\n\nOverhead, a plane flew with a sign trailing behind that\u00a0read, \u201cRevolution starts here! Feel the Bern!\u201d It was a reference to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has emerged as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s main rival in the Democratic contest.\n\nMr. Clinton also briefly found himself negotiating with a heckler who jumped on the stage in support of animal rights.\n\nAs the man continued yelling, Mr. Clinton genially continued talking, and the crowd booed to drown the man\u00a0out.\n\nBut after several moments, Mr. Clinton turned to the man and asked, \u201cWe got it. Will you please quit now?\u201d The man was soon escorted from the stage.\n\nThe former president turned back to the crowd and said, \u201cAt least that guy is for something. He didn\u2019t come here to bad mouth anybody.\u201d", "byline": "MAGGIE HABERMAN", "description": "Appearing at his first rally of the campaign on behalf of his wife, Bill Clinton exhorted the crowd to rise above the partisan tone of this election cycle and said that Hillary Rodham Clinton has shown voters her truest self in recent weeks.", "title": "First Draft: Bill Clinton Rallies Iowa for Hillary Clinton as \u2018Honest and Trustworthy\u2019", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/10/24/bill-clinton-rallies-iowa-for-hillary-clinton-as-honest-and-trustworthy/", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Bill Clinton", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Joseph R.
