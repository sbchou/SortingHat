Bernie Sanders on Sunday challenged Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton\u2019s characterization of why her husband, former President Bill Clinton, signed the Defense of Marriage Act, which denied federal recognition of gay marriages.\nHillary Clinton said on Friday she supported the 1996 legislation as a defensive measure to prevent an even stricter amendment to the Constitution doing the same thing. And Sanders took issue with that, saying it was a \u201chomophobic\u201d and politically expedient law.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cI think the evidence is very, very clear that that legislation was anti-gay legislation,\u201d he said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cIt was playing off the fears of a lot of Americans.\u201d\nIn a Friday appearance on \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show\u201d on MSNBC, Hillary Clinton said there was enough momentum in 1996 to amend the Constitution. DOMA, she said, was \u201ca line that was drawn to prevent going further.\u201d\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\nSanders, an independent senator from Vermont who is running for president as a Democrat, voted against the bill when he was a member of the House \u2014 which he said was \u201cnot an easy vote\u201d because of the political atmosphere at the time.\n\u201cI thought then \u2014 and I think now \u2014 that people have the right to love those folks that they want to love and get married because of their sexual orientation,\u201d Sanders said.\nSince then, though, he said, \u201cWe have become a far less discriminatory society,\u201d and \u201cwe should be very, very proud \u2026 We\u2019ve come a long way.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Sanders: Hillary&apos;s wrong on gay marriage law", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-gay-marriage-215139", "topics": ["personality", "surveillance/privacy", "lgbt issues", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Katy O'Donnell", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Bill Clinton", "Rachael Bade", "Henry C.
