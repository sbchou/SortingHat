He just said it in the wrong place.\nThe New Jersey governor was kicked out of Amtrak\u2019s \u201cquiet car\u201d for reportedly screaming (or, at least, talking loudly) on the phone during a return ride to New Jersey from Washington on an Acela Express. He later apologized for breaking the transit company\u2019s \u201ccardinal rule.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\nAccording to Christie\u2019s spokesperson Sam Smith, the GOP presidential candidate who appeared on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d prior to his departure, took a seat in the quiet car by accident during his morning travels. \n\"On a very full train this morning, the Governor accidentally took a seat in Amtrak's notorious quiet car,\" Smith said.\n\"After breaking the cardinal rule of the quiet car, the Governor promptly left once he realized the serious nature of his mistake and enjoyed the rest of his time on the train from the cafe car. Sincere apologies to all the patrons of the quiet car that were offended.\"\nAmtrak\u2019s passenger guidelines urge riders to use quiet voices to help maintain a \u201clibrary like atmosphere\u201d in that particular car. \nThe story was initially reported on Gawker, where someone claiming to be a nearby passenger said the governor was yelling a lot.\nChristie continues to lag in early voting state polls, coming in 12th in a recent Iowa poll by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics. \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The New Jersey governor is kicked out of Amtrak\u2019s \u201cquiet car\u201d for making noise.", "title": "Chris Christie too loud for Amtrak", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/chris-christie-amtrak-2016-quiet-car-215145", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Katy O'Donnell", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Rachael Bade", "Henry C.
