{"body": "Donald J. Trump, whose campaign has fallen behind that of Ben Carson in Iowa polls released this week, appeared to take aim Saturday at Mr. Carson\u2019s faith.\n\nSpeaking at a rally in Jacksonville, Fla., Mr. Trump noted that he was a Presbyterian, which he called \u201cdown the middle of the road.\u201d\n\nThen Mr. Trump said: \u201cI mean, Seventh-day Adventist, I don\u2019t know about, I just don\u2019t know about.\u201d\n\nMr. Carson is a practicing Seventh-day Adventist.\n\nProvocation is Mr. Trump\u2019s stock in trade and he has been biting in his criticism of his Republican rivals.   But in favorably contrasting his faith with that of a principal rival, he may have reached a new level of bombast, at least as it relates to his opponents.\n\nMr. Trump also reprised previous attacks he has directed at Mr. Carson, calling him \u201csuper low\u201d energy and expressing astonishment at the former neurosurgeon\u2019s rise.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand the whole deal,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nCampaigning in Iowa Saturday, Mr. Carson said: \u201cMy energy levels are perfectly fine.\u201d  He noted that he spent long hours in surgery, adding: \u201cDoesn\u2019t require a lot of jumping up and down and screaming, but it does require a lot of concentration.\u201d\n\nTwo Iowa surveys released this week showed Mr. Carson surpassing Mr. Trump in the polls.  The Des Moines Register\u2019s survey, long seen as the most accurate poll in the state, found Mr. Carson winning by nine percentage points over Mr. Trump.
