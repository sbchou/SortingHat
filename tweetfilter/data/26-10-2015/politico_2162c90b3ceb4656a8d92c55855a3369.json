That phrase echoed Obama\u2019s \u201cFired up! Ready to go!\u201d call-and-response chant that tore through the room then -- and shocked a less organized, less fired-up Clinton campaign that was based on experience and competence.\nStory Continued Below\nOn Saturday, the sting of the 2008 J-J Dinner -- and Clinton\u2019s determination to capture some of the energy that became a feature of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 insurgency -- was at the forefront of the campaign\u2019s planning. Hours before the dinner, the campaign announced an endorsement from David Plouffe, Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign manager. \u201cTo be honest, during the most intense days of the 2008 primary, I would never have imagined writing this,\u201d Plouffe wrote. \u201cAnd I doubt Team Clinton felt any differently about me \u2026 She\u2019s the right person to protect President Obama\u2019s legacy on health care and so much else.\u201d\nThe campaign also seemed to have learned its lesson about being out-organized. More than 100 volunteers and staffers, at points joined by campaign manager Robby Mook, started marching in the streets of downtown Des Moines before 7 a.m. on a chilly fall Saturday. The campaign headquarters in Des Moines was filled by the afternoon with hundreds of volunteers attending a training session, dressed in royal-blue T-shirts that read \u201cI\u2019m Fighting for Her.\u201d The campaign also brought out the big dog for his first official appearance on the trail: Former President Bill Clinton gave a 15-minute speech Saturday afternoon, appearing to relish being back on the campaign trail and in the spotlight.\n\"The American people in the last six weeks have learned a lot about Hillary \u2014 what she\u2019s for, why she\u2019s running, and what kind of president she\u2019d be,\" he told a large crowd that had lined up and waited for an hour-and-a-half for a short set performed by Perry. \"If they watched 'Saturday Night Live,' they know she\u2019s a pretty good bartender, too.\"\n\n\n\n            By \nAnnie Karni\n             and \nGlenn Thrush\n\nThe dinner also marks a critical moment for Sanders, who needs to show he can maintain the enthusiasm that buoyed him all summer even as Clinton grows in strength after the one-two punch of her debate performance and her testimony Thursday in front of the House Benghazi Committee. At Clinton\u2019s rally, a single-engine plane flying a banner \u201cRevolution Starts Now: FEEL THE BERN,\u201d flew over the modest stage set up in front of the Hy-Vee Hall, a sign of the challenge Clinton still faces, even as she benefits from the boost of a ten-day winning streak.\nSanders\u2019 campaign also planned a rally before the dinner, with alumni of the band Guster getting the crowd amped up. \u201cOur allotted 1,950 seats will all be full,\u201d said Robert Becker, Iowa State director for the Sanders campaign. \u201cBernie will address the rally, and then we\u2019ll march across the Des Moines River. We\u2019re going to be a diverse and rowdy bunch.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Her campaign rolls out Bill Clinton and Katy Perry to capture the energy that electrified Barack Obama's campaign eight years ago.", "title": "Hillary Clinton gears up for Iowa&apos;s Jefferson-Jackson dinner", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/clinton-iowa-215133", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "campaign_finance", "surveillance/privacy"], "people": ["Katy O'Donnell", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Eliza Collins", "Katy Perry", "Rachael Bade", "Helena Bottemiller Evich", "Henry C.
