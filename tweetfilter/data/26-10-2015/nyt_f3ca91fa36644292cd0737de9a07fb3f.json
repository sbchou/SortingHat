{"body": "The Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said Sunday he believed that abortion should be outlawed even in cases of rape and incest, comparing the procedure with slavery.\n\n\u201cI would not be in favor of killing a baby because the baby came about in that way,\u201d Mr. Carson said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d citing \u201cthe many stories of people who have led very useful lives who were the result of rape or incest.\u201d\n\nMr. Carson, who has not been shy about using slavery and Nazi metaphors, held up what he said was a historic parallel with abortion.\n\n\u201cDuring slavery, a lot of the slave owners thought that they had the right to do whatever they wanted to that slave,\u201d said Mr. Carson, a former brain surgeon. \u201cAnything that they chose to do. And, you know, what if the abolitionist had said, you know, \u2018I don\u2019t believe in slavery. I think it\u2019s wrong. But you guys do whatever you want to do.\u2019 Where would we be?\u201d\n\nSurveys of Republican voters in Iowa, where Mr. Carson has staked out a lead, indicate that such language does little to hurt him there. \n\nMr. Carson noted as much in the interview, saying: \u201cThe fortunate thing is a lot of people really do think for themselves, as you can see, you know, from the poll numbers here.\u201d\n\nAsked about his penchant for invoking Nazism on such issues as health care coverage, Mr. Carson said he had received positive feedback from some Jews for the comparisons, which others have called inflammatory. \n\n\u201cIn the last several weeks, I\u2019ve heard from many people in the Jewish community, including rabbis, who said, \u2018You\u2019re spot on. You are exactly right,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Carson\u2019s rise in Iowa has bumped Donald J. Trump from his monthslong polling advantage there, a development that has prompted Mr. Trump to attack Mr. Carson, one of the few Republican candidates he had so far largely ignored.\n\nAppearing on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Mr. Trump attacked Mr. Carson on immigration and called him \u201ca very low energy person,\u201d but he seemed perplexed at how the soft-spoken doctor had seized the lead in Iowa.\n\n\u201cBen doesn\u2019t even go to Iowa that much,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Trump brought up Mr. Carson\u2019s Seventh-day Adventist faith, which could prompt some concerns among Iowa\u2019s evangelicals, at a rally in Florida, but insisted in an interview Sunday that he was not attempting to attack Mr. Carson over his faith.\n\nAsked on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d why he had raised Mr. Carson\u2019s religion, Mr. Trump refused to apologize or offer an explanation for his comments.\n\n\u201cBecause I just said, I don\u2019t know about it,\u201d said Mr. Trump, repeating the phrase he used Saturday. \u201cI said nothing about it. I would never say bad. I\u2019d never say bad about any religion.\u201d ", "byline": "JONATHAN MARTIN", "description": "The Republican presidential candidate said abortion should be outlawed even in cases of rape and incest, comparing abortion with slavery.", "title": "First Draft: Ben Carson Calls for Ban on Abortion in All Circumstances", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/10/25/ben-carson-calls-for-ban-on-abortion-in-all-circumstances/", "topics": ["abortion", "immigration"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Donald J.
