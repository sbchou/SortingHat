Ryan announced the task force in a closed meeting Thursday.\nThe House Freedom Caucus led a charge to rework the panel, saying it gave too much power to GOP leadership and committee chairmen, and too little to newer members and conservatives. Ryan has not yet signaled how he wants to change the committee's composition, but some have floated removing chairmen, and diluting the five votes the speaker gets.\nRyan has promised to overhaul the panel by Thanksgiving.\nHouse Majority Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) will sit on the panel, as will Reps. Luke Messer of Indiana, Rodney Davis of Illinois, Bill Flores of Texas, Bob Goodlatte and Morgan Griffith of Virginia, and Richard Hudson and Virginia Foxx of North Carolina.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Ryan announced the task force in a closed meeting Thursday.", "title": "Ryan forms task force to overhaul powerful Steering Committee", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/the-gavel/2015/11/paul-ryan-steering-committee-215552", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Lauren Gardner", "Erin Mershon", "Henry C.
