Schneiderman is also leading a coalition of states supporting EPA's climate regulations for power plants.\nStory Continued Below\nThe subpoena follows a growing outcry among climate activists sparked by investigations from InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times into Exxon's decade-long internal research into the links between global warming and human burning of fossil fuels. \nHillary Clinton last month became the last remaining Democratic presidential candidate to join environmentalists' call for a Department of Justice investigation into Exxon's alleged attempts to shield its own knowledge that fossil fuels exacerbate climate change. \nThe company said it is reviewing the subpoena disputed allegations that it misled the public. \n\"We unequivocally reject allegations that ExxonMobil suppressed climate change research contained in media reports that are inaccurate distortions of ExxonMobil\u2019s nearly 40-year history of climate research that was conducted publicly in conjunction with the Department of Energy, academics and the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nElana Schor is an energy reporter for Politico Pro.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "New York AG to investigate whether ExxonMobil climate research misled public", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/new-york-investigate-exxon-mobil-climate-research-215571", "topics": ["environment/energy"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Lauren Gardner", "Erin Mershon", "Hadas Gold", "Janet Yellen", "Jon Allen", "Jenny Hopkinson", "Brian Mahoney", "Theodoric Meyer", "Josh Gerstein", "Elana Schor", "Bernie Sanders", "Nick Gass", "Bernie Becker", "Alex Weprin", "Barney Frank", "Jeb Bush", "Seung Min Kim", "Issac J.
