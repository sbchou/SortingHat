CBS News, the first broadcast network to host a primary debate, is also planning to livestream the Democratic debate on Nov. 15 for free.\nOpening up access to streamers can make a difference: During its Democratic debate, CNN at one point had nearly 1 million concurrent viewers on its livestream.\nIn addition, Fox Business is \u201cunbundling\u201d on a number of its current pay-TV partners, including DirecTV, Suddenlink , Mediacom and the NCTC, letting subscribers who don\u2019t normally get Fox Business to have access to the channel for the debate. The move basically moves Fox Business from a premium tier to a lower tier for a temporary period of time. That effectively widens Fox Business' distribution and its potential pool of viewers. Fox Business is available in just over 74 million homes, according to Nielsen.\nThat move may help it when the ratings come in Nov. 11. CNBC drew an average of 14 million viewers for its Republican debate last month, but it was up against the MLB World Series, which likely sucked potential viewers away.\nWhere CNBC had an advantage is reach: The channel is distributed in just over 93 million homes, according to Nielsen, almost 20 million more than Fox Business. Fox Business won\u2019t have any major sporting events to contend with next week, however, and by expanding its distribution with existing partners, it can try to cut that gap.\nStill, by expanding its distribution and streaming for free online, Fox Business puts itself in a position where it is almost assured to have the most viewers for any program in its eight-year history.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The debate will be streamed for free on Foxbusiness.com without the need to be a cable TV subscriber.", "title": "Fox Business to stream GOP debate for free", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2015/11/fox-business-to-stream-gop-debate-for-free-215570", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Lauren Gardner", "Erin Mershon", "Hadas Gold", "Janet Yellen", "Jon Allen", "Jenny Hopkinson", "Brian Mahoney", "Theodoric Meyer", "Josh Gerstein", "Elana Schor", "Bernie Sanders", "Nick Gass", "Bernie Becker", "Alex Weprin", "Jeb Bush", "Seung Min Kim", "Jeh Johnson", "Donald Trump", "John Bresnahan", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Paul Ryan", "Tim Starks", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Jeremy Herb", "Tony Romm", "Daniel Strauss", "Heather Caygle", "Ben White", "Eric Wolff", "Darius Tahir", "Ben Carson", "Caitlin Emma"], "orgs": ["Fed", "DNC", "Senate", "Priorities USA Action", "Supreme Court", "UAW", "DirecTV", "Democratic National Committee", "R&D", "CNBC"], "election_confidence": 0.9725544151271958, "authors": [{"author_id": 30861, "fullname": "daniel strauss", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-05 20:36:14", "org": "politico", "article_id": "3068ebb421348426d221f3c4d3a8a9bb", "date_access": "2015-11-05 21:00:06.705744"}
