And for the first time, the House majority leader, who rocketed to No. 2 in leadership faster than many members land a committee chairmanship, is going to have to be content to stay where he is, possibly for years.\nWhen McCarthy ditched his bid for speaker last month \u2014 in the face of fierce opposition from the right, a major gaffe about his party\u2019s probe of the Benghazi attacks, and rumors about his personal life \u2014 some of his Republican colleagues wondered whether the majority leader would or even could stay in Congress. One top Republican said it was \"50-50\" that McCarthy would retire, and questioned whether he \"really wants to be here now.\" \nStory Continued Below\nBut long before his aborted bid for the speakership, the affable California Republican built up a deep reservoir of good will within the GOP Conference. And he appears to still have the confidence of leadership \u2014 starting with new Speaker Paul Ryan \u2014 and rank-and-file members to remain majority leader.\n\"It\u2019s clear that [McCarthy] is fully on board with the speaker\u2019s desire to shake up the way things are done around here, and his counsel has been indispensable as we\u2019ve worked to get this new speakership started off on the right foot,\" said Brendan Buck, spokesman for Ryan. \"It\u2019s going to be a great partnership for a long time.\"\n\n\n\n            By \nJake Sherman\n\nIn an interview with POLITICO this week, McCarthy asserted that his decision to drop his speaker campaign actually strengthened his position within the conference, a view his allies share. He said the move allowed Republicans, already reeling from John Boehner\u2019s resignation, to avoid an ugly fight between mainstream members and hard-liners, and to coalesce around Ryan.\n\"If you go back and look at my decision not to run [for speaker], I think we'll look at history and say that's the time we were able to come back together,\" McCarthy said in his first floor office in the Capitol. \"We had to face the challenges of where we are and where we're gonna go. And it gave us that moment.\"\nMcCarthy said he\u2019s upbeat about tackling big-ticket issues with Ryan like tax reform, defying doubts that major work in Congress can get done in a presidential election year. Still, McCarthy\u2019s status points to the importance of expectation and potential in the never-ending scramble for power that is Congress. He was seen as a future speaker; his every move was analyzed for what impact it would have on him becoming the top Republican leader. \nNow that that possibility has been set aside \u2014 if not indefinitely, probably for a long time \u2014 McCarthy has to recalibrate his political trajectory. Some weaknesses have been exposed, detractors and rivals within his own party have been more clearly identified, and the true depth of his support is clear. \nWhether McCarthy has peaked, or whether this is a temporary setback before another eventual bid for speaker, is still to be determined. \nMcCarthy's aides and allies believe he could have gotten the 218 votes he needed to become speaker, although it would have been an ugly, grind-it-out victory. Politics aside, McCarthy said he believed his decision to step aside was simply the right choice. \n\n\n\n            By \nSeung Min Kim\n\nEven his critics say McCarthy seems \"more like his old self\" \u2014 more relaxed and less tense about what will happen next. \n\"I actually believe at the end of the day, we've got a stronger leadership team now than we would before,\" McCarthy insisted. \n\"I'm excited because I see us getting stronger,\" McCarthy said of Ryan. \"We have different strengths and weaknesses, but I think those complement each other probably better than anyone else [in leadership].\"\nBowing out of the speaker\u2019s race was a concession to the bare-knuckled reality of life inside the GOP Conference nowadays. McCarthy may have been able to muscle his way into the job. But if he only barely won a floor vote to become speaker, it\u2019s questionable, at best, whether he would have been more effective than Boehner, who was hounded by the Freedom Caucus and other right-wing members during the five-plus years that he led the House. \nMcCarthy likely would have faced potential motions to \"vacate\" the speaker's post, rebellions on procedural votes and legislation, and a tidal wave of criticism from conservative media and organizations that had made it their mission to bring down \"Speaker McCarthy.\"\n\"I think there were a lot of members \u2014 some have said this publicly, some have said this in conference \u2014 how selfless it was that [McCarthy] recognized there were still fissures in the conference, and he chose not to run for speaker, stepped back,\" Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said in an interview. \n\"I still think he would have been able to get to 218 on the House floor,\u201d Scalise added. \u201cBut he felt that we wouldn't have been in the right place after that happened.\"\nNow, according to his allies, McCarthy has time to recover from the Benghazi blunder, in which he undermined the special committee investigating the 2012 attacks by publicly declaring the panel was created to hurt Hillary Clinton politically. The remarks raised questions about whether McCarthy had the verbal acumen to serve as a face of the GOP.\nTime should also allow talk of a relationship with Rep. Renee Ellmers (R-N.C.) \u2014 fueled in part by Ellmers' own apology to the Republican Conference over those same rumors \u2014 to die down. \nThe ideal scenario for a McCarthy comeback and potential future speaker bid, his allies say, goes something like this: He\u2019ll have proved himself to be a loyal top lieutenant to Ryan, continuing to build relationships with other members and doing the political spadework that comes with a top party post. The perception of McCarthy as lacking the gravitas to be speaker, the doubts about his suitability for the job, will have been addressed. \nDespite the fact that he was elected to the GOP leadership only in 2011 \u2014 he was appointed chief deputy whip in 2009 \u2014 McCarthy is now the longest-serving member of the Republican hierarchy.\n\"He's now the 'Old Man' in leadership, which is different for him,\" said Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chief deputy majority whip, of McCarthy. \"I think that gives him a different perspective.\u201d\n\n\n\n            By \nHeather Caygle\n             and \nLauren Gardner\n\nLike other Republicans, McHenry, who himself just turned 40 last month, believes McCarthy could still be speaker one day. \"It's still wide open for him. The question is how long Paul wants to be speaker. Kevin is well-positioned to take up the reins after that,\" McHenry said. Part of McCarthy's appeal \u2014 and one that may become even more important in the Paul Ryan era \u2014 is fundraising, the grunt work of modern politics. Ryan, who has young children, has said he won't take on the same grueling travel schedule that Boehner kept. That\u2019s an opportunity for McCarthy to step up.\nMcCarthy just transferred $1.2 million from his campaign account to the National Republican Congressional Committee, and he raised more than $4 million this last quarter for his various political committees. Sources close to the California Republican say he plans to keep up this pace throughout the rest of what will be a tough cycle politically and financially for GOP lawmakers.\n\"I believe he has tremendous opportunities in front of him,\u201d said Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.), a McCarthy ally. \u201cI believe, No. 1, he can be majority leader as long as he wants the job. And if the opportunity ever presented itself in the future again to be speaker, I would hope that he would consider that.\"\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "His rapid rise in House leadership has stalled, but allies including Paul Ryan are standing by him.", "title": "McCarthy looks to rebound from failed speaker bid", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/kevin-mccarthy-future-speaker-215489", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "economy"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Lauren Gardner", "Erin Mershon", "Hadas Gold", "Janet Yellen", "Jon Allen", "Brendan Buck", "Steve Scalise", "Jenny Hopkinson", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Theodoric Meyer", "Josh Gerstein", "Bernie Sanders", "Nick Gass", "Bernie Becker", "Alex Weprin", "Barney Frank", "Jeb Bush", "Seung Min Kim", "Issac J.
