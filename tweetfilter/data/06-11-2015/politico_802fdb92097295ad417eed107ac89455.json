The next Democratic debate is 10 days from now.\nStory Continued Below\nBILL CLINTON\u2019S BEHIND-THE-SCENES ROLE: POLITICO\u2019s Annie Karni reports: Eight months into HILLARY CLINTON\u2019s second presidential run, Bill Clinton is already occupying a more significant private role as a strategic adviser than he did in 2008 when his deployment was as a public surrogate \u2014 a role that effectively ended with his angry, politically damaging diatribes in a catastrophic South Carolina primary loss to Barack Obama.\nThis year, his biggest influence so far has been behind the scenes, a veteran voice who can carry the day during decisive moments in the race, even if he's removed \u2014 by design \u2014 from the nitty gritty of directing the daily operation. As always, it's hard to figure out exactly what Clinton is doing \u2014 he doesn't make a habit of reading out his conversations with his wife to anyone. But people close to the Clintons tell POLITICO it's not unusual for him to sit in on big meetings or even participate in conference calls with senior staff from time to time.\nAnd \u2014 unlike 2008 when the campaign's top staff were loyalists to his wife \u2014 his new role is enhanced by strong personal ties with top campaign chairman John Podesta, his former chief of staff at the White House, and campaign manager Robby Mook, with whom he developed a personal bond when Mook ran the campaign of his good friend, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. Read more at POLITICO http://politi.co/1GNLZhK\nTGIT, let\u2019s do it. It\u2019s time for your 2016 Blast. Henry C.

Meanwhile, Sanders registers as a Democrat in New Hampshire and MARTIN O\u2019MALLEY\u2019s moment might be coming. On the GOP side, DONALD TRUMP once courted the big donors he lambastes, BEN CARSON gets scrutiny, while he and Trump both get security. JEB BUSH opens up about his daughter\u2019s struggle with addiction, MARCO RUBIO tries to make his age an asset and CHRIS CHRISTIE pledges to debate you any time, anywhere.  \nTHE DAILY CLINTON\nU-TURN: The Wall Street Journal has an interview with BERNIE SANDERS in which he\u2019s much more aggressive at drawing sharp distinctions with HILLARY CLINTON and even raises the specter of her emails \u2014 after seemingly taking the issue off the table at the last Democratic debate. Per the WSJ, Sanders \u201cis casting her policy reversals over the years as a character issue that voters should take into account\u201d and said her email practices were \u201cvalid questions\u201d if they thwarted public-records requests or compromised classified information. http://on.wsj.com/1PnGSpu \nHONESTY ISSUES: The Washington Post says HILLARY CLINTON\u2019s current sanguine outlook belies broader issues with her perceived honesty, and that may haunt her in a general election. \u201cTo win \u2026 she has to prove to swing voters that she is the sort of person that they can and should trust with leading the country over the next (at least) four years. That won't be easy because Clinton is both totally known by the electorate and not seen in that light by a majority of them in most polls.\u201d http://wapo.st/1MCe9Za \nFAMILY BUSINESS: ABC looks at a group of (Bill) Clinton devotees who are reuniting to back HILLARY CLINTON. The \u201cArkansas Travelers\u201d have no official affiliation with the Clintons, but have relationships going back decades, even to childhood. http://abcn.ws/1iF9NIS \nWHAT A GIRL WANTS: Billboard reports that HILLARY CLINTON raised more than $1 million dollars at the home of singer Christina Aguilera during a West Coast fundraising trip. \u201cClinton opened her remarks by telling the crowd that she is inspired by Aguilera\u2019s song 'Fighter' and plans to fight for 'everyday Americans.'\" http://bit.ly/1PbVwla \nTHE PROGRESSIVE RESISTANCE\nSO LONG, SOCIALISM: ABC News reports BERNIE SANDERS will declare himself a Democrat on Thursday in order to appear on New Hampshire\u2019s primary ballot. \u201cLike many other presidential candidates this week, Sanders plans make an official stop at New Hampshire Secretary of State\u2019s office to file his \u2018Declaration of Candidacy\u2019 form for the first primary in the nation \u2026 The Sanders campaign confirmed to ABC News that Sanders will write in 'Democrat' on the form. It also brushed aside any concerns over potential ballot challenges.\u201d http://abcn.ws/1l938Zh \nPARTY PERSON: POLITICO\u2019s Gabriel Debenedetti reports BERNIE SANDERS has reached a joint fundraising agreement with the Democratic National Committee. \u201cThe move, which comes more than two months after HILLARY CLINTON\u2019s campaign signed such an agreement in August, will allow Sanders' team to raise up to $33,400 for the committee as well as $2,700 for the campaign from individual donors at events.\u201d http://politi.co/1NSqICQ \nMARTY\u2019S MOMENT?: Yahoo! suggests next week will \u2014 finally \u2014 be the moment that MARTIN O\u2019MALLEY gets a chance to break through. \u201cAfter toiling away in obscurity for much of the year, barely registering in polls or even in the public consciousness, O\u2019Malley suddenly finds himself \u2014 as he likes to put it with his dry wit \u2014 in sole possession of third place. \u2018I really feel like the campaign started in earnest 10 days ago, after the first debate,\u2019 he said.\" http://yhoo.it/1NSubRX \nTRUMP ON THE STUMP\nTHINK BIG: POLITICO\u2019s Kenneth P. Vogel and Ben Schreckinger report \u201cDONALD TRUMP has spent much of his presidential campaign bashing his GOP rivals as beholden to major donors, and, in recent weeks, he\u2019s expanded his attacks to include three major donors in particular \u2015 Sheldon Adelson, Paul Singer and the Koch brothers. But POLITICO has learned that Trump or his surrogates have sought to build relationships \u2015 if not support \u2015 from all three, calling into question the billionaire real estate showman\u2019s repeated assertions that, because of his wealth, he has no use for major donors.\u201d http://politi.co/1MlHDhX \nNEVER GIVE UP: Business Insider reports DONALD TRUMP denied POLITICO\u2019s story and (implausibly) denies knowing who GOP mega-donor Paul Singer is. http://read.bi/1NfHCJ1 \nTIME TO GET TOUGH: POLITICO\u2019s Eliza Collins reports DONALD TRUMP and BEN CARSON are getting Secret Service details. DHS spokesman Todd Breasseale says Secret Service will work with the campaigns to work out the timeframe to start the protection. http://politi.co/1Qh2d4V \nSURVIVING AT THE TOP: CNN reports DONALD TRUMP is up with his first campaign ads, \u201cradio ads set to air in the early primary states\u201d which \u201ctout Trump's business experience, slam politicians as \u2018all talk and no action\u2019 and play up Trump's pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. The $300,000 in ad buys will air in the first three primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.\u201d http://cnn.it/1l9hqcp \nCARSON\u2019S COURSE\nSCRUTINY ARRIVES: POLITICO\u2019S Nick Gass reports BEN CARSON found himself on the defensive on Thursday, a reporters pressed him on a slew of stories that have \u201csprung up questioning the factual accuracy of his past statements. As Carson has gained in the polls, so has media scrutiny of the 64-year-old retired pediatric neurosurgeon and Republican presidential candidate, whose past and present statements have drawn no shortage of curiosity and interest.\u201d http://politi.co/1PqkcoO \nRESTROOM RIGHTS: In the same interview Fusion reports that BEN CARSON called for the creation of transgender bathrooms. \u201cIt is not fair for them to make everybody else uncomfortable. It\u2019s one of the things that I don\u2019t particularly like \u2026 I think everybody has equal rights, but I\u2019m not sure that anybody should have extra rights.\u201d \nJEB\u2019S JOURNEY\nDAUGHTER\u2019S STRUGGLE: Huffington Post has a revealing, at times wrenching interview with JEB BUSH as he discusses his daughter Noelle\u2019s battle with drug addiction. \u201cBush spoke in highly personal terms about the toll that his daughter\u2019s struggles took on her famous family. \u2018She went through hell,\u2019 Bush said. \u2018And so did her mom and so did her dad. And it was in a private setting, but then it became very public when I was governor. And it wasn\u2019t easy.\u2019\" http://huff.to/1Q6WM9B \nBRO BACKER: POLITICO\u2019s Nick Gass reports JEB BUSH vouched for his brother former President George W. Bush\u2019s independence \u201cafter the release of excerpts from his father's upcoming biography that harshly criticized the negative influence of former Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. In response, Bush said that his older brother is 'a big boy' and that his father and others are attempting to \"create a different narrative.\" http://politi.co/1kwZ0l7 \nGRANITE GUARANTEE: POLITICO\u2019s Nick Gass reports JEB BUSH has guaranteed a victory in the New Hampshire primary. What\u2019s the worst that could happen? http://politi.co/1ML6rlK \nRUBIO\u2019S RACE\n\u2018OUTDATED\u2019 ATTACK: The Washington Post reports MARCO RUBIO tried to make his \u201cyouth an asset in foreign affairs\u201d during a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Thursday. \u201carguing \u2026 that the nation's security is being compromised by Washington's \u2018outdated political establishment\u2019 and that he would be a nimble commander in chief. \u2026 \"The nature of warfare is always changing and the leaders of the past are almost always blind to these changes,\" Rubio said, extending his criticism to \"outdated leaders\" of both political parties. http://wapo.st/1LSGs8l \nNOTED: \u201cAs Rubio spoke in Manchester, he was missing a vote back in Washington on a defense appropriations bill.\u201d\nDEFENSIVE SPECIALIST: Bloomberg: MARCO RUBIO \u201cseems to be deftly swatting away attacks from rivals DONALD TRUMP and JEB BUSH, but the barrage coming his way over missed Senate votes, immigration reform and mismanagement of personal finances have prompted him to quietly fine-tune his campaign as he rises in the polls and picks up big donors.\u201d http://bloom.bg/1OrAS0q \nGAS TAX RELAX: The Hill: MARCO RUBIO \u201cis calling for the 18.4 cents-per-gallon gas tax that pays for most federal transportation projects to be cut by 80 percent. The 2016 presidential hopeful said in a post on his campaign website that the gas tax should be cut because it is \u2018outdated\u2019 and replaced by a system that allows states to take the lead on financing transportation projects.\u201d http://bit.ly/1MLf6ok \nSURVEYING THE 2016 LANDSCAPE\nONE WAY OR ANOTHER: POLITICO\u2019s Daniel Strauss reports CHRIS CHRISTIE said he\u2019d be debating next week, whether he made the main stage or not. \u201cThe bottom line is you need to be on a stage and debating.
