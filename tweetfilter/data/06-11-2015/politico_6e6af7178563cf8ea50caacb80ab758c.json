I think my dad, like a lot of people that love George, want to try to create a different narrative, perhaps just to\u2014just 'cause that's natural to do, right? But [my brother] would say this was under my watch, I was commander in chief, I was the leader and I accept personal responsibility for what happened, both the good and the bad. And I think that's the right way to look at it,\" the former Florida governor said.\n\"As it relates to Dick Cheney, he served my brother well as vice president, and he served my dad extraordinarily well as secretary of defense,\" he continued. \"The context changes\u2014we've got to get beyond this feeling that somehow 1991 is the same as 2001, which is the same as 2017. It isn't. The world has changed, it always changes, and the context changes as it relates to foreign policy and everything else. So, looking forward, I think there are lessons to be learned from both those presidencies and the presidencies of Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton.\"\n\n\n\n            By \nJake Sherman\n\nAccording to a New York Times report, in the book, \"Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush,\" the former president told biographer Jon Meacham that Cheney was an \"iron-ass\" and \"and very different from the Dick Cheney I knew and worked with,\" surmising that his wife, \"Lynne Cheney is a lot of the eminence grise here.\" On Rumsfeld, Bush told Meacham in excerpts reported Thursday, that the secretary of defense \"served the president badly.\"\n\"There's a lack of humility, a lack of seeing what the other guy thinks. He's more kick ass and take names, take numbers. I think he paid a price for that,\" the elder Bush said of Rumsfeld.\nThe former defense secretary fired back in a statement his office provided to NBC News, saying, \"Bush 41 is getting up in years and misjudges Bush 43, who I found made his own decisions. There are hundreds of memos on www.rumsfeld.com that represent advice DoD gave the President.\"\nJeb Bush also cannot remember another reported remark in the book which his father said he advised him to drop Dan Quayle from the presidential ticket in 1992.\n\"I don't recall. That's a long time ago. I don't remember that. If my dad said it's true, geez, it's probably... since he's about as perfect as I can imagine a person,\" he said. \"That puts me in deep conflict here, but I don't remember that.\"\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Jeb Bush defends brother after details emerge from father&apos;s book", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/jeb-bush-defends-george-w-bush-215564", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Dan Quayle", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Lauren Gardner", "Erin Mershon", "Hadas Gold", "Natasha Korecki", "Ronald Reagan", "Janet Yellen", "Jon Allen", "Jenny Hopkinson", "Brian Mahoney", "Donald Rumsfeld", "Theodoric Meyer", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Bernie Sanders", "Nick Gass", "Bernie Becker", "Bill Clinton", "Barney Frank", "Jeb Bush", "Seung Min Kim", "Issac J.
