He was a great governor of Florida and is a really good person, but the campaign has hijacked his message\u201d said Brian Ballard, a Tallahassee lobbyist who contributed more than $25,000 of his own money and has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars more for Bush\u2019s campaign and the super PAC supporting him.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cThe campaign has become negative, one that is about attacking and trying to bring down Marco Rubio. And that doesn\u2019t sit well -- not only with me, but with anyone who knows the two,\u201d Ballard said. \u201cMarco\u2019s a friend of mine. I didn\u2019t sign up for a campaign that was going to be negative and attack a bright star of the party\u2019s future. It doesn\u2019t make sense. I\u2019m over it. And I\u2019m done.\u201d\nBallard, who stopped raising money for the campaign three months ago as he saw it turn negative, said he decided to make his departure final and public after the Bush team called Rubio \u201cthe GOP Obama\u201d and a \u201crisky\u201d bet due to his past personal financial struggles.\nWhile Ballard\u2019s decision and comments are the most-striking, his sentiment of disappointment in the campaign was expressed to POLITICO in varying degrees by numerous Bush supporters -- from members of Congress to those who have worked for the Bush campaign to donors unhappy with the direction of the election effort.\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\nU.S. Rep. Pete Sessions, who counts George W. Bush as a Texas constituent and whose father, William, served as George H. W. Bush\u2019s FBI director, said Jeb put himself in a combative situation that\u2019s an ill fit for him. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s his strong suit,\u201d said Sessions, still a Bush supporter. \u201cI think it\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s strong suit.\u201d\nAnd U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo \u2013 who, like Bush and Rubio, is a Miami-area Republican \u2013 said that while he still thinks Bush is the most-qualified to sit in the White House, attacking Rubio is neither effective nor beneficial.\n\u201cThe serious candidates in this race should focus on their policy proposals and resumes,\u201d Curbelo said in an email to POLITICO. \u201cMud-slinging and efforts to disqualify one another will only serve to pave Hillary Clinton's path to the White House.\u201d\nMost of those who say they are disappointed with the attack-Rubio tactics blame the campaign\u2019s senior leadership \u2013 not Bush personally.\nOne Republican who has worked for the Bush campaign said the staffers are taking Rubio\u2019s bid for president personally, not professionally. Some have taken to calling Rubio \u201cJudas,\u201d a betrayer who should have deferred to the elder Republican, the source said, adding that the campaign\u2019s upper-echelon isn\u2019t listening to the numerous voices in the conservative movement and the Republican Party who have become increasingly disillusioned with the negative tone.\n\u201cThe campaign has been arrogant with donors, arrogant with staff, arrogant with Republicans, and arrogant with the media,\u201d the source said. \u201cAnd now look at where we are: isolated.\u201d\nWorse yet for Bush, nearly all of the supporters who told POLITICO they are disappointed in his attack approach see Rubio as a viable alternative who would continue the tradition of conservative principles and policies that the former governor espoused when Rubio served simultaneously in the Florida Legislature. Already, they noted, Rubio is well ahead of Bush in national and state polls.\n\u201cFor a substantial portion of the DC crowd \u2013 and I think this probably goes beyond DC \u2013 Marco is well liked,\u201d said one major Bush donor and fundraiser from Washington. \u201cI don\u2019t know necessarily what is gained by picking fights with people.\u201d\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\nOne reason the Bush campaign\u2019s tactic has hit such a nerve is that, polls show, a high amount of Bush supporters favor Rubio as a second-choice candidate. And with Bush\u2019s public support collapsing, many Republicans don\u2019t want to see his campaign take Rubio down with it.\nBallard said he has not spoken to Rubio or his campaign about his disappointment in the Bush campaign or his decision to make his departure official. Ballard said this was the first campaign he publicly left since his first race when he worked for Gov. Bob Martinez in 1986. He was a national finance-committee member for the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns of John McCain and Mitt Romney, respectively, and led fundraising efforts for Gov. Charlie Crist and Gov Rick Scott\u2019s elections in 2010 and 2014, respectively.\nIf the Rubio campaign wanted, Ballard said, he would volunteer in any way they asked.\n\u201cThe three smartest people I know are my three daughters. All three of them are for Marco Rubio, and have been despite my support for Jeb,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they speak about Marco, they speak about someone who can get them involved in politics. That\u2019s why Marco has so much potential. That\u2019s clearly why so many in the Bush campaign feel like they have to strangle him in the crib. And that\u2019s a damn shame.\u201d\nBush spokesman Tim Miller declined to comment on the criticisms and referred POLITICO to statements Bush made this week on the campaign trail about Rubio, for whom the former governor said he had \u201crespect.\u201d Bush refrained from taking on Rubio directly \u2013 and last week said he hadn\u2019t seen his campaign\u2019s comments calling the senator a \u201cGOP Obama\u201d or a \u201crisky\u201d choice, but he did fault Rubio because he \u201cdidn\u2019t change the culture of Washington.\u201d\nCertainly, many of Bush\u2019s supporters are sticking with the one-time front-runner. U.S. Rep. Mario Diaz Balart, for instance, said he didn\u2019t think Bush was out of line in discussing Rubio\u2019s missed Senate votes or in emphasizing the superiority of executive over legislative experience, though he cautioned against more personal attacks.\n\u201cI believe in Reagan\u2019s 11th Commandment. So that\u2019s where I am,\u201d Diaz-Balart said, referencing the former president\u2019s maxim against speaking ill of fellow Republicans.\nOthers agree.\n\u201cJeb has been and needs to continue to talk about the issues,\u201d said Chicago investor Ron Gidwitz, a Bush donor who has contributed $100,000 to Bush\u2019s super PAC, Right to Rise. \u201cI see no reason why Jeb needs to attack anyone.\u201d\nFrancis Rooney, a Bush donor who served as U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See under President George W. Bush, said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t tell [Bush] what to do,\u201d but stressed his belief that Bush should focus on an economic message, which is what attracted people to Bush in the first place. Rooney, whose investment company, Rooney Holdings, has contributed $2 million to Bush\u2019s super PAC, also urged Jeb to distinguish himself from \u201cattack dogs\u201d who were on the debate stage.\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\n\u201cWhen he\u2019s himself, he\u2019s a very inspirational candidate,\u201d Rooney said.\nSome Bush supporters didn\u2019t mind Bush deciding to take on Rubio directly onstage over his missed Senate votes, but they winced at Rubio\u2019s sharp retort that Bush was only doing it \u201cbecause we\u2019re running for the same position. Someone convinced you attacking me is going to help you.\u201d\nThe idea of confronting Rubio was a good one, if not the execution.\n\u201cI think that was his judgment,\u201d said Gidwitz. \u201cUnder the circumstances it was called for.\u201d\n\nMarc Caputo is POLITICO's Florida political reporter.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Florida's top fundraiser quits Bush team, signals shift to Rubio.", "title": "Bush&apos;s Rubio attack plan backfires", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/jeb-bush-marco-rubio-donor-backfires-215575", "topics": ["economy", "foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Lauren Gardner", "Brian Ballard", "Erin Mershon", "Henry C.
