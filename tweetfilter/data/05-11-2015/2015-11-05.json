[{"body": " (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 State and local elections across the country this week produced warning signs for both Democrats and Republicans as they press toward the 2016 presidential contest, now just a year away.\nDemocrats lost more ground in legislatures and governor's mansions, raising questions about the party's strength when President Barack Obama's name isn't at the top of the ballot. Democrats still have important demographic advantages in the states that often determine presidential elections, but the party is struggling in power centers outside Washington that influence policy and steer congressional redistricting.\nThe GOP is casting its victory in the Kentucky gubernatorial race as a blueprint for how Republicans can run successfully against Obama's signature health care law.\nBut the elections weren't all good news for the Republicans. For party leaders anxious about Donald Trump and Ben Carson's lead in the GOP presidential primary, the win in Kentucky for Matt Bevin \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a wealthy businessman who has never held political office \u00e2\u0080\u0094 could be a sign that many voters are serious about electing outsider candidates.\nParty leaders are skeptical that outsiders' rebellious appeal will be sufficiently deep and lasting to send such a candidate to the White House.\n\"We're at this interesting moment where clearly there's a lot of frustration in the electorate, which means voters are going to be more volatile,\" said David Winston, a Republican pollster.\nTo be sure, off-year elections are imperfect predictors of presidential contests. Turnout is far lower and the voters who do show up tend to be older and less diverse, favoring Republicans.\nStill, Tuesday's contests across the country are being scoured for signs of the electorate's mood less than three months before the lead-off Iowa caucuses.\nFor Democrats, results in Kentucky, Virginia and elsewhere were part of a troubling pattern. Since Obama was elected in 2008, the party has lost 13 governorships and more than 900 state legislative seats, ceding control of 30 legislative chambers. On Capitol Hill, Democrats have given up control of both the House and Senate.\nThe fresh losses raise serious questions for Democrats about how the party will fare next year when Obama isn't on the ticket. It's also raising questions about where Democrats will draw their next generation of leaders.\nHillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, is making specific campaign appeals to the Hispanics, blacks and young voters who helped propel Obama to victory. And she's promising she'll work to help candidates down the ballot win their races, too.\nThe Democratic defeats have implications for policies as well as politics. While most Democratic governors have expanded their states' Medicaid coverage under the federal Affordable Care Act, several Republicans have resisted, including in Florida and Texas. Democratic Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe tried to expand Medicaid but was blocked by Republicans.\nDemocrats' efforts to fully implement \"Obamacare\" got even harder Tuesday. McAuliffe failed in his campaign to put Virginia's legislature back in Democratic hands. And in Kentucky, Bevin won in part on a pledge to repeal the state's Medicaid expansion, propelling a Republican into the state's governor's mansion for just the second time in four decades.\nBevin cast himself as a political outsider, one who was self-funded and shunned by Kentucky's political establishment after he challenged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the 2014 GOP Senate primary. It's an approach that fits with the outsider appeal of Trump and Carson, who are roiling the GOP presidential primary and worrying establishment Republicans who fear neither of them could defeat Clinton in a general election.\nAsked Wednesday whether Bevin's win bodes well for his own political future, Trump sounded confident. He said, \"There is something happening, folks, I will tell you. There is something happening.\"\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who is struggling in the GOP presidential polls, aligned himself with Bevin's success as a political outsider.\n\"That's the same thing I ran on when I ran in 2010,\" Paul said of his Senate victory five years ago.\nBevin wasn't the only outsider who won this week. In Mississippi, Republican poultry and cattle farmer Vince Mangold made his political debut by ousting Democratic House Minority Leader Bobby Moak, who had been in office for 30 years.\nRepublicans targeted Moak with mailers displaying his photo next to Obama's under the headline, \"Bobby Moak and Barack Obama ... A Liberal Love Affair.\" Mangold said he campaigned on lower taxes and a good education system, but he attributed his victory not to any particular policy stances but to his outsider status.\n\"As I traveled around the district, the overwhelming reply was they were ready for a change,\" Mangold said Wednesday.\n___\nLieb reported from Jefferson City, Missouri.

About two-dozen protesters were on hand as the petitions were delivered to NBC's midtown Manhattan offices. Some chanted \"dump Trump\" and carried signs bearing the same phrase.\nThe coalition is accusing NBC of reversing itself for the sake of a ratings windfall while granting Trump \"a free national platform to bolster his racist and xenophobic campaign,\" Zaheed said.\nAlex Nogales, president of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, said after delivering the petitions that the protest effort was not over. His group and others would use the days leading up to the broadcast to call on \"SNL\" sponsors to remove their commercials from Saturday's show, he said.\nNBC declined comment on the petitions and did not immediately comment on the attempt to get ads pulled.\nMeanwhile, Trump drew sharp criticism in an online letter with the names of dozens of prominent writers, filmmakers, academics and others from the United States, Spain and Latin America attached to it, including Oscar-winning writer-director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu  (\"Birdman: Or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance\").\n\"We refuse to keep silent in the face of the alarming declarations of the candidate for the presidency of the United States Donald Trump,\" the letter posted Tuesday reads. \"His hate speech appeals to the lowest passions like xenophobia, machismo, political intolerance and religious dogmatism.\"\nThe letter calls on the American people to \"cease to tolerate his absurd positions.\"\nTrump has played a major role in delivering record-breaking ratings to the first three Republican debates and has been a sought-after guest on talk shows and newscasts.\nAsked about the opposition to his upcoming appearance while promoting his new book in New York on Tuesday, Trump said he was pleased to hear demonstrations were already underway.\n\"Look, I think they should demonstrate\" he said. \"Ratings will go even higher than they are going to be. It's going to be one of their highest-rated shows ever and they're very excited about it.\"\nAsked specifically about the petition, he said: \"It's only going to make it hotter.\"\nTrump also repeated his frequent assertion that he has great relationship with Hispanics, with tens of thousands working for him over the years, he said.\nSaturday's appearance will be an \"SNL\" encore for Trump, who first hosted the show in April 2004, long before his entry into politics, as the breakout star of NBC's new competition show \"The Apprentice.\"\nHe appeared on CNN's \"New Day\" on Wednesday, where anchor Chris Cuomo voiced surprise that NBC booked him.\n\"I thought you were at war with them,\" said Cuomo, \"then all of a sudden they wanted to have you on. You say it's because of ratings.\"\n\"You're never at war when you get great ratings with a network, OK?\" Trump replied. \"Nobody gets ratings like me.\"\nHe went on to say that initially he was asked to do a single sketch on Saturday's show. Then \"SNL\" executive producer Lorne Michaels had second thoughts and asked Trump if he would host the entire 90-minute program. \"And I said, 'You know what? I would.' Because it's an honor.\"\n\"Every single major politician in this country probably for 30 years has done 'Saturday Night Live' if they're invited,\" Trump added. \"If they're invited.\"\nNBC would not comment on whether any other presidential candidates are being considered to host \"SNL.\"\nOn Wednesday, NBC released promotional spots for the show featuring Trump.

{"body": " (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 A leading Republican and a lagging Democrat became the first major candidates Wednesday to file for New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation presidential primary.\nCelebrity businessman Donald Trump and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley were among a handful of candidates who signed up to get on the ballot as the filing period opened. Candidates have until Nov. 20 to file for the primary, which is expected to be held Feb. 9.\n\"Wow, this is some turnout!\" Trump said as he entered the secretary of state's office, which typically is jammed with members of the media and the public when major candidates sign up. Earlier, Trump was greeted by a large crowd of supporters outside the statehouse.\nCompared with other states, it's relatively cheap and easy to get on the ballot in New Hampshire. Candidates must meet basic requirements to be president, fill out a one-page form and pay a $1,000 filing fee.\n\"They wanted a cashier's check,\" Trump said. \"So this is from a bank that's not actually as rich as we are.\"\nSpeaking to reporters later, Trump criticized retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has topped Trump in some recent national polls.\n\"We need someone with tremendous strength and tremendous energy,\" he said. \"Ben Carson does not have the aptitude to bring jobs back, does not have the aptitude to deal with China, Japan, Mexico and any other country you can name.\"\n\"We talk about Jeb (Bush),\" he said. \"Jeb Bush is a low-energy person. Ben Carson is super-low energy,\" he said.\nEarlier, O'Malley dismissed Trump's campaign, saying while he understands that many Americans are apprehensive about their children's futures, Trump and other \"unscrupulous people\" have seized on that fear and blamed the nation's challenges on \"people who are not like us.\"\n\"I find extremely distasteful and repugnant Donald Trump's racist rants against new American immigrants,\" he said. \"I find that sort of politics to be base and crude and demeaning of everything our country is about.\"\nO'Malley, who lags behind Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, said voters want a president who gets things done, not \"old names or polarizing figures.\"\n\"I feel like we really just turned the corner in this race,\" he said. \"Most voters here in New Hampshire and in Iowa are only now into that decision window. Everything prior to this was pre-season. ... And it's out of our party that new leaders emerge.

{"body": " (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 State and local elections across the country this week produced warning signs for both Democrats and Republicans as they press toward the 2016 presidential contest, now just a year away.\nDemocrats lost more ground in legislatures and governor's mansions, raising questions about the party's strength when President Barack Obama's name isn't at the top of the ballot. Democrats still have important demographic advantages in the states that often determine presidential elections, but the party is struggling in power centers outside Washington that influence policy and steer congressional redistricting.\nThe GOP is casting its victory in the Kentucky gubernatorial race as a blueprint for how Republicans can run successfully against Obama's signature health care law.\nBut the elections weren't all good news for the Republicans. For party leaders anxious about Donald Trump and Ben Carson's lead in the GOP presidential primary, the win in Kentucky for Matt Bevin \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a wealthy businessman who has never held political office \u00e2\u0080\u0094 could be a sign that many voters are serious about electing outsider candidates.\nParty leaders are skeptical that outsiders' rebellious appeal will be sufficiently deep and lasting to send such a candidate to the White House.\n\"We're at this interesting moment where clearly there's a lot of frustration in the electorate, which means voters are going to be more volatile,\" said David Winston, a Republican pollster.\nTo be sure, off-year elections are imperfect predictors of presidential contests. Turnout is far lower and the voters who do show up tend to be older and less diverse, favoring Republicans.\nStill, Tuesday's contests across the country are being scoured for signs of the electorate's mood less than three months before the lead-off Iowa caucuses.\nFor Democrats, results in Kentucky, Virginia and elsewhere were part of a troubling pattern. Since Obama was elected in 2008, the party has lost 13 governorships and more than 900 state legislative seats, ceding control of 30 legislative chambers. On Capitol Hill, Democrats have given up control of both the House and Senate.\nThe fresh losses raise serious questions for Democrats about how the party will fare next year when Obama isn't on the ticket. It's also raising questions about where Democrats will draw their next generation of leaders.\nHillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, is making specific campaign appeals to the Hispanics, blacks and young voters who helped propel Obama to victory. And she's promising she'll work to help candidates down the ballot win their races, too.\nThe Democratic defeats have implications for policies as well as politics. While most Democratic governors have expanded their states' Medicaid coverage under the federal Affordable Care Act, several Republicans have resisted, including in Florida and Texas. Democratic Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe tried to expand Medicaid but was blocked by Republicans.\nDemocrats' efforts to fully implement \"Obamacare\" got even harder Tuesday. McAuliffe failed in his campaign to put Virginia's legislature back in Democratic hands. And in Kentucky, Bevin won in part on a pledge to repeal the state's Medicaid expansion, propelling a Republican into the state's governor's mansion for just the second time in four decades.\nBevin cast himself as a political outsider, one who was self-funded and shunned by Kentucky's political establishment after he challenged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the 2014 GOP Senate primary. It's an approach that fits with the outsider appeal of Trump and Carson, who are roiling the GOP presidential primary and worrying establishment Republicans who fear neither of them could defeat Clinton in a general election.\nAsked Wednesday whether Bevin's win bodes well for his own political future, Trump sounded confident. He said, \"There is something happening, folks, I will tell you. There is something happening.\"\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who is struggling in the GOP presidential polls, aligned himself with Bevin's success as a political outsider.\n\"That's the same thing I ran on when I ran in 2010,\" Paul said of his Senate victory five years ago.\nBevin wasn't the only outsider who won this week. In Mississippi, Republican poultry and cattle farmer Vince Mangold made his political debut by ousting Democratic House Minority Leader Bobby Moak, who had been in office for 30 years.\nRepublicans targeted Moak with mailers displaying his photo next to Obama's under the headline, \"Bobby Moak and Barack Obama ... A Liberal Love Affair.\" Mangold said he campaigned on lower taxes and a good education system, but he attributed his victory not to any particular policy stances but to his outsider status.\n\"As I traveled around the district, the overwhelming reply was they were ready for a change,\" Mangold said Wednesday.\n___\nLieb reported from Jefferson City, Missouri.

{"body": " (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio said Wednesday he'll release in the next few weeks all of the statements detailing his use of an American Express card he shared with the Republican Party of Florida.\nRubio, a former speaker of the Florida House, had the party-issued card from February 2005 to November 2008. During his successful 2010 bid for U.S. Senate, news broke that Rubio had charged personal items such as grocery bills, plane tickets for his wife and repairs to the family minivan to the card. Rubio says he reimbursed the party for any personal expenses. The statements from late 2006 to late 2008 are now public, but those from 2005 and most of 2006 are not.\nRubio's personal finances are gaining new scrutiny as he tries to break out of the crowded GOP nomination fight.\nThe American Express card is part of a litany of financial problems \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from a bank moving to foreclose on a house he part-owned in Tallahassee to questionable accounting of political funds \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that have dogged Rubio during his career.\nGOP rival Donald Trump criticized Rubio on his personal finances on Tuesday, saying \"he is a disaster with his credit cards.\"\nRubio dismissed the charges as old news and said he did nothing wrong.\n\"Every month I would get a bill at my home and I would review it. If there was something on it that was personal, I would pay it, and if it wasn't, the party paid it,\" Rubio told reporters in New Hampshire on Wednesday.\n\"What I would do differently is that I just wouldn't have done any personal things on it because I would have avoided all the confusion that it's created in the minds of some,\" he said.\nDuring his 2010 campaign, Rubio's aides said the charges were legitimate, contending that the minivan had been damaged while being used on GOP business. They also said Rubio paid American Express more than $16,000 to cover nonparty expenses when they happened. He also sent a check to the party as reimbursement for personal airline flights he said were mistakenly charged to the GOP card. Rubio blamed an accounting error.\nRubio was among several state GOP lawmakers given access to American Express cards through the Republican Party of Florida, which offered a way for lawmakers to get around the state's strict ban on accepting gifts that was put into law in 2006. The ban prevents lawmakers from taking gifts from lobbyists, but the state party doesn't face the same restrictions. The Florida Republican Party was responsible for paying off the cards on a monthly basis.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Nicholas Riccardi in Denver, Sergio Bustos in Miami and Gary Fineout in Tallahassee, Florida, contributed to this report.", "byline": "", "description": "MANCHESTER, N.H.

{"body": " (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Republican Jeb Bush's campaign revival tour is getting louder and more colorful as he charges across early voting states with a can-do slogan, a tour bus and critiques of rivals who have become threats to his claim as the GOP mainstream favorite.\n\"We're Americans, dammit!\" he shouted Wednesday at a pharmacy in Hollis, N.H., as he complained that the U.S. was not leading in key foreign policy disputes.\nHe saved special words for Donald Trump, the former reality show star who remains a leader in the unpredictable GOP nomination fight.\n\"A president can't say 'You're fired,' and go to commercial break,\" Bush told more than 100 people at a senior center in Raymond, New Hampshire, Tuesday night. \"A president has to roll up their damn sleeves and get to work.\"\nA night earlier, his voice showed signs of strain as he railed against what he called anemic economic growth.\n\"That means more people stuck in poverty. That means one in five children on food stamps,\" Bush said, raising his voice during an event Tuesday in Rye, N.H. \"That's the new normal. I hope you agree with this: we need to reject that out of hand. And we can do it.\"\nThe volume and feeling reflect the urgency of Bush's drive to push his campaign into a winning position ahead of the first votes of the GOP nomination fight in Feb. Once seen as the probable favorite, Bush's viability has never really thrived in the face of unexpectedly strong support from outsiders Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who are leading the pack. Also a thorn for Bush: Marco Rubio, his onetime protege, who has approached the dynamics as an opportunity to win over the GOP establishment turned off by Trump and Carson.\nBush took a more restrained tone on Rubio, with whom he'd clashed in last week's debate.\n\"He hasn't changed the culture in Washington,\" Bush told reporters aboard his campaign bus. He refused to answer questions on Rubio's personal spending habits, which had had come up during last week's debate.\n\"It's not my job to worry about that,\" Bush said.\nPriority No. 1 for Bush, acknowledged even by him, is injecting some life into his campaign.

He was headed north to the lake country for two events later in the day.

{"body": " (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Pressure continued to mount on NBC to cancel Donald Trump's guest-host appearance on this weekend's \"Saturday Night Live\" as a coalition of advocacy groups delivered petitions to the network Wednesday calling for him to be dropped from the show.\nThe petitions delivered to 30 Rockefeller Plaza, home of NBC and \"Saturday Night Live,\" marked the latest attempts to dissuade the network from allowing the Republican presidential hopeful to host the show, with the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda earlier asking that NBC reconsider the decision.\n\"There's mounting evidence that Donald Trump's racist demagoguery is resulting in real-world violence and physical and verbal intimidation,\" Mushed Zaheed, deputy political director of Credo Action, one of the participating groups, said in a statement.\nTrump drew fire early in his campaign when, as the billionaire developer announced his candidacy, he described some Mexicans who are in the United States illegally as criminals and rapists, prompting NBC to sever its Miss Universe ties with Trump while declaring he would never again appear on \"The Celebrity Apprentice.\"\n\"It is shameful for 'SNL' and NBC to think that racism can be repackaged as comedy,\" said Juan Escalante, digital campaigns manager for America's Voice, another group participating in the coalition.\nOther participating groups included the National Hispanic Media Coalition, MoveOn.org and National Council of La Raza. About two-dozen protesters were on hand as the petitions were delivered to NBC's midtown Manhattan offices. Some chanted \"dump Trump\" and carried signs bearing the same phrase.\nThe coalition is accusing NBC of reversing itself for the sake of a ratings windfall while granting Trump \"a free national platform to bolster his racist and xenophobic campaign,\" Zaheed said.\nAlex Nogales, president of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, said after delivering the petitions that the protest effort was not over. His group and others would use the days leading up to the broadcast to call on \"SNL\" sponsors to remove their commercials from Saturday's show, he said.\nNBC declined comment on the petitions and did not immediately comment on the attempt to get ads pulled.\nMeanwhile, Trump drew sharp criticism in an online letter with the names of dozens of prominent writers, filmmakers, academics and others from the United States, Spain and Latin America attached to it, including Oscar-winning writer-director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu  (\"Birdman: Or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance\").\n\"We refuse to keep silent in the face of the alarming declarations of the candidate for the presidency of the United States Donald Trump,\" the letter posted Tuesday reads. \"His hate speech appeals to the lowest passions like xenophobia, machismo, political intolerance and religious dogmatism.\"\nThe letter calls on the American people to \"cease to tolerate his absurd positions.\"\nTrump has played a major role in delivering record-breaking ratings to the first three Republican debates and has been a sought-after guest on talk shows and newscasts.\nAsked about the opposition to his upcoming appearance while promoting his new book in New York on Tuesday, Trump said he was pleased to hear demonstrations were already underway.\n\"Look, I think they should demonstrate\" he said. \"Ratings will go even higher than they are going to be. It's going to be one of their highest-rated shows ever and they're very excited about it.\"\nAsked specifically about the petition, he said: \"It's only going to make it hotter.\"\nTrump also repeated his frequent assertion that he has great relationship with Hispanics, with tens of thousands working for him over the years, he said.\nSaturday's appearance will be an \"SNL\" encore for Trump, who first hosted the show in April 2004, long before his entry into politics, as the breakout star of NBC's new competition show \"The Apprentice.\"\nHe appeared on CNN's \"New Day\" on Wednesday, where anchor Chris Cuomo voiced surprise that NBC booked him.\n\"I thought you were at war with them,\" said Cuomo, \"then all of a sudden they wanted to have you on. You say it's because of ratings.\"\n\"You're never at war when you get great ratings with a network, OK?\" Trump replied. \"Nobody gets ratings like me.\"\nHe went on to say that initially he was asked to do a single sketch on Saturday's show. Then \"SNL\" executive producer Lorne Michaels had second thoughts and asked Trump if he would host the entire 90-minute program. \"And I said, 'You know what? I would.' Because it's an honor.\"\n\"Every single major politician in this country probably for 30 years has done 'Saturday Night Live' if they're invited,\" Trump added. \"If they're invited.\"\nNBC would not comment on whether any other presidential candidates are being considered to host \"SNL.\"\nOn Wednesday, NBC released promotional spots for the show featuring Trump.

{"body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Two of the Republican Party's rising young stars \u00e2\u0080\u0094 House Speaker Paul Ryan and presidential hopeful Marco Rubio \u00e2\u0080\u0094 made similar calculations on the way to political advancement: Both abandoned efforts to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul.\nThe about-faces by Ryan and Rubio underscore the GOP's difficulties with the issue of immigration, where policies that appeal to young and minority voters can invite a backlash from the conservative base. And in a campaign season where Donald Trump's incendiary rhetoric has seemed to drive the debate, they renew questions about whether Washington will ever be able to come up with a solution for the nation's dysfunctional immigration system.\nIn Ryan's case, he emerged as the unity candidate for speaker of the House last week after offering assurances to conservatives that he would not pursue comprehensive immigration legislation with President Barack Obama in the White House. Rubio, in campaigning for president, has repeatedly sworn off the bipartisan Senate immigration bill he co-authored two years ago, and he is now rising in the polls.\nBoth Ryan, 45, and Rubio, 44, have treaded with care on the issue, never specifically disavowing the goals of comprehensive immigration reform but instead shifting their focus to border security and enforcement, and blaming process or politics.\nRyan says immigration reform cannot happen with Obama in the White House because the president showed he could not be trusted by going around Congress to issue executive actions limiting deportations.\n\"He has already demonstrated he is not serious about enforcing the law. Passing comprehensive reform during his presidency would merely render it meaningless,\" the Wisconsin Republican wrote in an opinion piece Wednesday in USA Today, adding that the focus should instead be on bills to secure the border or enforce immigration rules inside the U.S.\nRubio says he's concluded that a comprehensive bill like the one he helped write, which passed the Senate in 2013 but stalled in the House, is not the way to go.\n\"The only way forward is through a series of steps that begins with border security,\" the Florida senator said Wednesday on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\" ''This issue cannot be tackled in one massive piece of legislation.\"\nBoth tend to downplay their past support for potential eventual citizenship for many of the 11.5 million immigrants living in this country illegally, which was the most contentious element of the Senate's immigration bill and decried as \"amnesty\" by many conservatives.\nRyan once called potential citizenship \"a very important part of immigration reform,\" but he's avoided discussing it since becoming speaker even when directly asked. For his part, Rubio emphasizes a piecemeal approach. His campaign website includes a section devoted to his opposition to \"sanctuary cities\" that shield immigrants from prosecution, but does not highlight his broader immigration policies. When asked earlier this week on Fox News Channel, Rubio said he is open to immigrants in the country illegally becoming citizens after 15 years under certain circumstances.\nThe maneuvering comes from lawmakers who were hailed in the past by immigration activists for their leadership roles, Rubio for taking on the Senate bill and trying to sell it to the conservative community, and Ryan for working behind the scenes in the House and trying to find a legislative solution there.\nBut it's against the backdrop of a presidential campaign that's been dominated by Trump, who's said immigrants who come here illegally are \"rapists\" bringing drugs and crime. Such pronouncements have pushed the GOP to the right, even as some leading Republicans insist they need a nominee who will embrace immigration legislation and win back some of the Latino and Asian voters who've been abandoning the party.\n\"It's an issue that as much as we would like, it's not going away,\" said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. \"If we don't do something about immigration reform and people are going around saying they're rapists and murderers, then obviously the reaction in the Hispanic community is very negative.\"\nRyan's efforts to find a House GOP consensus on immigration fizzled after former Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., was upset in his primary race last year by a conservative who accused him of backing amnesty. A crisis of unaccompanied minors arriving from Central America also helped end any faint hopes for action in the House \u00e2\u0080\u0094 well before Obama took the executive actions that Ryan and other Republicans now blame for congressional inaction.\nNow immigration activists are bemoaning the changed focus from Ryan and Rubio.\n\"We all know that Ryan supports reform, yet he's letting the Steve King wing of the party call the shots, and same thing with Rubio,\" said Frank Sharry, executive director of pro-immigrant group America's Voice, naming the leading immigration hardliner in the House. \"If they want to expand the Republican Party they have to lead, and neither of them are doing that right now.\"\n___\nFollow Erica Werner at http://twitter.com/ericawerner", "byline": "", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Two of the Republican Party's rising young stars \u2014 House Speaker Paul Ryan and presidential hopeful Marco Rubio \u2014 made similar calculations on the way to political advancement: Both abandoned efforts to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul.", "title": "Rubio, Ryan back off comprehensive immigration overhaul", "url": "http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-11-04-US--Rubio-Ryan-Immigration/id-1b2acf5489de45fe9a9e2c1b6ccb873a", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Steve King", "Erica Werner", "Frank Sharry", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Barack Obama", "Paul Ryan", "Eric Cantor"], "orgs": ["Senate", "Republican Party", "House GOP", "GOP", "Congress"], "election_confidence": 0.9546244268775168, "authors": [{"author_id": 39773, "fullname": "erica werner", "primary_org": "ap"}], "date_written": "2015-11-04 20:51:21", "org": "ap", "article_id": "ed65a15ecb91e3ae36a2f275b9116854", "date_access": "2015-11-04 21:00:06.210250"},

{"body": "", "byline": "", "description": "\nSpencer Platt / Getty Images\nEarlier this year, as Donald Trump began noisily flirting with a 2016 presidential bid, a flurry of Trump-related book ideas began circulating among Manhattan publishing types. There was the writer who wanted to produce an ironic collection of Trump's most outlandish quotes; the conservative journalist promising unparalleled access for a campaign hagiography; the other conservative journalist ready to rush a quickie anti-Trump polemic to the presses.And, finally, there was Trump's own political manifesto \u2014 Trumpily titled, Crippled America: How To Make America Great Again \u2014 which was released this week to much fanfare by Simon & Schuster.With its celebrity author currently topping 2016 polls and generating nonstop media attention with his vaudevillian White House bid, the book seems destined for bestseller status. But despite the potential for a publishing bonanza, Crippled America is the only new Trump-centric title to have hit the shelves so far this year. One reason? The book industry \u2014 like the political press \u2014 largely dismissed Trump's campaign at the outset as a short-lived publicity stunt that would be over before they had time to cash in.Now that The Donald has proven them wrong, the haters and losers of the professional literati are left kicking themselves.\"I think everybody in political publishing had been burned too many times by [authors] who were at their high when they sold their books and then had fizzled by the time the books came out,\" said one editor. \"A lot of people thought this was a Michele Bachmann or Herman Cain situation.\"Indeed, the graveyard of the publishing industry is littered with money-losing political books that were tanked by bad timing, like the 2012 memoir that fetched Marco Rubio an $800,000 advance at a time when pundits were predicting he would be Mitt Romney's running mate \u2014 and then flatlined in sales once he didn't make it on the ticket. Given The Donald's well-documented record of toying with presidential bids and then abandoning them, book editors were especially wary of placing big bets on 2016-themed Trump-lit.The first of this year's ill-fated Trump projects was conceived during a backstage interview with conservative Daily Mail journalist David Martosko at the Iowa Freedom Summit in January. Trump's attempts to stoke 2016 buzz at the conservative confab that day had elicited mostly eye-rolls from the incredulous reporters in attendance \u2014 but Martosko believed he was serious this time. Spotting a ground-floor investment opportunity, the reporter proposed that Trump collaborate with him on a campaign book, according to two sources familiar with the conversation.Trump liked the idea, and Martosko \u2014 a former editor at The Daily Caller who declined to comment for this story \u2014 spent the following weeks negotiating with the billionaire's aides and pitching the project to publishers. One concept was a collection of high-octane interviews with Trump on various political subjects; another was an authorized inside account of Trump's early campaign, tentatively titled, Three Weeks With The Donald.On its face, bidding on the proposal might have seemed like a no-brainer for publishers. As one source who was supportive of the project put it, \"Donald Trump is an ATM with eyes and a mouth.\"But the reception Martosko received from editors earlier this year was often muted and hesitant. One editor said he passed on the book because he didn't believe Trump would actually run. Another source said the standard lead time in the publishing industry \u2014 even if accelerated to warp speed \u2014 seemed unlikely to produce a topical book before Trump inevitably flamed out of the race.\"Look, it's February, and by April this is all gonna be over and we're gonna be on the hook for a contracted book with a big advance,\" said one source familiar with Martosko's project, summing up the initial reluctance by publishers.Martosko, who has conducted nearly a dozen interviews with Trump, did generate some interest from editors, but they said any book contract would be contingent on a commitment of cooperation from The Donald \u2014 and that never materialized. After much back-and-forth, Trump eventually informed Martosko that he had decided not to do a campaign book at all, reasoning that he already had world-beating name recognition and didn't need to bother.It was only a matter of weeks, however, before Trump reversed that decision, and by summer he was peddling his own political book to publishers. Even with Trump surging in the national polls at that point, the proposal was still met with some skepticism from the publishing world.Said one editor, \"Probably any publisher would have taken that swing gladly at some level \u2014 just not for the amount [of money] Trump's agent was asking.\"The agent in question was Byrd Leavell, a unique fixture in the New York literary scene whose impeccably lowbrow client roster includes the raunchy bro-bait blogger Tucker Max; the creators of the website Total Frat Move; socialite-cum-\"pillhead\" memoirist Cat Marnell; and a young Maryland woman who went viral after emailing a profanity-laced tirade to her sorority sisters. Leavell does not typically traffic in presidential politics: He is best known in the industry for his tendency to trawl on the web, and then successfully repurpose the most controversial content into bestselling books. He's had some hits \u2014 the adaptation of the popular \"Shit My Dad Says\" Twitter account sold more than a million copies \u2014 and some misses, such as a widely panned book by the author of Twitter's Goldman Sachs Elevator account. But Leavell's gleeful anti-elitism made him a natural fit for Trump.In a 2013 interview, Leavell described the philosophy that animates his search for literary talent. \"There's a number of books that have pubbed that just say, you know, I had too many drinks, I banged him, I kicked him out of bed, and I went to work,\" he mused. \"Like, it's out there, but I think there's room for more.\"Trump's new book is light on such first-person tales of debauchery, but compared to the stodgy, sanitized memoirs of his Republican rivals, Crippled America \u2014 with its politically incorrect title and glowering cover photo \u2014 is similarly defiant of genre conventions. And Leavell was the perfect agent to get it sold.Leavell declined an interview request and wouldn't respond to questions about the size of Trump's advance (though he did say in an email that the candidate planned to donate the money). One source close to Trump speculated that he was aiming for something in the ballpark of Hillary Clinton's rumored $14 million contract \u2014 so that he could boast about the comparison in a general election face-off. \"He really does think that way,\" the source said. Others in publishing circles said Trump's advance was likely closer to low-end seven figures.Meanwhile, the industry's scramble to catch up and cash in on Trump-mania continues. Editors described a number of books at various stages of fruition, including a novelty collection of Trump's most outrageous utterances, and new editions of old biographies and books about The Donald.Kevin Williamson \u2014 a National Review correspondent whose vicious report on Trump's campaign kickoff earlier this year was headlined \"Witless Ape Rides Escalator\" \u2014 churned out a short paperback over the course of ten days in September, which will be published by a small conservative imprint this month under the title, The Case Against Trump.Williamson said he and his editor both held off for a while before committing to the book, because they assumed \u2014 and hoped \u2014 that Trump would fade. Eventually, they had to come to terms with reality.\"Frankly, I would have rather Trump exited the race quickly and I not write the book,\" Williamson said, adding, \"I think he'll probably sell a few more copies than I do.\"\n", "title": "How Donald Trump Crushed The Haters And Losers In The Publishing World", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/how-donald-trump-crushed-the-haters-and-losers-in-the-publis", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "personality"], "people": ["Mitt Romney", "Herman Cain", "Hillary Clinton", "Michele Bachmann", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Kevin Williamson", "Spencer Platt", "David Martosko"], "orgs": ["America Great Again", "National Review", "Donald", "Simon & Schuster"], "election_confidence": 0.9923515460191388, "authors": [{"author_id": 6681, "fullname": "mckay coppins", "primary_org": "buzzfeed"}], "date_written": "2015-11-04 19:50:28", "org": "buzzfeed", "article_id": "eecd3c4bf318cace7e15c0920e490165", "date_access": "2015-11-04 20:07:43.841103"},

Mr. Trump himself contributed only about $100,000 in in-kind contributions, including rent space that he donated and payroll expenses that he covered.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Follow her on Twitter @ruthbenghiat. \n (CNN)On Tuesday, Donald Trump, who would like to be our President, retweeted a message about Jeb Bush.  It featured a swastika among its gallery of Bush-bashing images. And with this tweet, Trump has outdone himself in doing whatever he can to stay in the headlines through sensationalist attacks on his rivals. \nHe has mocked candidate Bush before on the grounds of patriotism, painting him as somehow less American because he speaks Spanish at home and when addressing Hispanic audiences. This time, perhaps worried about his declining status after his uneven performance in the last GOP candidates' debate, Trump went for the sure shot on social media, and included the most recognizable symbol of Nazism. \nAs offensive as this montage is, we can be thankful that he posted it. Images have their own way of telling stories. They are often used in political propaganda to elicit a visceral reaction -- outrage, laughter, identification -- and they reveal things their creators are not able or willing to say with words. \nA grouping of images, intended to spark certain associations, is even more useful in reading how someone thinks about a given person or subject.\nSo what can we learn from these pictures that can be useful in evaluating him as a potential president? First, the depth of his attachment to a politics of prejudice that disdains and distrusts all those who are not white and of European Christian heritage. \nIn the logic of Trumpworld, Jeb Bush is a straw man -- he even wears a sombrero, in one image -- for all Americans who are soft on immigration and thus soft in body and character. Bush is \"Forrest Bush,\" as another image proclaims, a weak and backward man who will leave our country unprotected for \"animals\" to come through (one of the cartoons in the assemblage shows a strange, monkey-like creature featured breaching our borders). \nHate politics, from Nazism onward, thrive on paranoia. In Trump's hands, Jeb Bush becomes that stock figure of propaganda, the internal enemy who masquerades as a patriot but whose interests are really against the nation. Trump's tabloid-style graphics to associate Bush with foreigners (his Mexican-born wife occupies a central place in the gallery), with \"the Bush criminal family\" and their campaign to reclaim, through Bush, a ruined empire (cue the image of a broken crown).  \nAnd here we come to the swastika, which is on a flag that comes out of the barrel of a gun, flanked by portraits of Jeb Bush and his \"criminal\" family. \"Evil Runs Deep,\" the lurid font proclaims. This image is so exaggerated as to become parody. But the use of the gun, together with the swastika, also contains a reveal about which Americans Trump aims to please with his platform. \nFor the swastika is not a dead symbol, but one used -- sometimes together with the Confederate flag -- by American white supremacists. Featuring a swastika and a gun on American social media just months after the Charleston church massacre --  in which Dylann Roof (shown in pictures displaying the Confederate flag) slaughtered nine people in a black church -- sends a message to those who want to hear it: Trump is not only anti-immigrant, but pro-white. \nIn fact, one could conclude that Trump's relentless insults of Jeb Bush, and his depiction of Bush as a stereotypical Mexican -- witness the image of Bush playing the guitar, against a landscape of cacti, wearing a sombrero -- are a means of attacking some of his other Republican presidential rivals, who actually are Hispanic, and who are actually political threats to him: the Cuban-Americans Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. \nAnd that, too, is a classic operation of political propaganda, as perfected by the Nazis: Make one group, or person, stand in for the perceived faults of others. This latest retweet may remind us of Trump's mastery of social media, but his crude gallery of images is proof of his unworthiness of the presidency.  \nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.\n", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "What swastika retweet tells us about Donald Trump", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/04/opinions/ben-ghiat-trump-tweet/index.html", "topics": ["immigration", "personality"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Jeb Bush", "Dylann Roof"], "orgs": ["New York University"], "election_confidence": 0.9954209380170654, "authors": [{"author_id": 2538, "fullname": "ruth ben-ghiat", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-11-04 23:06:42", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "06b6a770d3bb6aa84642d0b26c935a10", "date_access": "2015-11-04 23:21:48.870934"},

{"body": "Washington (CNN)Racial discrimination in America has come a long way from the days of forced segregation, but there's still a long way to go, Sen. Marco Rubio said Wednesday.\nThe rising GOP presidential candidate waxed about the nation's history with racism and the current state of discrimination Wednesday in response to questions at a campaign event with young professionals in New Hampshire. He noted a change that has occurred from his parents first encounter with segregation in America to his kids' interactions with their friends today.\nThe Florida Republican said it gives him hope to see how little his children pay attention to skin color with their predominantly African-American football team, even compared to his own awareness of race at the same age. But he acknowledged generational change takes time.\n\"In the short term, I believe we do need to address the reality in this country that there are millions of people who feel that because of the color of their skin, they're followed at the mall, they're treated differently,\" Rubio said. \"If a significant percentage of the American family feels this way, it's an issue. We have to talk about it.\"\nRELATED: Clinton protested by Black Lives Matter \nRace relations in America have been a flashpoint on the campaign trail this year, brought into sharper focus by the Black Lives Matter movement and the tension over police shootings of unarmed African-Americans.\nRubio was careful to add that he doesn't support anti-police rhetoric.\n\"I don't think the answer to it, however, is to demonize police officers,\" he said. \nBut he said that even if people don't see discrimination themselves, they need to listen to people who do. \n\"The reality of it is that there's a significant percentage of Americans, African-Americans, particularly young males, who feel discriminated against,\" Rubio said. \"And if they feel discriminated that way, whether you agree with it or not, if they feel that way, it's a problem. ... I know people that feel that way, who tell me this, and in some instances, I've actually seen it as well.\"\nThe conversation began when a questioner asked Rubio what part of American history he would like to erase, excluding the obvious answer of slavery. He said that even after the Civil War, racial discrimination was \"pronounced.\"\nHe told a story of how his parents once were driving to Miami when their car broke down \"somewhere in the South, they believe it was South Carolina.\"\n\"It was the first chance they ever interacted with segregation,\" Rubio said. \"Because Cuba had cultural segregation ... but it didn't have legal segregation, so for them, that was a shocking experience.\"\nHe said his parents asked an African-American woman about where to catch a movie and she replied she wasn't allowed in. \n\"That's a period that I think took too long to resolve, that period from the end of slavery to the civil rights era, that just lingered way too long. It obviously should have never happened, but that's a period I wish we could have as a nation have avoided and dealt with much quicker,\" Rubio said.\nRubio has embraced his own minority status on the trail, speaking of his family's American Dream-like story of arriving in the U.S. after fleeing communism in Cuba.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Rubio noted on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" that three of the top four Republicans in the race right now are minorities: himself, Texas Sen.

{"body": " (CNN)One year out from the 2016 general election, voters in off-year races across the country on Tuesday offered some signs of things to come \u2014 and presented the presidential candidates with tea leaves to read as they sharpen their campaign strategies.\nBy evening's end, Republicans were the ones crowing, as they scored a surprise win in a hotly contested governor's race in Kentucky while keeping control of the state Senate in Virginia, despite a big spending onslaught from former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's gun-control group. \n\"Tonight was another key test for Dems, Clinton, and their party's field [organization] and once again they failed to deliver,\" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tweeted shortly before midnight.\nBy contrast, Democrats were a little on the quiet side. A stinging defeat in Houston, where voters rolled back an ordinance that had expanded nondiscrimination protections to LGBT people, illustrated the risks attached to ballot initiative tactics that the party has increasingly used as a means of advancing its policy goals when blocked by the GOP.\nHere are takeaways from Tuesday's results and what they mean for 2016: \n\nThe tea party scored a significant win in Kentucky, where one of its own, Matt Bevin, overcame a late deficit and a series of missteps on the stump to defeat Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway by a handy margin, 53% to 44%. Bevin, who has promised to dismantle the state's successful Obamacare exchange, will now have that opportunity.\nA disaster for President Barack Obama's signature initiative? Not quite. Supporters of the Affordable Care Act believe that Republicans could face a backlash if Bevin goes ahead with his pledge.\n\"He's the dog who caught the car,\" on Democratic strategist told CNN, \"and I think he's going to have a real problem using up all of his political capital taking health care away from 400,000 of his constituents.\"\nIn fact, toward the end of the campaign, Bevin had already begun to soften his rhetoric against the state's Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. \nBut Republican consultant Liz Mair sees the wealthy businessman's win as the latest sign that any attachment to the controversial program -- which the Democrat candidate had planned to preserve -- is still poison at the polls. \n\"Last night seems to continue to evidence that Obamacare is a big liability and is a problem for people who are running on it,\" she said, \"and people who are associated with it by virtue of their partisan identity.\"\n\nThe commonwealth has been caught between a Democratic governor, Clinton pal Terry McAuliffe, and a heavily Republican state House of Representatives. But its state Senate entered Tuesday very much up for grabs. \nIn the end though, the GOP retained its advantage -- and its ability to handcuff the Democratic administration from pursuing its legislative agenda.\nThat includes a push for stricter gun-control laws, which have become a staple of Hillary Clinton's pitch to more liberal Democratic primary voters.\nBloomberg's \"Everytown for Gun Safety\" group, which sunk millions into the Virginia contests to wrest control of the state Senate, took heart from one high-profile victory. In the state's 29th district, voters tapped a Democrat, Jeremy McPike, who was backed by $1.5 million in advertisements from Everytown, including one featuring Andy Parker, the father of slain local news reporter Ashley Parker.\n\"Gun safety prevailed on the NRA's home turf because we made sure that every voter knew where the candidates stood on gun safety,\" Everytown president John Feinblatt said in a statement.\nThe win, he added, is \"just the latest example of how candidates are paying the price for being out of step with Americans who demand that their leaders take action to prevent gun violence.\"\n\nIf Republicans won the most notable contest of the off-year 2015 Election Day in Kentucky, Democrats scored a number of number of lower-profile but potentially significant victories through ballot initiatives.\nDemocrats and supporters of campaign finance reform won hard fought and expensive battles in Seattle and Maine, where voters boosted initiatives to amp up public financing of elections.\n\"We as a movement have not had a great example to point to when people ask what kind of reform are you talking about, what is the actual path forward,\" said Szelena Gray, a co-founder of Run for America, which seeks to draft fresh faces into politics. \"We often have to speak in vague terms because there aren't a lot of solutions to point to and say this is working really well, let's grow this.\" \nBut with Tuesday's vote, she said, the sale became a whole lot easier for more liberal candidates like Clinton and Bernie Sanders. \n\"With the actual first passage of the ballot for 'democracy vouchers' in Seattle, you've taken something that up until now is just a concept, a theory and turned into something we can point to very concretely and say, 'Here is what the systems looks like, here is how it's working',\" Gray said. \"We now have the ability.\"\n\nEven as Republicans dole out the virtual backslaps to Bevin in Kentucky and point to the results in Virginia as proof gun control advocacy is a dead end for Clinton, Election Day 2015 may not provide much of a crystal ball at what's to come over the next 12 months.\nCase in point: The winner of Kentucky's attorney general race?

{"body": "Paul Sracic is chair of the Department of Politics and International Relations at Youngstown State University in Ohion and co-author of \"Ohio Government and Politics.\" The views expressed are his own.\n (CNN)Commentators were virtually unanimous in their praise of Marco Rubio's performance at last week's Republican debate. In particular, the freshman senator from Florida was lauded for more than holding his own in a testy exchange with his former friend and mentor, Jeb Bush, over his poor voting attendance record in the U.S. Senate. \nBut was his evening-defining comeback as smart as many have said?\nThe key moment came early in the debate, when Bush accused Rubio of shirking his responsibilities to his constituents, suggesting that he ought to resign. Rubio shot back that Bush hadn't been critical of John McCain's 2008 presidential run, which had seen the Arizonan senator missing numerous Senate votes.\nOn one level, this was a clever response by Rubio (and probably one he had ready in advance -- Bush had telegraphed the attack in interviews before the debate). \nThe response allowed the Florida senator to attack Bush for attacking him (in the world of politics this somehow makes sense). And, having established that Bush did not really have a problem with absentee senators, Rubio stated that Bush only brought the issue up because he wanted to score political points. Rubio then pivoted to the high ground, suggesting that he himself is only interested in attacking Democrats.\nYet despite the plaudits, Rubio's response was actually pretty terrible. \nThe first and most obvious problem with Rubio's answer is that it was no answer at all. Pointing out that \"everybody else does it\" is more a childish retort than a valid explanation. If the senator worked for a company and his supervisor criticized him for not showing up, would it be sufficient for him to answer that other employees had missed work in the past and no one had said anything?  \nWhether he likes it or not, Rubio agreed to be the voice for Florida residents on the floor of the Senate. But keep in mind that Rubio was often absent from the Senate even before he announced that he was running for president. \nFor example, in 2014, Rubio missed 36 votes, or about one out of every 10 votes that were taken. In comparison, Rubio's fellow senators on the main debate stage, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, missed, respectively, 28 votes and 7 votes. \nEven as the campaign has heated up for all the candidates, Rubio's absences have still outstripped those of his colleagues -- Rubio has missed over half of the 76 votes that have occurred since the start of July. In comparison, Ted Cruz has missed just under a quarter of the votes, and Rand Paul about 15% of them.\nThis should matter to Republican voters, who have been throwing their support behind nontraditional candidates such as Donald Trump and Ben Carson largely out of fatigue with the \"political class.\" Those who are in the government are thought to be out of touch with everyday Americans. What better evidence could there be of this that politicians -- and senators being paid $174,000 per year -- can simply decide they are too busy with other things to turn up to work?\nRubio's chronic absence from Senate votes is also directly tied to his biggest weakness as a candidate: his thin and completely political resume. \nRubio is a career politician -- a \"man in a hurry,\" as one of the moderators prefaced a question on Wednesday -- and so his only real argument for higher office is his brief performance in his current and previous offices. True, Rubio did serve as speaker for the Florida House of Representatives. But this hardly seems adequate training to be the next leader of the free world.  \nSo Rubio's incomplete Senate term is what we have to judge him on, including all those missed votes. \nOf course, his defenders will note that from 2011 until 2013, Rubio missed only about 5% of votes, but this is still above the median of less than 2% for all senators now serving, and it doesn't change the fact that Rubio missed 36 votes last year, presumably as he geared up to run. In contrast, in 2006, the year before launching her first campaign for president, Hillary Clinton missed only four votes, while her opponent for the nomination, Barack Obama, missed only three votes. \nIf Rubio had been in the Senate longer, perhaps 2014 could be dismissed as an anomaly. As it stands, however, it is nearly a quarter of the record that we have for him. It is therefore understandable that other candidates might want to make this an issue during the primaries. \nNext Tuesday, during the next Republican debate, Sen. Rubio's colleagues will have an opportunity to challenge him again. Let's see whether they do a better job of it than Jeb Bush.   \nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine. \n", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Marco Rubio's not-so-clever debate response (Opinion)", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/04/opinions/sracic-marco-rubio-voting-response/index.html", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Barack Obama", "Ben Carson", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": ["Senate", "Florida House of Representatives"], "election_confidence": 0.9991071277628983, "authors": [{"author_id": 25237, "fullname": "paul sracic", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-11-04 22:07:20", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "7c36a992f22c5f963331ae2816d2d6ac", "date_access": "2015-11-04 22:24:39.772046"},

{"body": "Hugh Hewitt is a lawyer, law professor, author and host of a nationally syndicated radio show. He served in the Reagan administration in posts including assistant counsel in the White House and special assistant to two attorneys general. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n (CNN)In his first radio interview since becoming speaker of the House (the complete audio and transcript is here), Paul Ryan told me on Monday:\n\"Look, I see the whole shooting match coming up in 2016. Again, one of the reasons why I chose to do this, and one of the reasons, one of the conditions, more or less, I talked to my colleagues about, which is we've got to go on offense, big and bold, specific agenda and vision in 2016, and let the country choose, because the kind of an election we have to have is a mandate election.\"\nThe Wisconsin Republican had come to talk with me at the radio studio at Hillsdale College's Kirby Center, near Capitol Hill. In doing so he increased by one the number of times his predecessor, former Rep. John Boehner, had been interviewed by me or any other nationally broadcast conservative talk show host while he was speaker of the House. An interesting change in tactics, that one. \nBoehner dutifully made the rounds of conservative media while rising to the speakership, then promptly abandoned the effort to talk to the Republican Party's core supporters and those independents and open-minded Democrats who listen to shows like mine.  \nInterviews and selling the party's agenda to an audience beyond his GOP caucus just wasn't how Boehner saw his job. Speaker Ryan promises a much-needed, night-and-day change there, one that foreshadows crucial change in the way Congress operates.\nRyan arrived early on Monday and joined Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, in a discussion of the Democratic debate and it promises regarding student loans, then stayed on after Cotton left talk about national defense, the \"regular order\" approach he is embracing for the House and, crucially, how congressional Republicans must assist the GOP field in framing the upcoming election.\nRyan used the interview to begin doing that specifically with the conservative base that listens to my show or reads the transcripts of interviews I post from it, just as he had done so for different audiences on the weekend shows the previous day.\nRyan, like his mentor, the late congressman and GOP vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp, is a gifted communicator and an ideas guy. He loves to talk policy, even with folks who disagree with him. Unlike most older Republican stalwarts on the Hill, even the ones deeply admired by conservatives, Ryan is also very, very good at it.\nRyan comes armed for the communications battles. He has been studying up for years, beginning with his undergraduate days at Miami University. His 2012 campaign as Mitt Romney's running mate infused him with name recognition no other member of the House can rival, and the speakership gives him a platform he can use every day to sell the conservative vision.  \nThat he began to do so on the radio with me probably had more to do with paying a compliment to Hillsdale College, which is a lighthouse institution for conservatives, and its president Larry Arnn, who is one of the very few thought leaders respected across he conservative spectrum, than it did with me.\nBut the key facts are that Ryan knows the importance of Hillsdale, of Arnn, of conservative talk radio generally and of center-right media and conservative institutions all across the land. The new speaker knows he must sell ideas and help build conservative ideas infrastructure, just as Kemp did, and he is about the business of doing so. All conservatives should be thrilled about Ryan's rise -- and about other recent developments.\nYesterday, Republican Matt Bevin won a shocking upset for the governorship in Kentucky. The GOP debates are drawing huge audiences no matter how well or poorly they are managed. There is good news for conservatives everywhere.\nThe GOP candidates are all experienced, effective communicators, and they don't have to conceal what they were doing or where they were during the Obama years. None of them has dismissed the VA scandal as \"not as widespread\" as the public has been led to believe. None of them has a scandal that is under FBI investigation. None of them lied about a video having anything to do with a terrorist attack.\nLike Speaker Ryan and his friend RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, I don't have a favorite in the GOP race but, like both of them, I have an intense interest in seeing the GOP nominate its strongest candidate and in winning the presidency a year from now.\nTo do that, the GOP needed new voices, like Ryan's and Cotton's and Bevin's, to emerge with a message drawn from all the presidential candidates -- \"We can fix this, we can make America great again, we can speak for and on behalf of all Americans, including all working Americans or Americans who want to find work, and we can rebuild our military and return the country to global leadership and renew the world's respect for us\" -- without favoring any one candidate. Ryan especially can lead the House in crafting legislation that would await a new Republican's president's input and signature.\nThe GOP doesn't need a party platform when it has a platform in which to display its legislative agenda and a Speaker who can describe it with good humor, eloquence and a command of the details.\nIt has been a great week for the GOP, and though the mainstream media seems to have missed yet another major development in the race for the White House -- even as it mostly missed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's pratfall on the VA or her many \"admissions against interest\" in her 11 hours of testimony two weeks ago -- the reinforcements have arrived, in the Speaker's Office, in Kentucky and across the country.  \nDemocrats feel a chill wind blowing.

{"body": "Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House. He is a consultant to the pro-Hillary Clinton super-PAC Priorities USA Action. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n (CNN)Back in July, when Donald Trump was first insulting his way to the top of the polls, I told CNN's Anderson Cooper, \"He speaks for a lot of people.  The Republican base: the technical term [is] they're crazy.  And he speaks to the crazy base voters.\"    \nThat description of the GOP base has been borne out.  I believe what's driving the GOP base crazy is anger.  Anger at stagnant wages, anger at immigration and the changing demography of the U.S., anger at losing the culture wars, at seeing gay marriage enshrined in the Constitution.  These people are ticked off.\nThey are, as Howard Beale said in Network \"as mad as hell, and ... not going to take this anymore.\"  For some, this anger crosses into despair: Hence the study released this week about the spike in mortality rates for middle-aged white people, primarily those with a high school degree or less. The study showed a spike in diseases of despair: alcoholism and alcohol-related liver disease, drug addiction and poisoning and suicide.  When a sizeable chunk of America is driven to deadly despair, attention must be paid.\nSome of those not driven to the point of drugs and death are driven to, umm, eccentric political expression:  \n-- Matt Bevin was a fringe nut a few years ago, getting creamed by Mitch McConnell (whose spokesman called him an \"East Coast con man\"). Now he's governor-elect of the great Commonwealth of Kentucky after a campaign in which he embraced Kim Davis, the controversial anti-gay-marriage county clerk, and promised to eliminate the expanded Medicaid program under Obamacare.  Bevin once spoke at a rally in support of -- get this -- cockfighting.  He later apologized, but the message was sent: If you're into cockfighting, I'm your man. \n-- Ben Carson compares pretty much everything he doesn't like to slavery and Hitler. He's leading in the national polls.   \n-- Donald Trump says America is \"crippled,\"  has asserted that many Mexican migrants are murderers and rapists, and that John McCain is not a war hero because he was a POW.  And he has led in the polls for months, now basically tied with Carson.  I am old enough to remember when Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, was a right-wing crackpot leading the charge to impeach my boss, President Bill Clinton. Today he isn't even crazy enough to make it onto the main stage at the debates.  \n-- In my beloved hometown of Houston, anti-gay, anti-transgender zealots prevailed in a referendum to repeal the city's equal rights ordinance.  Never mind that most major cities have such an ordinance. The conspiratorial right told Houstonians that equal rights would mean men could pee in the ladies room.  I am not kidding.  Worse, a sizeable majority of Houston voters fell for it.  They could have called their cousin in, say, Dallas (hardly a hotbed of PC excess) and asked him, \"Hey, Buford, y'all got any guys peein' in front of your daughters?  No?  OK.  Just wonderin'.\"\nI know it is fashionable -- actually, required -- to pretend that both parties' bases are equally crazy.  But that is simply not the case.  Sure, there are some loopy lefties out there, but even Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders is not, for example, calling for nationalizing the oil companies or socializing the banks.  \nNo Democratic presidential candidate is saying Ted Cruz can't be president because he was born in Canada.  No progressive is attacking Ben Carson's profound faith.   That is why both Hillary Clinton and Sanders are succeeding by addressing some pretty mainstream issues: raising the minimum wage, equal pay protections for women, paid family leave, making college affordable, and universal background checks for gun purchases.  \nThe Democrats are not insulting each other and they are not spinning fantastic conspiracy theories.  They also aren't getting their voters out.  The impressive -- stunning, really -- victory of Bevin in Kentucky, paired with the overwhelming victory of the anti-gay forces in Houston teaches Republicans a sobering lesson:  crazy sells.  \nSo here's my prediction:  It's about to get a whole lot crazier.  How crazy?  Consider this:\n \n\u2022 44% of Republicans believe the President was not born in the USA; \n\u2022 54% think our President is a Muslim. (Never mind the fact that they were freaking out about his Christian minister back during the 2008 campaign -- only 14% of Republicans think the President is a Christian.)  \n\u2022 And, perhaps most ominous: According to a September YouGov poll, 43% of Republicans could imagine supporting a military coup in the United States. \n Keep in mind that we're still 89 days from the Iowa caucuses and 98 days from the New Hampshire primary.  We have not even begun to see the full blooming of right-wing crazy.  We may look back on November 2015 as the calm before the storm. \n \nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine. \n", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "What's making GOP crazy", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/04/opinions/begala-whats-making-gop-crazy/index.html", "topics": ["jobs/employment"], "people": ["Lindsey Graham", "Anderson Cooper", "Bill Clinton", "Kim Davis", "Paul Begala", "Hillary Clinton", "Donald Trump", "Howard Beale", "Bernie Sanders", "Ben Carson", "Matt Bevin", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": ["Commonwealth", "GOP", "United States."], "election_confidence": 0.9924362964036901, "authors": [{"author_id": 3749, "fullname": "paul begala", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-11-04 22:24:22", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "bf35aba65ccc474aa714e8c20be7a61c", "date_access": "2015-11-04 23:01:55.627083"},

As Carson moves into a tie with Donald Trump in the latest Quinnipiac University national Republican primary poll, the retired neurosurgeon is blowing the doors off every candidate \u2013 including Hillary Clinton \u2013 when it comes to the general electorate.  Carson runs better against Clinton than any GOP contender in hypothetical general election matchup, romping to a 10-point lead. Among the three other top-tier GOP candidates, Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz both defeated Clinton by 5 points and 3 points respectively while Trump trails Clinton by 3 points.  We\u2019re still almost a year out from Election Day, so these matchups are meaningless as predictive properties. But they do reveal the depth of Clinton\u2019s predicament and the remarkable height Carson is obtaining.  Among both general election voters and Republicans, Carson and Rubio are the best liked candidates, though Carly Fiorina also shows appeal in her party and with all voters.\u00a0 But consider this: Carson has a favorability score 34 points higher than Clinton\u2019s.  Americans might vote for a candidate they do not like. Americans might even vote for a candidate they do not trust, but Democrats ought to be more than a little seasick at the thought that their presumptive nominee is 10 points underwater with the national electorate on favorability and 24 points (!) underwater on honesty.  But again, why is Carson the most popular candidate in the country?  To get your answer, consider the least liked candidate in either party: Jeb Bush.  Bush, who has a net favorability rating of negative 33 points, has made personal attacks a hallmark of late. He first attacked Trump, who is the ne plus ultra of character attackers. But Bush has most recently been attacking the character of his onetime prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Rubio.  Bush\u2019s attacks on Trump have sometimes been issue-based, but with Rubio, Bush attacks his younger rival as unfit and unready for office, comparing him to President Obama.  That\u2019s not Ronald Reagan hitting Gerald Ford on the Panama Canal or Mitt Romney clubbing Rick Perry over Social Security. This is personal, more in the vein of the hits Romney took from rivals Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for Romney\u2019s work at Bain Capital, attacks that teed up the ball for Obama in the general election.  Attacks cost favorability for both the attacked and the attacker. It\u2019s like an intentional foul in a football game. It\u2019s only worth the penalty of it keeps the other team from scoring and keeps you in the game.  Trump\u2019s persistent personal attacks have been part of what has left him unable to expand his reach within his party. Bush\u2019s attacks have proven even more costly. He fell 26 points on favorability with the general electorate since Quinnipiac\u2019s September poll and 38 percent just among Republicans.  Team Bush is looking to reboot, but with Bush loyalists pushing hard on Rubio\u2019s spotty personal financial past \u2013 one Bush loyalist emailed today calling for Rubio to release a decade of his credit scores \u2013 it seems clear that the personal attacks will persist.  Carson\u2019s opponents have mostly avoided attacking him, except, of course, Trump, a move which has plainly backfired. Attacking Carson, a kindly, Christian man with an inspiring life story, is hard to do.  And Carson goes to great pains to avoid saying unkind things about his rivals. Like Cruz and Rubio, Carson looks for ways to praise rather than blame his fellow Republicans. And voters reward them.  The lesson: If you want to fight your intra-party foes, do it on substance not character.  New poll shows big movement for Rubio in the Granite State - WBUR: \u201cA new WBUR poll in New Hampshire shows establishment outsiders Donald Trump and Ben Carson are still leading in the Republican primary race there, but some of the other candidates are making new headway\u2026 Florida Sen. [Marco] Rubio\u2019s support more than quintupled, from 2 percent to 11 percent, while New Jersey Gov. Christie\u2019s support rose from 2 percent to 8 percent. Both candidates are also seeing big jumps in their favorability ratings.\u201d  Rubio gets second Senate endorsement - The Hill: \u201cSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is picking up his second endorsement for president from a fellow senator in as many days. \u2018I\u2019m endorsing Marco Rubio for President,\u2019 said Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) in a statement on Tuesday\u2026Rubio\u2019s first Senate endorsement came from Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) on Monday\u2026\u201d  Dr. Cruz is in - James Pinkerton credits Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for his support of better treatments and cures for pernicious illnesses like Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer, which the former adviser to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush says will be the key message for the GOP in fighting the Democratic narrative on health issues in 2016.  Jeb to France: Je suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9 - Time: \u201cFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush lightheartedly apologized to the people of France on Tuesday for making fun of their work week during last week\u2019s Republican debate\u2026when he was trying to highlight rival Marco Rubio\u2019s poor voting record in the Senate. \u2018I made the mistake of saying that the Congress operates on a French work week,\u2019 he deadpanned. \u2018I really did a disservice to the French,\u2019 Bush added with a chuckle Tuesday. \u2018My inbox was full of French journalists,\u2019 piped in campaign spokesman Tim Miller.\u201d  Jeb thunders in N.H. speech - Bloomberg: \u201c\u2026the former Florida governor practically yelled through his stump speech to a crowd at a house event hosted by ex-senator Scott Brown before taking questions from the audience. \u2018We\u2019re Americans, dammit!\u2019 he thundered, as he talked up his boilerplate proposals to cut taxes, lift regulations, boost the military and take aim at President Barack Obama\u2019s policies.\u201d  POWER PLAY: DEBATING DEBATES, IN 60 SECONDS There\u2019s a great deal of hoopla over the fact the Republican presidential candidates are at odds over the format of GOP debates. Should that be surprising? Chris Stirewalt details the great debate over debates, in just 60 seconds. WATCH HERE.  WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026 After over 100 years a landmark of European architecture is nearing completion. The Atlantic describes its historic journey: \u201cIn August 1963, Merloyd Lawrence wrote a dispatch in\u00a0The Atlantic\u00a0from Barcelona, mentioning many of the city\u2019s\u2026buildings designed by Antoni Gaud\u00ed\u2026Lawrence describes the Iglesia de la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, Gaud\u00ed\u2019s most famous building, as an \u2018unfinished, uninhibited cathedral in which stone explodes into botanical fantasies or overflows like molten wax.\u2019 52 years after Lawrence\u2019s piece appeared in\u00a0The Atlantic\u00a0and 132 years after construction began in 1883, the magnificent Sagrada Fam\u00edlia\u00a0has reached its final stage of construction. \u2026 When it\u2019s finished, the basilica will be the tallest religious building in Europe, standing at 564 feet.\u201d  Got a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

The biggest surprise of the night came from the Kentucky governor\u2019s race where Republican Matt Bevin and Democrat Jack Conway were expected to have an extremely tight contest for a seat Democrats have held for all but four of the past 44 years. Bevin trounced his opponent with a nearly 9-point victory, however, creating shock waves around the state. That\u2019s good news for Sen. Rand Paul who can continue to run for president for a while longer. And an interesting factoid: the party that won the Kentucky gubernatorial election for the previous 3 cycles has also won the presidency.  Kentucky adds its name to the list of unpredicted Republican victories in between the last two election cycles, drawing many questions about how polling keeps getting things so wrong.\u00a0 Pollsters in the Bluegrass state apparently did not expect the 17 percent turnout surge from 2011\u2019s gubernatorial race in Kentucky, just as they did not expect Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s shocking upset last year in the Maryland\u2019s governor\u2019s race. Looks like the persistent challenges of polling, or perhaps the wrong assumption of the pollsters.  Ohio says no to Mary Jane by a wide margin - Columbus Dispatch: \u201cOhioans pushed a monopoly marijuana-legalization proposal out the door Tuesday by a nearly 2-to-1 vote. But the question is, will pot make a comeback? Although Issue 3 was handily defeated, the debate and conversations about the issue have convinced House Speaker Cliff Rosenberg, R-Clarksville, and other state lawmakers who were staunchly opposed to legalization to now say it may be time to move ahead with medical marijuana.\u201d  Multi-gender bathrooms stall in Texas - Fox News: \u201cAn ordinance that would have established nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people in Houston failed to win approval from voters on Tuesday. The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance was rejected after a nearly 18-month battle that spawned rallies, legal fights and accusations of both religious intolerance and demonization of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.\u201d  [The Ohio school superintendent whose district is being ordered by the Department of Education to allow a transgendered student access to the women\u2019s locker room appeared on \u201cThe Kelly File.\u201d Watch here.]  HILLARY MOVES LEFT AGAIN ON GUNS, MINIMUM WAGE What\u2019s up with Hillary Clinton? The latest national poll out today from Quinnipiac University puts her up 18 points over Bernie Sanders. The same poll says 54 percent of Democrats supporting Clinton made up their minds and only 8 percent say they would definitely not support her. And she has overtaken Sanders in the latest polls in both Iowa and New Hampshire. But despite the apparent lock on the nomination she\u2019s digging a deeper hole with the general electorate.  Tuesday saw Clinton aggressively pushing stricter gun control measures, which she wants to make a \u201cvoting issue.\u201d That may please the left now but could prove costly in the general, especially in swing states where tighter restrictions on gun rights strike a nerve. And if that wasn\u2019t enough for one day, Clinton says she wants the federal minimum wage boosted to $12 per hour, an increase of almost 70 percent and a move that could cost jobs. Clinton may be bringing the hammer down on Sanders, but at what cost?  Bad omen in Virginia - WaPo: \u201cRepublicans held onto the Virginia Senate in fiercely contested elections Tuesday, leaving Gov. Terry McAuliffe without legislative leverage or political momentum as he works to deliver Virginia for his friend and ally Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016. The outcome was a blunt rebuke to McAuliffe (D), who had barnstormed the state with 24 events over the past four days and who portrayed the elections as a make-or-break moment for his progressive agenda.\u201d  [Good luck in Paris - NYT: \u201cChina, the world\u2019s leading emitter of greenhouse gases from coal, has been burning up to 17 percent more coal a year than the government previously disclosed, according to newly released data.]  From nun to \u2018none\u2019 - According to a recent Pew Research survey cited by WaPo \u201c\u2026shows is that people who do not identify with any organized religion (aka the \u2018nones\u2019) comprise the largest chunk of self-identified Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic party. \u00a0And, that number has increased by almost 10 percentage points since Pew last conducted a similar study back in 2007.\u201d  Oops - At an NAACP banquet in Charleston, S.C.

The Aviation Herald\u00a0reports the cargo flight from Australia to Kuala Lumpur, with 4 crew and 2186 sheep on-board, was flying just to the south of Indonesia when the smoke alarms sounded on October 26. Crew on-board SQ-7108 descended the aircraft immediately and diverted to Bali where they landed about 45 minutes later. Emergency services didn\u2019t find any trace of fire or smoke and identified the cause to be the result of exhaust gasses and manure produced by the sheep. The plane and its stinky cargo were able to depart the holiday island about three hours later.\u201d  Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

I guess that's what's happening,\" Rubio told Fox News. \"We are going to focus on our campaign -- and we will pray for Donald; that he finds some peace.\"\nRubio added: \"I don't know what he is talking about. I don't have any debt in the world except a mortgage that I own with our family.\"\nTrump first went after Rubio on his finances during a press conference Tuesday and kept up the criticism Wednesday, after becoming the first Republican to file for New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary ballot. Trump is at the top of most polls alongside Ben Carson, but Rubio has risen to third in many surveys.\n\"Marco Rubio has a disaster on his personal finances. He has a disaster on his credit cards,\" Trump said in the state capital of Concord.\nDuring his U.S. Senate run in 2010, Rubio faced similar criticism from then-opponent Charlie Crist, who attacked the upstart candidate on the same topic. At issue: whether Rubio as Florida House speaker crossed an ethical line by using his Republican Party of Florida American Express charge card for personal reasons. Rubio always maintained he repaid his personal expenses on the charge card in 2007 and 2008, totaling roughly $16,000. He also argued the card was a charge card -- payments had to be paid off every month, unlike a credit card where a balance is rolled over to the next billing period.\n\"It wasn't a credit card, it was an American Express charge card secured under my personal credit in conjunction with the party,\" Rubio\u00a0 said on ABC's \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on Wednesday.\nDuring the 2010 campaign, the Rubio team accused Crist -- a former Republican governor who left the party to run as an independent -- of leaking the credit card issue for political gain. Crist lost to Rubio in the election.Serafin Gomez covers Special Events and Politics for FOX News Channel and is also a contributor to FOX News Latino.

Clinton\u2019s current 25-point margin over Sanders is mostly unchanged from last month when she had a 26-point lead without Biden in the race.\nThe next Republican presidential debate will be hosted by Fox Business Network and The Wall Street Journal on November 10 in Milwaukee and will focus on the economy.\nViews on the economy remain ugly, yet they have improved compared to four years ago.\u00a0 While only 21 percent rate the economy positively (1 percent \u201cexcellent\u201d and 20 percent \u201cgood\u201d), that\u2019s up from a 5 percent positive rating in December 2011.\u00a0 Most voters -- 79 percent -- still say the economy is in \u201conly fair\u201d (44 percent) or \u201cpoor\u201d shape (35 percent).\nThinking only about economic issues, voters prioritize government spending (36 percent) and jobs (28 percent) over income inequality (16 percent) and taxes (6 percent).\nMore GOP primary voters say economic issues (38 percent) will be most important in deciding their vote for the nomination than say national security (26 percent), immigration (15 percent) or social issues (7 percent).\u00a0\nAnd that helps Trump.\u00a0 No other candidate comes close to the real estate mogul\u2019s 42 percent rating when primary voters are asked who is most qualified to handle the economy.\u00a0 The next closest is Cruz at 10 percent, while 9 percent say Carson, 7 percent Rubio, and 5 percent each for Bush and Kasich.\u00a0 Fiorina, a former CEO, garners just 3 percent.\nThere\u2019s much less consensus on which candidate is most qualified to be commander-in-chief,\u00a0 yet Trump still has the edge: 19 percent pick him, while 17 percent say Carson, 13 percent Cruz, 10 percent Rubio and 9 percent Bush.\u00a0\nBut who can WIN?\u00a0 Twice as many Republican primary voters say Trump (37 percent) is the one most likely to beat Clinton than Carson (18 percent).\u00a0 Another 11 percent say Rubio has the best odds.\u00a0 All other candidates are in the single digits on electability.\n\u00a0\nPollpourri\nBy a 55-34 percent margin, voters think Clinton would win a one-on-one debate with Fiorina, the only female Republican candidate.\u00a0 Women say Clinton would prevail by 60-30 percent.\u00a0 Democrats (86 percent) are far more likely to say Clinton would win than Republicans are to pick Fiorina (62 percent).\u00a0\nThe Fox News poll is based on landline and cell phone interviews with 1,230 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from November 1-3, 2015.

As Carson moves into a tie with Donald Trump in the latest Quinnipiac University national Republican primary poll, the retired neurosurgeon is blowing the doors off every candidate \u2013 including Hillary Clinton \u2013 when it comes to the general electorate.  Carson runs better against Clinton than any GOP contender in hypothetical general election matchup, romping to a 10-point lead. Among the three other top-tier GOP candidates, Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz both defeated Clinton by 5 points and 3 points respectively while Trump trails Clinton by 3 points.  We\u2019re still almost a year out from Election Day, so these matchups are meaningless as predictive properties. But they do reveal the depth of Clinton\u2019s predicament and the remarkable height Carson is obtaining.  Among both general election voters and Republicans, Carson and Rubio are the best liked candidates, though Carly Fiorina also shows appeal in her party and with all voters.\u00a0 But consider this: Carson has a favorability score 34 points higher than Clinton\u2019s.  Americans might vote for a candidate they do not like. Americans might even vote for a candidate they do not trust, but Democrats ought to be more than a little seasick at the thought that their presumptive nominee is 10 points underwater with the national electorate on favorability and 24 points (!) underwater on honesty.  But again, why is Carson the most popular candidate in the country?  To get your answer, consider the least liked candidate in either party: Jeb Bush.  Bush, who has a net favorability rating of negative 33 points, has made personal attacks a hallmark of late. He first attacked Trump, who is the ne plus ultra of character attackers. But Bush has most recently been attacking the character of his onetime prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Rubio.  Bush\u2019s attacks on Trump have sometimes been issue-based, but with Rubio, Bush attacks his younger rival as unfit and unready for office, comparing him to President Obama.  That\u2019s not Ronald Reagan hitting Gerald Ford on the Panama Canal or Mitt Romney clubbing Rick Perry over Social Security. This is personal, more in the vein of the hits Romney took from rivals Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum for Romney\u2019s work at Bain Capital, attacks that teed up the ball for Obama in the general election.  Attacks cost favorability for both the attacked and the attacker. It\u2019s like an intentional foul in a football game. It\u2019s only worth the penalty of it keeps the other team from scoring and keeps you in the game.  Trump\u2019s persistent personal attacks have been part of what has left him unable to expand his reach within his party. Bush\u2019s attacks have proven even more costly. He fell 26 points on favorability with the general electorate since Quinnipiac\u2019s September poll and 38 percent just among Republicans.  Team Bush is looking to reboot, but with Bush loyalists pushing hard on Rubio\u2019s spotty personal financial past \u2013 one Bush loyalist emailed today calling for Rubio to release a decade of his credit scores \u2013 it seems clear that the personal attacks will persist.  Carson\u2019s opponents have mostly avoided attacking him, except, of course, Trump, a move which has plainly backfired. Attacking Carson, a kindly, Christian man with an inspiring life story, is hard to do.  And Carson goes to great pains to avoid saying unkind things about his rivals. Like Cruz and Rubio, Carson looks for ways to praise rather than blame his fellow Republicans. And voters reward them.  The lesson: If you want to fight your intra-party foes, do it on substance not character.  New poll shows big movement for Rubio in the Granite State - WBUR: \u201cA new WBUR poll in New Hampshire shows establishment outsiders Donald Trump and Ben Carson are still leading in the Republican primary race there, but some of the other candidates are making new headway\u2026 Florida Sen. [Marco] Rubio\u2019s support more than quintupled, from 2 percent to 11 percent, while New Jersey Gov. Christie\u2019s support rose from 2 percent to 8 percent. Both candidates are also seeing big jumps in their favorability ratings.\u201d  Rubio gets second Senate endorsement - The Hill: \u201cSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is picking up his second endorsement for president from a fellow senator in as many days. \u2018I\u2019m endorsing Marco Rubio for President,\u2019 said Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) in a statement on Tuesday\u2026Rubio\u2019s first Senate endorsement came from Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) on Monday\u2026\u201d  Dr. Cruz is in - James Pinkerton credits Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for his support of better treatments and cures for pernicious illnesses like Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer, which the former adviser to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush says will be the key message for the GOP in fighting the Democratic narrative on health issues in 2016.  Jeb to France: Je suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9 - Time: \u201cFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush lightheartedly apologized to the people of France on Tuesday for making fun of their work week during last week\u2019s Republican debate\u2026when he was trying to highlight rival Marco Rubio\u2019s poor voting record in the Senate. \u2018I made the mistake of saying that the Congress operates on a French work week,\u2019 he deadpanned. \u2018I really did a disservice to the French,\u2019 Bush added with a chuckle Tuesday. \u2018My inbox was full of French journalists,\u2019 piped in campaign spokesman Tim Miller.\u201d  Jeb thunders in N.H. speech - Bloomberg: \u201c\u2026the former Florida governor practically yelled through his stump speech to a crowd at a house event hosted by ex-senator Scott Brown before taking questions from the audience. \u2018We\u2019re Americans, dammit!\u2019 he thundered, as he talked up his boilerplate proposals to cut taxes, lift regulations, boost the military and take aim at President Barack Obama\u2019s policies.\u201d  POWER PLAY: DEBATING DEBATES, IN 60 SECONDS There\u2019s a great deal of hoopla over the fact the Republican presidential candidates are at odds over the format of GOP debates. Should that be surprising? Chris Stirewalt details the great debate over debates, in just 60 seconds. WATCH HERE.  WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026 After over 100 years a landmark of European architecture is nearing completion. The Atlantic describes its historic journey: \u201cIn August 1963, Merloyd Lawrence wrote a dispatch in\u00a0The Atlantic\u00a0from Barcelona, mentioning many of the city\u2019s\u2026buildings designed by Antoni Gaud\u00ed\u2026Lawrence describes the Iglesia de la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, Gaud\u00ed\u2019s most famous building, as an \u2018unfinished, uninhibited cathedral in which stone explodes into botanical fantasies or overflows like molten wax.\u2019 52 years after Lawrence\u2019s piece appeared in\u00a0The Atlantic\u00a0and 132 years after construction began in 1883, the magnificent Sagrada Fam\u00edlia\u00a0has reached its final stage of construction. \u2026 When it\u2019s finished, the basilica will be the tallest religious building in Europe, standing at 564 feet.\u201d  Got a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

The biggest surprise of the night came from the Kentucky governor\u2019s race where Republican Matt Bevin and Democrat Jack Conway were expected to have an extremely tight contest for a seat Democrats have held for all but four of the past 44 years. Bevin trounced his opponent with a nearly 9-point victory, however, creating shock waves around the state. That\u2019s good news for Sen. Rand Paul who can continue to run for president for a while longer. And an interesting factoid: the party that won the Kentucky gubernatorial election for the previous 3 cycles has also won the presidency.  Kentucky adds its name to the list of unpredicted Republican victories in between the last two election cycles, drawing many questions about how polling keeps getting things so wrong.\u00a0 Pollsters in the Bluegrass state apparently did not expect the 17 percent turnout surge from 2011\u2019s gubernatorial race in Kentucky, just as they did not expect Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s shocking upset last year in the Maryland\u2019s governor\u2019s race. Looks like the persistent challenges of polling, or perhaps the wrong assumption of the pollsters.  Ohio says no to Mary Jane by a wide margin - Columbus Dispatch: \u201cOhioans pushed a monopoly marijuana-legalization proposal out the door Tuesday by a nearly 2-to-1 vote. But the question is, will pot make a comeback? Although Issue 3 was handily defeated, the debate and conversations about the issue have convinced House Speaker Cliff Rosenberg, R-Clarksville, and other state lawmakers who were staunchly opposed to legalization to now say it may be time to move ahead with medical marijuana.\u201d  Multi-gender bathrooms stall in Texas - Fox News: \u201cAn ordinance that would have established nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people in Houston failed to win approval from voters on Tuesday. The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance was rejected after a nearly 18-month battle that spawned rallies, legal fights and accusations of both religious intolerance and demonization of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.\u201d  [The Ohio school superintendent whose district is being ordered by the Department of Education to allow a transgendered student access to the women\u2019s locker room appeared on \u201cThe Kelly File.\u201d Watch here.]  HILLARY MOVES LEFT AGAIN ON GUNS, MINIMUM WAGE What\u2019s up with Hillary Clinton? The latest national poll out today from Quinnipiac University puts her up 18 points over Bernie Sanders. The same poll says 54 percent of Democrats supporting Clinton made up their minds and only 8 percent say they would definitely not support her. And she has overtaken Sanders in the latest polls in both Iowa and New Hampshire. But despite the apparent lock on the nomination she\u2019s digging a deeper hole with the general electorate.  Tuesday saw Clinton aggressively pushing stricter gun control measures, which she wants to make a \u201cvoting issue.\u201d That may please the left now but could prove costly in the general, especially in swing states where tighter restrictions on gun rights strike a nerve. And if that wasn\u2019t enough for one day, Clinton says she wants the federal minimum wage boosted to $12 per hour, an increase of almost 70 percent and a move that could cost jobs. Clinton may be bringing the hammer down on Sanders, but at what cost?  Bad omen in Virginia - WaPo: \u201cRepublicans held onto the Virginia Senate in fiercely contested elections Tuesday, leaving Gov. Terry McAuliffe without legislative leverage or political momentum as he works to deliver Virginia for his friend and ally Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016. The outcome was a blunt rebuke to McAuliffe (D), who had barnstormed the state with 24 events over the past four days and who portrayed the elections as a make-or-break moment for his progressive agenda.\u201d  [Good luck in Paris - NYT: \u201cChina, the world\u2019s leading emitter of greenhouse gases from coal, has been burning up to 17 percent more coal a year than the government previously disclosed, according to newly released data.]  From nun to \u2018none\u2019 - According to a recent Pew Research survey cited by WaPo \u201c\u2026shows is that people who do not identify with any organized religion (aka the \u2018nones\u2019) comprise the largest chunk of self-identified Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic party. \u00a0And, that number has increased by almost 10 percentage points since Pew last conducted a similar study back in 2007.\u201d  Oops - At an NAACP banquet in Charleston, S.C.

The decline accelerated as the nation\u2019s polarization over cultural issues intensified in the decades since then.\nKentucky\u2019s shift away from Democrats has been slower than in some neighboring states, thanks partly to the 2005 indictment of its last Republican governor, \nErnie Fletcher\n, in a political patronage scandal, Cross said.\nFor Bevin, Obama\u2019s unpopularity in culturally conservative states like Kentucky proved a major asset. His advertising leaned heavily on tying Conway to the president.\nObama is also a major factor in the Nov. 21 runoff for governor of Louisiana, where Republican U.S. Sen. \nDavid Vitter\n is trying to use the president\u2019s low popularity there to damage Democratic opponent John Bel Edwards.\nSince 2008, when Obama won the presidency, Democrats have lost 13 governorships and more than 900 state legislative seats across the U.S.\nIn Kentucky, Bevin campaigned as a Christian conservative businessman who would protect coal mining, a backbone industry in the Appalachians.\nJim Cauley, a Democratic strategist in Louisville, said that timeworn tactic was especially effective in rural areas where the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is seen as a coal-mine job killer.\n\u201cThere\u2019s this feeling that the liberal Democrats are coming to get them,\u201d Cauley said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have Christmas because Barack\u2019s coming at them with the EPA.\u201d\nBevin highlighted his \u201cpro-life\u201d and \u201cpro-family\u201d stances. He stressed his opposition to Planned Parenthood and his support for Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who spent several days in jail for refusing to obey federal court orders to issue marriage licenses after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage was legal. Bevin paid her a jailhouse visit.\nHe also campaigned against Obamacare, a sensitive issue in a state where the Affordable Care Act has extended coverage to more than 500,000 people, mostly through an expansion of \nMedicaid\n under Democratic Gov. \nSteve Beshear\n.\nBevin wound up backpedaling on his initial pledge to stop the Medicaid expansion, saying he would continue to accept federal money to keep the newly insured covered but would require some of them to pay fees.\nBevin\u2019s pivot came as Republican White House contenders, with a few exceptions, strike a less bellicose posture against the healthcare law than they did in 2012.\n\u00a0\u201cWe went from \u2018repeal, repeal, repeal\u2019 to \u2018repeal and replace,\u2019\u201d said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. \u201cThat, to me, is shorthand for Republicans figuring out you couldn\u2019t just talk about repeal.

{"body": "The Republican presidential candidates were infuriated by last week's CNBC debate. They felt the tone was hostile, the questions were \"gotcha,\" and the whole thing reeked of liberal media bias. As a result, the candidates have joined forces to craft a new debate format, one that will better and more fairly allow them to expound their views to the American people. Here's an advance look at the result:\nHANNITY: Hi, I'm Sean Hannity and these are my fellow moderators, Ann Coulter and \nRush Limbaugh\n. Let's get right to it. This first question calls for a show of hands. If you think America is the greatest country in the entire universe, raise your hand. [All hands go up except for Dr. \nBen Carson\n's]\nHANNITY: You disagree, Dr. Carson?\nCARSON: [Inaudible]\nHANNITY: I'm sorry, Doctor. Could you please speak up?\nCARSON: I said there's a problem with the question. I would say America is the greatest country in the entire universe and any parallel universes. [All hands go up. Applause.]\nCOULTER: Mr. Trump, you have said you will build a wall to keep Mexican illegals out of the country and that you will make the Mexican government pay for it. The obvious question is: How high do you think that wall should be?\nTRUMP: Good question, Ann. Here's the good news. Mexicans are not very tall. That's why you don't see any in the NBA. That means a six, seven foot wall should do the job.\nHUCKABEE: If I can follow up.\nCOULTER: I'm sorry, Governor, we need to move on. [Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, walks hurriedly on stage and whispers in Coulter's ear.] My deepest apologies, Governor, I didn't mean to interrupt.\nHUCKABEE: I was just going to add that this is yet another example of how God has blessed this country. Just think if we shared a border with Africa. Then we'd need a much taller wall and the costs would soar. [Applause]\nLIMBAUGH: This question is for Senator Cruz. What's your favorite color?\nCRUZ: It's not one color, Rush. It's three. Red, white and blue. [Thunderous applause]\nLIMBAUGH: What about you, Governor Bush?\nBUSH: Gosh, brown maybe.\nCOULTER: Senator Rubio, you've been described as young, handsome, virile, a powerful and attractive politician with great appeal to women voters.\nRUBIO: What's the question?\nCOULTER: No question.\nHANNITY: Senator Paul, I'd like to try a word association exercise with you.\nPAUL: First I want to address something very important that was discussed earlier. Cyan.\nHANNITY: Pardon?\nPAUL: That's my favorite color.\nHANNITY: Let me try this with you, Mrs. Fiorina.

He went on for nearly two pages about Rubio: \"his youth and vigor.... his unmatched ability to articulate a public argument.... the best explainer of conservatism in public life today.\" What makes Singer's email noteworthy is its author. Singer was the Republicans' top individual donor in the 2014 elections, giving $11.5 million, based on federal data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. A cornerstone of Wall Street conservatism, he founded the cautious and successful hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. So far this year, the Federal Election Commission has logged $3.4 million in Singer money. He's given to dozens of congressional campaigns, plus $250,000 to Future 45, a new anti-Clinton superPAC, and another $250,000 to the opposition-research superPAC America Rising. Most notably, Singer this year has sent more than $1 million to American Unity PAC, which he established three years ago as a pioneering voice among conservatives for LBGT rights. But there's something he hasn't done, nor have many other top donors. He hasn't started pumping money into the superPAC of a chosen presidential contender. Now, however, the crowded field of candidates has begun to thin out, and the Iowa caucuses are less than three months away. Singer's endorsement of Rubio may mark the awakening of the upper-echelon donor class. \"Paul Singer is a real opinion leader,\" said Darrell West of the Brookings Institution, author of the book Billionaires. \"He's someone with lots of political experience. People respect him within Republican circles. He's been very active.\" And he has that email list, reaching others in the Republican establishment. Singer declined to comment for this story. But his move isn't a complete surprise. Last April he gave Rubio's campaign committee $2,700, the legal limit for the primaries. Other top donors from the 2014 cycle have also given small sums to presidential candidates. Marlene Ricketts, wife of Joe Ricketts, founder of AmeriTrade, gave $4.9 millon to a superPAC for Scott Walker, who has since withdrawn. Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam have written checks to Lindsey Graham and Rubio, plus an earlier PAC for Rubio \u2013 just over $20,000 in all. Their totals from the last presidential race, in 2012, give a hint of what might come: The Adelsons gave $93 million, mainly to the superPAC backing Newt Gingrich's White House bid, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Joe and Marlene Ricketts gave $13 million. Singer's more cautious giving totaled $3.7 million.\n", "byline": "", "description": "Billionaire Paul Signer, who spent $11.5 million in 2014, has endorsed Rubio.

When an audience member complimented Bush's father, President George H.W. Bush, the candidate remarked \"If I could have all of the people that love my dad and I could have half of the people who don't like me, I'd probably come out ahead on that pretty good.\" He described his opponents in the race not by name, but as \"the big personalities on the stage\" who \"think they have it all figured out\" when it comes to the nation's problems.

Easley/AP\n            \n        \n\n\n\nConservatives across the country issued a stinging rebuke to President Obama and the Democratic Party Tuesday night. In Kentucky, Republicans notched huge wins for governor and other statewide offices. In a race most believed leaned slightly to the Democrats, Tea Party favorite Matt Bevin pulled off the surprise easy victory despite several missteps. His win gives the Bluegrass State only its second Republican governor in the past 40 years. But the blowback didn't stop there. In Houston, voters repealed a law to protect gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination with the slogan \u2014 \"No men in women's bathrooms.\" In Ohio, they rejected a referendum to legalize marijuana in the state. And in Virginia, despite millions in ads pushing gun-control measures, Democrats still failed to take back the state Senate. The results cap off yet another disappointing election cycle for Democrats ever since President Obama entered the White House. While they've managed to construct a strong coalition in presidential years, it's conservatives who have been more motivated to turn out to the polls during both midterm and off-year elections. Since 2010, Democrats have lost control of both the House and Senate. A dozen governorships have turned from blue to red, along with many state legislative chambers. Democrats have especially suffered Obama drag in the South. Even moderate, Blue Dog Democrats couldn't survive: the last white Southern Democrat in the House lost last year, and Republicans flipped four Senate seats in the region last year. The troubling sign for Democrats is that Tuesday's rebuke didn't simply come from the South \u2014 it was against liberal policies in more Democratic-friendly areas like Ohio and Houston. Here's a rundown of what happened on Election Night. Kentucky The victory of Bevin \u2014 a man despised just a year ago by the GOP establishment in the state after he tried to unseat Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the primary \u2014 shows Democrats' grip on their last remaining stronghold in the South has disappeared. Democrats had still managed to cling to the Bluegrass State, and polls even showed that Attorney General Jack Conway had the edge going into Election Day. He had hoped to ride the coattails of popular term-limited Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear and the state's successful Obamacare exchange \"Kynect\" to victory. \n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n            Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jack Conway thanks his supporters during a concession speech at the Kentucky Democratic Party election night watch party at the Frankfort Convention Center on Tuesday.\n            \n            \n                \n                David Stephenson/AP\n                \n            \nhide caption\n\n\nitoggle caption\n\n        \n        David Stephenson/AP\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial candidate Jack Conway thanks his supporters during a concession speech at the Kentucky Democratic Party election night watch party at the Frankfort Convention Center on Tuesday.\n\n            \n            David Stephenson/AP\n            \n        \n\n\n\nBut the anti-Obama tide proved be too much. The Republican Governors Association spent $2.5 million in the final weeks, mostly on ads and mailers tying Conway to Obama. Though local Democrats hoped voters would be able to differentiate state races from national ones, in Kentucky Tuesday they did not. The victory came despite poor reviews for Bevin on the trail and Democrats' arguments that he was too far right for the state. Democrats tried to spin the venture capitalist's win, somewhat bizarrely arguing that Conway \"ran into the unexpected headwinds of Trump-mania, losing to an outsider candidate in the Year of the Outsider.\" The loss had other reverberations, too \u2014 state Auditor Adam Edelen, who was seen as a possible challenger to Sen. Rand Paul next year \u2014 lost his reelection bid. Bevin's win also puts the future of Kynect, the state's successful health care exchange, up in the air. As NBC's Perry Bacon noted, Bevin has said he would get rid of the exchange program, which could leave thousands without insurance coverage, but he's softened his stance on allowing Medicare expansion in the state. Houston Social conservatives were successful in repealing an anti-LGBT discrimination bill with a simple slogan: \"No Men In Women's Bathrooms.\" The bill extended to far more than which bathroom transgender persons could use, also protecting them from employment discrimination and housing bias, among other civil rights protections and is similar to many other measures across the country. The bill's rejection is a blow to Mayor Annise Parker, who became the first openly gay mayor of a major city when she won in 2009. Parker rallied celebrities and corporations to her side, like Apple and actress Sally Field. But opponents, who branded it the \"bathroom bill\" framed their argument as one of child safety, said it would enable sexual predators. With the backing of the faith community, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and even a former Houston Astros star, the groups opposing it ran an effective campaign with persuasive ads like this one: \n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\nThe law's repeal could have other reverberations \u2014 the Super Bowl is scheduled to be in Houston in 2017. \"I don't think it's the straw that creates the imbalance where you don't get a Super Bowl or lose a Super Bowl, but it's definitely part of the equation when people make decisions,\" Ric Campo, who is chairing the city's Super Bowl host committee, told the New York Times. To that, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is against the law, said, per the Times, \"If Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner, 'would even suggest that the Super Bowl not be played here because we don't want men in ladies' bathrooms, then we need a new commissioner.'\" Ohio \n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n            Buddie, the mascot for the pro-marijuana legalization group ResponsibleOhio, waits on a sidewalk to greet passing college students during a promotional tour bus at Miami University of Ohio last month.\n            \n            \n                \n                John Minchillo/AP\n                \n            \nhide caption\n\n\nitoggle caption\n\n        \n        John Minchillo/AP\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuddie, the mascot for the pro-marijuana legalization group ResponsibleOhio, waits on a sidewalk to greet passing college students during a promotional tour bus at Miami University of Ohio last month.\n\n            \n            John Minchillo/AP\n            \n        \n\n\n\nA statewide referendum to legalize recreational and medical marijuana overwhelmingly failed in Ohio. Advocates had launched a $20 million campaign in favor of its passage, including the creation of \"Buddie\" the marijuana mascot. The subsequent marijuana farms the measure would have produced would have been big windfalls for its backers, including former 98 Degrees frontman Nick Lachey. Opponents, however, successfully framed it as a danger to families and children. \"At a time when too many families are being torn apart by drug abuse, Ohioans said no to easy access to drugs and instead chose a path that helps strengthen our families and communities,\" Republican Gov. John Kasich, a presidential candidate, said in a statement. Virginia Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe's push to turn the state Senate blue was dashed Tuesday, despite crisscrossing the commonwealth for nearly the past month and a heavy push from outside groups over gun control. Instead, Republicans' slim one-vote advantage held in the upper chamber. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's gun-control group put $2.3 million into the state, running ads hitting two Republican candidates over the issue just weeks after two reporters had been gunned down on live TV at a Roanoke, Va., station. The National Rifle Association and other groups pushed back with their own ads. It's a blow to the progressive agenda McAuliffe, who was elected in 2013, wants to push through on education, Medicaid expansion and more. But it would have also helped his push to deliver the critical swing state for his longtime friend and close ally Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race, if she emerges as the nominee.\n", "byline": "", "description": "A Republican will be governor of Kentucky for only the second time in 40 years.

{"body": "LONDON \u2014 Accused of French-bashing, the Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush apologized this week for making fun of France\u2019s work ethic, saying he was sorry for insulting America\u2019s oldest ally.\n\n\u201cI made the mistake of saying that the Congress operates on a French workweek,\u201d Mr. Bush was quoted as saying by Time magazine, with jovial flourish. \u201cI really did a disservice to the French.\u201d\n\nDuring the Republican presidential debate last week, Mr. Bush, former governor of Florida, sought to pour scorn on his opponent Marco Rubio\u2019s attendance record in the Senate by comparing it with the perceived idleness of the French. \u201cI mean, literally, the Senate, what is it, like a French workweek? You get like three days where you have to show up?\u201d Mr. Bush asked.\n\nThe assault, a seemingly well-rehearsed line that fell flat both at home and in France, stirred a backlash, with more than a few irate French people taking to social media to mock Mr. Bush\u2019s lack of diplomacy. Moreover, some critics, including France\u2019s ambassador to Washington, G\u00e9rard Araud, noted that Mr. Bush had muddled his facts.\n\n\u201cA French work week of 3 days? No but a pregnancy paid leave of 16 weeks yes! And proud of it,\u201d Mr. Araud wrote on Twitter, with Gallic defiance.\n\nIndeed, despite having a 35-hour week, in practice the French are far from lazy. Full-time French workers last year put in an average of 38.9 hours a week, compared with the eurozone average of 39.6 hours a week, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nAt the same time, French labor productivity is sufficiently robust that The Economist recently noted that \u201cThe French could take Friday off and still produce more than Britons do in a week.\u201d\n\nMr. Bush, who has been seeking to revive his flagging candidacy and this week unveiled a new campaign slogan, \u201cJeb can fix it,\u201d sought to mollify France, the first ally of the United States, which, historians note, provided essential military help during the American Revolutionary War.\n\n\u201cI now know that the average French workweek is actually greater than the German workweek,\u201d Mr. Bush was quoted as saying by Time magazine. \u201cSo, my God, I totally insulted an entire country \u2014 our first ally, that helped us become free as a nation. And I apologize.\u201d\n\nMr. Araud, for his part, appeared willing to accept the apology, called a mea culpa by Le Monde, the French newspaper.\n\n\u201cEverything is forgotten and forgiven,\u201d Mr. Araud wrote on Twitter, adding: \u201cErrare humanum.\u201d", "byline": "DAN BILEFSKY", "description": "The Republican presidential candidate said he \u201cmade a mistake\u201d by citing the French workweek in criticizing Marco Rubio\u2019s Senate attendance record.", "title": "Jeb Bush Apologizes to France for Workweek Remark in Debate", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/world/europe/jeb-bush-france-apology.html", "topics": ["economy", "jobs/employment"], "people": ["Marco Rubio", "Jeb Bush"], "orgs": ["Senate", "The Economist", "Congress", "Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development"], "election_confidence": 0.6713882540488033, "authors": [{"author_id": 251, "fullname": "dan bilefsky", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-11-04 20:54:12", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "5cb2289d3df8600346499265205e5e2f", "date_access": "2015-11-04 21:38:11.807994"},

{"body": "When Ted Cruz announced his run for the presidency, the big question was whether he had only a small chance to win or no chance at all. Since then, a lot has gone right for him.\n\nMr. Cruz still does not enjoy an easy road to the Republican nomination, not by any means. But it is a testament to just how strange this year has been that a candidate like him, who is despised by many of his own Republican colleagues in the Senate, now has a plausible path to the Republican nomination.\n\nSome of his opportunity is the result of his own strength. He has succeeded in building a robust campaign organization, buoyed by fund-raising tallies of the sort we generally haven\u2019t seen from anti-establishment, conservative candidates. Fund-raising isn\u2019t everything, but it\u2019s a big part of why candidates like Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum have not been serious contenders this time.\n\nA lot of Mr. Cruz\u2019s opening, however, reflects the weakness of his rivals, not his strength. Few would have guessed, for instance, that his solid but hardly astonishing $26 million in official campaign contributions (not counting outside groups) would be more than Jeb Bush\u2019s total. By comparison, George W. Bush raised more than both candidates combined by this point 16 years ago (when a dollar was worth more). Back in the summer, I certainly would not have guessed that the combined support for Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker \u2014 Mr. Walker is now out of the race \u2014 would add up to just 16 percent in national polls, with three months to go before Iowa.\n\nThe candidates who are faring well in the polls \u2014 Ben Carson and Donald Trump \u2014 are also good news for Mr. Cruz. In just about any other year, Mr. Cruz would be the worst-case scenario for the party\u2019s establishment. But compared with the likes of Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson, he seems reasonable and conventional. That might let him become a candidate the party could grudgingly accept. His debate performances, especially the one last week, have only helped in this regard.\n\nMr. Cruz hasn\u2019t been faring particularly well in the polls, but there is a path forward. Even when he seemed to have little or no chance nationally, it was still clear that he could do well in Iowa, a state where nearly half of the Republican electorate is \u201cvery conservative,\u201d according to the exit polls. He doesn\u2019t lead there now, but the caucus is still three months off, and he has a large and untapped war chest. Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson might fade, which could help if a disproportionate share of their anti-establishment support goes his way.\n\nIf Mr. Cruz finishes well in Iowa, it won\u2019t be hard to envision a serious run for the nomination. He could follow up a win in Iowa with strength in South Carolina and particularly Nevada, another caucus state where half of the G.O.P. electorate is \u201cvery conservative.\u201d Soon after come the predominantly Southern states on Super Tuesday, where very conservative voters represent a larger share of the primary electorate than any other region of the country.\n\nIf Mr. Cruz is the only elected official who amasses many delegates by that point \u2014 which seems plausible \u2014 he will be in a good position to outmuscle relatively weak establishment candidates, particularly if those candidates prove to have fairly narrow appeal themselves, like Jeb Bush, Chris Christie or John Kasich.\n\nFor instance, if Mr. Cruz had run in 2012 and run with this strength, he might have had a real shot at defeating Mitt Romney, who struggled against underfunded opposition because of protracted resistance from the religious right. Of course, Mr. Cruz would ultimately need to broaden his appeal beyond his base of \u201cvery conservative\u201d voters in the face of considerable resistance from party elites, hardly a sure thing, especially if Mr. Rubio continues to consolidate their support.\n\nBut in recent weeks, it has almost become a clich\u00e9 to suggest that Mr. Cruz is going to win the \u201cgrass-roots\u201d half of the G.O.P. primary once Ben Carson and Donald Trump fade, and that Mr. Cruz will then have a real shot to win.\n\nThis theory assumes, though, that Mr. Cruz could become the sole candidate of the right. Mr. Carson and Mr. Trump aren\u2019t at all assured to fade. Even if they did, there isn\u2019t much reason to think Mr. Cruz would gain the preponderance of their support.\n\nThe conservative wing of the G.O.P. is deceptively diverse, and the appeal of Mr. Carson and Mr. Trump comes from a lot more than their adherence to conservative doctrine. Their appeal is in part about identity politics, and they often draw from wings of the conservative base \u2014 populist, anti-immigrant, the religious right \u2014 that aren\u2019t always unbending or ideological on other issues.\n\nMr. Cruz is different. He draws from voters motivated by ideology more than identity. Mr. Carson and Mr. Trump, for instance, tend to win at least 20 percent of self-identified moderate voters, but Mr. Cruz had the support of just 1 percent of moderate voters in a recent Iowa poll.\n\nThe diverse support of the various outsider candidates makes it tough to assume that supporters of Mr. Trump or Mr. Carson would shift to Mr. Cruz en masse. There\u2019s little evidence that he\u2019s their second choice. As two Yale professors wrote last week, there is even data that a sizable share of people favoring Mr. Trump or Mr. Carson have Mr. Bush or Mr. Rubio as their second choice.\n\nThe diversity of the G.O.P. base also helps explain how anti-establishment candidates like Mr. Carson, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump have all coexisted in drawing their support, how Mr. Carson has surged to the top of the polls without detracting much from Mr. Trump\u2019s share of the vote, or how both have risen without any decline in Mr. Cruz\u2019s support. And it makes it easier to imagine how the three could survive into Super Tuesday and beyond, sustained by unusually strong name recognition, considerable resources and distinct bases of support.", "byline": "NATE COHN", "description": "A victory in Iowa, which is plausible, could help him emerge as the sole leader of a conservative wing that is flexing its muscles this cycle.", "title": "Road to 2016: Ted Cruz Has a Chance to Win.

{"body": "Donald J. Trump is buying radio air time in three early states, his campaign manager confirmed, marking the billionaire candidate\u2019s first foray into paid advertising since he began his presidential campaign in June. \n\nThe 60-second radio ads will run in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina over the next two weeks, said Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager.\n\nThe ads are not expected to feature attacks on any of Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals, despite his penchant for such criticism in interviews and stump speeches. \n\nAnd they are not television ads, which are substantially more expensive than radio spots. Those are the types of ads that some political watchers assumed Mr. Trump was referring to when he told Fox News on Tuesday evening that he planned to begin small advertising buys in early states over the coming days. \n\nThe purchase for a week of radio ads usually costs only several thousands of dollars, as opposed to the hundreds of thousands of dollars that television spots could cost a campaign to air at this point in the race. \n\nMr. Trump is making the move after seeing his poll numbers begin to sag in Iowa and nationally, although he has maintained his lead in recent public polls in New Hampshire. \n\nPundits and people who have long been involved with national races have been skeptical about whether Mr. Trump would ultimately spend his own money on advertisements to try to regain his lead. Mr. Trump has ridden a wave of so-called earned media, meaning all of his television publicity so far has come at no cost to him. \n\nIt remains to be seen whether Mr. Trump will buy television air time, although his aides have insisted he is prepared to do so.

{"body": "Donald J. Trump has appeared unconcerned with the possibility of angering Latinos since declaring during the announcement of his presidential campaign in June that Mexico was sending rapists to the United States.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, in an event organized by the League of United Latin American Citizens, about two dozen protesters gathered behind metal barricades opposite NBC headquarters at Rockefeller Center in New York to demand that the network rescind an invitation that Mr. Trump had accepted to host \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d this week.  \n\nThere were claps and chants of \u201cDump Trump\u201d and \u201cFight back.\u201d There were placards reading \u201cSNL stop the hate.\u201d There were people dressed in costume, including a man appearing as a cartoon-style plutocrat, replete with a black top hat and a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 mask featuring eyeballs emblazoned with dollar signs.\n\nAmong the protesters was Juan Sanchez, 45, a translator from Midtown Manhattan, who said that he believed that Mr. Trump, racial views aside, might be driven by ego.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all \u2018I do, I do, me, me, me, myself, myself,\u2019\u200a\u201d Mr. Sanchez said, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think America deserves that kind of leadership.\u201d\n\nHope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, declined to comment on Wednesday evening about the protest.\n\nXiomara Santos, 20, said she had come to New York to join the demonstration from Washington, where she is an intern with the League of United Latin American Citizens. Mr. Trump seemed most interested in spreading negativity, she said, and it would therefore be a bad idea for NBC to provide him with yet another platform.\n\nAsked who she supported for president, Ms. Santos said quickly that she was a fan of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, adding, \u201cHe seems more truthful than all the other candidates.\n\nDoes that mean that Mr. Trump was being less than truthful when he made his inflammatory statements?\n\nIf Mr. Trump believed what he said, \u201che is a racist,\u201d Ms. Santos said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a publicity stunt, he\u2019s just destructive.\u201d\n\nNearby, Nicola DeMarco 57, from Riverdale, in the Bronx, held aloft an illustration he had drawn of Mr. Trump with his lips pursed as if whistling and featuring his trademark haircut.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see people rounded up and deported,\u201d Mr. DeMarco said, referring to a proposal of Mr. Trump. \u201cWhat he\u2019s proposing is right out of the Nazi playbook; these are Mussolini tactics, to rile up people.\u201d\n\nAround 6:30 p.m. several protesters walked slowly across West 49th Street holding a cardboard box that they said contained a flash drive bearing 522,080 signatures to a petition demanding that NBC revoke Mr. Trump\u2019s invitation. The chants stopped briefly as Juan Escalante, a member of an immigration reform group called America\u2019s Voice, was permitted to enter the Rockefeller Center lobby to deliver the cardboard box to \u201csomeone named Adam.\u201d Then, as he emerged from the lobby, the chants resumed.", "byline": "COLIN MOYNIHAN", "description": "In an event organized by the League of United Latin American Citizens, about two dozen protesters demanded that NBC rescind an invitation that Mr. Trump had accepted to host the show this week.", "title": "First Draft: Donald Trump\u2019s Scheduled Appearance on \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 Draws Protest", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/04/donald-trumps-scheduled-appearance-on-saturday-night-live-draws-protest/", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Bernie Sanders", "Hope Hicks", "Donald J.

But this time, he took the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d hosts along for the ride.\nPutting on his media critic hat, the Nevada Democrat mocked Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski for what he sarcastically called a \u201creally tough\u201d interview with the billionaire brothers earlier this week on their popular MSNBC morning talk show. \nStory Continued Below\nAs he launched his anti-Koch broadside, Reid read excerpts of the brothers\u2019 \u201cMorning Joe\u201d interview on the Senate floor -- including Scarborough\u2019s inquiry on whether the Kochs got their \u201cgraciousness\u201d in philanthropy from their mother, or Brzezinski asking them who was the better brother. \nThe \"Morning Joe\" hosts did press the Kochs on more substantive issues, such as whether it was fair for a relatively small number of wealthy families to have contributed an overwhelming amount of the campaign cash in the 2016 race, according to a recent New York Times report. Still, Reid noted: \u201cSometimes, most of the time there weren\u2019t even questions. There were just compliments.\u201d \n\u201cWow. Those were some really tough questions asked by the host of \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d That\u2019s sufficient journalism,\u201d Reid said Wednesday morning from the Senate floor. \u201cThose questions are so easy, they may even qualify them to moderate the next Republican presidential debate.\u201d\nReid had previously criticized how last week\u2019s CNBC GOP debate was conducted; in an interview with POLITICO last week, the minority leader observed that \u201cthere was no control\u201d and that it was a \u201cvery, very poorly run debate.\u201d But he also added that Republican candidates attacked the moderators because they didn\u2019t like the type of questions being asked. \nOn Wednesday, Reid broadened his criticisms of journalists beyond the MSNBC interview, arguing that the Kochs have \u201cprocured a media that is intimidated by their billions, too intimidated to hold them accountable.\u201d\n\u201cWe should be working to rid the system of the Koch brothers\u2019 dark money, but this cannot and will not happen if reporters and journalists refuse to ask Charles and David Koch questions, maybe even probing questions,\u201d Reid said. \u201cOtherwise, no one is holding these two oil barons accountable for their nefarious actions.\"\nIn a pointed response, Scarborough said Reid is \"blinded\" by hatred. \n\"It is easy to understand why Harry Reid is enraged by the kind of thoughtful discussions we have with our Democratic and Republican guests on Morning Joe. It was Reid, after all, who brought shame to the Senate floor last year by quoting Joseph McCarthy and calling his political opponents \u2018un-American,'\" Scarborough said in a statement. \"If Harry Reid were not so blinded by hatred toward Charles Koch, he would have noticed that Koch harshly criticized Republicans for supporting corporate welfare, called George W. Bush a failed president for running up massive deficits and reckless wars, and said that he was unimpressed with the field of Republican presidential candidates. In fact, he saved his harshest criticisms for Republicans he once supported.\"\nScarborough went on to say that Reid's strategy attacking the Kochs led to the Democrats losing their majority in 2014. \n\"Reid's unbridled rage toward the Kochs led to a failed electoral strategy that cost Democrats their majority in 2014. I can understand why he remains so bitter to this day. Thankfully, with Chuck Schumer, the Democrats will have a tough leader who can respectfully disagree with his opponents without being consumed by anger and stooping to McCarthy-type tactics,\" he said.\n\nHadas Gold is a reporter at\u00a0Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Joe Scarborough responds that the Senate minority leader is 'blinded by hatred.'", "title": "Reid mocks &apos;Morning Joe&apos; interview of Kochs", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/harry-reid-koch-brothers-215510", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Ben Smith", "Lauren Gardner", "Erin Mershon", "Joe Scarborough", "Hadas Gold", "Paul Demko", "Austin Wright", "Lauren French", "Janet Yellen", "Simon Says", "Charles Koch", "Bob Corker", "Mick Mulvaney", "Harry Reid", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Jeremy Herb", "Theodoric Meyer", "Mark Perry", "Caitlin Emma", "Josh Gerstein", "Nick Gass", "Roger Simon", "Bernie Becker", "Mika Brzezinski", "Jeb Bush", "Seung Min Kim", "Jeanne Shaheen", "Donald Trump", "John Bresnahan", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Paul Ryan", "Megyn Kelly", "Tim Starks", "Gary Cohn", "Adam Behsudi", "Tony Romm", "Laura Bush", "Daniel Strauss", "Heather Caygle", "Rachana Pradhan", "David Koch", "Chuck Schumer", "Ben White", "George W.

Jeff Flake and John McCain\u2019s investigation has prompted the National Football League to examine all of its contracts with the Department of Defense. | Getty\n\n            By \nBurgess Everett\n\n11/04/15 11:45 AM EST\nContracts between the Pentagon and pro sports teams intended to boost military recruiting and honor service members lack adequate oversight and cost the government more than $10 million over the past four years, according to a new report from Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake.\nIn the hopes of ending what they view as \u201cpaid patriotism\u201d that benefits wealthy sports leagues at the expense of taxpayers, the two Arizona Republicans\u2019 investigation has prompted the National Football League to examine all of its contracts with the Department of Defense. And though the NFL has a newly instituted ban on such deals and the Pentagon is discontinuing the practice of paying for patriotic displays at games and events, the senators say there is far more work to do.\nStory Continued Below\nThe senators charge that the Defense Department's response to their investigation fell short of fixing the problem, and they suggest the department is at the very least unaware of the sprawling number of deals there are with various multi-billion dollar sports leagues. The senators found 122 contracts worth $10.4 million spent over four years, but the department only included 62 percent of those marketing and advertising contracts with the five major sports leagues in correspondence delivered to the GOP investigators.\nFlake and McCain say there's far more to this story. \n\u201cDirect and persistent sunlight is the best way to ensure that such activities are not continued,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cTaxpayers \u2014 not the teams \u2014 paid for patriotism and VIP perks. It is time to allow major sports teams\u2019 legitimate tributes to our soldiers to shine with national pride rather than being cast under the pallor of marketing gimmicks paid for by American taxpayers.\u201d\n\nCongress\n\n            By \nRachael Bade\n\nThe report lists dozens of examples of spending deals between the Pentagon and pro sports leagues, a list that lands just a month before negotiators must seal a year-end spending deal and could find the leagues again under fire given intense public interest in the contracts. In a policy bill earlier this year, senators voted to ban spending taxpayer dollars on honor ceremonies for veterans and active military after national media picked up Flake's concern about \"paid patriotism.\" \nIn the report unveiled Wednesday, the two senators cataloged $879,000 spent by the Georgia Army National Guard with the Atlanta Falcons on color-guard performances and video board tributes and $450,000 spent by the same unit on the Atlanta Braves. Beyond Atlanta, investigators say the Defense Department paid the Seattle Sounders soccer team $128,000 over the past four years on \u201ca compelling Army National Guard public service message\u201d to be played at games and $115,000 spent was spent on the Indiana Pacers for perks including parking passes and access to a luxury conference room. College sports programs and NASCAR were also dinged by Flake and McCain, along with the NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and MLS. \nBut the bulk of the spending was associated with the NFL, where four teams received more than $500,000 a piece over the past four years from Defense Department contracts. That revelation has NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell scrubbing the league\u2019s books to make sure they withstand scrutiny. \n\u201cWe are conducting an audit of all contracts between our clubs and the military service branches or state National Guard units. If we find that inappropriate payments were made, they will be refunded in full. We will share the results of this review with you,\u201d Goodell wrote to the senators on Monday. He advised them to call him personally if they have further concerns. \nFlake began digging into the \u201cpaid patriotism\u201d contracts in May, prompting the Pentagon and NFL to begin investigating the practice and officially separate advertising and marketing from military appreciation this summer. And the Arizona conservative is prepping a new flurry of investigations for the end of the year: He is assuming the budget-cutting mantle of Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) by taking over the annual \u201cWastebook,\u201d a document viewed by many on the right as a blueprint for which wasteful spending to tackle next. \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Report: Pentagon spent millions on &apos;paid patriotism&apos; with pro sports leagues", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/pentagon-contracts-sports-teams-215508", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Ben Smith", "Lauren Gardner", "Erin Mershon", "Hadas Gold", "Tom Coburn", "Paul Demko", "Austin Wright", "Lauren French", "Janet Yellen", "Simon Says", "Bob Corker", "Mick Mulvaney", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Jeremy Herb", "Roger Goodell", "Theodoric Meyer", "Mark Perry", "Caitlin Emma", "Darius Tahir", "Jeff Flake", "Shane Goldmacher", "Nick Gass", "Roger Simon", "Bernie Becker", "Jeb Bush", "Jeanne Shaheen", "Donald Trump", "Eliza Collins", "Chase Purdy", "Megyn Kelly", "Tim Starks", "Rachael Bade", "Gary Cohn", "Adam Behsudi", "Tony Romm", "Laura Bush", "Daniel Strauss", "Heather Caygle", "Ronald Reagan", "Rachana Pradhan", "Ben White", "Eric Wolff", "Matt Bevin"], "orgs": ["Department of Defense", "MLB", "NHTSA", "Defense Department", "Congress", "National Guard", "Senate", "NHL", "NFL", "Atlanta Braves", "Acela", "NASCAR", "AUMF", "Freedom Caucus", "College", "NBA", "Pentagon", "GOP"], "election_confidence": 0.9890804245064907, "authors": [{"author_id": 31434, "fullname": "austin wright", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-04 16:45:01", "org": "politico", "article_id": "446b5e1c9db4bea74b2bd156cb930981", "date_access": "2015-11-04 17:00:08.597819"},

The network will be basing the decision on polling that has been released by the end of Wednesday.\nCandidates who score 2.5 percent or higher in an average of the four most recent national polls conducted through Nov. 4 will be invited to the main debate stage on Nov. 10, which will last two hours starting at 9 p.m. ET.\nTo qualify for the undercard debate stage, candidates must score at least 1 percent in one of four most recent national polls conducted through Nov. 4, as recognized by Fox Business.\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\nAt the start of the call, several participants said, the conference call host did a roll call to see which campaigns were present. All Republican campaigns said they were on \u2013 except for Marco Rubio\u2019s.\nThat prompted a crack from a representative for back-of-the-pack candidate Jim Gilmore that Gilmore would be more than happy to take Rubio\u2019s place onstage. (A Rubio staffer signed on to the call later.) Gilmore has failed to reach 1 percent in recent national polls and failed to qualify for the past two undercard debates. \nHadas Gold contributed to this report.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Fox Business Network will announce which candidates make the cut at 7 p.m. Thursday.", "title": "Who will take the main stage in the next GOP debate?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2015/11/fox-business-network-gop-debate-stage-215531", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Lauren Gardner", "Erin Mershon", "Joe Scarborough", "Jim Risch", "Mike Huckabee", "Hadas Gold", "Paul Demko", "Austin Wright", "Tim Starks", "Chris Christie", "Harry Reid", "Brian Mahoney", "Theodoric Meyer", "Josh Gerstein", "Caitlin Emma", "Chase Purdy", "Nick Gass", "Bernie Becker", "Jeb Bush", "Mika Brzezinski", "Alex Isenstadt", "Seung Min Kim", "Jeanne Shaheen", "Donald Trump", "John Bresnahan", "Marco Rubio", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Barney Frank", "Megyn Kelly", "David Makovsky", "Pat Tiberi", "Adam Behsudi", "Tony Romm", "Heather Caygle", "Daniel Strauss", "Lou Dobbs", "Rachana Pradhan", "Jim Gilmore", "Eric Wolff", "Darius Tahir", "Matt Bevin", "Paul Ryan"], "orgs": ["NHTSA", "Senate", "NFL", "Microsoft Outlook", "Clinton Health Access Initiative", "Freedom Caucus", "MSNBC", "Pentagon"], "election_confidence": 0.9745457603347895, "authors": [{"author_id": 30849, "fullname": "seung min kim", "primary_org": "politico"}, {"author_id": 30731, "fullname": "hadas gold", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-04 21:58:58", "org": "politico", "article_id": "4d5932bb320b5e9c9105195041f3be45", "date_access": "2015-11-04 22:49:28.362665"},

But it is a high-stakes test of Rubio's ability to control the story about his ability to manage money now that he's on a national stage and is emerging as the establishment-friendly Republican to beat in the presidential race.\nStory Continued Below\nSo far, Rubio has successfully batted away the probing questions from media, presenting himself as the son of immigrants who never enjoyed a silver spoon and has often barely scraped by as he made his way through law school and then up the food chain of Florida politics.\n\"I think it would be good for this country to have a president that knows what it feels like to have your house lose its value because of irresponsible and reckless behavior by Fannie and Freddie, by the Federal Reserve,\" Rubio said on Fox News' \"America's Newsroom\" on Wednesday morning. \"I think it would be good for this country to have a president who knows what it\u2019s like to owe money in student loans like I once did, someone who grew up paycheck to paycheck.\"\nIt was a line that echoed his defense from last week's GOP debate, during which he faced a series of harsh questions from CNBC's Becky quick about accidentally mingling campaign and personal money, facing foreclosure on a second home, and liquidating a $68,000 retirement fund \u2014 all data points that Quick said \"raises the question whether you have the maturity and the wisdom to lead this $17 trillion economy.\"\nRubio was prepared, dismissing the questions as an echo of \"discredited attacks\" and then sharing his up-by-bootstraps story.\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\nBut rivals are sharpening the knives. Donald Trump, while debuting his new book on Tuesday, shifted from attacking Rubio's sweating (\"Putin's going to look at him and say, 'What the hell is wrong with this guy?'\") to his money-handling skills. \"For years, I\u2019ve been hearing that his credit cards are a disaster,\" the billionaire businessman said, also panning Rubio as \"overrated.\"\nRubio for years has faced questions about his shabby finances, from his money pit of a rental home in Tallahassee to his $80,000 fishing boat to his heavy student loan debt. But none of his money woes have caused him as much headache \u2014 and come with as much risk \u2014 as his use of a credit card reimbursed by the Republican Party of Florida.\nRubio has admitted putting personal expenses on the card, but has attempted to explain them as simple oversights, including a $10,000, four-day family reunion (Rubio has said the travel agent used the wrong card) and repairs for his family minivan (the vehicle was damaged at a political function). He has insisted he did nothing improper, and in 2012 the Florida state ethics commission cleared him.\nWhile the controversy over the card was aired during Rubio's Senate run in 2010, not everything is public yet. Two years of credit card transactions from Rubio's time in the Florida House have not been disclosed, and Rubio's camp promises they'll be released soon. \u201cWe have always planned to release them. Marco is running for president and has nothing to hide,\u201d said Rubio strategist Todd Harris.\nRubio's also in a different league now. With a large and unruly Republican primary field, there's plenty of opposition research flying around, and Rubio is a prime target, especially after delivering a strong performance at last week's debate and securing some choice endorsements from the likes of mega donor Paul Singer.\nAlso, people from Rubio's past are willing to talk about his past financial troubles.\nChris Ingram, a Republican strategist in Florida who informally advised Rubio briefly during his Senate campaign and is now a vocal opponent of the Florida senator, said he had pushed Rubio to disclose more about his personal credit card purchases, but was rebuffed.\n\nCongress\n\n            By \nRachael Bade\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very well spoken, has a gifted silver tongue\u2026when you actually dissect what he says and start to connect the dots it doesn\u2019t add up,\u201d Ingram said.\nAnd Rubio's rivals show no signs of letting up. Even the campaign of Jeb Bush, Rubio's former Florida mentor who endorsed his Senate bid after the credit card issues came to light, has been pushing the line that Rubio is a \"risky bet\" because of his finances.\nIn a 112-page internal document that was leaked to U.S. News & Word Report, Bush's campaign listed the reasons why Rubio is a vulnerable candidate, bullet pointing his \"misuse of state party credit cards.\" Bush, for his part, contends he didn't see the document before it leaked.\nBut some see a silver lining in the attacks.\nJoe Culotta, Florida-based communications consultant who has worked for several political campaigns and committees and helped Rubio get elected to the Senate through work with the College Republican National Committee, said he thinks the attacks prove Rubio\u2019s electability. \n\u201cThe attacks on Senator Rubio is basic politics 101. When your poll numbers are slipping and your opponent\u2019s are rising, you have to say and do whatever it takes to bring that person down,\" Culotta said. \u201cThese are the same attacks that were used against him in 2010, which means his responses will be the same, the only difference is that the spotlight is bigger since he\u2019s now running for president.\u201d\nMarc Caputo and Nick Gass contributed to this report.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The Florida senator has brushed off attacks about his money management before, but he's now in a bigger and heavier-hitting league.", "title": "Rubio fights back to defend financial past", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/marco-rubio-defends-financial-past-215521", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Ben Smith", "Lauren Gardner", "Erin Mershon", "Joe Scarborough", "Hadas Gold", "Vladimir Putin", "Paul Demko", "Austin Wright", "Lauren French", "Janet Yellen", "Paul Singer", "Bob Corker", "Marc Caputo", "Mick Mulvaney", "Harry Reid", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Jeremy Herb", "Theodoric Meyer", "Mark Perry", "Josh Gerstein", "Caitlin Emma", "Nick Gass", "Bernie Becker", "Mika Brzezinski", "Jeb Bush", "Seung Min Kim", "Jeanne Shaheen", "Donald Trump", "John Bresnahan", "Marco Rubio", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Paul Ryan", "Megyn Kelly", "David Makovsky", "Tim Starks", "Rachael Bade", "Todd Harris", "Gary Cohn", "Adam Behsudi", "Tony Romm", "Laura Bush", "Heather Caygle", "Daniel Strauss", "Rachana Pradhan", "Ben White", "Eric Wolff", "Darius Tahir", "Matt Bevin", "Chase Purdy"], "orgs": ["CNBC", "NHTSA", "Federal Reserve", "Congress", "Senate", "Republican Party of Florida", "NFL", "Acela", "AUMF", "Freedom Caucus", "Clinton Health Access Initiative", "College Republican National Committee", "MSNBC", "Pentagon", "GOP"], "election_confidence": 0.9981557569395011, "authors": [{"author_id": 31434, "fullname": "austin wright", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-04 20:14:28", "org": "politico", "article_id": "618f30f54102983f70f8b031028ed5bf", "date_access": "2015-11-04 20:46:24.895945"},

This slowed down S/ES-S searches for other requests and further prevented it from starting on the email searches tor Request A,\" Degnan wrote.\nRequest A is a FOIA request AP reporter Robert Burns submitted in March 2010 asking for copies of Clinton's \"daily calendar of appointments, phone calls and meetings.\" State regularly releases a public schedule for the secretary, but it does not include all official meetings or calls. In the suit filed in March 2015, the news agency said it never got a substantive response to the 2010 request, although the agency did deny a request to expedite processing.\nIn July of this year, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon held a hearing aimed at determining why State had taken so long to respond to that AP request and several others. Leon required State FOIA official John Hackett to appear in person at the hearing. Hackett said backlogs and a lack of personnel had contributed to the delays, but Leon seemed mystified at how they could have resulted in a five-year delay.\nHackett told the judge the actual reviews of documents are conducted by former foreign service officers who work part-time. In a recent filing in another case, State said most reviewers can work only 1024 hours a year--roughly half time--because of restrictions on rehiring of retirees.\n\"Oftentimes, these reviewers reach either the hours cap or the earnings cap prior to the end of the calendar or appointment year. Such reviewers must stop work pending a renewal of their appointment,\" Hackett wrote last week in a declaration filed in a FOIA case brought by Vice News.\nAt the July hearing, Leon seemed startled by the arrangement.\n\"Is Congress aware that people who do all [State] FOIA requests are part-timers?\u201d Leon asked. He also said \"even the least ambitious bureaucrat\" should be able to process records faster than State was proposing to do with the AP's requests.\nIn the new filing, State said it would be able to produce copies of paper versions of Clinton's schedule this week, but that an estimated 22,000 emails may contain scheduling information for Clinton. The agency did not immediately propose a new deadline.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Microsoft Outlook software takes the blame", "title": "State Dept.: Outlook crashes delay release of Hillary Clinton schedules", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2015/11/state-department-outlook-hillary-clinton-schedules-215534", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Lauren Gardner", "Erin Mershon", "Joe Scarborough", "Jim Risch", "Hadas Gold", "Robert Burns", "Paul Demko", "Austin Wright", "Tim Starks", "Harry Reid", "Brian Mahoney", "Richard Leon", "Theodoric Meyer", "John Hackett", "Josh Gerstein", "Caitlin Emma", "Chase Purdy", "Nick Gass", "Bernie Becker", "Jeb Bush", "Mika Brzezinski", "Alex Isenstadt", "Seung Min Kim", "Jeanne Shaheen", "Donald Trump", "John Bresnahan", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Barney Frank", "Megyn Kelly", "David Makovsky", "Pat Tiberi", "Adam Behsudi", "Tony Romm", "Heather Caygle", "Daniel Strauss", "Rachana Pradhan", "Hillary Clinton", "Eric Wolff", "Darius Tahir", "Matt Bevin", "Paul Ryan"], "orgs": ["Courts , Transparency , & More", "NHTSA", "State Department", "Congress", "Microsoft Outlook", "NFL", "Senate", "Clinton Health Access Initiative", "Freedom Caucus", "MSNBC", "Pentagon", "Freedom of Information Act"], "election_confidence": 0.9543300115369929, "authors": [{"author_id": 30849, "fullname": "seung min kim", "primary_org": "politico"}, {"author_id": 30731, "fullname": "hadas gold", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-04 22:11:08", "org": "politico", "article_id": "63fdf4736d8372a6cd08657948f65b0c", "date_access": "2015-11-04 22:49:28.568034"},

They say Trump mentioned that he lives in heavily Jewish New York and that his daughter married a Jewish man, real estate developer Jared Kushner. \nTwo separate sources close to Trump\u2019s campaign added that his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski reached out to Adelson\u2019s political adviser Andy Abboud to set up a face-to-face July meeting in Las Vegas between their bosses. \nAdelson later backed out. And last month, when POLITICO reported that Adelson was leaning towards supporting the GOP presidential campaign of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, whose hawkish foreign policy aligns closely with Adelson\u2019s, Trump lashed out at the senator and his potential patron.\n\u201cSheldon Adelson is looking to give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet. I agree!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\n\n\n            By \nHadas Gold\n             and \nSteven Shepard\n\nA similar pattern unfolded with Singer, a politically influential New York hedge fund billionaire who also is an ardent Israel hawk. Back in March, when Trump was still publicly toying with running for president, Kushner reached out to one of Singer\u2019s representatives to try to broker a meeting between the representative and Trump, according to a source familiar with the interaction. Kushner indicated that Trump was laying the groundwork for a campaign and suggested Singer\u2019s representative might want to hear about the plans, according to the source. \nThe entreaties, which did not result in a meeting, came after Kushner attended a March event at Singer\u2019s office at which the billionaire and other donors had the chance to meet with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who was then exploring a presidential campaign of his own. \nBut a few days after Singer declared his support for Rubio on Friday, Trump went on the attack.\nAt a Tuesday press conference, Trump declared ominously that there\u2019s a \u201clotta controversy with Mr. Singer\u201d and suggested \u201cThere are those people who probably wouldn\u2019t have wanted him to back, but we\u2019ll see.\u201d \nIn other appearances this week, Trump predicted that Singer\u2019s backing could hurt Rubio, given the billionaire\u2019s support for a 2013 immigration reform effort championed by Rubio that some Republican activists still hold against him.\n\n\n\n            By \nEliza Collins\n\n\u201cThis man Singer that put up money? He\u2019s big on amnesty, he\u2019s big on illegal immigration, Trump said Wednesday at a rally in Concord, New Hampshire, where he had filed papers to appear on the ballot for the state\u2019s first-in-the-nation primary. \u201cPaul Singer. Take a look at what he represents. And he represents other things, beside. Paul Singer represents amnesty and he represents illegal immigration pouring into the country. And now he\u2019s with Rubio,\u201d added Trump, whose top campaign issue is stopping illegal immigration and deporting undocumented immigrants.\nThe operatives behind a super PAC dedicated to supporting Trump\u2019s campaign last month closed up shop after Trump disavowed their efforts. But before that, POLITICO revealed that Trump had attended a fundraiser for the super PAC, which maintained close connections to Trump's campaign. While Trump's campaign has raised most of its cash from small donors, the super PAC could have accepted huge donations from wealthy donors.\nYet, in a refrain that\u2019s become familiar to those who\u2019ve followed his surprisingly strong candidacy, Trump on Wednesday inveighed against rival candidates who have been more than happy to have the backing of super PACs funded by huge checks from wealthy supporters.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t anybody to form super PACs for me. We sent legal notices: \u2018please give all the money back.\u2019 We don\u2019t want it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at Jeb, if you look at Marco Rubio, if you look at all of these people, they have super (PACs). And you look at Hillary \u2015 let\u2019s go to the other side \u2015 they have super PACs, where they control the candidate just like you control a puppet.\u201d\nYet the sources close to the Trump campaign said that it went to great lengths to cast the candidate as an Israel supporter to appeal to Singer, Adelson and other similarly minded mega-donors. In its interactions with Adelson\u2019s representatives, the campaign highlighted a campaign ad Trump cut in 2013 urging Israeli voters to reelect their hawkish Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is a favorite of Adelson\u2019s. \u201cWe had really tried to promote Trump as pro-Israel,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe\u2019s always wanted Adelson money.\u201d\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did representatives for Singer, Adelson or the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch.\nThe Trump campaign sought access to the political and public policy network helmed by the Koch brothers. Trump\u2019s aides detailed his policy positions for the Kochs and their donors in a survey put together by Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the group that coordinates the Koch network and hosts its twice-a-year donor gatherings.\nBut when Trump was not among the five candidates invited to the August Koch donor gathering at which the survey was distributed to donors, he unleashed some serious snark at his rivals who were included \u2015 Rubio, Walker, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina.\n\u201cI wish good luck to all of the Republican candidates that traveled to California to beg for money etc. from the Koch Brothers. Puppets?\u201d he tweeted.\nTrump took another shot at Charles Koch this week after the billionaire was asked during interviews promoting a new book about his thoughts on the GOP presidential field.\nKoch \u201cis looking for a new puppet after Governor Walker and Jeb Bush cratered. He now likes Rubio--next fail,\u201d Trump tweeted, though Koch has yet to direct any financial support to any of those candidates\u2019 campaigns.\nInterestingly, the Trump campaign employs several operatives who once worked for entities within the Koch network, including the campaign manager Lewandowski, who served as the New Hampshire state director and in other positions for the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity. \n\u201cThe reason we hired Corey is we thought he could help us with Koch,\u201d said one of the sources close to the Trump campaign.\n\nKenneth P.

The state has seen an unparalleled drop in its uninsured rate. \nBut Bevin, who easily beat Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway on Tuesday in a race that previewed themes of the 2016 presidential campaign, promised in the early days to unravel it all.\nHe could have outsized influence in dictating the health's law's fate in his state because outgoing Gov. Steve Beshear, a Democrat, built Obamacare through executive orders \u2014 which a successor could undo.\n\n\n\n            By \nKevin Robillard\n\n\"The lesson for Republicans is to be bold,\" Americans for Prosperity President Tim Phillips said after Bevin's win. Democrats may praise Kentucky \u2014 but Kentucky voters blew up the myth of success, he said.\nBevin did make bold promises \u2014 at first.\nIn his \"Blueprint for a Better Kentucky\" he said that undoing the Medicaid expansion that has brought coverage to 400,000 low income adults \u201cwould be financially prudent and give Kentucky more control over how medical financial assistance is administered.\u201d \n\u201cHe was the person who ran saying he was beholden to nobody,\u201d said Judy Solomon, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank that supports the Affordable Care Act.\nThen he hedged. \nBefore Tuesday's election, he said he would add conservative reforms to Medicaid rather than scrapping it entirely. \nBevin still says he'd close down the state-based exchange Kynect \u2014 one of the few online marketplaces to operate relatively glitch-free since Obamacare enrollment started two years ago. People could still get coverage through the federal exchange via HealthCare.gov, but the lack of state commitment could suppress enrollment. \nAl Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky, pointed out that it's not all up to the governor-elect. \n\u201cA key thing to remember at this point is the Republican president of the senate, Robert Stivers, made clear in July that the Legislature was going to decide the future of the Medicaid expansion,\u201d Cross said. \u201cIt was the very next day that Bevin started talking about doing a waiver like Indiana.\u201d\nGetting rid of KYnect would be a much simpler task, but Cross wonders whether Bevin might even reconsider, given how well it has worked.\n\u201cIt may be a test of Bevin\u2019s pragmatic streak,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a businessman; he\u2019s been in the military. You\u2019ve got to do what works. He might be persuaded KYnect isn\u2019t worth killing.\u201d \n\nCongress\n\n            By \nRachael Bade\n\nThe failure of Kentucky Health Cooperative less than a month before Election Day was also a wild card in the race. Roughly 50,000 Kentuckians enrolled in plans sold by the nonprofit startup established with $146 million in ACA loan dollars. They now face the prospect of scrambling to find new coverage during the current open-enrollment period. Bevin seized on the collapse of the co-op plan \u2014 one of a dozen such failures nationwide \u2014 as evidence that Kentucky\u2019s Obamacare infrastructure was crumbling.\nKentucky is not the first southern state that expanded Medicaid to see control of the governor\u2019s mansion taken over by a Republican. In Arkansas, which has also seen a double-digit decrease in the uninsured rate, Asa Hutchinson won the governor\u2019s race last year. \nBut Hutchinson never vowed to scrap the Medicaid expansion, and since taking office he\u2019s steered a pragmatic course, setting up a state task force to study the state\u2019s options. In that state, it\u2019s become exceedingly clear that current Medicaid enrollees aren\u2019t going to lose their benefits.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Kentucky health law repeal: Not so fast", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/kentucky-health-law-repeal-not-so-fast-215513", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Jack Conway", "Kyle Cheney", "Ben Smith", "Lauren Gardner", "Erin Mershon", "Kevin Robillard", "Anna Palmer", "Hadas Gold", "Paul Demko", "Lauren French", "Janet Yellen", "Simon Says", "Bob Corker", "Barack Obama", "Mick Mulvaney", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Jeremy Herb", "Theodoric Meyer", "Mark Perry", "Caitlin Emma", "Darius Tahir", "Tim Phillips", "Steve Beshear", "Shane Goldmacher", "Nick Gass", "Roger Simon", "Bernie Becker", "Asa Hutchinson", "Jeb Bush", "Jeanne Shaheen", "Andrew Glass", "Donald Trump", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Chase Purdy", "Megyn Kelly", "Tim Starks", "Rachael Bade", "Gary Cohn", "Adam Behsudi", "Tony Romm", "Laura Bush", "Daniel Strauss", "Heather Caygle", "Ronald Reagan", "Rachana Pradhan", "Ben White", "Eric Wolff", "Matt Bevin"], "orgs": ["Congress", "Senate", "Center on Budget and Policy Priorities", "NHTSA", "Acela", "AUMF", "Freedom Caucus", "Medicaid", "HealthCare", "GOP"], "election_confidence": 0.9902173753593017, "authors": [{"author_id": 32625, "fullname": "eliza collins", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-04 16:12:56", "org": "politico", "article_id": "7dc68a21f127f7b264a5115c7a0ec69a", "date_access": "2015-11-04 16:42:30.158400"},

Marco Rubio on Wednesday slammed Donald Trump's record on immigration, saying he only became a hardliner on the issue once he started running for president.\nRubio was asked on Fox News about a poll in Florida showing Rubio and former Florida governor Jeb Bush trailing Trump in their home state. Rubio said it had absolutely nothing to do with Trump's stances on immigration, which currently include an aggressive proposal to build a huge wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and to deport more than 11 million undocumented immigrants. \nStory Continued Below\n\"Well first of all, Donald was a supporter of amnesty and the DREAM Act, he changed his position on those issues just to run for president,\" Rubio said on Fox News' \"America's Newsroom.\" \"But beyond it, I don't think that's the issue that's driving it. Florida voters are following the national trends and watching the news cycle. I'm confident that as we get closer to a real election in Florida, those numbers are going to change. And they will.\"\nRubio's slam comes as Trump has ratcheted up his attacks on the Florida senator, who had a standout performance at last week's debate and has secured some high-profile endorsements, including one from mega donor Paul Singer.\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\n\u201cFor years, I\u2019ve been hearing that his credit cards are a disaster,\" Trump said about Rubio on Tuesday, as he publicly released his new book in Trump Tower. Trump also tweeted that same day about Rubio's record on immigration, and seized on a months-old comment from the Florida senator about how he would not immediately revoke Obama's executive actions.\nRubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, has struggled to shake his past as a member of the Gang of Eight bipartisan Senate alliance that tried to pass a comprehensive immigration reform proposal. He's since changed tack, and more recently he's begun advocating an approach centered on stronger enforcement of the country's immigration laws.\n\"But I would just say on immigration it is a very legitimate issue. We are not going to be able to pass a comprehensive approach to the immigration problem. The votes don't exist. We tried that two years ago,\" Rubio said on Wednesday, adding that \"the only way to move forward on immigration begins by enforcing our immigration laws. Part of that is a wall on key sectors of the border. But we also need e-verify, we also need an entry-exit tracking system and until you do that you're not going to be able to do anything else on immigration.\" \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Rubio knocks Trump for switching stances on immigration", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/marco-rubio-slams-donald-trump-215509", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Kyle Cheney", "Ben Smith", "Lauren Gardner", "Erin Mershon", "Kevin Robillard", "Anna Palmer", "Hadas Gold", "Paul Demko", "Lauren French", "Janet Yellen", "Simon Says", "Paul Singer", "Bob Corker", "Barack Obama", "Mick Mulvaney", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Jeremy Herb", "Theodoric Meyer", "Mark Perry", "Caitlin Emma", "Darius Tahir", "Shane Goldmacher", "Nick Gass", "Roger Simon", "Bernie Becker", "Jeb Bush", "Jeanne Shaheen", "Andrew Glass", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Chase Purdy", "Megyn Kelly", "Tim Starks", "Rachael Bade", "Gary Cohn", "Adam Behsudi", "Tony Romm", "Laura Bush", "Daniel Strauss", "Heather Caygle", "Ronald Reagan", "Rachana Pradhan", "Ben White", "Eric Wolff", "Matt Bevin"], "orgs": ["Congress", "Senate", "NHTSA", "Acela", "AUMF", "Freedom Caucus", "GOP"], "election_confidence": 0.9985231662983955, "authors": [{"author_id": 32625, "fullname": "eliza collins", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-04 16:19:53", "org": "politico", "article_id": "873cd534ec52c27189c5ebe752ccfb7e", "date_access": "2015-11-04 16:42:28.694269"},

That likely means Christie will get bumped to the undercard stage \u2014 a big blow for the New Jersey governor, especially because it comes as he appeared to be gaining some traction in the presidential race.\nStory Continued Below\nThe latest Fox poll is also potentially bad news for Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former New York Gov. George Pataki, who look like they might be left out of the event all together.\nThe lineup of the debates has been especially fraught \u2014 and controversial \u2014 for the large GOP field, as the candidates have feared the optics of being relegated to the undercard stage, which has carried various unpleasant monikers, including the \"junior varsity debate,\" \"the happy hour debate,\" or the \u201ckids table.\"\nAnd then there's the prospect of being frozen out completely, as former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore has had to cope with.\n\n\n\n            By \nAlex Isenstadt\n\nFox Business has not publicly provided the full details of how they'll determine the lineup for the Nov. 10 event, leaving some uncertainty until the official announcement on Thursday. \nIt has set the criteria as follows: Candidates who score 2.5 percent or higher in an average of the four most recent national polls conducted through Nov. 4 will be invited to the main debate stage. To qualify for the undercard debate stage, candidates must score at least 1 percent in one of four most recent national polls conducted through Nov. 4, as recognized by Fox Business.\nChristie is at an average of 2.25 percent in the four most recent national surveys, after earning just 2 percent in Wednesday evening's Fox poll. The other candidates who were hovering near the cutoff line \u2013 Rand Paul, John Kasich and Mike Huckabee \u2013 are all at 3 percent or higher, putting them in a safe zone.\nWhat creates some murkiness is the fact that the network has not specified which polls they will include, though it has said it will use the four most recent, qualifying national polls to determine the debate fields. It has also noted polls \"must be conducted by major, nationally-recognized organizations that use standard methodological techniques (i.e., live interviewers, random digit-dial sampling techniques and include both landlines and cell phones).\" The four most recent polls are from Fox News, Quinnipiac University, NBC News/Wall Street Journal and CBS News/New York Times. Whether the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll is ultimately included, however, is uncertain. But when Fox News hosted the first debate back in August, it excluded poll results from NBC News/Wall Street Journal over concerns about the wording of the horse-race question. If Fox replaces the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, it could instead include one of two surveys conducted over the same time period \u2013 Oct. 15-18.\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\nBut that would be little consolation for Christie: His 3 percent score in the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll would be swapped out for identical 3-percent showings in one of the other two polls, from ABC News/Washington Post or Monmouth University. That\u2019s not enough to overcome the 2 percent in the new Fox poll or the 1 percent he got in the CBS News/New York Times poll and vault him over the threshold.\nSimilarly, Huckabee, Paul and Kasich look safe regardless of what Fox does: They all clear the 3-percent mark with each of the three polls as part of the average.\nBut, if Fox decides to exclude the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, which poll they pick instead will matter greatly to Jindal and Pataki. Jindal is at 0 percent in five of the six surveys considered here \u2013 except the Monmouth poll, in which he got to 1 percent. Using Monmouth would get Jindal the Louisiana governor into the undercard debate.\nOn the other hand, the only poll in which Pataki got to 1 percent was the ABC News/Washington Post survey.\nBoth Jindal and Pataki have legitimate claims if the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll is omitted \u2013 since the two potential replacement surveys were conducted over the same field dates.\n Fox Business will announce who has made the debate stages Thursday at 7p.m. on Lou Dobbs' show. \n\nHadas Gold is a reporter at\u00a0Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Christie on track to get bumped from main stage at next GOP debate", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/chris-christie-republican-debate-215539", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Kenneth P.

The meeting was aimed at presenting a united front to the networks and put the campaigns in control of the process.\nThe early demands included things such as the ability to approve on-screen graphics about the candidates, which stemmed partly from the CNBC debate, when an on-screen bio of Jeb Bush showed that he was a consultant for Lehman Brothers and Barclays, but didn't mention his years in politics. (A graphic that appeared some 20 minutes before covered his years as governor). Several network anchors, including Fox News' Megyn Kelly and CNN's Kate Bolduan scoffed at the idea of allowing the candidates editorial control over on-screen graphics and camera shots. \nBut the latest draft of the letter being circulated has strayed far from the original list of demands. It is now a series of mostly mundane questions about debate criteria and basic logistics, though there is one asking for the networks to \"commit to provide an equal number of questions to each candidate.\" The letter asks the network to return the questionnaire within one month of receipt. \nIt's not clear yet who will actually sign the letter. As of Wednesday morning, Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush and Rand Paul's campaign have all said they do not intend to sign it. It's still possible another version of the letter will come out, or that they will agree to sign a newer, tamer version. But at the moment, that doesn't appear to be likely.\nHadas Gold is a reporter at\u00a0Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The latest draft of the letter being circulated has strayed far from the original list of demands.", "title": "About that debate demands letter...", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2015/11/about-that-debate-demands-letter-215512", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Kyle Cheney", "Ben Smith", "Lauren Gardner", "Erin Mershon", "Kevin Robillard", "Anna Palmer", "Hadas Gold", "Paul Demko", "Lauren French", "Janet Yellen", "Simon Says", "Kate Bolduan", "Bob Corker", "Barack Obama", "Mick Mulvaney", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Jeremy Herb", "Theodoric Meyer", "Caitlin Emma", "Darius Tahir", "Shane Goldmacher", "Nick Gass", "Roger Simon", "Bernie Becker", "Chris Christie", "Jeb Bush", "Jeanne Shaheen", "Andrew Glass", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Chase Purdy", "Megyn Kelly", "Tim Starks", "Carly Fiorina", "Rachael Bade", "Gary Cohn", "Adam Behsudi", "Tony Romm", "Laura Bush", "Daniel Strauss", "Heather Caygle", "Ronald Reagan", "Rachana Pradhan", "Ben White", "Eric Wolff", "Matt Bevin"], "orgs": ["CNBC", "Congress", "Senate", "NHTSA", "Acela", "AUMF", "Freedom Caucus", "Barclays", "Lehman Brothers", "GOP"], "election_confidence": 0.9937525026578178, "authors": [{"author_id": 32625, "fullname": "eliza collins", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-04 16:08:48", "org": "politico", "article_id": "94c4783413e4ef024e5ee8d340cc39f2", "date_access": "2015-11-04 16:42:27.196353"},

Her departure comes at a sensitive time for the administration, which is struggling to figure out how to deter Russian aggression in Ukraine and its new bombing campaign against Syrian rebels to prop up Syrian dictator Bashar Assad.\nFarkas said she was proud of her work at the Defense Department but painted a grim picture of U.S. relations with Russia.\nShe said she believes Putin is seeking to be a counter to the United States on the world stage and that Ukraine and Syria might not be the last of his military adventures.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he tried to counter-balance us elsewhere,\u201d she said, noting that there was some concern in the administration that if Putin saw an opening, he might try to \u201ctest NATO.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cI do think that we need to, unfortunately, do a better job of really understanding what Russia and the Kremlin\u2019s interests are. They have, thus far, prioritized their security interests over their economic interests.\u201d\nShe insisted, though, that she wasn\u2019t leaving the administration with any hard feelings, explaining that now was \u201ca good time personally for me to leave.\u201d \n\u201cI will say that certainly I advocated for things internally, and I have personal views that may be further afield or may be slightly different from what the current administration position is, but I\u2019ve always felt that I gave my advice and was listened to and we had a full hearing and we have a very healthy inter-agency process.\u201d\nShe demurred when asked about her post-Pentagon plans.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take my time to decide exactly what is next, and I\u2019ll leave it at that,\u201d Farkas said. \n\nAustin Wright is a defense reporter for Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Pentagon&apos;s top Russia expert says her calls for tougher policy were overrruled", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/evelyn-farkas-russia-pentagon-215517", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Ben Smith", "Lauren Gardner", "Bashar Assad", "Erin Mershon", "Joe Scarborough", "Evelyn Farkas", "Hadas Gold", "Vladimir Putin", "Paul Demko", "Austin Wright", "Lauren French", "Janet Yellen", "Simon Says", "Bob Corker", "Mick Mulvaney", "Harry Reid", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Jeremy Herb", "Theodoric Meyer", "Mark Perry", "Caitlin Emma", "Josh Gerstein", "Nick Gass", "Roger Simon", "Bernie Becker", "Mika Brzezinski", "Jeb Bush", "Seung Min Kim", "Jeanne Shaheen", "Donald Trump", "John Bresnahan", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Paul Ryan", "Megyn Kelly", "Tim Starks", "Gary Cohn", "Adam Behsudi", "Tony Romm", "Laura Bush", "Daniel Strauss", "Heather Caygle", "Rachana Pradhan", "Ben White", "Eric Wolff", "Darius Tahir", "Matt Bevin", "Chase Purdy"], "orgs": ["NHTSA", "Defense Department", "Senate", "NFL", "Acela", "AUMF", "Freedom Caucus", "Clinton Health Access Initiative", "NATO", "MSNBC", "Pentagon", "GOP"], "election_confidence": 0.9895464416800085, "authors": [{"author_id": 31180, "fullname": "jake sherman", "primary_org": "politico"}, {"author_id": 30948, "fullname": "john bresnahan", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-04 16:58:20", "org": "politico", "article_id": "bfa192f205058852f9390a4d1b46c664", "date_access": "2015-11-04 17:48:30.920748"},

(From #thekellyfile - Nov 2d).\u201d she tweeted with a picture of the graphic previously used on her show to illustrate Trump in first place with 28 percent compared to Ben Carson\u2019s 23 percent. \nThe feud between the GOP candidate and the Fox News host began after the Fox presidential debate in August when Kelly asked him a question about his treatment of women. \nWhen Kelly finally addressed the tiff, she said \u201cI\u2019ve decided not to respond [to those comments].\u201d \n \u201cMr. Trump is an interesting man who has captured the attention of the electorate. That\u2019s why he\u2019s leading in the polls. Trump, who is the front-runner, will not apologize, and I certainly will not apologize for doing good journalism,\u201d Kelly said on her show in August. \u201cSo I\u2019ll continue doing my job without fear or favor. And Mr. Trump, I expect, will continue with what has been a successful campaign thus far.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Trump&apos;s feud with Megyn Kelly heats back up", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/megyn-kelly-donald-trump-215514", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security", "trade"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Ben Smith", "Lauren Gardner", "Erin Mershon", "Hadas Gold", "Paul Demko", "Lauren French", "Janet Yellen", "Simon Says", "Bob Corker", "Barack Obama", "Mick Mulvaney", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Jeremy Herb", "Theodoric Meyer", "Mark Perry", "Caitlin Emma", "Darius Tahir", "Shane Goldmacher", "Nick Gass", "Roger Simon", "Bernie Becker", "Jeb Bush", "Jeanne Shaheen", "Andrew Glass", "Donald Trump", "Eliza Collins", "Chase Purdy", "Megyn Kelly", "Tim Starks", "Rachael Bade", "Gary Cohn", "Adam Behsudi", "Tony Romm", "Laura Bush", "Daniel Strauss", "Heather Caygle", "Ronald Reagan", "Rachana Pradhan", "Ben White", "Eric Wolff", "Ben Carson", "Matt Bevin"], "orgs": ["NHTSA", "Congress", "Senate", "NFL", "Acela", "AUMF", "Freedom Caucus", "GOP"], "election_confidence": 0.9922955122717293, "authors": [{"author_id": 30739, "fullname": "burgess everett", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-04 16:37:40", "org": "politico", "article_id": "c08077ac8fa6af33f1b1435baab090fe", "date_access": "2015-11-04 17:00:05.178460"},

Yet they also made plain Bush\u2019s frustrations with the business of running for president \u2013 his low regard for the political press, his frustration with the debate process and with opponents whom he views as too unaccomplished to be seeking the White House.\nStory Continued Below\nIn a 30-minute ride from Manchester to Hollis, Bush revealed that he no longer expresses irony without caveats because of the potential to be misread on Twitter. He said he heard from the French ambassador recently after he publicly joked that Sen. Marco Rubio works a French workweek, and noted that he's getting a haircut Saturday morning. \nActually, Bush clarified, it's not a cut -- just a trim.\nHe gets unsolicited suggestions from random people who email him (Bush often gives out his jeb@jeb.org email address and promises voters he\u2019ll reply if they reach out). And he got one during the bus ride \u2013 the second of three press sit-downs during his New Hampshire swing. While a Florida friend was busy chastising assembled reporters for asking Bush about Donald Trump, Bush flashed his phone to show a new piece of advice he got from a college student in Wyoming.\n\n\n\n            By \nAlex Isenstadt\n\n\u201cI need toilet paper, can you grab some?\u201d Bush read aloud. He replied: \u201cFunny guy.\"\nThe former Florida governor explained that he made a mistake by assuming that candidates should answer questions during GOP debates -- he's since learned that the presidential debates are better viewed as opportunities to \"say what you think.\" \n\u201cI\u2019ve got 62 years of DNA upbringing where I try to answer the question,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be myself by saying what\u2019s on my mind.\u201d \nThe next time, Bush explained, he intends to be \u201cbetter as a performer.\u201d\nBush, who last ran for office in 2002, rejected the notion that he should\u2019ve been better prepared for an era of campaigning that often evokes the spectacle of reality TV.\n\u201cI don\u2019t accept that premise. Normal people, which are the great majority of people \u2026 don\u2019t obsess about the process,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnybody in this room think that Donald Trump would be a candidate?\u201d he wondered.\nYet Bush clearly does think about process -- alot. He lamented the reams of advice he receives daily \u2013 from his consultants, from his advisers, \u201can army of people\u201d -- and joked that one adviser rejected a tie he wore recently, comparing it to something he\u2019d wear if he was going to a funeral. \n\u201cThere\u2019s always a tendency to try to reshape candidates,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just instinctive for campaigns to try to do that with the best of intentions.\u201d\n\n2016\n\n            By \nKenneth P. Vogel\n             and \nBen Schreckinger\n\nBush says he doesn\u2019t read political coverage of his campaign, but revealed the opposite by observing that his donors have been among the media's best sources of information on the state of the Bush campaign. (\u201cDonors don\u2019t talk to me. They only talk to you guys, apparently.\")\nLater Wednesday, on a private conference call designed to reassure nervous donors -- two of whom immediately provided details to Bloomberg Politics -- Bush urged them to stop reading the political media, including this publication.\n\"Stop reading Politico,\" he said, according to the Bloomberg account. \"It doesn't do any good for your health. It doesn't matter.\"\nThe former governor chalked up blanket coverage of some of his controversial statements to the judgment of individual reporters.\n\u201cHey baby, that\u2019s your fault,\u201d he said wryly to a reporter who asked why he thought his remarks were often caricatured.\nAs much as anything else, Bush's interpretation of the Straight Talk Express is showing him to be a political realist -- a candidate who understands his flaws and acknowledges his precarious position. \n\u201cI\u2019m not crazy,\" he said. \"I have enough self-awareness to know I\u2019m in the middle of the pack. But I know how to get where I need to be.\u201d\nBush repeatedly pinned his hopes on the fact that New Hampshire voters are notoriously late deciders in presidential primaries. Right now, he said, \u201cthey\u2019re speed dating.\u201d He expects that when it\u2019s time to vote in February, he\u2019ll be in a better position in polls. \nThough he largely declined to dissect his political rivals, Bush paused when asked about Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who has surpassed Bush in recent polls. He noted that Rubio and other senators running for president have failed to \u201cchange the culture in Washington.\u201d He noted that between Rubio, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, only two combined bills had been passed. But he insisted he\u2019d support Rubio and the others if they beat him to the nomination.\n\u201cMarco\u2019s a gifted politician. He\u2019s earned his position. You don\u2019t get to be a United States senator without being responsible for your success,\u201d he said.\nAs for the McCain comparisons, which Bush\u2019s team has readily courted, Bush agreed that the press sit-downs were an attempt to emulate the Straight Talk Express. But he insisted that his tour be renamed. \nAfter a brief contemplation, he joked, \u201cCrowdsource it.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "In Jeb Bush's version of the Straight Talk Express, the candidate can't hide his frustrations.", "title": "Bush boards comeback bus", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/jeb-bush-2016-republicans-bus-215533", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Kenneth P.

(Getty)\n\n            By \nJosh Gerstein\n\n11/04/15 12:01 PM EST\nAn organization related to the Clinton Foundation has again reversed itself on fixing errors on its federal tax filings and now says it plans to submitted amended returns.\nClinton Health Access Initiative spokeswoman Maura Daley said Wednesday that the group has now decided to refile two years worth of forms with the Internal Revenue Service.\n\"As previously stated, the minor errors on the 2012 and 2013 CHAI 990s are immaterial and do not require refiling, yet in response to recent media interest in the forms, CHAI has decided to refile the returns in order to be fully transparent,\" Daley said in a statement emailed to POLITICO.\nA widely-publicized Reuters report in April said the organization, which focuses on HIV/AIDS treatment and vaccination programs, planned to refile its annual tax returns known as Forms 990 after acknowledging errors in the reporting of government grants. The organization also acknowledged that it did not submit several new contributions from foreign countries for a State Department ethics review as a conflict-of-interest agreement signed when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009 appeared to require.\nHowever, POLITICO reported Monday that, although the Clinton Foundation spinoff did not publicly dispute the Reuters report for the past six months, the organization had concluded that no refiling was necessary and had never committed to refile its returns.\n\"Contrary to what was reported, CHAI has consistently stated that they would conduct a review process to determine whether the transposition errors required a refiling,\" Daley said Monday. \"After conducting the review, the transpositional errors made had no material impact, and we do not believe a refiling is required.\"\nReuters stood by the accuracy of its report, noting that Daley said in a March email that the group was \"working diligently to make the necessary amendments to the returns.\"\nOn Tuesday, the Republican National Committee filed a formal complaint with the IRS, urging it to conduct a full audit of the health-focused charity and to require the group to file amended returns.\nWith Hillary Clinton mounting a bid for the White House, news outlets have stepped up scrutiny of the finances of the Clinton Foundation and its affiliates. Republicans have sought to capitalize on those reports to raise questions about the trustworthiness of the former secretary of state and her husband, former President Bill Clinton.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Clinton Health Access Initiative spokeswoman says that the group has now decided to refile two years worth of forms.", "title": "Clinton Foundation spinoff reverses on refiling tax forms", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2015/11/clinton-foundation-spinoff-reverses-on-refiling-tax-forms-215515", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Ben Smith", "Lauren Gardner", "Erin Mershon", "Joe Scarborough", "Hadas Gold", "Paul Demko", "Austin Wright", "Lauren French", "Janet Yellen", "Simon Says", "Bob Corker", "Mick Mulvaney", "Harry Reid", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Jeremy Herb", "Bill Clinton", "Theodoric Meyer", "Caitlin Emma", "Josh Gerstein", "Nick Gass", "Roger Simon", "Bernie Becker", "Mika Brzezinski", "Jeb Bush", "Seung Min Kim", "Jeanne Shaheen", "Donald Trump", "John Bresnahan", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Paul Ryan", "Megyn Kelly", "Tim Starks", "Gary Cohn", "Adam Behsudi", "Tony Romm", "Laura Bush", "Daniel Strauss", "Heather Caygle", "Rachana Pradhan", "Hillary Clinton", "Ben White", "Eric Wolff", "Maura Daley", "Darius Tahir", "Matt Bevin", "Chase Purdy"], "orgs": ["Courts , Transparency , & More", "NHTSA", "State Department", "Internal Revenue Service.", "Senate", "NFL", "Acela", "AUMF", "Clinton Foundation", "Freedom Caucus", "Clinton Health Access Initiative", "CHAI", "MSNBC", "Republican National Committee", "Pentagon", "GOP", "IRS"], "election_confidence": 0.9959246377083089, "authors": [{"author_id": 31180, "fullname": "jake sherman", "primary_org": "politico"}, {"author_id": 30948, "fullname": "john bresnahan", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-11-04 17:01:10", "org": "politico", "article_id": "c5a675785b2a13838583ce6cd683dcba", "date_access": "2015-11-04 17:48:28.372043"},

Bush lamented that nine in 10 painkiller prescriptions worldwide originate in America. But he saved particular criticism for the decision of the FDA\u2019s recent support of a version of slow-release OxyContin for children.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cThis is not appropriate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to take a pause and recognize that pain is part of life. You have to monitor pain and deal with it. But overprescribing creates all sorts of adverse problems as well.\u201d\nBush\u2019s comments came at the Hollis Pharmacy & General Store, where owner Vahrig Manoukian related the story of losing a child to drug addiction. Bush said he\u2019d like to adopt Manoukian\u2019s proposal to register drug dealers publicly like sex offenders, a move Manoukian said would shame them out of communities.\nAt the event, Bush also locked horns with a questioner who suggested his tax plan was \u201cgarbage.\u201d The questioner rejected Bush\u2019s suggestion that he could pay for the plan with the \u201cdynamic\u201d economic effect of the tax reductions. And he said Bush\u2019s brother, former president George W. Bush, failed on that count, pushing large tax cuts that ultimately drove up the deficit.\nBush responded not with a defense of his brother but a reference to Ronald Reagan, rebutting the questioner by asking him whether Reagan\u2019s tax policies had failed by the same measure.\nTheir tense exchange ended cheerfully though. Bush ribbed the man: \u201cLighten up. Put a smile on your face.\u201d And the man praised him for presenting an optimistic message about America\u2019s future.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Bush: OxyContin prescription for kids &apos;inappropriate&apos;", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/jeb-bush-prescription-drugs-215522", "topics": ["foreign policy/national security"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Ben Smith", "Lauren Gardner", "Erin Mershon", "Joe Scarborough", "Hadas Gold", "Paul Demko", "Austin Wright", "Lauren French", "Janet Yellen", "Bob Corker", "Mick Mulvaney", "Harry Reid", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Jeremy Herb", "Theodoric Meyer", "Mark Perry", "Caitlin Emma", "Josh Gerstein", "Nick Gass", "Bernie Becker", "Mika Brzezinski", "Jeb Bush", "Seung Min Kim", "Jeanne Shaheen", "Donald Trump", "John Bresnahan", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Paul Ryan", "Megyn Kelly", "Tim Starks", "Gary Cohn", "Adam Behsudi", "Tony Romm", "Laura Bush", "Heather Caygle", "Daniel Strauss", "Ronald Reagan", "Rachana Pradhan", "Ben White", "George W.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) took a subtle but notable shift on immigration on Wednesday, declaring that he would end a program designed to protect young undocumented immigrants in the United States, even if a congressional overhaul doesn\u2019t happen under his watch. \nPreviously, Rubio had said as president he would not immediately revoke the so-called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program \u2014 a 2012 directive from President Barack Obama that shielded so-called DREAMers who came here illegally at a young age from being deported. \nStory Continued Below\nRubio indicated that he hoped the program would end because lawmakers would have passed immigration reform to replace the executive action.\nBut on Wednesday in New Hampshire, Rubio sharpened his position: DACA will have to end, even if Congress never hands him an immigration bill to sign if he is elected as president. \n\u201cThis program\u2019s now been around for three years and we haven\u2019t signed it by now \u2026 we\u2019re not going to extend the program,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cDACA is going to end. The ideal way for it to end would be it\u2019s replaced by a reform system that creates an alternative but if it doesn\u2019t it will end. It cannot be the permanent policy of the United States.\u201d \n\n\n\n            By \nDaniel Strauss\n\nThe Florida senator \u2013 who played a key role in the Senate\u2019s comprehensive immigration reform efforts in 2013 \u2013 conveyed similar remarks earlier this year, but expressed less urgency about revoking Obama's action. The interview at the time got little attention, but resurfaced this week and caused a stir in conservative media.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can immediately revoke that,\u201d Rubio said in the April interview with news anchor Jorge Ramos. \u201cI think it will have to end at some point. And I hope it will end because of some reform to the immigration laws. It cannot be the permanent policy of the United States but I\u2019m not calling for it to be revoked tomorrow or this week or right away.\u201d\nIn response to the April video, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie slammed Rubio on his DACA position during a Tuesday interview with conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham, arguing that the senator should have taken a more aggressive stance over Obama\u2019s unilateral actions.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why anyone would want to have someone who is not going to enforce the law as the chief law enforcement officer of the United States,\u201d Christie told Ingraham. \u201cNow maybe Marco doesn\u2019t believe that the executive order is illegal, and if he doesn\u2019t he should say that. And, he\u2019s welcome to that opinion, obviously there\u2019s lots of Democrats who would agree with that. But, he needs to say that.\u201d \nDonald Trump also jumped in, tweeted out on Tuesday an article from the conservative website Breitbart that criticized Rubio\u2019s remarks to Ramos for not giving a timeline on when the program would end. \u201cMarco Rubio would keep Barack Obama\u2019s executive order on amnesty intact. See article. Cannot be President,\u201d he tweeted. \nAlfonso Aguilar, executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, a conservative organization aimed at getting Latinos involved with conservative issues and causes, wasn\u2019t concerned about the shift in comments and called them a \u201cpractical approach.\u201d \n\n\n\n            By \nDaniel Strauss\n\n\u201cI think he believes that he would end it by replacing it with good legislation that provides a path to legal status for the undocumented,\u201d Aguilar told POLITICO. \u201cThe only way to get a permanent solution for the undocumented is through legislation.\u201d\nBut other Hispanics were not happy. \n\u201cWhile there might be a race to the bottom to attack Latinos and immigrant families, the fact is DACA stands as living proof that America benefits when an undocumented individual is allowed the opportunity to fully contribute to the economy through their ingenuity, skills, and hard work,\u201d Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J) said in an e-mailed statement to POLITICO. \u201cThis latest attack on young DREAMers is indicative of the jam the GOP candidates are in when it comes to the fastest growing voting bloc in our nation. The road to the White House is not feasible without the support of Latinos, yet they can\u2019t get through a primary without capitulating to right-wing radicals.\u201d\nThe bipartisan Latino Victory Fund, a group to increase Latino political power, circulated a statement shortly after his remarks that alleged he abandoned his community. \n\u201cRubio has been a leader on immigration reform in the past, but when leading on the issue is no longer politically expedient he is abandoning his community for the purpose of his own ambitions,\u201d President Cristobal J. Alex said in the statement. \u201cLatinos are listening and Marco Rubio just made it crystal clear that he is completely out of touch with the needs of the Latino community and that he doesn\u2019t stand with us. Rubio should remember that it\u2019s not enough to be Latino to get our community\u2019s support.\" \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Rubio takes harder stance on DREAMers program", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/marco-rubio-immigration-dreamers-215538", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Jorge Ramos", "Kenneth P.

Bob Corker of Tennessee has made many short-term trades in shares of a little-known Chattanooga real-estate company. Until recently, he hadn\u2019t made public a dozen stock purchases in the firm, including several that resulted in his most profitable investments. In one previously unknown purchase, Mr. Corker purchased between $1 million and $5 million in shares of the firm, CBL & Associates Properties Inc., in late 2011 and sold them five months later for a 42% gain. A pair of purchases in 2009 in accounts in the name of his daughters likely netted more than $1 million, though in that case the exact gain is impossible to calculate. The trades are among the CBL stock purchases that Mr. Corker disclosed only recently after questions from The Wall Street Journal about apparent discrepancies in his Senate financial-disclosure reports. Congressional ethics rules require lawmakers to make public their financial investments in broad ranges each year. Brody Mullins and Tom McGinty report.\nWITH RYAN AT HELM, HOUSE BEGINS SCUFFLING OVER HIGHWAY BILL: The House has begun skirmishing over a multiyear highway bill that includes an extension of the Export-Import Bank and other nontransportation items, providing an early test of House Speaker Paul Ryan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to manage the chamber\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disparate factions. The legislation, which sets out policies for building roads and maintaining bridges for six years, already is facing skepticism from Senate Democratic leaders, who say the $325 billion raised by the bill is too little. Some Republicans complain that the measure, a version of which has already passed the Senate, includes only three years of funding for the programs. Mr. Ryan, following through on promises to conservatives, has allowed a number of amendments, in a debate that was expected to run into Tuesday and Wednesday evenings, with a final vote set for Thursday.

But concern from some justices over a possible flood of political gerrymandering litigation later raised doubts whether they would prevail.\nThe plaintiffs claim that the remap, engineered by former Gov. Martin O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Malley to shift a Republican seat into the Democratic column, violated constitutional speech and association rights. The allegation raised \u00e2\u0080\u009cabout as important a question as you can imagine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Justice Stephen Breyer said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey want to say\u00e2\u0080\u00a6that the state legislators are forbidden to draw district boundaries the way that has been done here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if they are right, that would affect congressional districts and legislative districts throughout the nation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nA federal district judge in Baltimore had dismissed the lawsuit, shutting down the lawsuit without putting it before an expedited process Congress authorized for redistricting lawsuits. Under federal law, a three-judge district court is supposed to hear challenges to electoral maps, then bypass the appellate courts for a direct appeal before the Supreme Court.\nJustice Elena Kagan suggested the district judge was too hasty in dismissing the case.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u2019ve basically said that\u2019s only [appropriate] when it\u2019s completely ridiculous,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, not merely an unsuccessful legal theory but \u00e2\u0080\u009ca laughing stock of a case.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWhile the Supreme Court never has thrown out a political map for partisan gerrymandering, neither has it foreclosed the possibility that drawing lines to favor a political party could be unconstitutional. In a 2004 concurring opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy invited litigants to propose reasons and methods for judicial review of partisan gerrymanders, a point the court underscored in June when it upheld an Arizona voter initiative transferring political map making to an independent commission from the state legislature.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u2019s Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurrence\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that provides the basis for the complaint in this case,\u00e2\u0080\u009d plaintiffs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 attorney Michael Kimberly told the justices. As a result, Republican voters at least were entitled to their day in three-judge court, he said.\nJust as it seemed a majority had been sewn up, Chief Justice John Roberts raised a troubling implication. If practically any challenge to a political map brings an automatic appeal to the Supreme Court, the justices could find themselves flooded with gerrymandering litigation.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u2019s a serious problem,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\nMaryland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyer, Steven Sullivan, immediately stoked such fears, noting that seven separate challenges to the 2011 map had been filed.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe cases we\u2019ve had in recent years that were dismissed by a single judge, they would have all come here. And we\u2019re one state times 50,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00c2\u00ac Mr. Sullivan, a state assistant attorney general, said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is this concern to control this court\u2019s mandatory docket, which Congress cares deeply about,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe care even more than Congress. Trust me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Justice Antonin Scalia said.\nA decision in the case, Shapiro v. McManus, is expected before July.\n______________________________________________________\n2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll Standings\n\n\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops. \r\n\nCapital Journal Daybreak Newsletter: Sign up to get the latest on politics, policy and defense delivered to your inbox every morning.\r\nFor the latest Washington news, follow @wsjpolitics\r\nFor outside analysis, follow @wsjthinktank", "byline": "", "description": "Maryland Republicans seeking to reinstate a challenge to the state\u2019s 2011 congressional map made headway early in Wednesday\u2019s Supreme Court arguments.

{"body": "We don\u2019t know yet whether Republican Matt Bevin, who was elected governor of Kentucky on Tuesday, will try to abolish the Medicaid expansion put in place by outgoing Gov. Steve Beshear (D.), attempt to cap enrollment, or do nothing at all. But his election sets up new discussion of Republican attitudes toward Medicaid expansion.\nThirty states have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act since the Supreme Court made it a state option in 2012. Ten of them have Republican governors, two of whom are presidential candidates, John Kasich and Chris Christie. If, however, you follow campaign commentary on cable TV you would think expanding Medicaid is a political black mark in the eyes of all Republicans. To be sure, the most activated elements of the GOP base\u2013conservative campaign contributors, super PACs, and conservative legislators\u2013oppose Medicaid expansion, primarily because they see it more as embracing Obamacare than providing federal funding to states to help them expand coverage for low-income residents. But the limited polling the Kaiser Family Foundation has done on the issue has found that most Republicans do not oppose Medicaid expansion. In fact, they favor it.\nIn a December 2014 poll, 52% of Republicans said they had a favorable view of\u00a0Medicaid expansion, 44%\u00a0had an unfavorable view, and 3% did not voice an opinion. In the same poll,\u00a0as the chart above shows, 56% of Republicans in states that had not expanded Medicaid had a very favorable (23%) or somewhat favorable (33%) view of expansion. This survey was conducted too far in advance of the 2016 primary elections to poll likely Republican voters. Views were also different in two strongly anti-expansion states in polling Kaiser did with the New York Times in 2014. A majority of Republicans in Louisiana (66%) and North Carolina (53%)\u00a0preferred that their state keep Medicaid as is.\nWe don\u2019t know from the polling why most Republicans say they support expansion. Gov. Kasich has argued that expansion is a moral imperative and that he sees it as broadening Ohio\u2019s Medicaid program rather than embracing Obamacare, which he opposes. We do know that 47% of Republicans in a May 2015 poll said Medicaid was a very important program; only 14% said it is not an important program. But that is far fewer than the 69% who said Medicare was a very important program. As might not be surprising, given their generally higher income levels, fewer Republicans (35%) than Democrats (61%) say Medicaid is important to them or their family.\nThat even a slim majority of Republicans favor expansion is notable given the tone of debate on this issue on the campaign trail, where expansion has become like a third rail for GOP candidates. This is not to suggest that Republican candidates or governors who oppose Medicaid expansion in conservative states will be anxious to flip any time soon. But Medicaid may not be as unpopular with Republicans overall as the conventional wisdom suggests, and other issues may be more salient for Republican voters in primary and general elections across the country than opposition to Medicaid expansion.\nDrew Altman is president and chief executive officer of the\u00a0Kaiser Family Foundation.

{"body": "In a fascinating (and, for some, frustrating) year in politics, the latest polls, including this week\u2019s Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey, provide some telling insights into the trajectory of the 2016 presidential race. I see five key points that give us a sense of where things are going:\n1. While Hillary Clinton has solidified her lead and standing among Democratic primary voters, she remains unlikeable to and distrusted by most Americans. Those likeability and trustworthy numbers didn\u2019t move despite all the \u201csuccess\u201d she has had in the last month. Add to that the fact that two-thirds of the country believe we are on the wrong track, with an incumbent Democratic president with a 49% disapproval at the helm, and it appears she is a weak November candidate (in some ways weaker than a Bernie Sanders candidacy).\n2. Donald Trump and Ben Carson continue to solidify their positions as dominant players in the GOP primary. Between the two of them, they represent more than 50% of Republican voters. My question from August still stands: Is the GOP on the verge of nominating an unelectable November candidate as Republicans did in 1964 with Barry Goldwater?\n3. This GOP race is coming into a much firmer structure, with three dominant candidates running in the outsider lane (Mr. Trump, Mr. Carson, and Ted Cruz) and three or four in the more establishment lane (Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, and John Kasich). Someone will emerge as the leader in each lane and ultimately face off against the\u00a0other in the spring of 2016. Today it looks like that will be Sen. Rubio for the establishment; right now, Mr. Carson is leading the outsider lane, but Mr. Cruz could come on strong soon. Sen. Rubio is highly popular among Cruz and Carson voters so if their numbers drop he is likely to be the beneficiary.\n4. Jeb Bush is in an incredibly difficult position. He has campaigned everywhere, has a huge organization, and spent millions on television ads\u2013and the numbers haven\u2019t moved. This goes to a simple point: Money matters much less this year, and TV ads are ineffective. And when you look at head-to-head numbers in a GOP primary, the only person Mr. Trump beats one on one is Mr.\u00a0Bush by 18 points. In addition, Mr. Bush is very unpopular among Carson, Trump, and Cruz voters. He has no real way to grow support.\n5.\u00a0Americans are very frustrated with our government and political institutions, and a majority think the systems are stacked against them. Voters are upset with both political parties, and it looks like each party may be on the verge of nominating \u201cunelectable\u201d candidates to face off next November. And so, having only a choice between the two parties, the generic ballot for president and for Congress is tied. Right now, no one is getting rewarded in this debate.\nWhile the recent polling begins to give us a shape for this presidential contest, a number of twist and turns are likely before the Iowa caucuses are held in 90 days. So far, debates seem to have had more impact than any other events in the campaign. With several GOP and Democratic debates on the horizon, candidates have an opportunity to shift the trajectory with their performance on-stage. Fasten your seat belt.\nMatthew J.

The race between Mr. Bevin, a 48-year-old businessman, and Democrat Jack Conway, the 46-year-old state attorney general, was the most high-profile of three gubernatorial contests this year. The candidates were vying to succeed Gov. Steve Beshear, a popular Democrat who was barred by law from running for a third term. In another race,\u00a0Republican Gov. Phil Bryant of Mississippi easily won re-election against Democrat Robert Gray, a little-known truck driver.

Known as the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, or HERO, the measure would have banned discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, race and a dozen other categories. It was backed heavily by Houston Mayor Annise Parker and a cadre of national Democratic political figures, and proponents poured more than $3 million into the push to pass it.

The Ohio marijuana measure has been controversial from the start, and not just because it was trying to legalize marijuana in the Midwest. Local investors in the pot industry were behind the ballot initiative, spending more than $20 million to collect signatures to force a statewide vote and then funding the campaign to try to win its passage.

{"body": "Democratic presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is proposing to\u00c2\u00a0end the federal prohibition on marijuana.\nThe Senate bill set to be introduced by Mr. Sanders would remove marijuana from the list of substances controlled under federal law and repeal federal penalties for possessing or consuming it.\n\u201cThe time is long overdue for us to take marijuana off of the federal government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s list of outlawed drugs,\u201d Mr. Sanders said on the Senate floor last week.\nThe proposal \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which is unlikely to be a top priority in the Republican-controlled Senate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 would essentially allow states to establish regulated marijuana industries without fear of federal interference. Under Mr. Sanders\u2019s proposal, trafficking marijuana across state lines would remain illegal.\nAdult use of marijuana is legal in four states and the District of Columbia but it remains illegal under federal law to possess, consumer or sell. Dozens of states have also legalized the drug for medical purposes.\nBut federal drug laws treat marijuana as a substance with a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in the same category as heroin or LSD.\nAs a result, the nation\u2019s drug laws remain murky \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with some states allowing an industry that the federal government considers illegal. Ohio voters on Tuesday rejected a ballot measure that would have created a legal marijuana market in the state.\nThe move also establishes Mr. Sanders as one of the most outspoken voices in the 2016 presidential field on the issue of drugs. Though other candidates in both the Republican and Democratic races have expressed interest in reducing the number of nonviolent drug offenders in prison or reducing penalties for using marijuana, Mr. Sanders drew immediate praise from groups opposed to the federal government\u2019s approach to drugs.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the first time a bill to end federal marijuana prohibition has been introduced in the U.S. Senate. A growing majority of Americans want states to be able to enact their own marijuana laws without harassment from the DEA, and lawmakers should listen,\u201d said Tom Angell, chairman of the pro-legalization group Marijuana Majority.\nHillary Clinton \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mr. Sanders\u2019s chief rival for the Democratic nomination \u00e2\u0080\u0094 said she was not prepared to support full legalization of pot but that she supported state efforts.\n\u201cI think that we have the opportunity through the states that are pursuing recreational marijuana to find out a lot more than we know today,\u201d she said during last month\u2019s Democratic debate. She added that she supported reducing the criminal penalties for the use of marijuana.\nThe move to tackle drug use as more of a health issue and less of a criminal justice one is shared across partisan lines.\nRepublican presidential candidate and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who opposes legal marijuana \u00e2\u0080\u0094 said last week that drug addiction can afflict everyone and that it should be treated as a disease.\nAbout drug users, Mr. Christie said in a widely viewed video: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have to stop judging and start giving them the tools they need to get better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMore:\nMarco Rubio Defends Use of Florida GOP Credit Card\nWSJ/NBC Poll Finds Anger at Political System\nElection 2015 Highlights: Who Won, Who Lost?\nRepublican Wins Kentucky Governor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Race\nOhio Defeats Measure to Legalize Marijuana\n______________________________________________________\n2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll Standings\n\n\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops. \r\n\nCapital Journal Daybreak Newsletter: Sign up to get the latest on politics, policy and defense delivered to your inbox every morning.\r\nFor the latest Washington news, follow @wsjpolitics\r\nFor outside analysis, follow @wsjthinktank", "byline": "", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate and Vermont Sen.
