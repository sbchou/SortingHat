"Washington (CNN)Marco Rubio says socialism is distinct from the communism his parents fled in Cuba and he doesn't fault Bernie Sanders for promoting it -- but that doesn't mean he agrees with his Senate colleague.
The Florida Republican corrected a questioner at a ""Life of the Party"" event in New Hampshire Wednesday who compared Sanders' brand of socialism with what Rubio's family fled when they left Cuba.
""In fairness, they fled communism,"" Rubio interjected. ""There is social democracy, right, like you see in Europe, where government provides for every aspect of your life, but there's consequence to that. They fled communism, which is beyond socialism, obviously where government controls society, but also government controls politics, life, the banning of religion, people were being executed.""
RELATED: Rubio dismisses questions about his finances
The questioner took his point, but asked him if he ever wants to tell Sanders that he's going too far.
Rubio disagreed, saying that while he's not a supporter of socialism, he praises Sanders for speaking his mind. 
""What I appreciate about Bernie is he's not trying to shirk from it,"" Rubio said. ""It's what he believes in. He's honest about it.""
He also noted that the viewpoint obviously resonates with plenty of people who support Sanders' presidential campaign and have re-elected him in Vermont.
""I don't think it works for America,"" Rubio said. ""My argument is, you want to live in a country like that -- there's like dozens of countries around the world that are socialist -- move there. We should continue to be America.""
But the beauty of democracy, Rubio added, is that the debate can happen.
""I don't personally have a problem with Bernie because he's being honest about what he believes in. I'd love to have that debate,"" Rubio said. 
While in New Hampshire, Rubio picked up a third endorsement from former Scott Walker state co-chairs, adding the support of Phyllis Woods, according to NH1.

"With no presidential election or congressional seats on the line, Tuesday’s election watchers were focused on some high-profile ballot initiatives, a governor race in Kentucky and a handful of other races. Here are some of the highlights, compiled from the Journal’s reports across the country.

San Francisco voters rejected a ballot measure that would have limited short-term housing rentals to 75 nights a year, a victory for Airbnb Inc., which waged a sophisticated political campaign to defeat it. Proposition F, dubbed the “Airbnb Initiative,” underscored the class tensions roiling San Francisco as a technology boom contributes to rising housing prices in the city. Airbnb, based in San Francisco, deployed veteran field organizers and hundreds of volunteers to defeat the measure, outraising backers 18-1 with an $8 million effort, according to campaign filings.

Republican Matt Bevin won a bitterly fought race for Kentucky governor Tuesday, handing the GOP a coveted seat that extends its hold on the South and imperiling the state’s closely watched implementation of the federal health law. The race between Mr. Bevin, a 48-year-old businessman, and Democrat Jack Conway, the 46-year-old state attorney general, was the most high-profile of three gubernatorial contests this year. The candidates were vying to succeed Gov. Steve Beshear, a popular Democrat who was barred by law from running for a third term. In another race, Republican Gov. Phil Bryant of Mississippi easily won re-election against Democrat Robert Gray, a little-known truck driver. Read the full article.

In a victory for social conservatives, voters in Houston overwhelmingly rejected a ballot measure to extend nondiscrimination protections to gay and transgender people. Known as the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, or HERO, the measure would have banned discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, race and a dozen other categories. It was backed heavily by Houston Mayor Annise Parker and a cadre of national Democratic political figures, and proponents poured more than $3 million into the push to pass it. Read the full article.

Ohio voters rejected a ballot measure legalizing marijuana for recreational and medical uses, dealing a blow to pot industry investors looking to build on a series of ballot victories across the country. The Ohio marijuana measure has been controversial from the start, and not just because it was trying to legalize marijuana in the Midwest. Local investors in the pot industry were behind the ballot initiative, spending more than $20 million to collect signatures to force a statewide vote and then funding the campaign to try to win its passage.

Former Bridgeport Mayor Joseph Ganim, who spent seven years in prison after he was convicted on corruption charges, was returned to office Tuesday, completing a stunning political comeback in the state’s most populous city. The 56-year old Democrat beat six opponents. He was the front-runner in the mayoral race, having secured the endorsement of the local Democratic Party and winning a a three-way primary in September.

Presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina will be sharing her views with Joy Behar, Raven Symone and the other co-hosts of ABC’s mid-morning talk show, “The View,” but the network allegedly tried to reschedule her Friday appearance just days before it is set to take place.
Despite a highly publicized back-and-forth between the ladies of “The View” and Fiorina during the past several days, according to Fiorina’s deputy campaign manager Sarah Isgur Flores, ABC wanted to push off Fiorina’s sit-down until the day after the next Republican debate.
Flores said during “The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson” on Wednesday that after some confusion, Friday’s appearance is set.
“As far as I know, we are still confirmed for Friday,” she said. “I hope that they'll continue to have us on. We are certainly looking forward to hearing what they have to say to Carly’s face, and hopefully they will want to talk about the issues instead of doubling down on these catty remarks.”
A rep for “The View” told FOX411 on Wednesday morning that Fiorina would appear on Friday as planned. A promo for the Fiorina appearance ran during Wednesday’s episode of “The View.”
During that episode, while speaking about Jeb Bush, host Whoopi Goldberg discussed why she feels politicians should come on “The View.”

“If you can’t handle us, you… can’t be president,” Goldberg said. “There’s all kind of folks, and we don’t necessarily agree with all your politics… so come on. We’re interested. We want to let our folks know what’s going on.”  On Oct. 29, Behar and Michelle Collins ridiculed Fiorina’s last debate appearance. The hosts branded her smile “demented” and suggested there should be a “smiling Fiorina” Halloween mask on shelves.
The presidential candidate responded to the comments on “Fox News Sunday.” She said she is “tired of being insulted by liberal feminists.”
“It will not stop me. It will not scare me,” Fiorina declared. “... Let’s see if they have the guts to say that to my face.”
During Monday’s episode of the show, Goldberg responded to Fiorina’s criticism of the show.
“Just so we’re all clear, you have to know the difference between when somebody’s coming for you, when somebody is paying you a compliment and when somebody is saying, ‘here’s my observation,’” she said. “If you can get that together, maybe you can be president.”",,"Despite a highly publicized back-and-forth between the ladies of “The View” and Fiorina during the past several days, according to Fiorina’s campaign manager Sarah Isgur Flores, ABC wanted to push off Fiorina’s sit-down until the day after the next Republican debate.",‘The View’ tried to postpone Carly Fiorina appearance?,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/entertainment/~3/ZXE3E25LA7s/,[u'personality'],"[u'Jeb Bush', u'Gretchen Carlson', u'Sarah Isgur Flores', u'Michelle Collins', u'Carly Fiorina', u'Whoopi Goldberg', u'Joy Behar']",fox,0.49648703051649634,[],2015-11-04 19:25:28,[],c6ae6e95f02f88c4ba2bf8f1542d137b,2015-11-04 19:56:40.583562

“Good Morning America” co-host Lara Spencer got flak on Tuesday when she seemed to post an Instagram pic of herself sitting on presidential candidate Donald Trump’s lap.
Comments on the shot, which appeared to show smiling Spencer and Trump with his arm around her and his own grin, included “Unprofessional,” “Gross!” and “You are a professional. Sitting on his lap. Really? I think it’s inappropriate.”
Another countered, “These comments display what is wrong with America. Lighten up people!”
But ABC reps explained the image was an optical illusion. Trump was seated on the “GMA” set on a tall chair at a table, and Spencer was standing next to him. Spencer also changed the pic’s caption to clear up any confusion.





Let’s clear this up – I’m standing next to Donald Trump. Said a quick hello and welcomed him to the GMA studio for first time since he announced his candidacy.

" (CNN)France has long been a punching bag for U.S. conservatives, but Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush has jokingly apologized for one jab he made that he says in retrospect went too far.
Bush's original comment came last week when he criticized rival Marco Rubio in a Republican debate over his poor voting record. 
""The Senate, what is it like, a French work week?"" Bush said. ""You get, like, three days where you have to show up?""
Speaking to reporters on his campaign bus on Tuesday, the former Florida governor said, ""I made the mistake of saying that the Congress operates on a French work week,"" according to Time magazine. 
""I really did a disservice to the French,"" Bush continued with a chuckle, adding shortly thereafter. ""I now know that the average French work week is actually greater than the German work week.""
""So, my God, I totally insulted an entire country -- our first ally -- that helped us become free as a nation! And I apologize. That did a huge disservice to France. It didn't really get to the magnitude of the problem: Three-day work week.""
CNN has reached to the Bush campaign for additional comment.
French media pounced on the debate statement shortly after it came out, poking holes in the description and calling it a false stereotype. 
The Bush campaign dismissed these rebuttals. 
""Not too concerned about attacks from the French media,"" Bush communications director Tim Miller told CNNMoney. ""Jeb's working far more than 40 hours a week!""
""French"" is a familiar smear in conservative circles. In the 2004 presidential election, Republicans repeatedly taunted John Kerry for being too French-like. And the GOP famously led efforts to change French fries to freedom fries in Capitol Hill cafeterias.

"Washington (CNN)Racial discrimination in America has come a long way from the days of forced segregation, but there's still a long way to go, Sen. Marco Rubio said Wednesday.
The rising GOP presidential candidate waxed about the nation's history with racism and the current state of discrimination Wednesday in response to questions at a campaign event with young professionals in New Hampshire. He noted a change that has occurred from his parents first encounter with segregation in America to his kids' interactions with their friends today.
The Florida Republican said it gives him hope to see how little his children pay attention to skin color with their predominantly African-American football team, even compared to his own awareness of race at the same age. But he acknowledged generational change takes time.
""In the short term, I believe we do need to address the reality in this country that there are millions of people who feel that because of the color of their skin, they're followed at the mall, they're treated differently,"" Rubio said. ""If a significant percentage of the American family feels this way, it's an issue. We have to talk about it.""
RELATED: Clinton protested by Black Lives Matter 
Race relations in America have been a flashpoint on the campaign trail this year, brought into sharper focus by the Black Lives Matter movement and the tension over police shootings of unarmed African-Americans.
Rubio was careful to add that he doesn't support anti-police rhetoric.
""I don't think the answer to it, however, is to demonize police officers,"" he said. 
But he said that even if people don't see discrimination themselves, they need to listen to people who do. 
""The reality of it is that there's a significant percentage of Americans, African-Americans, particularly young males, who feel discriminated against,"" Rubio said. ""And if they feel discriminated that way, whether you agree with it or not, if they feel that way, it's a problem. ... I know people that feel that way, who tell me this, and in some instances, I've actually seen it as well.""
The conversation began when a questioner asked Rubio what part of American history he would like to erase, excluding the obvious answer of slavery. He said that even after the Civil War, racial discrimination was ""pronounced.""
He told a story of how his parents once were driving to Miami when their car broke down ""somewhere in the South, they believe it was South Carolina.""
""It was the first chance they ever interacted with segregation,"" Rubio said. ""Because Cuba had cultural segregation ... but it didn't have legal segregation, so for them, that was a shocking experience.""
He said his parents asked an African-American woman about where to catch a movie and she replied she wasn't allowed in. 
""That's a period that I think took too long to resolve, that period from the end of slavery to the civil rights era, that just lingered way too long. It obviously should have never happened, but that's a period I wish we could have as a nation have avoided and dealt with much quicker,"" Rubio said.
Rubio has embraced his own minority status on the trail, speaking of his family's American Dream-like story of arriving in the U.S. after fleeing communism in Cuba.
Earlier on Wednesday, Rubio noted on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that three of the top four Republicans in the race right now are minorities: himself, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.
""(It) speaks a lot to the diversity of the Republican Party and the strength of our party,"" Rubio said.

 (CNN)On Tuesday, Donald Trump, who would like to be our President, retweeted a message about Jeb Bush.  It featured a swastika among its gallery of Bush-bashing images. And with this tweet, Trump has outdone himself in doing whatever he can to stay in the headlines through sensationalist attacks on his rivals. 
He has mocked candidate Bush before on the grounds of patriotism, painting him as somehow less American because he speaks Spanish at home and when addressing Hispanic audiences. This time, perhaps worried about his declining status after his uneven performance in the last GOP candidates' debate, Trump went for the sure shot on social media, and included the most recognizable symbol of Nazism. 
As offensive as this montage is, we can be thankful that he posted it. Images have their own way of telling stories. They are often used in political propaganda to elicit a visceral reaction -- outrage, laughter, identification -- and they reveal things their creators are not able or willing to say with words. 
A grouping of images, intended to spark certain associations, is even more useful in reading how someone thinks about a given person or subject.
So what can we learn from these pictures that can be useful in evaluating him as a potential president? First, the depth of his attachment to a politics of prejudice that disdains and distrusts all those who are not white and of European Christian heritage. 
In the logic of Trumpworld, Jeb Bush is a straw man -- he even wears a sombrero, in one image -- for all Americans who are soft on immigration and thus soft in body and character. Bush is ""Forrest Bush,"" as another image proclaims, a weak and backward man who will leave our country unprotected for ""animals"" to come through (one of the cartoons in the assemblage shows a strange, monkey-like creature featured breaching our borders). 
Hate politics, from Nazism onward, thrive on paranoia. In Trump's hands, Jeb Bush becomes that stock figure of propaganda, the internal enemy who masquerades as a patriot but whose interests are really against the nation. Trump's tabloid-style graphics to associate Bush with foreigners (his Mexican-born wife occupies a central place in the gallery), with ""the Bush criminal family"" and their campaign to reclaim, through Bush, a ruined empire (cue the image of a broken crown).  
And here we come to the swastika, which is on a flag that comes out of the barrel of a gun, flanked by portraits of Jeb Bush and his ""criminal"" family. ""Evil Runs Deep,"" the lurid font proclaims. This image is so exaggerated as to become parody. But the use of the gun, together with the swastika, also contains a reveal about which Americans Trump aims to please with his platform. 
For the swastika is not a dead symbol, but one used -- sometimes together with the Confederate flag -- by American white supremacists. Featuring a swastika and a gun on American social media just months after the Charleston church massacre --  in which Dylann Roof (shown in pictures displaying the Confederate flag) slaughtered nine people in a black church -- sends a message to those who want to hear it: Trump is not only anti-immigrant, but pro-white. 
In fact, one could conclude that Trump's relentless insults of Jeb Bush, and his depiction of Bush as a stereotypical Mexican -- witness the image of Bush playing the guitar, against a landscape of cacti, wearing a sombrero -- are a means of attacking some of his other Republican presidential rivals, who actually are Hispanic, and who are actually political threats to him: the Cuban-Americans Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. 
And that, too, is a classic operation of political propaganda, as perfected by the Nazis: Make one group, or person, stand in for the perceived faults of others. This latest retweet may remind us of Trump's mastery of social media, but his crude gallery of images is proof of his unworthiness of the presidency.

"The Republican presidential candidates were infuriated by last week's CNBC debate. They felt the tone was hostile, the questions were ""gotcha,"" and the whole thing reeked of liberal media bias. As a result, the candidates have joined forces to craft a new debate format, one that will better and more fairly allow them to expound their views to the American people. Here's an advance look at the result:
HANNITY: Hi, I'm Sean Hannity and these are my fellow moderators, Ann Coulter and 
Rush Limbaugh
. Let's get right to it. This first question calls for a show of hands. If you think America is the greatest country in the entire universe, raise your hand. [All hands go up except for Dr. 
Ben Carson
's]
HANNITY: You disagree, Dr. Carson?
CARSON: [Inaudible]
HANNITY: I'm sorry, Doctor. Could you please speak up?
CARSON: I said there's a problem with the question. I would say America is the greatest country in the entire universe and any parallel universes. [All hands go up. Applause.]
COULTER: Mr. Trump, you have said you will build a wall to keep Mexican illegals out of the country and that you will make the Mexican government pay for it. The obvious question is: How high do you think that wall should be?
TRUMP: Good question, Ann. Here's the good news. Mexicans are not very tall. That's why you don't see any in the NBA. That means a six, seven foot wall should do the job.
HUCKABEE: If I can follow up.
COULTER: I'm sorry, Governor, we need to move on. [Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, walks hurriedly on stage and whispers in Coulter's ear.] My deepest apologies, Governor, I didn't mean to interrupt.
HUCKABEE: I was just going to add that this is yet another example of how God has blessed this country. Just think if we shared a border with Africa. Then we'd need a much taller wall and the costs would soar. [Applause]
LIMBAUGH: This question is for Senator Cruz. What's your favorite color?
CRUZ: It's not one color, Rush. It's three. Red, white and blue. [Thunderous applause]
LIMBAUGH: What about you, Governor Bush?
BUSH: Gosh, brown maybe.
COULTER: Senator Rubio, you've been described as young, handsome, virile, a powerful and attractive politician with great appeal to women voters.
RUBIO: What's the question?
COULTER: No question.
HANNITY: Senator Paul, I'd like to try a word association exercise with you.
PAUL: First I want to address something very important that was discussed earlier. Cyan.
HANNITY: Pardon?
PAUL: That's my favorite color.
HANNITY: Let me try this with you, Mrs. Fiorina. When I say ""Obamacare,"" what's the first word that comes to mind?
FIORINA: A failed socialist experiment that was forced down the throats of the American people, which has resulted in thousands of lost jobs, skyrocketing insurance premiums, extreme tornadic activity in the Southwest and a tenfold rise in skin eruptions. [Applause]
COULTER: Governor Kasich, when Hillary Clinton goes to prison for her Benghazi crimes, you just know there's going to be a hue and cry from the liberal media to pardon her. Will you?
KASICH: In Ohio, we've lowered—
COULTER: What about you, Governor Christie?
CHRISTIE: Hell no, I wouldn't pardon her. I'd make sure she served every day of her sentence.
CRUZ: If I could jump in here. I agree with the governor, but I would go further. I would use all the powers of the presidency to make certain she served her entire sentence in solitary confinement.
CHRISTIE: I thought that was a given.
FIORINA: I'd also deny her visitors and reduce her food intake to water and dog kibble every other day.
HANNITY: That's all the time we have. I want to thank all the candidates for participating in tonight's debate.
BUSH: You know what? I think I may prefer beige.

Conservatives across the country issued a stinging rebuke to President Obama and the Democratic Party Tuesday night. In Kentucky, Republicans notched huge wins for governor and other statewide offices. In a race most believed leaned slightly to the Democrats, Tea Party favorite Matt Bevin pulled off the surprise easy victory despite several missteps. His win gives the Bluegrass State only its second Republican governor in the past 40 years. But the blowback didn't stop there. In Houston, voters repealed a law to protect gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination with the slogan — ""No men in women's bathrooms."" In Ohio, they rejected a referendum to legalize marijuana in the state. And in Virginia, despite millions in ads pushing gun-control measures, Democrats still failed to take back the state Senate. The results cap off yet another disappointing election cycle for Democrats ever since President Obama entered the White House. While they've managed to construct a strong coalition in presidential years, it's conservatives who have been more motivated to turn out to the polls during both midterm and off-year elections. Since 2010, Democrats have lost control of both the House and Senate. A dozen governorships have turned from blue to red, along with many state legislative chambers. Democrats have especially suffered Obama drag in the South. Even moderate, Blue Dog Democrats couldn't survive: the last white Southern Democrat in the House lost last year, and Republicans flipped four Senate seats in the region last year. The troubling sign for Democrats is that Tuesday's rebuke didn't simply come from the South — it was against liberal policies in more Democratic-friendly areas like Ohio and Houston. Here's a rundown of what happened on Election Night. Kentucky The victory of Bevin — a man despised just a year ago by the GOP establishment in the state after he tried to unseat Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the primary — shows Democrats' grip on their last remaining stronghold in the South has disappeared. Democrats had still managed to cling to the Bluegrass State, and polls even showed that Attorney General Jack Conway had the edge going into Election Day. He had hoped to ride the coattails of popular term-limited Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear and the state's successful Obamacare exchange ""Kynect"" to victory.

But the anti-Obama tide proved be too much. The Republican Governors Association spent $2.5 million in the final weeks, mostly on ads and mailers tying Conway to Obama. Though local Democrats hoped voters would be able to differentiate state races from national ones, in Kentucky Tuesday they did not. The victory came despite poor reviews for Bevin on the trail and Democrats' arguments that he was too far right for the state. Democrats tried to spin the venture capitalist's win, somewhat bizarrely arguing that Conway ""ran into the unexpected headwinds of Trump-mania, losing to an outsider candidate in the Year of the Outsider."" The loss had other reverberations, too — state Auditor Adam Edelen, who was seen as a possible challenger to Sen. Rand Paul next year — lost his reelection bid. Bevin's win also puts the future of Kynect, the state's successful health care exchange, up in the air. As NBC's Perry Bacon noted, Bevin has said he would get rid of the exchange program, which could leave thousands without insurance coverage, but he's softened his stance on allowing Medicare expansion in the state. Houston Social conservatives were successful in repealing an anti-LGBT discrimination bill with a simple slogan: ""No Men In Women's Bathrooms."" The bill extended to far more than which bathroom transgender persons could use, also protecting them from employment discrimination and housing bias, among other civil rights protections and is similar to many other measures across the country. The bill's rejection is a blow to Mayor Annise Parker, who became the first openly gay mayor of a major city when she won in 2009. Parker rallied celebrities and corporations to her side, like Apple and actress Sally Field. But opponents, who branded it the ""bathroom bill"" framed their argument as one of child safety, said it would enable sexual predators. With the backing of the faith community, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and even a former Houston Astros star, the groups opposing it ran an effective campaign with persuasive ads like this one:

The law's repeal could have other reverberations — the Super Bowl is scheduled to be in Houston in 2017. ""I don't think it's the straw that creates the imbalance where you don't get a Super Bowl or lose a Super Bowl, but it's definitely part of the equation when people make decisions,"" Ric Campo, who is chairing the city's Super Bowl host committee, told the New York Times. To that, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is against the law, said, per the Times, ""If Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner, 'would even suggest that the Super Bowl not be played here because we don't want men in ladies' bathrooms, then we need a new commissioner.'""

A statewide referendum to legalize recreational and medical marijuana overwhelmingly failed in Ohio. Advocates had launched a $20 million campaign in favor of its passage, including the creation of ""Buddie"" the marijuana mascot. The subsequent marijuana farms the measure would have produced would have been big windfalls for its backers, including former 98 Degrees frontman Nick Lachey. Opponents, however, successfully framed it as a danger to families and children. ""At a time when too many families are being torn apart by drug abuse, Ohioans said no to easy access to drugs and instead chose a path that helps strengthen our families and communities,"" Republican Gov. John Kasich, a presidential candidate, said in a statement. Virginia Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe's push to turn the state Senate blue was dashed Tuesday, despite crisscrossing the commonwealth for nearly the past month and a heavy push from outside groups over gun control. Instead, Republicans' slim one-vote advantage held in the upper chamber. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's gun-control group put $2.3 million into the state, running ads hitting two Republican candidates over the issue just weeks after two reporters had been gunned down on live TV at a Roanoke, Va., station. The National Rifle Association and other groups pushed back with their own ads. It's a blow to the progressive agenda McAuliffe, who was elected in 2013, wants to push through on education, Medicaid expansion and more. But it would have also helped his push to deliver the critical swing state for his longtime friend and close ally Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race, if she emerges as the nominee.

Presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina will be sharing her views with Joy Behar, Raven Symone and the other co-hosts of ABC’s mid-morning talk show, “The View,” but the network allegedly tried to reschedule her Friday appearance just days before it is set to take place.
Despite a highly publicized back-and-forth between the ladies of “The View” and Fiorina during the past several days, according to Fiorina’s deputy campaign manager Sarah Isgur Flores, ABC wanted to push off Fiorina’s sit-down until the day after the next Republican debate.
Flores said during “The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson” on Wednesday that after some confusion, Friday’s appearance is set.
“As far as I know, we are still confirmed for Friday,” she said. “I hope that they'll continue to have us on. We are certainly looking forward to hearing what they have to say to Carly’s face, and hopefully they will want to talk about the issues instead of doubling down on these catty remarks.”
A rep for “The View” told FOX411 on Wednesday morning that Fiorina would appear on Friday as planned. A promo for the Fiorina appearance ran during Wednesday’s episode of “The View.”
During that episode, while speaking about Jeb Bush, host Whoopi Goldberg discussed why she feels politicians should come on “The View.”

“If you can’t handle us, you… can’t be president,” Goldberg said. “There’s all kind of folks, and we don’t necessarily agree with all your politics… so come on. We’re interested. We want to let our folks know what’s going on.”  On Oct. 29, Behar and Michelle Collins ridiculed Fiorina’s last debate appearance. The hosts branded her smile “demented” and suggested there should be a “smiling Fiorina” Halloween mask on shelves.
The presidential candidate responded to the comments on “Fox News Sunday.” She said she is “tired of being insulted by liberal feminists.”
“It will not stop me. It will not scare me,” Fiorina declared. “... Let’s see if they have the guts to say that to my face.”
During Monday’s episode of the show, Goldberg responded to Fiorina’s criticism of the show.
“Just so we’re all clear, you have to know the difference between when somebody’s coming for you, when somebody is paying you a compliment and when somebody is saying, ‘here’s my observation,’” she said. “If you can get that together, maybe you can be president.”",,,'View' tried to postpone Carly,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2015/11/04/view-tried-to-postpone-carly-fiorina-appearance/,[u'personality'],"[u'Jeb Bush', u'Gretchen Carlson', u'Sarah Isgur Flores', u'Michelle Collins', u'Carly Fiorina', u'Whoopi Goldberg', u'Joy Behar']",fox,0.49648703051649634,[],2015-11-04 19:58:08,[],642bb85b700d3f3ec68d90c74f07d547,2015-11-04 20:22:49.252499
"(New throughout, adds comments from Sanders)
By Amanda Becker
WASHINGTON Nov 4 (Reuters) - Democratic presidential
contender Bernie Sanders on Wednesday unveiled a climate-change
bill that would crack down on fossil fuel extraction, a move
sure to please activists who want party front-runner Hillary
Clinton to make the same commitment.
Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, wants to halt new
leases for fossil fuel extraction on public lands and for
offshore drilling in the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico. He would
prohibit drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic Ocean.
Sanders pushed for the proposal at a rally at the U.S.
Capitol on Wednesday, alongside environmental leaders such as
Bill McKibben, co-founder of the grassroots climate group
350.org.
The bill, which Sanders introduced with a fellow Democrat,
U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, will face fierce opposition
in the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and is unlikely to
become law.
But it should help Sanders appeal to environmental activists
and could pressure Clinton, who has said that abruptly halting
extraction on federal lands would disrupt the U.S. economy.
""You can't talk the talk...and at the same time say we are
going to extract,"" Sanders said on Wednesday, adding that the
U.S. must protect workers as it moves away from fossil fuels.
Sanders, who calls himself a democratic socialist, has been
Clinton's main rival to be the party's nominee for president in
the November 2016 elections.
His liberal stances on the environment, trade and more have
pressured Clinton to move to the left on those issues. Still,
polls have shown the former U.S. secretary of state appeared to
gain ground against Sanders after a strong showing in October.
Climate activists want Clinton to commit to be tougher on
environmental issues if she is elected president.
Clinton told an activist at a New Hampshire town hall in
July that it would be irresponsible to abruptly halt oil,
natural gas and coal extraction on federal lands. She instead
called for phasing it out and increasing fees on companies
operating on public lands.
""We still have to run our economy, we still have to turn on
the lights,"" Clinton said.
Clinton in August opposed Arctic oil exploration, putting
her at odds with the Obama administration, which had just given
Royal Dutch Shell PLC final approval to resume drilling
off the coast of northern Alaska.

" (AP) â State and local elections across the country this week produced warning signs for both Democrats and Republicans as they press toward the 2016 presidential contest, now just a year away.
Democrats lost more ground in legislatures and governor's mansions, raising questions about the party's strength when President Barack Obama's name isn't at the top of the ballot. Democrats still have important demographic advantages in the states that often determine presidential elections, but the party is struggling in power centers outside Washington that influence policy and steer congressional redistricting.
The GOP is casting its victory in the Kentucky gubernatorial race as a blueprint for how Republicans can run successfully against Obama's signature health care law.
But the elections weren't all good news for the Republicans. For party leaders anxious about Donald Trump and Ben Carson's lead in the GOP presidential primary, the win in Kentucky for Matt Bevin â a wealthy businessman who has never held political office â could be a sign that many voters are serious about electing outsider candidates.
Party leaders are skeptical that outsiders' rebellious appeal will be sufficiently deep and lasting to send such a candidate to the White House.
""We're at this interesting moment where clearly there's a lot of frustration in the electorate, which means voters are going to be more volatile,"" said David Winston, a Republican pollster.
To be sure, off-year elections are imperfect predictors of presidential contests. Turnout is far lower and the voters who do show up tend to be older and less diverse, favoring Republicans.
Still, Tuesday's contests across the country are being scoured for signs of the electorate's mood less than three months before the lead-off Iowa caucuses.
For Democrats, results in Kentucky, Virginia and elsewhere were part of a troubling pattern. Since Obama was elected in 2008, the party has lost 12 governorships and more than 900 state legislative seats, ceding control of 30 legislative chambers. On Capitol Hill, Democrats have given up control of both the House and Senate.
The fresh losses raise serious questions for Democrats about how the party will fare next year when Obama isn't on the ticket. It's also raising questions about where Democrats will draw their next generation of leaders.
Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, is making specific campaign appeals to the Hispanics, blacks and young voters who helped propel Obama to victory. And she's promising she'll work to help candidates down the ballot win their races, too.
The Democratic defeats have implications for policies as well as politics. While most Democratic governors have expanded their states' Medicaid coverage under the federal Affordable Care Act, several Republicans have resisted, including in Florida and Texas. Democratic Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe tried to expand Medicaid but was blocked by Republicans.
Democrats' efforts to fully implement ""Obamacare"" got even harder Tuesday. McAuliffe failed in his campaign to put Virginia's legislature back in Democratic hands. And in Kentucky, Bevin won in part on a pledge to repeal the state's Medicaid expansion, propelling a Republican into the state's governor's mansion for just the second time in four decades.
Bevin cast himself as a political outsider, one who was self-funded and shunned by Kentucky's political establishment after he challenged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the 2014 GOP Senate primary. It's an approach that fits with the outsider appeal of Trump and Carson, who are roiling the GOP presidential primary and worrying establishment Republicans who fear neither of them could defeat Clinton in a general election.
Asked Wednesday whether Bevin's win bodes well for his own political future, Trump sounded confident. He said, ""There is something happening, folks, I will tell you. There is something happening.""
In an interview with The Associated Press, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who is struggling in the GOP presidential polls, aligned himself with Bevin's success as a political outsider.
""That's the same thing I ran on when I ran in 2010,"" Paul said of his Senate victory five years ago.
Bevin wasn't the only outsider who won this week. In Mississippi, Republican poultry and cattle farmer Vince Mangold made his political debut by ousting Democratic House Minority Leader Bobby Moak, who had been in office for 30 years.
Republicans targeted Moak with mailers displaying his photo next to Obama's under the headline, ""Bobby Moak and Barack Obama ... A Liberal Love Affair."" Mangold said he campaigned on lower taxes and a good education system, but he attributed his victory not to any particular policy stances but to his outsider status.
""As I traveled around the district, the overwhelming reply was they were ready for a change,"" Mangold said Wednesday.

"We don’t know yet whether Republican Matt Bevin, who was elected governor of Kentucky on Tuesday, will try to abolish the Medicaid expansion put in place by outgoing Gov. Steve Beshear (D.), attempt to cap enrollment, or do nothing at all. But his election sets up new discussion of Republican attitudes toward Medicaid expansion.
Thirty states have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act since the Supreme Court made it a state option in 2012. Ten of them have Republican governors, two of whom are presidential candidates, John Kasich and Chris Christie. If, however, you follow campaign commentary on cable TV you would think expanding Medicaid is a political black mark in the eyes of all Republicans. To be sure, the most activated elements of the GOP base–conservative campaign contributors, super PACs, and conservative legislators–oppose Medicaid expansion, primarily because they see it more as embracing Obamacare than providing federal funding to states to help them expand coverage for low-income residents. But the limited polling the Kaiser Family Foundation has done on the issue has found that most Republicans do not oppose Medicaid expansion. In fact, they favor it.
In a December 2014 poll, 52% of Republicans said they had a favorable view of Medicaid expansion, 44% had an unfavorable view, and 3% did not voice an opinion. In the same poll, as the chart above shows, 56% of Republicans in states that had not expanded Medicaid had a very favorable (23%) or somewhat favorable (33%) view of expansion. This survey was conducted too far in advance of the 2016 primary elections to poll likely Republican voters. Views were also different in two strongly anti-expansion states in polling Kaiser did with the New York Times in 2014. A majority of Republicans in Louisiana (66%) and North Carolina (53%) preferred that their state keep Medicaid as is.
We don’t know from the polling why most Republicans say they support expansion. Gov. Kasich has argued that expansion is a moral imperative and that he sees it as broadening Ohio’s Medicaid program rather than embracing Obamacare, which he opposes. We do know that 47% of Republicans in a May 2015 poll said Medicaid was a very important program; only 14% said it is not an important program. But that is far fewer than the 69% who said Medicare was a very important program. As might not be surprising, given their generally higher income levels, fewer Republicans (35%) than Democrats (61%) say Medicaid is important to them or their family.
That even a slim majority of Republicans favor expansion is notable given the tone of debate on this issue on the campaign trail, where expansion has become like a third rail for GOP candidates. This is not to suggest that Republican candidates or governors who oppose Medicaid expansion in conservative states will be anxious to flip any time soon. But Medicaid may not be as unpopular with Republicans overall as the conventional wisdom suggests, and other issues may be more salient for Republican voters in primary and general elections across the country than opposition to Medicaid expansion.

"NEW YORK (AP) â Pressure continued to mount on NBC to cancel Donald Trump's guest-host appearance on this weekend's ""Saturday Night Live"" as a coalition of advocacy groups delivered petitions to the network Wednesday calling for him to be dropped from the show.
The petitions delivered to 30 Rockefeller Plaza, home of NBC and ""Saturday Night Live,"" marked the latest attempts to dissuade the network from allowing the Republican presidential hopeful to host the show, with the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda earlier asking that NBC reconsider the decision.
""There's mounting evidence that Donald Trump's racist demagoguery is resulting in real-world violence and physical and verbal intimidation,"" Mushed Zaheed, deputy political director of Credo Action, one of the participating groups, said in a statement.
In advance of the show, NBC released promotional spots featuring Trump that included one in which he refers to a Republican opponent, Ben Carson, as ""a complete and total loser.""
Trump drew fire early in his campaign when, as the billionaire developer announced his candidacy, he described some Mexicans who are in the United States illegally as criminals and rapists, prompting NBC to sever its Miss Universe ties with Trump while declaring he would never again appear on ""The Celebrity Apprentice.""
""It is shameful for 'SNL' and NBC to think that racism can be repackaged as comedy,"" said Juan Escalante, digital campaigns manager for America's Voice, another group participating in the coalition.
Other participating groups included the National Hispanic Media Coalition, MoveOn.org and National Council of La Raza. About two-dozen protesters were on hand as the petitions were delivered to NBC's midtown Manhattan offices. Some chanted ""dump Trump"" and carried signs bearing the same phrase.
The coalition is accusing NBC of reversing itself for the sake of a ratings windfall while granting Trump ""a free national platform to bolster his racist and xenophobic campaign,"" Zaheed said.
Alex Nogales, president of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, said after delivering the petitions that the protest effort was not over. His group and others would use the days leading up to the broadcast to call on ""SNL"" sponsors to remove their commercials from Saturday's show, he said.
NBC declined comment on the petitions and did not immediately comment on the attempt to get ads pulled.
Meanwhile, Trump drew sharp criticism in an online letter with the names of dozens of prominent writers, filmmakers, academics and others from the United States, Spain and Latin America attached to it, including Oscar-winning writer-director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu  (""Birdman: Or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"").
""We refuse to keep silent in the face of the alarming declarations of the candidate for the presidency of the United States Donald Trump,"" the letter posted Tuesday reads. ""His hate speech appeals to the lowest passions like xenophobia, machismo, political intolerance and religious dogmatism.""
The letter calls on the American people to ""cease to tolerate his absurd positions.""
Trump has played a major role in delivering record-breaking ratings to the first three Republican debates and has been a sought-after guest on talk shows and newscasts.
Asked about the opposition to his upcoming appearance while promoting his new book in New York on Tuesday, Trump said he was pleased to hear demonstrations were already underway.
""Look, I think they should demonstrate"" he said. ""Ratings will go even higher than they are going to be. It's going to be one of their highest-rated shows ever and they're very excited about it.""
Asked specifically about the petition, he said: ""It's only going to make it hotter.""
Trump also repeated his frequent assertion that he has great relationship with Hispanics, with tens of thousands working for him over the years, he said.
Saturday's appearance will be an ""SNL"" encore for Trump, who first hosted the show in April 2004, long before his entry into politics, as the breakout star of NBC's new competition show ""The Apprentice.""
He appeared on CNN's ""New Day"" on Wednesday, where anchor Chris Cuomo voiced surprise that NBC booked him.
""I thought you were at war with them,"" said Cuomo, ""then all of a sudden they wanted to have you on. You say it's because of ratings.""
""You're never at war when you get great ratings with a network, OK?"" Trump replied. ""Nobody gets ratings like me.""
He went on to say that initially he was asked to do a single sketch on Saturday's show. Then ""SNL"" executive producer Lorne Michaels had second thoughts and asked Trump if he would host the entire 90-minute program. ""And I said, 'You know what? I would.' Because it's an honor.""
""Every single major politician in this country probably for 30 years has done 'Saturday Night Live' if they're invited,"" Trump added. ""If they're invited.""

" (CNN)One year out from the 2016 general election, voters in off-year races across the country on Tuesday offered some signs of things to come — and presented the presidential candidates with tea leaves to read as they sharpen their campaign strategies.
By evening's end, Republicans were the ones crowing, as they scored a surprise win in a hotly contested governor's race in Kentucky while keeping control of the state Senate in Virginia, despite a big spending onslaught from former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's gun-control group. 
""Tonight was another key test for Dems, Clinton, and their party's field [organization] and once again they failed to deliver,"" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tweeted shortly before midnight.
By contrast, Democrats were a little on the quiet side. A stinging defeat in Houston, where voters rolled back an ordinance that had expanded nondiscrimination protections to LGBT people, illustrated the risks attached to ballot initiative tactics that the party has increasingly used as a means of advancing its policy goals when blocked by the GOP.
Here are takeaways from Tuesday's results and what they mean for 2016: 

The tea party scored a significant win in Kentucky, where one of its own, Matt Bevin, overcame a late deficit and a series of missteps on the stump to defeat Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway by a handy margin, 53% to 44%. Bevin, who has promised to dismantle the state's successful Obamacare exchange, will now have that opportunity.
A disaster for President Barack Obama's signature initiative? Not quite. Supporters of the Affordable Care Act believe that Republicans could face a backlash if Bevin goes ahead with his pledge.
""He's the dog who caught the car,"" on Democratic strategist told CNN, ""and I think he's going to have a real problem using up all of his political capital taking health care away from 400,000 of his constituents.""
In fact, toward the end of the campaign, Bevin had already begun to soften his rhetoric against the state's Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. 
But Republican consultant Liz Mair sees the wealthy businessman's win as the latest sign that any attachment to the controversial program -- which the Democrat candidate had planned to preserve -- is still poison at the polls. 
""Last night seems to continue to evidence that Obamacare is a big liability and is a problem for people who are running on it,"" she said, ""and people who are associated with it by virtue of their partisan identity.""

The commonwealth has been caught between a Democratic governor, Clinton pal Terry McAuliffe, and a heavily Republican state House of Representatives. But its state Senate entered Tuesday very much up for grabs. 
In the end though, the GOP retained its advantage -- and its ability to handcuff the Democratic administration from pursuing its legislative agenda.
That includes a push for stricter gun-control laws, which have become a staple of Hillary Clinton's pitch to more liberal Democratic primary voters.
Bloomberg's ""Everytown for Gun Safety"" group, which sunk millions into the Virginia contests to wrest control of the state Senate, took heart from one high-profile victory. In the state's 29th district, voters tapped a Democrat, Jeremy McPike, who was backed by $1.5 million in advertisements from Everytown, including one featuring Andy Parker, the father of slain local news reporter Ashley Parker.
""Gun safety prevailed on the NRA's home turf because we made sure that every voter knew where the candidates stood on gun safety,"" Everytown president John Feinblatt said in a statement.
The win, he added, is ""just the latest example of how candidates are paying the price for being out of step with Americans who demand that their leaders take action to prevent gun violence.""

If Republicans won the most notable contest of the off-year 2015 Election Day in Kentucky, Democrats scored a number of number of lower-profile but potentially significant victories through ballot initiatives.
Democrats and supporters of campaign finance reform won hard fought and expensive battles in Seattle and Maine, where voters boosted initiatives to amp up public financing of elections.
""We as a movement have not had a great example to point to when people ask what kind of reform are you talking about, what is the actual path forward,"" said Szelena Gray, a co-founder of Run for America, which seeks to draft fresh faces into politics. ""We often have to speak in vague terms because there aren't a lot of solutions to point to and say this is working really well, let's grow this."" 
But with Tuesday's vote, she said, the sale became a whole lot easier for more liberal candidates like Clinton and Bernie Sanders. 
""With the actual first passage of the ballot for 'democracy vouchers' in Seattle, you've taken something that up until now is just a concept, a theory and turned into something we can point to very concretely and say, 'Here is what the systems looks like, here is how it's working',"" Gray said. ""We now have the ability.""

Even as Republicans dole out the virtual backslaps to Bevin in Kentucky and point to the results in Virginia as proof gun control advocacy is a dead end for Clinton, Election Day 2015 may not provide much of a crystal ball at what's to come over the next 12 months.
Case in point: The winner of Kentucky's attorney general race? Andy Beshear, a Democrat and son of the outgoing governor, a major champion of Obamacare.

"When Ted Cruz announced his run for the presidency, the big question was whether he had only a small chance to win or no chance at all. Since then, a lot has gone right for him.

Mr. Cruz still does not enjoy an easy road to the Republican nomination, not by any means. But it is a testament to just how strange this year has been that a candidate like him, who is despised by many of his own Republican colleagues in the Senate, now has a plausible path to the Republican nomination.

Some of his opportunity is the result of his own strength. He has succeeded in building a robust campaign organization, buoyed by fund-raising tallies of the sort we generally haven’t seen from anti-establishment, conservative candidates. Fund-raising isn’t everything, but it’s a big part of why candidates like Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum have not been serious contenders this time.

A lot of Mr. Cruz’s opening, however, reflects the weakness of his rivals, not his strength. Few would have guessed, for instance, that his solid but hardly astonishing $26 million in official campaign contributions (not counting outside groups) would be more than Jeb Bush’s total. By comparison, George W. Bush raised more than both candidates combined by this point 16 years ago (when a dollar was worth more). Back in the summer, I certainly would not have guessed that the combined support for Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker — Mr. Walker is now out of the race — would add up to just 16 percent in national polls, with three months to go before Iowa.

The candidates who are faring well in the polls — Ben Carson and Donald Trump — are also good news for Mr. Cruz. In just about any other year, Mr. Cruz would be the worst-case scenario for the party’s establishment. But compared with the likes of Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson, he seems reasonable and conventional. That might let him become a candidate the party could grudgingly accept. His debate performances, especially the one last week, have only helped in this regard.

Mr. Cruz hasn’t been faring particularly well in the polls, but there is a path forward. Even when he seemed to have little or no chance nationally, it was still clear that he could do well in Iowa, a state where nearly half of the Republican electorate is “very conservative,” according to the exit polls. He doesn’t lead there now, but the caucus is still three months off, and he has a large and untapped war chest. Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson might fade, which could help if a disproportionate share of their anti-establishment support goes his way.

If Mr. Cruz finishes well in Iowa, it won’t be hard to envision a serious run for the nomination. He could follow up a win in Iowa with strength in South Carolina and particularly Nevada, another caucus state where half of the G.O.P. electorate is “very conservative.” Soon after come the predominantly Southern states on Super Tuesday, where very conservative voters represent a larger share of the primary electorate than any other region of the country.

If Mr. Cruz is the only elected official who amasses many delegates by that point — which seems plausible — he will be in a good position to outmuscle relatively weak establishment candidates, particularly if those candidates prove to have fairly narrow appeal themselves, like Jeb Bush, Chris Christie or John Kasich.

For instance, if Mr. Cruz had run in 2012 and run with this strength, he might have had a real shot at defeating Mitt Romney, who struggled against underfunded opposition because of protracted resistance from the religious right. Of course, Mr. Cruz would ultimately need to broaden his appeal beyond his base of “very conservative” voters in the face of considerable resistance from party elites, hardly a sure thing, especially if Mr. Rubio continues to consolidate their support.

But in recent weeks, it has almost become a cliché to suggest that Mr. Cruz is going to win the “grass-roots” half of the G.O.P. primary once Ben Carson and Donald Trump fade, and that Mr. Cruz will then have a real shot to win.

This theory assumes, though, that Mr. Cruz could become the sole candidate of the right. Mr. Carson and Mr. Trump aren’t at all assured to fade. Even if they did, there isn’t much reason to think Mr. Cruz would gain the preponderance of their support.

The conservative wing of the G.O.P. is deceptively diverse, and the appeal of Mr. Carson and Mr. Trump comes from a lot more than their adherence to conservative doctrine. Their appeal is in part about identity politics, and they often draw from wings of the conservative base — populist, anti-immigrant, the religious right — that aren’t always unbending or ideological on other issues.

Mr. Cruz is different. He draws from voters motivated by ideology more than identity. Mr. Carson and Mr. Trump, for instance, tend to win at least 20 percent of self-identified moderate voters, but Mr. Cruz had the support of just 1 percent of moderate voters in a recent Iowa poll.

The diverse support of the various outsider candidates makes it tough to assume that supporters of Mr. Trump or Mr. Carson would shift to Mr. Cruz en masse. There’s little evidence that he’s their second choice. As two Yale professors wrote last week, there is even data that a sizable share of people favoring Mr. Trump or Mr. Carson have Mr. Bush or Mr. Rubio as their second choice.

The diversity of the G.O.P. base also helps explain how anti-establishment candidates like Mr. Carson, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump have all coexisted in drawing their support, how Mr. Carson has surged to the top of the polls without detracting much from Mr. Trump’s share of the vote, or how both have risen without any decline in Mr. Cruz’s support. And it makes it easier to imagine how the three could survive into Super Tuesday and beyond, sustained by unusually strong name recognition, considerable resources and distinct bases of support.",NATE COHN,"A victory in Iowa, which is plausible, could help him emerge as the sole leader of a conservative wing that is flexing its muscles this cycle.",Road to 2016: Ted Cruz Has a Chance to Win.
