Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker officially enters 2016 presidential race,cnn," (CNN)Scott Walker, the political phenomenon who rose to national fame by taking on unions in one of the most blue-collar states, tweeted Monday morning confirming that he'll seek the Republican nomination for president, just hours ahead of his in-person announcement.
""I'm in. I'm running for president because Americans deserve a leader who will fight and win for them,"" Walker tweeted, signing the message with his initials ""SW,"" indicating it was written by him and not his staff. 
Walker also put out a video Monday morning, outlining his political history and why he thinks he would be the best candidate to be president. 
His Monday afternoon event in Waukesha, Wisconsin, will be a remarkable political milestone for the 47-year-old second-term governor, who vaulted from the obscurity of the Milwaukee County executive to the top tier of a presidential campaign, thanks in large part to a historic gubernatorial recall effort that nearly ended his career in 2012.
In his first foray into a presidential campaign, Walker -- one of the most recognizable and polarizing governors in the country -- has emerged as a potentially formidable opponent to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Recent polling has shown Walker as one of the major contenders in the presidential race, competing closely with Bush and other prominent Republicans both nationally and in the early presidential states.
Although Walker waited to launch his White House bid until the end of the legislative session in his home state, he has been laying down the groundwork for a national campaign for months. The union-busting governor has been courting donors, traveling overseas and boosting his national profile by publicly tussling with President Barack Obama on issues like the nuclear deal with Iran.
The next several months will be a critical test for Walker. After his campaign announcement, the governor will crisscross the country, presenting himself to voters in Nevada, South Carolina, New Hampshire and Iowa.

A few months after taking office in 2011, Walker signed a measure to curb collective bargaining rights for most public employees in the state, framing it as an effort to take on the ""big government special interests"" and give power back to Wisconsin taxpayers.
The move triggered fierce backlash from labor unions and their progressive allies, sparking massive protests at the state capitol in Madison.
Conservatives in Wisconsin and around the country came to Walker's defense, helping the governor withstand a recall effort in 2012. Walker went on to win re-election by six points in 2014, his third statewide victory in four years.
It is that recall experience, more than any other, that has helped lay the groundwork for Walker's presidential bid. At the time, Walker said his recall victory proved that ""voters really do want leaders who stand up and make the tough decisions.""
That is a message that Walker has promoted in recent months while exploring a presidential campaign, calling on the Republican Party to look for ""fresh leadership"" and someone with ""big, bold ideas and the courage to act on it.""
Veteran GOP strategist Kevin Madden, who served as a senior adviser to Mitt Romney's presidential campaign in 2012, says Walker's union-busting efforts helped him to burnish his conservative credentials by demonstrating his ability to taken on ""the national [Democratic]establishment"" and beat them on three consecutive occasions.

Beyond his record as governor, Walker's Midwestern roots will be an invaluable asset in the GOP nominating fight -- Wisconsin voters haven't picked a Republican for president since 1984.
Walker is poised to make the case that his candidacy could put other Great Lakes states on the electoral map that have been out of reach for Republicans in recent cycles, including Michigan and Pennsylvania, which haven't voted for the GOP nominee since 1988.
""The path for a Republican to win the presidency comes through the Midwest,"" Walker told a crowd in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in April. ""It comes from Iowa and Wisconsin and Michigan and Ohio and we're even going to include Pennsylvania because they're part of the Big Ten,"" he added.
Walker also has a personal narrative that could enable him to appeal to low-income voters, a group Republicans lost overwhelmingly in 2008 and 2012, with the struggles in the latter campaign fueled in part by Mitt Romney's ""47 percent"" comments.
Walker is the son of a Baptist minister and an Eagle Scout, who attended Marquette University for three years before dropping out to take a job with the Red Cross. Walker has taken to citing his humble beginnings during recent appearances, setting up a contrast between his background and that of one of his key 2016 rivals -- Bush.
""I realize unlike some out there I didn't inherit fame or fortune from my family,"" Walker said during a speech to a Christian broadcasters convention in February. ""I got a bunch of things that were a whole lot better than that. I got from my parents and my grandparents the belief that if you work hard and you play by the rules, here in America you can do and be anything you want.""

Walker  has already experienced challenges that come with being thrust into the national spotlight in the months leading up to his campaign's official launch.
Unlike some of his peers in the Republican field like Bush, who lived through the White House campaigns of his father and brother, or former 2012 presidential candidates Rick Perry or Rick Santorum, Walker is facing head-on for the first time the reality of just how much scrutiny comes with a presidential campaign.
And it's shown.
Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Walker raised eyebrows when he seemed to compare the task of fighting ISIS to taking on thousands of protesters in his state.
Earlier
 that month, a trip to London resulted in a slew of unflattering headlines when Walker, despite his best efforts to avoid making news during the overseas trip, punted on a question about the theory of evolution.
In March, several news outlets, including CNN, reported that at a private gathering in New Hampshire, Walker had endorsed a pathway for citizenship for undocumented immigrants. This would have marked a notable reversal for Walker who had staked out a more conservative position on the divisive issue, and pundits were quick to suggest that the governor had flip flopped.
Joe McQuaid, publisher of the New Hampshire Union Leader whose office is a must-visit early state stop for presidential candidates, remarked at the time that the controversy surrounding Walker's reported immigration remarks showed that this is the governor's ""first time outside of Wisconsin.""
""It is a guy in his first presidential campaign trying to get himself grounded and see where he needs to be nuanced,"" McQuaid said in a recent interview. ""He hasn't dealt with these issues on a regular basis.""

Walker could give Bush a run for his money.
Over the past few months, the governor has made aggressive overtures to wealthy financiers and prominent Republican donors, presenting himself as a conservative alternative to others in the field.
Bush's extensive fundraising network, founded on decades-old family friendships, will be difficult to compete with. But in the earliest stages of the campaign, Walker's political action committee, Our American Revival, has boasted impressive commitments and donations from prominent donors and bundlers in fundraising epicenters like New York, California and Texas.
And it's not just deep-pocketed donors that Walker is banking on.
The recall fight that made the governor a national figure could be a boon for his fundraising efforts among small-dollar donors.
Walker raised more than $30 million for the recall campaign, which helped him grow his donor to list to some 300,000 supporters. Walker and his supporters say they're eager to win over a new generation of donors.
""Our donor is not the tried and true Republican donor in New York City that's given to everybody since Reagan, Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of the investment firm SkyBridge Capital who is raising money for Walker, told CNN earlier this month. ""We don't have the mercenary donor that's paying for past political favors.""

"Luxury Public Golf Course, Run by Trump, Opens on Former Bronx Dump",nyt,"After decades of debate, false starts and cost overruns, luxury golf finally arrived in the Bronx on Wednesday, as the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point opened in the shadow of the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge.

Forty years ago, as swaths of the South Bronx blazed, such a news bulletin might have been an April Fool’s joke. But while the public links made its debut on April 1, the 18-hole course marked a milestone for urban fans of golf and the end of a long struggle for the city’s Department of Parks and Recreation.

The parks department already oversees more than a dozen other municipal golf courses, including four in the Bronx. But the new golf course in Ferry Point Park, in the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx, the first built in the city since 1964, represents a departure, elevating municipal golf to a new level of sophistication — and expense.

Greens fees are about three times what they are at the city’s other courses; a city resident will pay $169 to play on weekends, while a nonresident will pay $215. Electric golf carts are outfitted with GPS, allowing golfers, among other things, to order a chicken sandwich and a Bronx Pale Ale while they are playing.

Perhaps paradoxically for such a high-end experience, the 7,400-yard golf course, which received a push forward when the company led by Donald J. Trump won the bid to run it, is built on a former landfill that closed in 1963. Scores of vents jut up from the links to release methane gas. The course is framed by housing projects and other modest buildings on one side.

But out on the links, golfers are immersed in another world. While the greens were still dormant and therefore lacking in color, they nonetheless present a hilly tableau, offering vistas of the Manhattan skyline and the glittering East River around every corner.

On Wednesday, despite temperatures in the 40s, more than 30 foursomes were out on the links, which were designed by Jack Nicklaus and John Sanford in the Scottish style — without trees. (The landscape was in part dictated by the limitations of a former landfill.)

Among the players was the Bronx borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr., who insisted that his score was off the record. “I’m out here on Day 1, letting people know that we have a world-class, P.G.A. links-style golf course right here in the boogie-down Bronx,” he said right before making a crisp drive that elicited whistles from onlookers.

“That was on the record!” he shouted. Half of the course’s 100 employees are Bronx residents.

Higher greens fees do not seem to have scared off potential players. In mid-March, the course started taking reservations for April. “Within 15 minutes all the prime time slots had sold out for every weekend,” said Ronald C. Lieberman, an executive vice president of the Trump Organization.

The development of the course was plagued by problems, including the discovery of toxic substances in the soil. A deal with a developer, Ferry Point Partners, to build the course fell apart in 2006.

The city then built the 192-acre course itself, using city contractors, but costs eventually ballooned to $127 million, and critics questioned the need for an upscale golf course in a borough where a third of residents live below the poverty line. The Trump Organization was chosen in 2010 to operate the course after several earlier attempts to find an operator failed.

The company will soon start construction on a permanent, $10 million clubhouse, which it will finance. In the meantime, a temporary clubhouse has a pro shop and an outdoor grill under a yellow-and-white striped awning.

Both Mr. Trump and city officials hope to eventually lure a professional tournament. “Hopefully, we’ll have majors and P.G.A. championships and Ryder Cups,” Mr. Trump said in a phone interview.

There will be an official opening ceremony in May, with Mr. Trump, Mr. Nicklaus, the parks commissioner, Mitchell J. Silver, and others. By then the grass should be bright green. In keeping with the recent weather, opening day was so chilly that play was delayed by two hours.

“The first person teed off at 10,” said Anthony D. Macari, director of concession architecture and development for the parks department. “It was a little late because of the frost.”",0.96458728002032657,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.026822252851998154, u'mexico': 0.085848426082800217, u'abortion': 0.012731857046362371, u'immigration': 0.4139399103366791, u'trade': 0.078245365929452138, u'campaign_finance': 0.072565193381782453, u'other': 0.15028379185216992, u'china': 0.016253393946928592, u'military': 0.013643837806122189, u'terrorism': 0.0180286291112682, u'economy': 0.078574973199910525, u'health': 0.024178001321799852, u'women': 0.0088843671327264711}"
A Plan to Transform the US Immigrant Detention System,huffpo,"Executive Director, Center for Migration Studies
The U.S. immigrant detention system serves two legitimate purposes, to ensure that persons in removal proceedings appear for their hearings and (if so ordered) can be removed and, in rare cases, to protect the public.  An important report released on May 11 by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, Migration and Refugee Services and the Center for Migration Studies, argues that these goals can be accomplished more humanely and at far less cost through a national infrastructure of community-based, supervised release programs. This blog will outline seven of the report's main findings and corresponding recommendations.
First, the report argues that the status quo detention system should be dismantled and transformed because of the devastating human toll it exacts. As the report puts it, the system ""engenders despair, divides families, causes asylum-seekers to relive trauma, leads many to forfeit their legal claims and fails to treat immigrants with dignity and respect."" It also ""contributes to the misconception that immigrants are criminals.""  In response, the report calls for a substantial investment in alternative to detention (ATD) programs. It argues that each person in the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS's) custody should be placed in the least restrictive program or setting that will reasonably ensure their  court appearances.
Second, the report finds that while the Obama administration's detention reform initiative has had notable successes, at the end of the day the administrative reform initiative will not and cannot result, as promised, in a truly civil immigration detention system. Since its inception in 2009, annual detention numbers have risen. In addition, detainees overwhelmingly remain and will remain in prison-like facilities, subject to standards of confinement more appropriate for criminal defendants. If anything, the trend has been toward greater detention in recent months, with the growth of massive family detention centers. In response, the report recommends that:
Third, immigrant detainees are not criminals. None are serving criminal time, and most lack any criminal record at all. Of the 440,000 persons removed in 2013, about 45 percent were categorized by DHS as ""criminal aliens,"" but nearly one-third of those who were deported as ""criminal aliens"" had been convicted of an immigration-related offense. In addition, 44 percent of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees with criminal histories in 2013 were misdemeanants and others fell within an enforcement category that includes multiple misdemeanants. The report proposes a truly civil immigration detention system that reflects the non-criminal population in civil removal proceedings and DHS's legal authorities.
Fourth, the report finds that immigrant detainees are treated worse than criminals in many respects. For example, most are subject to mandatory detention and are not considered for release by a judge based on family or community ties or on whether they represent a flight risk or a danger. In contrast, virtually all criminal defendants receive custody hearings shortly after their detention and can be released subject to conditions designed to ensure their court appearances and to protect the public. Not all criminal defendants are released, of course, but those who are released, appear for their hearings at high rates. In response, the report proposes that Congress eliminate mandatory detention in all but national security and egregious criminal cases.
Fifth, the report finds that in the vast majority of cases, the purposes of immigrant detention can be achieved through more effective, humane, and less costly alternative to detention programs (ATD).  In 2014, ICE devoted only five percent of its detention budget to ATD programs. Yet on any given day, it held roughly 34,000 in detention and 22,000 in ATD programs. Thus, it dedicated less than five percent of its budget to roughly 40 percent of its case-load, counting both detainees and those in ATD programs. Moreover, ATD programs cost far less than detention and have been proven highly effective at ensuring court appearances. The report recommends that a substantial investment be made in community-based ATD programs. It also argues that ATD programs should be considered a form of custody and (thus) be open to people who are subject to mandatory detention.  
Sixth, the immigration court system is severely underfunded: It receives between one to two percent of the funding received by the immigration enforcement system. As a result, it faces average backlogs of around 18 months in removal cases. Moreover, almost 85 percent of those removed never see the inside of a court, but instead are subject to expedited removal, reinstatement of removal, administrative removal and other summary processes. The report proposes putting all removal cases under the jurisdiction of the immigration court system, expanding funding for this system by an order of magnitude, and providing government-funded legal counsel to indigent persons facing removal.
Seventh, for-profit corporations are administering larger and larger swaths of the detention system -- around 60 percent of detention beds by one estimate. While the detention system should substantially contract, for-profit prisons are aggressively seeking to maximize profits for their shareholders and to expand the market for their services.  As the report puts it: 
Custody determinations and imprisonment implicate liberty, human flourishing, the integrity of families, and contributory justice. States exist to promote these shared 'goods.' Yet the government has increasingly ceded responsibility for this function to private, for-profit entities whose primary loyalties run to their shareholders, not to the common good.
The report recommends that private corporations should have a more limited role in a transformed system.",0.71836252853964955,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.0014709046371137035, u'mexico': 0.00022872675099816367, u'abortion': 0.0021517875304794161, u'immigration': 0.93419810559740624, u'trade': 0.00091101314297303154, u'campaign_finance': 0.0021888352121276649, u'other': 0.015108141162786838, u'china': 0.0040947392325919674, u'military': 0.0025289804283974665, u'terrorism': 0.0049083843477236442, u'economy': 0.005354855048981224, u'health': 0.003032376552965075, u'women': 0.02382315035545552}"
5 Things About Hillary Clinton’s Debt-Free College Plan,wsj,"Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton on Monday announced a new plan aimed at easing what can be a crushing burden of student debt, the latest candidate to weigh in on the question of college affordability.
The centerpiece of her plan would allow for debt-free tuition at public schools, her attempt to address a source of anxiety for American families while advancing one of the left’s most sweeping new ideas.
Here are the five thing to know about her proposal:
The Big Idea: Debt-Free Tuition
The Clinton plan would have the federal government send large grants to states, which would then ensure students can pay tuition without taking out loans. There are strings attached: States would be required to increase their allocations to higher education, and schools would face new constraints on spending. Families would have to contribute what they can afford, according to a financial analysis, and students would be required to work 10 hours per week.
“Everyone is going to have to step up,” Mrs. Clinton said in Exeter, N.H., on Tuesday. “We can’t expect the federal government just to pay the bill for free. That’s not how America works.”
In addition, the lowest-income students would be newly allowed to use federal Pell grants to cover costs such as room and board. Other students could also have those expenses covered if they complete community service and take a public-service job.
Mrs. Clinton’s plan also adopts an Obama proposal for two years of free community college. Together, these ideas would cost about $200 billion over 10 years. The campaign also anticipates another $25 billion for historically black colleges and universities and other schools with modest endowments.
Refinancing Debt
The second plank of her plan would revamp the federal student-loan program to lower borrowing costs for both people who already hold student debt as well as current students at private schools. People could refinance at lower rates—or get lower rates in the first place—and cap payments at 10% of discretionary income. If any money is still owed after 20 years, it would be forgiven.
This portion of the program is estimated to cost $125 billion over 10 years. The entire plan would be paid for by capping deductions available to high-income taxpayers.
Who likes this?
The plan is aimed at addressing concerns of both middle class families worried about playing for college, and college students—also known as young voters—being crushed by heavy debt loads. Information about the plan will be a key element of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign on college campuses this fall.
It was immediately welcomed by activists who have pushed candidates to support “bold” proposals on college affordability.
Mrs. Clinton’s rivals for the Democratic nomination have their own plans for college affordability. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont proposes significant aid to the states to make college tuition-free, not just debt-free. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley has proposed a refinancing program and increased federal financial aid and says he would call on states to freeze tuition
Who Doesn’t Like It?
The plan was immediately attacked by Republicans as a tax hike and an unhealthy new dose of federal control.
“We don’t need more top-down Washington solutions that will raise the cost of college even further and shift the burden to hardworking taxpayers,” said former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is running for the GOP presidential nomination.
Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), another presidential contender, said on Fox News that the Clinton plan would spend money without fundamentally reforming the system.
“This is the thing they always do on the left. She has to figure out who to raise taxes on — so this is about making doing business in America even more expensive — raising taxes, and then taking all that money and pouring it into an outdated higher education system,” he said.
The Clinton campaign did not detail how its version of the tax change would work.
A Bipartisan Plan — Somewhere
While there are deep divides over the solution, there is a remarkable consensus on the problem. Student debt tripled over the past decade, reaching $1.2 trillion in the first quarter of 2015, New York Federal Reserve figures show. Education-related debt is now the highest form of household credit outside of mortgages, surpassing even credit card debt.
Republicans typically have focused on reining in the cost of a college education. Mr. Rubio has proposed allowing students to spend federal aid on programs outside of traditional colleges. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, another presidential candidate, proposed a two-year tuition freeze and a 13% cut to the University of Wisconsin system’s budget.
In another bipartisan signal, Mrs. Clinton also is calling for colleges to be held liable for aid when their students default on loans, an idea that has gained traction among members of both parties as a way to control costs.

Could Reggie Bush fill role of No. 3 wide receiver?,fox,"



SANTA CLARA, CA - AUGUST 7: Reggie Bush #23 of the San Francisco 49ers runs drills during a practice session at Levi's Stadium on August 7, 2015 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images)


There is a void to fill at the No. 3 wide receiver spot due to Jerome Simpson's six-game suspension. Quinton Patten, Bruce Ellington and DeAndrew White are expected to compete for the job, but is it possible offseason addition Reggie Bush fills that role?Head coach Jim Tomsula alluded earlier in the offseason that Bush is more than just a third-down back. The 49ers are expected to use Bush on special teams returning punts and kicks, and as backup to Carlos Hyde. In short, they'll likely use him everywhere. But over his nine-year career, Bush has totaled 466 receptions for 3,489 yards. Even in Detroit during a down season in 2014, Bush still caught 40 passes out of the backfield. It's something to monitor if the 49ers try to test this out in the preseason. (h/t bayareasportsguy.com)

The Agenda
Darren Samuelsohn and POLITICO Pro truth-squad the candidates.
Seven low-rung Republican presidential candidates. Ninety minutes. Talk about fertile ground for playing loose with the facts. 
From exaggerations over political records to ill-advised predictions over exactly what Hillary Clinton would do if she won the White House, the GOP undercard debating in Cleveland took some liberties in their attempts to stand out in a record-sized field.
Here’s POLITICO’s analysis of where the Republican field stretched the truth or just plain got it wrong:
WELFARE REFORM'S AUTHOR? 
Rick Santorum: “I ended a federal entitlement”
The former Pennsylvania senator got into fact check trouble back in 2012 when he made a similar claim in his last presidential run. So it's no surprise he entered hot water again by taking such a large degree of credit for the landmark 1996 law that reformed the welfare program. 
Santorum certainly had a large hand in the law President Bill Clinton signed just months before his reelection. He did serve as a floor manager for starters. But he certainly isn't alone either as the measure's champion. Clinton, for one, had promised in his own 1992 campaign to “end welfare as we know it.” And there's a good chance one of Santorum's 2016 rivals might question his claim too: Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
During that 1996 legislative battle, Kasich was the House bill's lead sponsor as chairman of the House Budget Committee. 
TESTING THE DEFINITION OF A VIABLE FETUS
George Pataki: “Doctors say that at 20 weeks” a fetus is viable
The former New York governor said that as president, he would sign a law to prohibit abortion at 20 weeks because that is the point at which a fetus is viable outside the womb. In fact, it's generally considered to be about 24 weeks — earlier than it was a generation ago. 
There is a Republican-led effort to prohibit abortion at 20 weeks, but it is based on the disputed argument that a fetus can feel pain at that gestational age.
FORGETTING HIS OWN CAP-AND-TRADE RECORD Lindsey Graham:“In her world, cap and trade would dominate. That will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.""
The South Carolina senator was swinging at the potential environmental policies of a future Hillary Clinton administration. But he's also experiencing a bit of policy amnesia here.
While Graham stands out among the giant GOP field for acknowledging man-made climate change, he's also trying to disown his own work with Democrats to pass a cap-and-trade bill during President Barack Obama's first term. Those talks stretched from the fall of 2009 into the summer of 2010 and ultimately came apart amid the BP oil spill. Graham abandoned his legislative partners John Kerry and Joe Lieberman just days before they were to release a major climate bill that would have capped carbon emissions on power plants, petroleum refiners and a range of other major industrial facilities. 
Graham gave a variety of excuses for the backtrack -- he blamed the oil spill, the complexity of the climate bill and he even fingered Harry Reid for forcing a separate immigration debate. But Graham's early efforts -- he co-authored an op-ed in The New York Times with Kerry headlined 'Yes we can (Pass Climate Change Legislation') — helped keep alive an Obama priority that many of his fellow Republicans would just have well preferred to be shelved. Once Graham walked away, the wheels really came apart and Reid pulled the plug about two months later.MAKING HILLARY'S DECISION ON KEYSTONE XL?
Graham: “She’s not going to build the Keystone pipeline. I will.”
The South Carolina senator also went after Clinton over the highly controversial energy project that's been stuck in policy limbo for pretty much all of the Obama administration.
In reality, Clinton has declined to take a position on TransCanada’s Keystone XL pipeline, which would send heavy crude from Alberta oil sands down to refineries in Texas, before Obama announces his decision because she had a role in reviewing the project as secretary of state. 
Clinton’s unwillingness to oppose the pipeline outright has actually fueled criticism from Democratic challengers, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and Sen. Bernie Sanders,both of who have long criticized of the project. 
DEBATABLE CONCLUSIONS ON MEDICAID EXPANSION 
Bobby Jindal: “Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health outcomes.”
It depends on which study you choose.
The Louisiana governor has been a huge foe of Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion and stated an oft-repeated argument voiced by critics -- access to the program doesn’t equate to better health for patients. But the evidence is mixed, with various studies coming to different conclusions about low-income people enrolled in the program.
One of the most widely publicized – and which would back up Jindal’s argument – was a study from Oregon. It found that people newly insured under the Medicaid program after Oregon expanded it in 2008 did not see significant improvement with respect to certain health conditions, including blood pressure and cholesterol. Research also showed that being on Medicaid increased the probability that patients would go to the emergency room to get care.
But other research has shown improvements among patients who are covered by the program. A recently released study focusing on Ohio found that diabetes patients enrolled in a particular Medicaid program received better care and had better outcomes compared to uninsured patients with diabetes. Costs also came in 29 percent lower than expected for the roughly 28,000 adult Medicaid enrollees that were studied.

Jeb Bush rolls out VA reforms in South Carolina,cnn,"Columbia, South Carolina  (CNN)It's no coincidence that Jeb Bush chose South Carolina as the backdrop for the rollout of his plan to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs: the state is seeped in military history, runs several active military bases, and houses a large population of retired veterans. 
CNN Interactive: 2016 election candidates 
After all, according to CNN exit polls from 2012, 21% of GOP primary voters identified as veterans.
The former Florida governor, who did not serve in the military himself but whose father and brother did, has a list of announcements expected Monday, starting with a veterans steering committee list that includes two Medal of Honor recipients here in South Carolina and ten more nation-wide. 
He will meet with these veterans today in a closed-door event in Charleston before he heads to Columbia for a town hall in the evening.
Of the endorsements, Bush said in a press release, ""As President, I'm committed to a safe America through a strong military, and having a strong military includes having policies that will keep our country's commitment to our veterans after active service.""
Bush also laid out his policy agenda for the overhaul of the Department of Veteran's Affairs in two pieces published this morning. 
In an op-ed for the National Review, he outlined several keys areas that need reform: ""empowering"" veterans to be able to choose their own doctors if options are limited within the VA system; recognize that female veterans require other health needs like gynecologists and doctors trained to treat breast cancer; and also the ability for VA doctors to fill prescriptions from outside doctors. 
He attacked the antiquated administrative practices of the department, citing a staggering $4.7 billion spent annually on information technology, while noting that there is not a ""simple app that allows veterans to make appointments, get medical advice, or refill a prescription from a smartphone or tablet."" He also did an interview with Military Times.
Like his campaign refrain of shrinking Washington D.C. politics, Bush wants to see the VA whittled down, saying that it's nearly impossible right now to fire a VA employee and overhead costs are sucking money away from actually caring for veterans.
As CNN previously reported, GOP candidates have been heavy on the pro-military and strong national security front here in South Carolina. Rand Paul spoke to a Concerned Veterans for America forum in Charleston a month ago and echoed some of Bush's same sentiments, especially regarding the ability for veterans to seek outside medical attention if the VA does not suffice. Last week in Anderson, Rick Perry, who himself served in the Air Force, asked the veterans in the room to raise their hands. Many shot up in the air.
South Carolina GOP Chairman Matt Moore describes the veterans' community in the state. ""Almost every other South Carolina voter has ties to the military, either through their work or through a veteran in their family. It's hard to understate how important the military community is in South Carolina."" When asked if any other candidates have secured the kind of veteran support and endorsements like Bush has in South Carolina, he noted, ""Not yet.""

Inevitable no more? Clinton march to party nod disrupted,fox,"







							mboxCreate('FoxNews-Politics-Autoplay-Videos-In-Articles');
						
What looked like a lock when she announced her candidacy four months ago has turned into a scramble for Hillary Clinton as her campaign faces not just challenges from declared candidates but speculation that recent stumbles could draw a party powerhouse like Vice President Biden into the race. 
Already, Clinton's campaign is going up this week with her first television ads in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Analysts suggest her team remembers well the lessons of 2008, when the Iowa caucuses saw the supposed front-runner come in third, and lose momentum after that. 
But unlike 2008, Clinton's biggest threat might be someone who hasn't yet declared. Speculation is mounting that Biden could enter in the fall. And the far left wing of the party appears to be voicing its dissatisfaction with the current front-runner -- with some backing Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who continues to draw big crowds, as the alternative and others still clamoring for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to run. 
Meanwhile, pundits have floated two former nominees from the past two decades, Al Gore and Secretary of State John Kerry, though they've shown little interest in running. The New York Times reported that even Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is being courted to run. 
""I think there's a little panic in the Clinton camp,"" former GOP New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu said Monday. 
A Clinton aide last week disputed the notion the campaign is nervous about Biden, and told Fox News there has not been any shift or new focus on him. 
But the calls for him to run are growing, and even the White House on Monday seemed to fuel the speculation -- as Clinton herself grapples with continuing questions over her use of personal email as secretary of state and other issues. 
In an interview with Fox News, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest acknowledged Biden has ""indicated that he's thinking about it."" Without saying what he thinks the VP's decision should or would be, Earnest heaped praise on the former senator who has been at Obama's side since the 2009 inauguration. 
""The president ultimately wants Democratic voters to decide who they believe the nominee should be,"" Earnest said, when asked what Obama would like to see. He then added: ""The president certainly believes that a spirited contest would be in the best interests of our party, and in the best interest of our country."" 
Asked for comment, Biden Press Secretary Kendra Barkoff issued a statement saying: ""As the Biden family continues to go through this difficult time, the Vice President is focused on his family and immersed in his work. In recent weeks, the Vice President has worked on the nuclear deal with Iran, traveled across the country to highlight the Administration's economic priorities, and more."" 
Fox News also has learned that two longtime Biden confidantes have been brought on board as VP advisers. 
Former senior adviser Mike Donilon has been brought on as a communications adviser, and former Delaware Sen. Ted Kaufman also is now an adviser; each has an office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, next to the White House. Kaufman has a long history with Biden, and was a top campaign adviser in 2008. Donilon worked on Obama's re-election campaign. 
While there are strong suggestions the two were brought on to specifically help Biden during the period of his son's illness and death, they nevertheless have a political history with the vice president. 
In another recent development, a top political aide to Biden's late son joined the super PAC working to recruit the elder Biden to run for president on Sunday. 
Josh Alcorn, a longtime Democratic operative, had been former Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden's top political and fundraising adviser before he died of brain cancer in May. Alcorn will now work with the Draft Biden super PAC. 
On Thursday, Fox News reported that Clinton aides were growing increasingly nervous about the possibility of a Biden run after the vice president's White House chief of staff was spotted having breakfast recently with major Democratic donor Louis Susman, a Clinton friend who served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom under Obama. 
The New York Times reported Sunday that Biden had discussed entering the race with friends, family, and Democratic donors. 
The Times also reported that before Beau Biden died, he tried to convince his father to run. The same Times report said Starbucks' Schultz is being urged to join the race by powerful friends. 
Democratic strategist Doug Schoen said at this stage, with new ads going on the airwaves, the Clinton team is ""fighting to keep her numbers up"" in early voting states in a bid to ""forestall"" the possibility of Biden entering. 
Former Democratic pollster Pat Caddell agreed that Clinton is trying to keep more challengers from jumping in the race. 
""Elizabeth Warren is one of them. John Kerry may be another,"" he said. As for Biden, he said, ""People think he's trustworthy, as opposed to her."" 
While Clinton continues to lead the current primary field handily, recent polls have shown her behind in head-to-head matchups with Republicans. And last week's Quinnipiac University poll showed that, by 57-37 percent, voters said she wasn't honest and trustworthy. 
Aside from Sanders, other declared Democratic candidates are: former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb; former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley; and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chaffee.

ISIS: The terrorist art market,fox,"

					The ideologically-driven destruction of priceless Iraqi artifacts by Islamic State may be a ruse that actually hides a much more cynical operation, in which fakes are smashed to pieces while real treasures are smuggled out of the country and sold on the black market to fund the terrorist army.   

ISIS shocked the world last month with the public destruction of hundreds of seemingly priceless works of art at the Mosul Museum in Iraq. What is not clear upon first watching the devastation is that the bearded men wielding hammers and drills against copies of centuries’ old statues are already responsible for the world’s largest art sales of culturally plundered antique objects.  ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT

However, it is imperative that the objects being imported into the legitimate first world art market appear authentic and are not too recognizable. There is nothing more difficult than selling an artwork stolen from a museum that is beloved by the world, as famous stolen paintings like Eduard Munch’s ‘The Scream’ have taught us in the past. 

The Times of London reports that ISIS has smuggled nearly 100 artifacts looted from the Syrian war into Britain over the past year. As the international art thieves of ISIS demonstrate, however, the mark of a good smuggler is one who possesses mediocre taste. A smuggler attempting to sell Rembrandt’s famous ‘Storm on the Sea of Galilee’, which was stolen in the famous Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum heist, would be quickly apprehended and the painting returned to its rightful place on the wall of the museum. They experience greater success selling unknown and lesser artworks which are easier to smuggle and unload.  

This is not the first time that stolen artifacts have flooded onto the market.  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the FBI launched a major investigation to find stolen Russian religious icons.

When viewing the senseless destruction by ISIS of priceless artifacts that have been preserved by the human race for nearly three millennia, outrage is a natural emotion. However it is important to keep in mind that all media released by this terrorist organization is engineered to promulgate an international brand of ISIS terrorist atrocity.  

The ISIS brand intends to cultivate the image of a barbarian horde seeking to establish a Caliphate that will eviscerate all Arabic culture and iconography predating Islam, whether the material they present is true or not. Barbarian and terror regimes of the past are no strangers to destroying ancient artifacts -- these practices were employed by such groups as the Taliban, Khmer Rouge, and even the ancient Egyptians.

ISIS’ efforts to erase pre-Islamic pictorial art successfully communicates their brand image. What ISIS fails to mention is that they are destroying fakes. Blouin Art Info reports that upon the release of the Mosul Museum video, experts determined that “most, if not all’ of the statuary on view were plaster fakes. The officials at the Mosul Museum had previously transported the originals to the Baghdad Museum. The New York Times reported that many of these sculptures were replicas of ancient objects and a portion of the sculptures on display were reconstructed from fragments which included original shards of ancient sculptures.

This is not to say that the group did not succeed in destroying objects of immense cultural value. The nearby Nergal Gate archaeological site was seriously damaged and the truly magnificent 7th century BC Nineveh winged bulls at this location were lost forever.  

There is no doubt that the video was compelling, however when examining the group’s decision to destroy fake and priceless art objects a more pragmatic financial motivation is revealed. The pattern that emerges in this episode of cultural genocide is that ISIS is destroying only the art that is deemed to be unsaleable in the international art market. Both plaster cast fakes of ancient statues and priceless monumental sculptures cannot be sold or transported in the current international antiquity market. The reproduction sculptures do not have an inherent value as they are replicas and the irreplaceable winged bulls at the Nergal Gate are both too well known and too difficult to transport for them to sell in the art market today.  

Whether worthless or priceless the verdict for destruction is the same. The current terrorist art and antiquities market is dictated by two factors: (1) can an item be transported to a location where a buyer exists for it, and (2) can the artwork be passed off as legitimate once it arrives. 

To be sold an item must be exported from ISIS-occupied territories into nations such as Lebanon or Turkey, which have access to the first world antiquity and art markets. These objects are then smuggled into first world nations and legitimized through art galleries and dealers operating in the art business. 

Although in recent weeks most world attention has been on objects from the ancient cultures of Assyria and Nineveh, Syria remains one of the largest cultural casualties of ISIS expansion. Entire landscapes have been transformed by fighting, rampant looting, and cultural plunder decimating archaeological sites that were untouched just three years ago. The most dramatic example of this is the Seleucid site of Apamea in western Syria. A before and after inspection of satellite images of Apamea shows the scale of the destruction. 

Before the Syrian civil war and subsequent ISIS incursion the site was undisturbed and properly excavated by archaeologists. Since the time of the conflict looters have dug up nearly every square foot of the site in search of valuable antiquities, scarring the landscape with jagged pits. Many of these looted artifacts have made their way into the legitimate art markets in Europe, specifically the U.K. 

Despite the high number of artifacts being removed from ISIS occupied territories the artworks being unloaded by the group are not limited to the heritage of Iraq and Syria. Some of the highest grossing ISIS artworks reported in London include Roman pottery and glass, as well as gold and silver Byzantine coins, according to The Times of London. Despite their ideological opposition to Western Culture and iconography ISIS is guilty of compromising the tenets of their jihad in order to cash in on these more marketable western antiquities. With income from other sources in decline ISIS understands art commerce as an imperative to the continued success of their violent jihad.

The U.S. has also been a hot destination for plundered Syrian antiquities. In September 2014 John Kerry hosted a press conference at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York where he released a “red list of Syrian cultural objects at risk” which included a number of cultural objects which have been removed from Syria in the midst of ISIS’ war. A “red list” was also announced for cultural objects from Iraq and is yet to be released.

The goal of this project was to raise international awareness of threats to Syrian and Iraqi cultural patrimony. However, the sale of ISIS-supplied artifacts reportedly continues in New York and London. New legislation to prevent antiques trafficking in the U.S. is being spearheaded by Massachusetts Democratic Congressman Bill Keating. This intends to make the importation process more difficult thereby decreasing the level of funding that ISIS receives from the international antiquities and art trade.  

Despite all diplomatic and legislative efforts to stymie the trade of ISIS antiquities there appears to be no end to illegal antiquities trafficking in sight. The onus to stop the art market’s funding of the ISIS jihad does not rest solely on the government’s policing of antiquities import. Rather, it also remains the responsibility of galleries, dealers, and sales agents.  

As an industry gallerists must embrace internal and external regulations that establish standards for pre-purchase due diligence and end the era of sales dictated by the mantra “legitimate enough”. There are many miles of red tape, local governmental apathy, and civil litigation which lie between art market regulation and current appropriate art market practices. Until that time we rely on the efforts of the educated collector and the dedicated scholar to raise awareness about the dislocation and destruction of Iraq and Syria’s cultural heritage through the international terrorist art market. All the while dreading the next propaganda atrocity released by ISIS in Iraq and Syria.

Hillary Clinton is still leading the Democratic field for 2016, but her lead has shrunk in recent months, according to a new Monmouth University poll out Wednesday, as independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders continues to make steady gains despite trailing by a wide margin.
Among Democrats and those leaning toward the Democratic Party, Clinton picked up the support of 51 percent, down from 57 percent in June and 60 percent in April.

Sanders came in second with 17 percent, followed by former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb with 1 percent each. Lincoln Chafee, the former governor and senator from Rhode Island, registered no support.
If Vice President Joe Biden were to run, however, the results suggest that he would take some votes away from Clinton. He has not announced his intentions, but registered voters in the sample backed him with 13 percent, just behind Sanders.

Among voters who said they were likely to vote for Biden in the event of his candidacy, a whopping 68 percent said they are currently supporting Clinton, while 18 percent said they are backing another candidate, with 14 percent undecided.
Clinton continues to have the best favorability ratings among her Democratic rivals in the Monmouth poll (74 percent favorable to 17 percent unfavorable), though Biden is close behind (67 percent to 17 percent).
The poll was conducted via landlines and cellphones from a larger July 9-12 survey, which sought the opinions of 1,001 adults nationwide. This particular sample included 357 registered voters who identified themselves as Democrats or leaning toward the Democratic Party, carrying a margin of error of plus-or-minus 5.2 percentage points.
