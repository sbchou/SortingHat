"ArtsBeat: ‘Masters of Sex’ Recap: For Virginia, and Us, It’s All About a Certain Desire",nyt,"Season 3, Episode 4: “Untitled”

The very best moment of tonight’s otherwise somewhat rudderless episode comes when Dan Logan (Josh Charles), the man with the nose for seduction, delivers a line that, intentionally or not, breaks the fourth wall with viewers, addressing us all in an entirely unexpected and very interesting way.

It arrives when he and Gini (Lizzy Caplan) are waiting to speak to his army contact,  who will fill them in on the true cause of Henry Johnson’s tropical malaise. Logan emits what at first sounds like a come-on line — “God, you are so like her, a girl I used to know” — which then leads to a reminiscence about a six-month wartime affair that closely parallels the seminal story of abandonment that Virginia told Bill Masters during their epic fight-night exchange last season.

“How does a man just walk away, back to his fiancée … ?” she begins. (We are all back, unfortunately, to the heavy-handed déja-vù thematics of a few weeks ago.)

“Wife,” says Logan. 

 “Maybe you were afraid,” she goes on. “Afraid that if you ran off with a dazzling girl that you would never really measure up.”

“If that’s how you want your story to end. …” he says. 

It’s an inadvertent moment of truth that shows the sad fantasy at work not just in Virginia’s desire to ascribe loftier meaning to her story of youthful heartbreak, but, in a sense, to the entire enterprise of wish fulfillment that keeps us happily hooked on “Masters” week after week.

By which I mean: If you’re like me, the key delight of the series is watching the conflicting forces of love and cruelty, passion and bone-chilling non-concern play out in actor Michael Sheen’s face as he brings to life a Bill Masters who is lovable despite his very obvious, sometimes quite awful flaws. Lovable because, deep down, buried under the neglectful husband, the useless father, the shockingly selfish family friend (“I care,” he spits at poor Tessa, “because your mother is overextended — she can barely take care of her many obligations without you adding more pressure”), we believe there is a wounded little boy whose basic core of decency is masked by unaddressed P.T.S.D. 

But is there any real reason to think that decency exists?

It doesn’t show up much in the Thomas Maier biography that inspired this series. (Although, granted, the book is based in large part on late-in-life interviews with an extremely bitter Virginia Johnson, who is not terribly likable herself.) Beware, Logan seems to say to the show’s (presumably largely female) viewers, don’t get taken in by the dream of Masters’s as-yet-unplumbed inner depths — nor, for that matter, by my sudden flashes of attractively self-deprecatory insight. (“The Dan Logan charm wears thin, or so I’m told.”)

Sometimes a jerk is just a jerk. Not an absent-minded-professor, endearingly compensating for his social-skill deficiencies by reading Dale Carnegie. Not a good guy who dodged true love because it made him too insecure, and who helps a beautiful woman in a moment of great vulnerability because he wishes someone had similarly helped his mother during World War II. Sometimes a cad is just a cad. A guy who says “Lemme get on the horn” won’t turn out to harbor great stores of sensibility. What you see is what you get. Just ask Betty.

Some last thoughts: 

I am very concerned about Tessa (Isabelle Fuhrman), who is pasty and, I imagine, pimply, and is spiraling fast downward while Virginia is consumed by thoughts of far-off Henry and love for baby Lisa. (Whose nanny drinks! Wake up, Virginia!) If this were “Homeland,” or, even better, “24,” her putative boyfriend, Matt (Kevin Fonteyne), might be tortured a bit or blown apart entirely by an I.E.D., but I fear there’s no such satisfying plot resolution in sight in stultifying St. Louis. 

I’m irritated, too, by the new Margaret Scully plotline: I just don’t buy this 180-degree transformation of the perfect midcentury doctor’s wife into a far-out ’60s swinger. The sex, for once, seems gratuitous, as does the incessant, quasi-sadistic humiliation of Allison Janney’s Margaret, whose selflessness vis-à-vis her ex-husband Barton’s need to keep his sexual orientation a secret has cost her the love of her only child. 

It’s all just kind of yucky. 

Which brings me to a theme I see over and over again in television created by the youngest Boomers and oldest Gen X’ers: the incredibly punishing depiction of women who tried to live out the role of “happy housewife heroine” in the early 1960s. Were our mothers really so bad?

And does Margaret’s boyfriend — Tate Donovan’s Graham Pennington — now rival Mark Moses’ Dennis Boyd on “Homeland” as the most annoying man on television?

GLOBAL ECONOMY-Disappointing business surveys intensify growth fears,reuters,"* China factory activity sinks to 6-1/2-year low
* Orders fall at faster rate, more workers being laid off
* Markets fall on fears China will hit global growth
* Euro zone business growth remains weak in August
* China devaluation, looming U.S. rate hike add to worries
By Jonathan Cable and Koh Gui Qing
LONDON/BEIJING, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Signs China's slowdown is
getting worse and weak growth in Europe have further damaged the
outlook for the global economy, sending stocks and commodity
prices reeling on Friday.
China's vast factory sector shrank at its fastest rate in
almost 6-1/2-years in August, a private survey showed, pushing
investors who fear China's sagging economy will translate into
slower global growth to take refuge in gold and bonds.
World markets had already been on edge after China's
surprise devaluation of the yuan last week and a near-collapse
in its stock markets in early summer.
""Uncertainty about China growth is now the main swing factor
in markets,"" said Tim Condon, an economist at ING Group in
Singapore.
""Today's data reinforced the doubts about global growth.""
The preliminary Caixin/Markit China Manufacturing Purchasing
Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 47.1 in August, well below a
Reuters poll median of 47.7 and down from July's final 47.8.
It was the worst reading since March 2009, in the depths of
the global financial crisis, and the sixth straight one below
the 50-point level, which separates growth in activity from
contraction on a monthly basis.
Euro zone business growth unexpectedly accelerated this
month but remained tepid, according to surveys out of Europe,
while a similar index due later from the United States is
expected to show only a modest pick up in factory growth.
World stock markets tumbled towards their worst week of the
year and commodities got another kicking, as the data sent
investors scurrying to the safety of bonds and gold.
Analysts still expect the U.S. central bank to raise
interest rates this year, possibly as soon as next month, though
minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's last meeting in July
showed policymakers discussed China, Greece's debt crisis and
the weak state of the global economy.

CHINESE WIND
The downdraft from China is particularly rattling economies
of its trade-reliant Asian neighbours.
South Korea, which counts China as its biggest trading
partner, said on Friday its exports slumped and Taiwan reported
on Thursday its export orders in July fell more than expected.
And while a similar factory survey in Japan pointed to a
pick-up there due to stronger domestic demand, policymakers in
Tokyo are keenly aware of the dangers if China slows further.
Following three decades of blistering double-digit economic
growth, Chinese authorities have had limited success in shoring
up activity this year despite four interest rates cuts since
November.
Worse, last week's shock 2 percent devaluation in the yuan
 and a near-collapse in Chinese shares over the summer
that was countered by a massive stock market rescue do not
appear to have calmed investor jitters.
The yuan has slid nearly 3 percent since its Aug. 11
devaluation, a fall some analysts say is too modest to boost
Chinese exports, but notable enough to raise fears of
competitive currency devaluations between governments.
The speed with which China's economy is losing steam has led
to analysts warning the government may struggle to meet its
official growth target of 7 percent this year if it doesn't
ratchet up policy support. China's factory output, retail sales
and investment all disappointed in July.
Some economists say China's present growth levels could
already be closer to half of the 7 percent official figure
reported for the second quarter.
""While we do not have enough information to assess all the
details of official releases, we share the view that real GDP
growth probably slowed more than reported in recent quarters,""
said Wei Yao at Societe Generale.
EUROPEAN BREEZE
A relatively upbeat euro zone survey, one of the earliest
monthly economic indicators, suggests the European Central
Bank's massive bond-buying programme and a weaker euro may be
finally having an impact on growth.
However, signs businesses are cutting prices at a faster
rate will be disappointing for the ECB which has been battling
to bring inflation - at just 0.2 percent in July - anywhere near
its two percent target ceiling.
Markit's Composite Flash PMI, rose to 54.1 this month from
July's 53.9, confounding expectations in a Reuters poll for a
modest dip to 53.8.
The headline index has been above 50 since mid-2013 and
Markit said the PMI suggested third quarter GDP growth of 0.4
percent, matching the prediction in a Reuters poll last week.
""It points to weak growth that will do little to erode the
spare capacity in the region,"" said Jennifer McKeown at Capital
Economics.
""We still see euro zone growth slowing in the coming months
as earlier boosts from falling inflation and the euro's
depreciation fade, particularly if renewed uncertainty
surrounding the Greek election damages confidence.""
Adding to uncertainty for investors following a brief period
of relief after Athens avoided default and signed a third
bailout to stay in the euro zone, Greek Prime Minister Alexis
Tsipras resigned on Thursday.

Saudi Leadership Changes Highlight Contradictions in U.S. Middle East Policy,huffpo,"International Policy Adviser for Human Rights First
Yesterday King Salman of Saudi Arabia issued a series of royal decrees removing his half-brother Prince Muqrin as Crown Prince and replacing him with Mohammed bin Nayef, the Minister of the Interior and head of the powerful Council of Political and Security Affairs. Bin Nayef is a grandson of King Abdelaziz whose sons have served as Saudi monarchs since his death in 1953. 
Bin Nayef has been described as ""America's favorite Saudi official."" It is a description that points to a contradiction at the heart of U.S. policy in the region: how can the United States engage in effective counterterrorism cooperation with its authoritarian regional allies without legitimizing or validating their repressive practices?
Bin Nayef embodies this contradiction since he is seen as the leading force behind a massive crackdown on independent civil society activists and human rights activists inside the Kingdom and the architect of a regional strategy aimed at rolling back movements for more representative and more participatory governance throughout the Arab region. These policies spread instability and fuel the grievances that are exploited by violent extremists.
The United States and its Arab allies are in agreement over the threat posed by violent extremist groups like the so called Islamic State or ISIL. Bin Nayef has survived multiple assassination attempts by such extremists and U.S. officials see him as a reliable partner in countering terrorist threats.  At the same time, President Obama stated in February at the Summit on Countering Violent Extremism: ""When people are oppressed, and human rights are denied - particularly along sectarian lines of ethnic lines - when dissent is silenced, it feeds violent extremism."" 
Saudi Arabia's policies run counter to the president's statement and harm U.S. interests.
President Obama is aware of the problem. In a recent interview, he warned of the ""internal threats"" facing  countries like Saudi Arabia caused by unresponsive governance and spoke of the need for ""tough conversations"" with their leaders on the need to implement internal reforms.
The elevation of bin Nayef to be the heir to the 79-year-old king's throne underlines the challenges facing President Obama as his administration ramps up engagement with the Arab region in the face of numerous regional crises, and on the cusp of a possible new agreement on Iran's nuclear capabilities that has created misgivings among America's regional allies, chief among them Saudi Arabia, which see the Islamic Republic as a rival and even a threat.
On May-13-14, President Obama will meet with GCC leaders during a summit in Washington and at Camp David. He should initiate ""tough conversations"" and speak out against human rights violations within the Kingdom and its negative influence beyond its borders. Such an approach offers the best hope for restoring peace and stability to the region and would serve the best interests of both countries.

Pakistan Launches Hunt for Bus Hijackers Who Killed 19,nyt,"QUETTA, Pakistan —  Pakistani security forces launched a major operation before dawn Saturday to hunt down gunmen who hijacked two buses and killed at least 19 passengers in the country's southwest, officials said.

In a statement, the country's paramilitary Frontier Corps said 200 troops were taking part in the operation in the country's restive Baluchistan province, the home of a long-running insurgency that has seen increasing violence in recent weeks.

Baluchistan Home Minister Sarfaraz Bugti said the violence began Friday night when the gunmen abducted 25 passengers and killed 19. He said authorities recovered the remaining six passengers, one of whom is in critical condition.

Bugti said the abductors initially captured 70 passengers but let around 50 flee.

Private satellite news channel Geo TV aired an interview with a man it identified as a survivor, who said the gunmen who attacked the buses wore security force uniforms. He said the gunmen separated passengers by ethnicity, ordering Pashtun people to stand in line while allowing Baluch passengers to flee.

""The gunmen lined up Pashtun passengers after checking their identity cards and then opened fire,"" said the survivor, who the channel did not identify by name.

No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. However, Baluchistan is the scene of a low-intensity insurgency by Baluch nationalists, separatists and other groups demanding more autonomy and a greater share of the province's gas and mineral resources. Similar attacks by Baluch nationalists have seen them let Baluch flee.

Elsewhere in Pakistan, a suicide bomber blew himself up Friday near a stadium in Lahore where a cricket match was underway between Pakistan and Zimbabwe, killing a police officer and wounding six, Information Minister Pervez Rashid told Geo TV.

Police initially said the explosion, which was heard during the match, was caused by an electric transformer nearly a kilometer (mile) away from the Gaddafi Stadium.

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing, but the Pakistani Taliban, which has been at war with the government for years, has carried out past suicide bombings targeting civilians.",0.0046134016475706868,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.024164309832180039, u'mexico': 0.075974485962790342, u'abortion': 0.031818694209963611, u'immigration': 0.043734527399493336, u'trade': 0.060895439409503087, u'campaign_finance': 0.025611617529413367, u'other': 0.24323938623353286, u'china': 0.10066377865076828, u'military': 0.033150896712784227, u'terrorism': 0.12631430965339907, u'economy': 0.059757001671602895, u'health': 0.040492281090556165, u'women': 0.13418327164401259}"

Tomorrow's Women,huffpo,"Writer and painter

Having recently spent time with a house full of older teenage girls I observe with interest and some trepidation this new generation. I smile with joy when they grab a book and immerse themselves in it, frown when a line of heads glows by the light of mobile phones all night long, relish their deft hands and inquisitive minds embracing fresh vegetables from the garden, worry about their sharp judgement of others based on Facebook artifice, and generally listen to their pronouncements and peep at their mannerisms. The way they dress, laugh and interact is not that far removed from my own teenage years - they all have their own distinct personalities with an understandable dose of egocentricity, and some are better versed in social communication with adults than others. 
On the whole they are strong (albeit angst tinged) young women who have grown up with empowered female role models while happily accepting, it seems non-deferentially, those gender differences between them and the men in their lives. Differing religious and non-religious beliefs, sexual preferences, and complex ethnicity are as normal to them as breakfast cereal, and I day-dream about how wonderful it will be when they reach an age of careers and families, free from those toe-curling moments of prejudice still afflicting some of my own contemporaries. 
But what emerges as a distant rumbling is the nature and tone of their friendships, altogether different from my day when an intensive ebb and flow of affection was rarely impinged upon by rivalry. Yes, competitiveness naturally existed but it skulked along the periphery while being generally absent between friends at this age. I always dreaded the idea of attending a ballet school, as a family friend did, not because of the physical training but because of the mental and emotional rigour needed to combat the in-built competitiveness at such a young age. That for all the shared sympathies about bleeding feet and blisters, gruelling hours and emaciation, their friendship could never be more than a game of postulation to guarantee success at the next step of their careers. For the rest of us, however, even doing the same A Level subject allowed for a non-rivalrous friendship while career choices and general life direction tootled along a path of Quixotic vagueness.
Yet looking at young women still in high school today, the singularity of drive and ambition, and the relentless discipline needed to keep these traits motored and gunned seems to have blunted the innocence of friendship, or worse still, the selflessness of it. The competitiveness no longer lies in situations that arise from wanting the same job, dance in the same ballet company, or play in the same orchestra; in a way opportunity is more extensive than ever before and we welcome this in a recession full of future uncertainty.
This new competitiveness, however, lies in a more universal goal - for existence on this planet - for a greater positioning to be able to benefit from its physical energy and resources. In a truly global market, what was once the competition for the job within the city of our aspiration is now one for existence within an entire world. Among the bonhomie, laughs and shared experiences lies a hard-edged and lone drive to carve out a piece of the planet for oneself, because occupying it is more difficult than getting a job.
The evolved self in these girls is torpedo--precisioned and visceral. In an overcrowded environment that picks off frailty, the self emanates a strength of purpose and individual presence that outweigh the traditional rewards of old. A piece of the action now means a share of the world's energy. It makes young women grow up fast and survival-savvy, more Renaissance and less 21st century with its sexualisation through obnoxious rappers. Faith in themselves, a kind of ""self-faith"" is healthily prevalent. Though perhaps disconcerting, it is a natural evolution of the mind and the empowerment of the female adapting to ever-changing circumstances. Ambition lies less in populating previous male bastions of the work environment, more about owning part of an eroding landscape of physiological opportunity. And when these women find themselves jostling for diminishing air in the same room I wouldn't want to daydream about the outcome, especially if there was only one oxygen mask left.",0.0088501607564017305,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.0066242325058795603, u'mexico': 0.0070216888186846954, u'abortion': 0.00474584447279128, u'immigration': 0.0042068920054547411, u'trade': 0.0060774847715216029, u'campaign_finance': 0.0029147012555469456, u'other': 0.37232565659032046, u'china': 0.013555504826883152, u'military': 0.0059480891611978096, u'terrorism': 0.019482763090711376, u'economy': 0.0032226017926627244, u'health': 0.0055256767582254783, u'women': 0.54834886395012028}"

Anny Pena, 30, and Jonny Pena, 32, met when they were both deployed in Arizona.

            
            StoryCorps
            
        



StoryCorps' Military Voices Initiative records stories from members of the U.S. military who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. When former Marine Staff. Sgt Jonny Pena came back from Afghanistan, he wasn't the same man who had left for the war. He and his wife, former Marine Sgt. Anny Pena, met when they were stationed in Arizona. Two years later, in 2007, they got married; then they had a son. They decided Anny would leave the military, while Jonny stayed in the service — and volunteered to deploy to Afghanistan. Today, Anny and Jonny Pena are divorced, but they remain good friends. At a Storycorps interview in New York City, they talked about the challenges they faced as military spouses, and what happened when Jonny came home. But first, Jonny asked Anny how she felt when he volunteered to deploy. ""It was very upsetting, because ... I had a 3-year-old and a newborn,"" Anny says. ""And part of me felt that you were pretty much walking out on our family."" ""It was a hard decision to make,"" Jonny tells her. ""But I couldn't live with myself if I'd spent almost nine years in the Marines Corps and hadn't done my job."" 

I used to have nightmares that someone would knock on the door with a flag. And that's all that I was gonna get back.


Anny Pena


""As a Marine, I could relate to that,"" Anny says. ""But I used to have nightmares that someone would knock on the door with a flag. And that's all that I was gonna get back. ""Sometimes you would call me, and you'll say, 'Oh, I'm not gonna be able to talk for a couple of days.' And those couple of days were like the longest days of my life. ""The whole time it's like you sleep with your phone. Just waiting for a text, or waiting for a call, just anything that lets me know, 'He's still okay, he's coming back,' "" she says. ""And then, when you came back, it was a huge relief. ""But it wasn't the same as before. I remember thinking, 'My husband stayed in Afghanistan. He never came home.' "" ""I remember being at the train station, and just, an uncontrollable sense of dread and sadness. And not being able to see any good,"" Jonny says. ""I couldn't think about my kids. I couldn't think of the fact that somewhere, someone loved me. ""I honestly just felt that life was meaningless. And I dunno, like, I just saw that train come and I felt my body twitch towards it. And I think at that point, you know, I realized that I was lost and I didn't know why. 

I couldn't think about my kids. I couldn't think of the fact that somewhere, someone loved me.


Jonny Pena


""I wish I was that guy that I was before. Maybe, you know, if I had come back the same, things wouldn't have turned out the way they did, between you and me."" The two live in New Jersey — separately. Anny works as an intelligence analyst, and Jonny is in his final year of law school. ""You know, my love for you was always unconditional,"" Anny says. ""I think that's why I think that we're able to have the good relationship that we have. ""A lot of guys will get divorced, and they move away. You chose to get an apartment within walking distance from us so that you could be there as much as possible. You come twice during the week, have dinner, help with homework. You're a good dad,"" she says. Their kids are Jason, 7, and Gabby, 4. ""Despite everything we went through, we still care about each other,"" Anny says. ""Maybe not as a married couple, but ... pretty close. And I wouldn't have it any other way.""  Audio produced for Weekend Edition by Von Diaz.

PITTSBURGH -- Pittsburgh Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey left Sunday's preseason game against Green Bay in the first quarter with a left ankle injury.
The four-time Pro Bowler was blocking in front of running back Le'Veon Bell when Packers cornerback Ha Ha Clinton-Dix rolled onto Pouncey's leg while making a tackle. Pouncey lay on the Heinz Field turf for several minutes before walking off under his own power. He was examined on the sideline before being taken to the locker room for X-rays.

Want To Start Writing Poetry? Here's How,huffpo,"Diana Raab, Ph.D.is a transpersonal psychologist, poet, memoirist and essayist.
April is National Poetry month and if you were turned off by poetry in high school, maybe it's a good time to revisit the genre. Modern day poetry is not laden with the rhymes of the past. While it might be entertaining to be inspired by iconic poets, modern poets write what is more commonly called ""narrative poetry,"" which is essentially poetry that tells a story.
This is such a perfect poem for us baby boomers who are beginning to look back and reflect upon the lives we have led, reminiscing how we were when we younger, always wanting to grow up so quickly. While many of us have tried to embrace our subsequent life transitions, we now look backwards with a mix of wisdom and wonder.
Reading and writing poetry also has healing and transformative powers. As a matter of fact, many therapists augment their treatments by encouraging their clients to write poetry to express their feelings. This is one way to foster hidden creativity and a chance to allow the client to express themselves using another form. This may be done by writing about a moment or experience in the past, the present or even the future. The idea is to write including as many details as possible so the reader feels as if they are with you on the page, living the experience side by side. Writing poetry also forces you to go deeper into your heart and to write with your heart and not your head as a way to access your inner voice.
Like all types of writing, if you want to be a poet, it is imperative that you read lots of poetry. If you have never written a poem or have not written in a long time, a good place to begin is by writing a prose poem. This type of poem uses the rhythm of a sentence. It could be just a few sentences about a moment that changed your life, a vignette or a short story. The prose in a prose poem extends to the right hand margin, where verse breaks each line at a place not determined by the margin. The prose poem can be a story, description, or a captured mood. In a prose poem, all unnecessary words, phrases and clauses are eliminated. The French poet Charles Baudelaire was largely responsible for popularizing the prose poem.   
Since there are really no formal requirements, it's often a comfortable way to begin writing poetry. Try this: Think of an experience you might want to write about. Tell the entire story in three or four sentences. This will force you to condense. Center the telling on an action full of emotion. Revise. If you like it, try another. This time make it five or six sentences long. Keep doing this over and over until it feels comfortable for you and before long, your writing will be flowing beautifully.",0.099794957620577676,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.016454744211022068, u'mexico': 0.028295669369703631, u'abortion': 0.032366887930010781, u'immigration': 0.074937533320245039, u'trade': 0.021371977693859585, u'campaign_finance': 0.019896083128903848, u'other': 0.57396449964725327, u'china': 0.033310151629600077, u'military': 0.01920066568198734, u'terrorism': 0.090220805485606043, u'economy': 0.019915083186769496, u'health': 0.027903851742808104, u'women': 0.04216204697223086}"

Victoria Azarenka Calls Out The Most Tired Double Standard In Tennis,huffpo,"Belarusian tennis player Victoria Azarenka may have lost to Serena Williams in Tuesday's quarterfinals at Wimbledon, but she made the most of her post-match presser. Azarenka lit a reporter on fire for asking about the two players' grunts, rather than the hard-fought game they had just played. 
As it has been so many times before, the ladies' grunting was a focus of the Azarenka-Williams matchup. When asked about the attention it was getting namely from the Wimbledon crowd in attendance, the No. 24 ranked player wondered aloud why the same question is rarely ever asked of male players (to boot, neither do we hear much discussion of the males' on-court attire).
""I'm so tired of these questions all the time,"" she told reporters after the match. ""It's so, in a way, annoying because guys grunt.""
But the tennis player didn't stop there, totally eviscerating the debate over women tennis players grunting altogether. 
I was practicing next to [Rafael] Nadal and he grunts louder than me and nobody noticed it. And why? I don't understand. Because why? The women on the court, both trying their hardest and giving everything they have and they make a noise. Is that a problem of tennis? It happens in every sport. So I think it's maybe it's time to just put it aside and not talk about it all the time because this is not what is important when there are two players playing on the Centre Court. We got to look a little bit past that, and see 'Oh my God, Serena played 24 aces.' Did any of the guys do [it] maybe in that match? Look at the good stuff, stop bringing this ridiculous stuff. Let's put aside the noise and how she looks, or how -- and look at the game. And the game proved itself today.
 
If Azarenka's response sounds familiar, it's because she was asked roughly the same thing two years ago. Back then, she also pointed out that Nadal and Novak Djokovic do the same thing.
Are critics fair in lambasting the levels of grunting that take place on the court? Maybe. In some cases, it has reached a point where it seems more for show and psyche than an actual release of physical exertion. If the Women's Tennis Association wants to and can address the issue, then so be it.
But if we're going to complain or make changes, let's complain about both men and women players equally, and make changes across the board. Because any time Williams (who, by the way, is on her way to possibly winning her 21st Grand Slam title), grunts, it's the source for a myriad of headlines, but men's grunting is still seemingly an ""under-the-radar"" issue.
After Roger Federer complained about Nadal's grunting, for example, some outlets dismissed Federer's complaint as nothing more than ""something minor"" and a ""nuisance,"" to what should really be the focus: his opponents skills on the court.
In fact, rather than debate what the WTA and Association of Tennis Professionals could do about both women and men grunting, some people have decided to instead just rank how sexual the women sound. Seriously. That's a real list that actually exists. (Eagerly awaiting the follow-up to which male tennis player gives the best O-face when returning a serve.)",0.026100780769041466,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.0084968857769960656, u'mexico': 0.0032824309388504828, u'abortion': 0.0060797021630785162, u'immigration': 0.0037993222625644302, u'trade': 0.004309087222060074, u'campaign_finance': 0.0057007844803153504, u'other': 0.59724015943644126, u'china': 0.0033569925723309626, u'military': 0.0070207107192987129, u'terrorism': 0.0056513389488174713, u'economy': 0.00085783864601004622, u'health': 0.0045349386930131942, u'women': 0.34966980814022347}"
These 2 Franchisee-Moms Aim to Fill the Gaps in STEM Education,fox,"
Franchise Players is Entrepreneur's Q&A interview column that puts the spotlight on franchisees. If you're a franchisee with advice and tips to share, email ktaylor@entrepreneur.com.
Women in the U.S. make up half the national workforce, but when it comes to careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math), men outnumber women, 3 to 1. 
Camilla Gazal and Flavia Naslausky are two Brazilian-American moms in Connecticut on a mission to close that gap. As the first franchisees with the new company Zaniac, they are offering an opportunity for young girls -- and boys -- to fall in love with STEM. Their vehicle is Zaniac, which offers after-school ""campuses"" for kids in grades K-8. Unlike traditional tutoring, Zaniac offers activities like robotics using LEGO, computer coding, 3D printing, app design and lessons about physics using the game Minecraft.
With their nearly 40 years of combined experience in the male-dominated financial industry, Gazal and Naslausky are using that business expertise to start reversing the shortfalls of STEM curricula. 
The women have some ready-and-willing guinea pigs to practice on: They are the mothers, between them, of five children, ages 6 to 10. And both have previously worked to bolster their children's math education at home. Now, they have a more formalized system to expand their mission to make up for the gaps in K-12 education -- and maybe even make some money along the way.

Names: Camilla Gazal and Flavia Naslausky
Franchise owned: Zaniac Learning Center; Greenwich, Connecticut
How long have you owned a franchise? 
We opened Zaniac Greenwich in December 2013, after meeting founder Paul Zane Pilzer by chance on the ski slopes of Park City, Utah.

Why franchising? 
We knew we wanted to open an enrichment center for kids that was focused on STEM; however, we realized our expertise was in business and finance, and not in education. We knew how to add more math into children’s lives -- but what about incorporating the other aspects of STEM? We decided that through franchising, we could acquire the best products and support, while still being able to focus on the operations of our business. 
Because we were the first Zane Prep franchisees, we not only became franchise owners, but have played an instrumental role in building and shaping the Zaniac franchise model. 
What were you doing before you became a franchise owner? 
Prior to Zaniac, Camilla worked for BBVA Securities and Santander Securities as a senior vice president in fixed income sales. Camilla’s responsibilities included the marketing of fixed-income products to new institutional clients in Canada, Central America, the Caribbean and South America. As part of her role, she traveled extensively to those regions to manage relationships with central banks and institutional investors.
Flavia most recently worked as the director of Latin American Currency Strategy at the Royal Bank of Scotland in Stamford, Connecticut, covering economic and financial market developments, focused mainly in Latin American (Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru and Mexico).
She travels regularly to the region and markets her strategy product in Europe and Asia. She is regularly quoted for her FX Strategy insights in major media sources, including the FT, the Wall Street Journal, Barron's and Bloomberg and business newspapers across Latin America, including Valor, Estadao and O Globo.
Why did you choose this particular franchise?
It is impossible not to fall in love with Paul Zane Pilzer’s ideals, charisma, and way of seeing life. He’s a visionary regarding the future of education, challenging the current, outdated school system. He believes technology can increase access to education and allow students to learn at their individual level through a customized curriculum. Paul is also a staunch believer in peer-based learning.
For two women in their forties with pre-teen children, Paul Zane Pilzer’s family-first approach to business and entrepreneurship was also very important to us. When we first met Paul, Zaniac did not yet exist as a franchise. He saw potential in the two of us to help launch a franchise program for Zaniac. We recognized the opportunity and trusted his vision for the business.
Q: How much would you estimate you spent before you were officially open for business? 
The total was $300,000. A breakdown includes: $100,000 for the build-out; $50,000 for the franchise fee; $30,000 for a security deposit for the lease; $20,000 for legal fees; $12,000 for PR and marketing; $40,000 for equipment; $40,000 for furniture; $5,000 for educational supplies; and $3,000 for hiring.
Where did you get most of your advice/do most of your research?
We relied on our own experiences as mothers of a total of five children between the ages of six and 10. We were very aware of the existing gaps and shortfalls in current U.S. schools and the need for enrichment. At the time, we were both complementing our children’s education at home, especially in math. Our homes were our research lab. Our kids will eventually realize that they were the guinea pigs, and our biggest inspiration. 
We were working with limited resources and relied heavily on our financial/economics backgrounds and business school experience. Our time in the financial industry proved to be helpful in terms of providing us with an analytical lens, while helping us remain calm under the pressure that comes with starting a business. Admittedly, we also relied a lot on our gut feeling because we believed in the franchise model. 
Finally, our children loved everything about Zaniac, and have since become completely obsessed with the concept. Witnessing their overwhelming responses firsthand solidified our decision to bring this opportunity to other young children throughout the area.

What were the most unexpected challenges of opening your franchise? 
Real estate was by far the biggest challenge. Real estate consumed most of our financial resources, as we knew that our location would be important to the success of our business. The second biggest challenge was finding qualified employees who felt as passionately as we do about Zaniac’s mission. Workaholics like ourselves tend to scare people away. 
One of our biggest fears was that embarking in the franchising business and owning our own business would take even more time away from our families. We had an unexpected surprise, whereby this particular industry and franchise increased quality time with our children, who enjoy watching their mothers build a business and love providing their own views on what direction education should be going. 
What advice do you have for individuals who want to own their own franchise? 
Work hard. Dream big. Be passionate about what you do. Make absolutely sure you have a strong support team surrounding you (a lawyer, accountant and manager; a PR and marketing firm; real estate brokers, family). Do not take anything personally. Have fun. If it’s not fun, then it’s just work. 
What’s next for you and your business? 
We’re having a blast and look forward to growing the business and improving it as we go along, making it the model of enrichment. We are opening two more Zaniac campuses in 2015 and have plans to open another seven.

Leonard powers Spurs past Clippers in Game 3,fox,"			
			 San  Antonio, TX  (SportsNetwork.com) -  Kawhi  Leonard added  to his  growing    collection  of hardware  on Thursday  when he  was named  the NBA's  Defensive    Player of the Year.He put his complete game on display in Friday's Game 3.
Leonard scored a career-high 32 points in less than 29 minutes and anchored an 
  incredible  defensive  effort to guide  the San Antonio  Spurs to a 100-73 win 
  over the Los Angeles Clippers.
Leonard  showcased his two-way dominance from the opening tip. He finished 13- 
  of-18 shooting with three steals and two blocks, playing less than two minutes 
  in the fourth quarter with the game well in hand.
Boris  Diaw chipped in 15 points and six rebounds off the bench to make up for 
  the relative lack of production from Tim Duncan, who scored 28 points to carry 
  the  Spurs to their overtime win in Game 2. The two-time MVP was quiet in this 
  one, netting just four points on 2-of-6 shooting.
The Spurs will look to take a commanding 3-1 series lead in Sunday's Game 4.
The  Clippers won Game 1 in convincing fashion and lost a heartbreaker in Game 
  2,  but they  looked overmatched  in their  first game  in San  Antonio. Blake 
  Griffin was the lone bright spot with 14 points, 10 rebounds and five assists.
Chris  Paul was  limited  to seven  points and  committed  six turnovers,  but 
  perhaps  the bigger issue for LA was the lack of production from its reserves. 
  Jamal  Crawford's  1-for-11 highlighted  an  abysmal  night for  the  Clippers 
  reserves, who contributed just 30 points on 41 shots.
Leonard  scored  twice during San  Antonio's 9-2 start. He  added a pair of 3- 
  pointers  during a 10-2  run later in the first quarter that extended the lead 
  to 25-13.
Leonard  finished  the first  half with  16 points, none  bigger than his one- 
  handed alley-oop on a feed from Danny Green. That flush highlighted a 9-0 run, 
  which Leonard capped with his coast-to-coast layup.
The  Spurs led 46-38  at halftime and looked to put the game away early in the 
  third. Leonard took it upon himself to make sure that was the case.
He  scored  11 on  5-of-5  shooting  in less  than  five  minutes out  of  the 
  break. His triple at 7:23 capped a 13-5 push that made it 59-43.
Patty  Mills  and Green hit  consecutive 3s during an  8-0 flurry early in the 
  fourth  that put the game out of reach. Leonard put an exclamation mark on the 
  blowout  with a three-point play at 7:39 of the fourth that made it a 30-point 
  game.
He  checked  out less than a  minute later to  a roaring ovation from his home 
  crowd.
Game Notes

ASSEMBLAGE: Meet Queer Punk Band bottoms,huffpo,"“ASSEMBLAGE“ is an inquiry into the different ways artists utilize performance and technology to explore and express different notions of identity. An effort to push forward marginalized artists with a focus on people of color, non-western nationalities and those along the queer/trans spectrum, “ASSEMBLAGE” provides a platform for analysis of how art and performance intersect with the lives of these individuals who are visibly and openly existing in the digital age. This is the eighth installment.
Queer punk band bottoms is a musical group unlike any other. Made up of two performers -- Jake Dibeler and Simon Leahy aka Babes Trust -- and drummer Michael Prommasit, bottoms is a project that in many ways explores the complicated, nuanced relationship queer people have with themselves and the world around them in 2015.
bottoms came together a bit over a year ago following the break-up of Leahy and Prommasit's previous band Teeth. Dibeler joined the group as the lead vocalist -- a style of vocalization that can be described as high-pitched screaming in a way that almost sounds manufactured but, in reality, is Dibeler's actual voice.

Dibeler's voice aside, what makes bottoms so unique and important is the hyper-political nature of their work and the shades of queer identity and experience encapsulated in the group's lyrics.
The queer community is at a strange and significant moment in time, as we move out of the aftermath of the AIDS crisis and into an era marked by PrEP, instantaneous access to sex via the Internet, mainstream transgender visibility and the widespread legalization of same-sex marriage. As specific types of queers become more visible and our relationships with sex, societal institutions and governance shift, we are at a place where many people are reimagining or rethinking what it means to be queer. 
bottom's music heavily explores the intersection of this complicated history marked by violence and disease with modern day realities surrounding visibility and sex.
""We're really interested in a lot of the culture surrounding the gay community during the time of the AIDS crisis,"" Diebler told The Huffington Post. ""There was a great resistance from the conservatives to acknowledge the crisis, so the gay community had to look to each other for support. I hope that bottoms can harness that same sort of energy -- angry queers with a message. I think that we're in this place as gays that's very apathetic. Being able to fuck dudes from your phone in minutes is amazing, PrEP is amazing, but it really makes for this sort of 'pre-AIDS-there's-nothing-wrong' mentality -- and maybe that's true, maybe nothing is wrong and this is the end of HIV and AIDS. But at the moment -- I think we need to balance this 'have unprotected sex with a stranger in an alley' attitude with one of respect and care for a community that lost a huge chunk of themselves in the 90s.""

bottoms also deals with notions of shame and self-hatred, shared realities for queer people navigating the world we have operated in since the beginning of time. As with any way of existing the world, it can be hard to communicate the realities of queer experience to those who haven't felt the effects of growing up as a faggot, trans person, or anywhere along the queer spectrum. For this reason, music -- or more broadly, performance -- serves as an immensely valuable tool to tell these stories authentically and unapologetically and, hopefully, change our culture. 
As Dark Matter mentioned in a previous installment of ASSEMBLAGE, ""no matter how many policies we change, no matter how many legislations we pass, people’s hearts and minds aren’t going to change. The only way to actually change people's hearts and minds is to engage them with feeling and emotion. Because often oppression is incredibly irrational."" Using art and performance to open a dialogue about these different shades of queer experience, like learned shame and self-hatred, is very present in the work of bottoms. The group's first music video, ""My Body,"" is about the complicated relationships queer people have with their bodies, from issues of gay body shame to the spectrum of transgender identity. Brooklyn performer Macy Rodman stars in the ""My Body"" video, below.

Performance, of course, also serves a dual role for the performer in the exploration of their own sense of self throughout this process of authentic storytelling. Within the context of a queer punk band like bottoms, the experiences being talked -- or screamed -- about are tangible, real and felt by every queer person in the room. At the risk of making a claim about universal queer experience (of which there is none), it can often feel very much that the pain, struggle, freedom and history of what it means to be a queer person bleeds through bottoms' performances in an unapologetic way that truly does connect with any random queer watching from the audience -- which is truly a remarkable accomplishment for any artist.
""I'm definitely always performing -- literally always,"" Dibeler elabprated. ""'All the worlds a stage,' all that bullshit. It's true, every moment is basically a standup comedy show for me, whether you want to be there or not. bottoms doesn't really step into a role when we get on stage, and it's the same with my own performances. I think a reason why it's relatable in this way is because you can actually see a real person on the stage. That's actually why I don't really like being on stage when I perform. I'd rather be in the audience because I think it's important to break down that wall of this 'We're a band and you're an audience and you're here to stand and listen to us.' We want the audience to be, like, 'Those fags in wigs are screaming about death and disease and fear are me, and I am a part of this too.'""

As the nature of what it means to be a queer person shifts and changes with the passing of time, one can only hope that we always have art and performance that accurately reflect the intricate nuances of what these experiences are like -- politically, socially, emotionally and physically. 
At this strange and complicated period for the queer community, bottoms seems to be accomplishing this in an impressive way that is not only informed by our history with AIDS, persecution and violence but also the current climate of agency and self-identification that parallels mainstream LGBT ""acceptance."" We hope to see more work like this from others along the spectrum of queer performance in the future.
bottoms is currently prepping to record the group's second EP later this summer.. Their first EP, ""Goodbye,"" can be found here or head here for their Soundcloud.

"223 Thoughts We Had Watching ""The Bachelor"" Australia Premiere",buzzfeed,"1. HERE WE GO. Hopefully this ends better than last season. *cough* Blake *cough*. 
2. âOne man and 19 beautiful women will begin the adventure of a LIFETIME.â - a completely normal phrase everyone loves to hear.
3. Oh heeeey new Bachelor.
4. The previews of the coming season looks dramatic AF.
5. The house looks dreeeeamy. Candles and flowers and fairy lights, oh my!
6. Aaaand 30 seconds in and weâve got our first abs shot. HERE FOR IT.
7. Those promo photos did not do this guy justice at all tbh.
8. This whole shirtless montage is A+.
9. Whoever filmed that slow motion shower shot is a goddamn artist.
10. OMG THE BACHELOR HAS A DOG. Be still my heart.
11. OF COURSE he works with kids. And is passionate about their health and fitness. AND he wants them himself.
12. Theyâve nailed it with this guy tbh.
13. Oh, heâs from Tasmania. Well, nobodyâs perfect.
14. Aw his family is adorable.
15. Another slow-mo abs shot. 
16. The producers know what we want.
17. Abs. Itâs abs.
18. Itâs not a true episode without The Bachelor looking longingly out to the beach, imagining his future good-looking spouse and their future good-looking babies. 
19. First impression he actually seems like a DECENT HUMAN BEING, unlike old mate Blake Garvey. 
20. Like his voice doesnât sound monotonous so thatâs definitely something. 
21. Was Sam a former stripper though?? Arenât most of them?
22. Iâm so distracted by his hot pink scoop neck, I have no idea what he actually just said. 
23. YAAASS OSHER! Everyoneâs favourite wingman. 
24. Itâs nice to see Osherâs hair on my TV again. Thereâs something hypnotic about it.
25. Osher is so damn cheery though. Like heâs just so excited to be back in that fairytale house, helping to bring together one man and the 19 women heâs going to date at once.
26. #Romance.
27. Here come the intro clips for the ladies! 
28. The first girl, Nina, is a wedding planner who desperately wants a wedding of her own. Of course.
29. Next up we have Sarah the event planner, aka the token smart blonde rocking glasses.
30. OMG. SHE HAD A DREAM ABOUT HER CONNECTION WITH THE BACHELOR. SHE FEELS CONNECTED TO HIM BECAUSE SHE DREAMT ABOUT IT. I AM DEAD.
31. I dreamt I was relaxing in the Greek Islands last night but unfortunately I wasnât connected enough to turn it into reality. 
32. Sandra is a P.E. teacher, which conveniently complements the Bachelorâs career.
33. Sheâs definitely a âwooâ girl.
34. Like the one that yells out âWOOOOOOO!!!â every time something mildly excites her. 
35. âFemales find me very intimidating.â Oh here we go.
36. Like, I know the whole premise of this show is pitting women against each other, but COME ON.
37. I feel so conflicted about the whole thing tbh.
38. Like, itâs wrong.
39. But so damn entertaining.
40. My problematic fave.
41. Meanwhile, Sandra says she âcanât tone it downâ. Should we take bets on how long it will take before sheâs pissing all the other girls off?
42. A week? A day? An hour? A minute?
43. Heather is an aspiring filmmaker who sounds a bit skeptical about the whole thing and is also wearing a â90s choker. I love her already.
44. Ohh sheâs doing yoga to show off how ~flexible~ she is. Ahem.
45. And weâre back to the Bach. He looks very dashing in that suit.
46. âGâday mateâ. The voice doesnât match the suit and itâs somehow more endearing.
47. âYouâre the luckiest guy in Australia,â says Osher. Sure Jan.
48. Awww Bach seems really nervous. I love him.
49. HE IS ACTUALLY SO HANDSOME?!
50. He has a very nice smile.
51. Actually has anyone else noticed Osher and Sam have MATCHING SMILES?! I cannot stop staring at their teeth. 
52. I wonder what whitening products they use. 
53. Bach just said the kids he works with call him Woody. WOODY?!
54. âLike the Toy Story character.â Oh my.
55. âGo for it Woody!â Life advice from kids is the best.
56. And now itâs finally time for Woody to meet the girls.
57. GO. FOR. IT. WOODY. 
58. First limo pulls up to the rose petal-covered driveway. Totally normal, nothing to see here.
59. Forget the Bachelor, that beautiful house gives me heart eye emojis.
60. OMG HER DRESS. ITâS GORGEOUS.
61. SHE is gorgeous.
62. Woody is giddy.
63. Wait what was her name again? 
64. Woody looks confused too. 
65. âSnezana. Say it like parmigiana.â Just a little name banter for ya on a Wednesday night.
66. Well that was a nice first encounter. The way he looked back at her was really sweet.
67. Hold your horses Woody this is only the first girl.
68. Lol she forgot to ask his name.
69. NBD Parmie. Iâm sure you can ask one of the other 18 girls heâs dating.
70. Sarah the smart blonde is here and sheâs wearing a white dress. Subliminal bridal messages?
71. Oh Woody is into it.
72. He just asked her to spin.
73. Ugh Woody no.
74. Oh now she asked him to spin. I am more into that.
75. This is such awkward banter.
76. Woody is also into this British vetâs hot pink dress.
77. Is he just trying to make conversation or is he really that into dresses?
78. Oh god. Sheâs talking about anal glands.
79. âDoes he need his anal glands doing?â This is exactly how you should pick someone up.
80. OMG Woodyâs face. Same, Woody. Same.
81. MAKE IT STOP.
82. STOP TALKING ABOUT ANAL GLANDS.
83. STOP IT NOW.
84. âI got verbal diarrheaâ literally tho.
85. ANAL GLANDS. GIRL NO.
86. This Rachel girl in the blue dress is literally doing party tricks. Sheâs making a balloon rose which is kinda clever but also I donât think theyâve actually exchanged any words.
87. He just said she impressed him the most, how polite.
88. This girl is talking in another language to Woody and he just got that look on his face when youâre like, âI still didnât quite catch what you said but Iâve already asked you to repeat it twice so now Iâm just going to smile and nod and hope thatâs the right response.â
89. She just said sheâll be his TURKISH DELIGHT and I canât even with this.
90. âLook at that dress!â He really, really loves the dresses.
91. Oh weâre really zooming through the girls now so I guess these ones arenât as important for the ~plot~.
92. Heather rocks up in a sparkly dress and she looks goddamn BEAUTIFUL.
93. âLook at that dress.â Woody approves, except heâs also said that to literally every other girl.
94. âYouâre so unattractive.â Yes thatâs a great way to show someone youâre attracted to them. Are we in year 7 again?
95. âCan I call you dude?â This is not relationship goals, Heather.
96. Sheâs obsessing over the house. She knows he doesnât own itâ¦ right? 
97. âI wanna find someone I can be friends withâ¦ really good friends.â Like how Louis Tomlinson and his alleged baby mama are ~really good friends~?
98. Jacinda is wearing a bright orange dress, sitting in the limo talking to herself. I love her already.
99. She brought a polaroid to take an old school selfie, girlâs got moves.
100. SHAKE IT LIKE A POLAROID PICTURE.
101. She kissed it omg.
102. âOur first kiss.â Wow Woody. Go in son. 
103. Heâs into the fact that sheâs a âchildrenâs entertainer.â
104. Wait until he hears about the P.E. teacher.
105. OMG SHE JUST TOOK A PHOTO OF HIS BUTT.
106. Now sheâs flashing it around.
107. The other girls are into it.
108. Same tbh. 
109. #Bachbooty.
110. Speeding through more girls.
111. This girl âmadeâ a cupcake and OH WOW HEâS REALLY EATING IT.
112. Now heâs trying to get her to take a bite and like lol as if sheâll want to mess up her makeup on camera rn.
113. Next girl brought beers. ANOTHER COOL GIRL.
114. She made a âbig impressionâ. IN YOUR PANTS MAYBE.
115. #Wood4Woody.
116. Sorry not sorry.
117. Here comes Zilda, all dressed in white. This bridal message isnât even subliminal this time, she literally just said, âitâs not a wedding dressâ¦ [but] maybe a glimpse into the future.â
118. And that music. DROP DAT BEAT. 
119. The person who organised the music for this show deserves an Aria or something.
120. Jaysus sheâs already asking him about kids and they met 30 seconds ago.
121. âHELLO MR BACHELOR.â Oh itâs Sandra, Miss âGirls Find Me Intimidatingâ.
122. How much has she been drinking?
123. âWeâre S&Sâ¦ that just goesâ¦ We have so much in common!â
124. I meanâ¦ not that much?
125. âI donât want to get ahead of myselfâ¦ but could this actually be the love of my life?â *Maniacal laughter*.
126. Oh boy.
127. Now sheâs just screaming at the other girls about partying.
128. âFlamboyan- noâ¦ annoying.â Lol Parmie corrected herself to be LESS nice about Sandra.
129. And she nailed it tbh.
130. Though the best thing about being on the Bachelor would be all the champagne you get to drink, lbr. So Sandraâs doing something right. 
131. Oh that is some fairy tale music going on as Emily walks in.
132. The show loves her already.
133. âWhat an entrance.â So does Woody, apparently.
134. At least he didnât say âlook at that dress.â
135. âThey saved the best until last.â Rude, Woody.
136. He just ~subtly~ tried to touch her hand. He is very into her.
137. âShe really really made an impression.â IN YOUR PANTS.
138. Sorry.
139. Not sorry.
140. OK a little bit sorry.
141. CUE DRAMA.
142. Sandra is bitching already, calling Zilda âMiss Pamela Andersonâ. Lordt.
143. THE RETURN OF THE WHITE ROSE DUN DUN DUNNN.
144. Itâll go to the lady who left the best impression on olâ Woody - I call Emily.
145. The white rose GIVES THE WOMAN THE POWER OVER THE BACHELOR. The girls get to ask HIM on a date for the first time ever because this show exists in an alternate universe where itâs still 1957.
146. These ladies are all so goddamn beautiful. Iâd be intimidated too, Woody.
147. OMG this girl burned her dress on one of the 197 thousand candles scattered around the house. Iâm surprised it hasnât happened sooner.
148. Woody just nicknamed Jacinda a hurricane which is not all that flattering tbh.
149. I love the other girls just sitting 10 metres away, analysing their body language.
150. Iconic.
151. And Sandra is bitching about Zilda again. She is out of control already. 
152. âIf you donât gossip then youâre clearly not a woman.â WHOA WHOA WHOA SANDRA NO. 
153. SIT DOWN SANDRA. 
154. Reshael is NOT here for it. She is staying very poised.
155. âI like everyone.â Team Reshael tbh. 
156. 10/10 do not trust Sandra.
157. Is Heather a fan of The Secret?
158. Apparently itâs working for her.
159. âSheâs already put her foot her in the mouthâ¦ and I love it.â Aw Woody youâre cute.
160. But this is so awkward.
161. âI grew into my head.â Dat banter.
162. OOOH heâs touching her knee. ~BODY LANGUAGE~.
163. âI used to make He Man and Barbie make out.â Oh dude. We all did that.
164. OMG Sandra was bitching about Zilda to Reshael, now sheâs trying to bitch about Reshael to Zildal?! 
165. Zilda is not here for it either. Go Zilda.
166. Now Sandra wants to talk about it in front of the whole group. WHAT A MESS!
167. This is like high school but set in a mansion, with lots of alcohol and candles. 
168. Sandra honey Reshael did not make you out to be terrible you did that all on your own.
169. Sandra has been watching too much Jaâmie King.
170. Whoever did the editing on this and juxtaposed Woody talking about paradise while Sandra goes in on Reshael deserves a million gold stars.
171. Jacindaâs back there eating her popcorn a.k.a. is all of us.
172. âIâm just the bigger person.â SANDRA IS ACTUALLY A PARODY OF HERSELF.
173. Yaass Parmie and Woody getting some one-on-one time. 
174. âIâm quite fond of parmigiana.â PARMIE IS IN.
175. Who isnât fond of parmigiana tbh.
176. âI canât believe Iâm not a dad already.â Thatâs the sound of ovaries around Australia exploding.
177. Oh Parmie is a the ~HOT MOM~, as Unreal would say.
178. Which makes me uncomfortable in light of what happened on Unreal.
179. I will never watch The Bachelor in the same way again thanks to that show tbh.
180. Oh god the British woman is still talking about anal glands!
181. âFor me talking about anal glands is completely normal.â Clearly. 
182. Stahhhp.
183. Tessa isnât comfortable in what sheâs wearing awww.
184. It really is so weird theyâre all dressed the same way.
185. Like is this to put them on an even playing field so he has to choose based only on their personalities?
186. Because they literally all look the same.
187. âItâs not about the dress,â says Woody, who actually said âlook at that dress!â to every girl.
188. Oh no. Sheâs doing yoga.
189. YOUâRE GOING TO RUIN YOUR DRESS.
190. Oh câmon like this fit healthy guy has never done a Downward Dog before.
191. Welp, apparently he was impressed, because heâs gone to get a rose. 
192. Just a red one tho.
193. âWell we suck.â Aw these girls. Clearly need to practice more sun salutations.
194. OMG TESSA. Statement alert.

Djokovic to Face Nadal in Monte Carlo Masters Semifinals,nyt,"MONACO —  Winning a game against Novak Djokovic these days is quite an achievement. Even when you're an U.S. Open champion.

Djokovic won the first eight games of his Monte Carlo Masters quarterfinal match Friday before Marin Cilic managed to hold his serve, raising a thumb in the air to celebrate.

The momentum change was short-lived, though, with the top-ranked Djokovic powering his way into the semifinals with a 6-0, 6-3 victory.

""Just all in all it was probably the best match I've played so far in the tournament,"" Djokovic said. ""That's what I want, what I wish for in this moment.""

The Serb, who has dropped only 12 games at the Country Club, extended his unbeaten record over his Croatian rival to 12 matches in another display of solid tennis.

Djokovic, who ended Rafael Nadal's reign in Monte Carlo when he won the clay-court Masters tournament in 2013, will next face the Spaniard in a match he sees as ""probably the biggest clay-court challenge you can have.""

It will be their 43rd career meeting, the first since Nadal beat Djokovic in last year's French Open final.

""I've got to prepare myself mentally for that,"" Djokovic said. ""Other than the mental part, I think physically I'm ready. I'm going to need to keep the high level of performance throughout the entire match tomorrow.""

Nadal, an eight-time champion at the Country Club, had to battle for nearly 3 hours before securing a 6-4, 5-7, 6-2 victory over David Ferrer, who stopped him in the quarterfinals last year.

""This is a very important victory for me, for the confidence in the next couple of months,"" said Nadal, who will be chasing a 10th French Open title from May 24.

Djokovic and Nadal have been going in opposite directions this season, as Nadal dropped to fifth in the world rankings following a string of poor results on hard court after recovering from a wrist injury and an appendectomy.

Back on his favorite surface, he passed a significant test against Ferrer, a fellow clay specialist.

Nadal looked set for a comfortable win when Ferrer needed treatment for a blister on a toe when down a break in the second set. But serving for the match at 5-4, Nadal was broken when Ferrer sent a backhand down the line followed by a deep forehand.

Ferrer broke again in the 12th game to claim the set.

Nadal recovered with a break at the start of the decider and broke again in the seventh game as Ferrer ran out of energy.

""Tomorrow I am not favorite, that is obvious,"" said Nadal. ""He is playing almost perfect. When the things go that well, it is difficult to stop a player like Novak.""

Djokovic is off to his best start since 2011. He has lost only two matches in 2015 and is bidding to win a third Masters title in a row this year following victories in Indian Wells and Miami.

""I like the way I'm playing right now,"" Djokovic said. ""I'm trying to impose all the variety in the game that I have.""

Earlier, Tomas Berdych advanced to the semifinals for the third time after Milos Raonic retired with a foot injury. He will face Gael Monfils, who followed up his convincing win over Roger Federer in the previous round with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over Grigor Dimitrov.

Raonic called for a trainer when trailing 5-2 in the first set to look at his strapped right foot, and then told Berdych he couldn't continue.

Berdych is chasing a second Masters title, 10 years after he made his breakthrough at the Paris Masters.

""If you look at the last 10 years, you're going to find three guys that pretty much took all of them,"" Berdych said about the tall order of winning titles in an era dominated by Djokovic, Nadal and Federer. ""They are taking all from us. Usually you've got at least two or three of these guys to win the title. Here it's a bit more open in that sense.""

Monfils has a poor 1-5 record against Berdych but managed to beat him on clay at the French Open two years ago.

""I must find the right tactics to neutralize his game because he gives me a lot of trouble,"" Monfils said. ""I'm never able to control him.""",0.086556210752611662,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.016642624391686706, u'mexico': 0.016848684795500321, u'abortion': 0.019124355290464006, u'immigration': 0.018449169214371119, u'trade': 0.019254637218508869, u'campaign_finance': 0.018240513385125719, u'other': 0.78757087351828414, u'china': 0.027471168167493096, u'military': 0.013016844792365834, u'terrorism': 0.032500428258374563, u'economy': 0.0055876365434574787, u'health': 0.01771178265825098, u'women': 0.0075812817661171572}"

FEINSTEIN WRITES FCC OVER TERRORIST GROUPS' ONLINE ACTIVITY — The Senate Intelligence Committee’s top Democrat wants the FCC to make sure its net neutrality rules aren't blocking Internet companies from censoring online content that inspires terrorism. Sen. Dianne Feinstein wrote a missive to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler in May — and made public Thursday — explaining as much, and the California lawmaker's office is set to receive a briefing on the topic soon, sources told MT.
Story Continued Below
""It has recently come to my attention that some broadband providers are suggesting, including through discussions with my staff on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, that the FCC order may prevent them from blocking the posting of information that inspires and aids terrorist activity such as Inspire Magazine, an online publication produced by al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula,"" Feinstein wrote in the May letter (http://bit.ly/1L9yOsk). She has also been pushing for social media companies to take a more active role to counter extremists who use their services.
Responding to an earlier letter, Wheeler in April sought to assuage her concerns, citing a provision in the 2015 Open Internet rules that clarifies those rules don't supersede national security and other obligations. ""The purpose of this provision is to ensure that open Internet rules do not restrict broadband providers in addressing the needs of law enforcement authorities, while ensuring that broadband providers do not use it as a loophole to the rules,"" he wrote (http://bit.ly/1L9yZDX). We're tracking.
-- NCSL URGES NET NEUTRALITY LEGISLATION: The National Conference of State Legislatures is calling on Congress to replace the FCC’s Open Internet Order with legislation that takes a lighter regulatory approach. While supporting rules against blocking, throttling or paid prioritization of content, the group pans Title II regulation as going against “a decades-long bipartisan Internet policy approach that fostered massive capital investment.” The resolution was introduced by a bipartisan pair of state lawmakers and approved by three-fourths of states participating: http://politico.pro/1L9BypE

APPLE SLIGHTLY MORE DIVERSE THAN BEFORE -- Apple’s 2015 diversity report shows a notable uptick in minority hiring over the past year, but overall changes resulted in only about 1 percentage point bump among gender and racial categories. Globally the company reported hiring 65 percent more women in the past year than the year before that. In the U.S. it hired 50 percent more black employees and 66 percent more Hispanic employees — the company’s most diverse hiring so far, according to a statement from CEO Tim Cook. Nearly 50 percent of all new hires in the first half of 2015 were women, black, Hispanic or Native American, he said.
That sounds great, but since there were so relatively few women and non-Asian minorities working at the company last year, those increases didn’t move the needle much. Apple’s workforce is still 69 percent male and 54 percent white, both categories down just 1 point from last year. As the Congressional Black Caucus pressures Apple and the tech industry to hire more minorities, the company’s African-American workforce rose 1 percentage point to 8 percent.
Nevertheless, the changes got the attention of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who issued a statement that Apple is showing “solid, measurable progress” even as “progress among other companies has been disappointingly slow.” See Apple’s diversity report here: http://apple.co/1L9y3zz
FTC’S DIVIDED REPUBLICANS -- This week’s decision at the FTC to adopt guidelines for competition cases earned different reactions from the two Republican commissioners. While Commissioner Joshua Wright hailed it on Twitter on Thursday as a step into “the modern world of antitrust policy,” Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen dismissed it as “short on guidance” and offering “practically no constraint on agency discretion.” In her dissenting comments, Ohlhausen railed against the commission for not seeking public input before making a decision (http://1.usa.gov/1DQKnBW).
-- The move did earn praise from some Hill Republicans, though. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte and antitrust subcommittee Chairman Tom Marino said the guidance is a “good first step” that will require close monitoring from lawmakers. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said it’ll now be easier for companies to comply with the FTC Act, though he wishes the commission had allowed time for public comment.
Elsewhere, TechFreedom said the plan is the only way to make sure the FTC doesn’t abuse its authority, and CEA president Gary Shapiro tweeted that it’s a “big win for tech.” The U.S. Chamber of Commerce wasn’t as supportive, saying the guidance “is disappointing as it fails to establish an objective standard that closes the door to varying interpretations.”
‘MOLE DETECTIVE’ CASE SETTLED -- The FTC is barring the makers of “melanoma detection” apps from making deceptive health claims, such as suggesting their apps can actually detect melanoma. Users of the $4.99 Mole Detective apps took photos of their moles and entered information into their cellphones to get an opinion about whether they might have a low, medium or high risk of melanoma.
“We haven’t found any scientific evidence that Mole Detective can accurately assess melanoma risk,” Jessica Rich, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said Thursday.
Under the settlement, (http://1.usa.gov/1Laex5Y) the app makers — L Health Ltd. — can’t make any more misleading or unsubstantiated claims about any product’s health benefits. A fine of more than $58,000 was suspended based on the company’s inability to pay, the FTC said.
The FTC settled the case in a 4-1 vote, with Ohlhausen dissenting over fears that it might deter beneficial health products from being developed.
VERIZON NIXES 3G THROTTLING — Verizon has decided it will no longer slow down 3G speeds to the heaviest users on unlimited data plans. That kind of throttling began in 2011, and as RCR Wireless reports (http://bit.ly/1DQUjeF), came to a close in June.
The only indication of the change so far came in an explanation of Verizon’s video optimization deployment, where the company explains that it began managing data speeds in 2011, then says, “We discontinued this practice in June, 2015.” The company intended to introduce a similar arrangement last year for 4G LTE customers but abandoned that policy on the day it was supposed to start.
""Because it was such a small subset of customers who were being impacted, we made the call to discontinue even a limited approach to throttling,"" a Verizon spokesman told MT. (h/t The Washington Post: http://wapo.st/1PamypB).
RESEARCHERS WANT IN ON FIGHT AGAINST NEW AUTODIALER RULES — Two research associations want to join the legal challenge to the FCC’s new rules restricting the use of autodialers. The Council of American Survey Research Organizations and the Marketing Research Association on Thursday filed a motion to intervene, saying their work to conduct survey, opinion and marketing research will be harmed by an unclear definition of autodialers.
They want a more restricted definition of an autodialer so that it doesn’t include any equipment that involves human intervention to place a call. They’re also challenging the decision to apply the rules to equipment that has the potential to be an autodialer, whether it’s being used that way or not.
The groups say they shouldn’t be held liable for calling someone who inherited a number that used to be OK to call, at least until the caller learns that the number was reassigned. “If the court rules in our favor, we could walk away with a more constrained autodialer definition and an applicable human intervention test — both of which could be major points of relief for the research industry,” CASRO President Diane Bowers said in a statement.

CORRECTED-UPDATE 3-Health insurer Cigna says 2nd-qtr medical costs stay low; profit beats,reuters,"(Corrects spelling of name Vishnu in 6th paragraph)
By Caroline Humer
July 30 (Reuters) - Health insurer Cigna Corp, which
agreed last week to be bought by Anthem Inc for $47 billion,
said on Thursday that medical services use was low in the second
quarter, helping to keep costs in check and beat Wall Street
profit estimates.
Cigna's report of a continued low utilization trend backs up
a growing industry view of this closely watched component of
insurer profitability. Anthem made similar comments on
Wednesday, when it reported better-than-expected quarterly
earnings.
Health insurers have benefited from low medical services use
during the past five years as the weak economy has kept down
doctor visits and hospitalizations and membership growth has
helped increase revenues.
But the rate of overall health spending has begun to
increase and medical use is expected to rise more as the economy
improves. The national healthcare reform law, also known as
Obamacare, has contributed to the increase as millions of people
gained health insurance coverage in the past two years.
That is driving insurers to consolidate to build scale to
help keep costs down and negotiate better deals with doctors and
hospitals.
""The reason why there is so much consolidation is because
utilization and the cost trend overall will go up, which will
pressure the profitability for these companies long term,""
Morningstar Research analyst Vishnu Lekraj said.
Aetna Inc agreed to buy smaller rival Humana Inc
 in early July, just weeks before Anthem and Cigna
reached a deal.
The mergers are expected to face antitrust scrutiny as
regulators consider their effect on insurance premium rates. The
concerns have kept Cigna shares far from Anthem's offer price of
more than $183.
Cigna shares dipped 0.4 percent at $144.81 on Thursday.
Cigna Chief Executive Officer David Cordani said on CNBC on
Thursday that the companies were already talking to state and
federal regulators. ""We will fully engage with state leaders and
federal leaders and those conversations have already started,""
Cordani said.
Cigna said its ratio of medical claims paid as a percentage
of premiums taken in, or MCR, was 77.5 percent for its
commercial business and 84.4 percent for its government
business. It expects medical costs to rise 5 percent to 6
percent in 2015.
Net profit rose to $588 million, or $2.26 per share, for the
second quarter, from $573 million, or $2.12 per share, a year
earlier.
Excluding items, Cigna earned $2.55 per share, beating the
average analyst estimate of $2.31, according to Thomson Reuters
I/B/E/S. On Friday when it announced the Anthem deal, Cigna said
second-quarter earnings would be at least $2.50 per share.
Cigna manages insurance plans for large companies and sells
health plans to individuals on government exchanges created
under the U.S. Affordable Care Act. It also manages government
Medicare and Medicaid plans.
Premiums and fees in Cigna's commercial and government
businesses rose 10 percent in the second quarter, boosted by the
addition of 524,000 customers.
Revenue rose about 9 percent to $9.49 billion, just below
the average analyst estimate of $9.53 billion.

Bullis football teammates Cameron Brown and Patrick Johnson II commit to Big Ten schools,washpo,"   Patrick Johnson II committed to Wisconsin, where he will play defensive back. (Doug Kapustin / The Washington Post)  Bullis football Coach Pat Cilento will be quick to note that the Potomac private school has produced famous football alumni before. Less than 15 years ago, both defensive back Tanard Jackson (2003) and linebacker Moises Foiku (2004) graduated from Bullis before moving onto Division I college football and, eventually, the NFL. But the two-time defending Interstate Athletic Conference champions may never have had this much talent at once, a development that’s been reinforced over the past five days. On Saturday, Bullis linebacker/defensive end Cameron Brown committed to Penn State while on a visit with his family. Defensive back Patrick Johnson II then followed suit Wednesday night, announcing his commitment to Wisconsin via Twitter after touring the campus and facilities with his father. The defensive duo joins highly touted quarterback Dwayne Haskins Jr., who committed to Maryland in May, as members of Bullis’s rising senior class to pledge to Big Ten schools. The Bulldogs also saw All-Met running back Devonte Williams and tight end/defensive lineman Jonathan Holland sign national letters-of-intent to play at Indiana and Penn State, respectively, beginning this fall. According to the Rivals.com database, which dates back only to 2002, Bullis has never had more than three Division I football recruits in the same recruiting class. “It just kind of happened that way, and I think we’ll love playing against each other,” said Johnson, who will remain in Madison, Wisc., through Friday. Both Brown and Johnson said they knew before these recent visits that the recruiting process would soon be over, and each listed Pittsburgh as the other finalist being considered. Johnson, a Northeast Washington native who transferred to Bullis from McKinley Tech, said he asked his parents permission to commit to Wisconsin two weeks ago, and got all the confirmation he needed this week. Brown, who transferred to Bullis from Blake before last season, noted the main objective of this past weekend was to convince his family members about his affinity for Penn State. “I felt comfortable from the beginning with them,” Brown said of the Nittany Lions Thur Thursday morning. “I just wanted to get around and make sure that was the place I wanted to be. I had my whole family up there and I let them see what I loved about it. They definitely understood.”   IVE OFFICIALLY COMMITTED TO PENN STATE UNIVERSITY 🔵⚪️🔵⚪️ #WEARE pic.twitter.com/W82a4m3ywX — Cameron Brown (@freakky21) July 18, 2015  Brown is a consensus four-star recruit and will begin his collegiate career at linebacker, although he could move to defensive end eventually. He will play both positions for Bullis this fall. Cilento said Johnson had been recruited as both a defensive back and a wide receiver, but preferred to stay in the secondary at the next level. The three-star prospect will initially line up at free safety at Wisconsin.   I'm proud to announce that I'm committed to the UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN #OnWisconsin 🔴⚪️ pic.twitter.com/cEXAwFhZrd — Patrick Johnson II (@PjohnsonII) July 22, 2015  “I liked everything,” Johnson said of the Badgers. “It has a great fanbase.

But that slight has taken a backseat to this fall, when Bullis must deal with the sort of elevated expectations that go hand in hand with recruiting success. “Now, it’s more time to perfect my craft than just go out and play and try to get exposure,” Brown said. “This team definitely has talent.” More from AllMetSports.com Recruit Watch: The latest football offers, commitments Bullis QB Dwayne Haskins Jr. commits to the Terps Tim Settle makes the grade, will play for Virginia Tech The full Virginia 2015 football schedule | Matchups to watch ",0.034954817666629411,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.010746784512468435, u'mexico': 0.0068189838115970342, u'abortion': 0.011920328175896633, u'immigration': 0.062719568917187149, u'trade': 0.038411859034211515, u'campaign_finance': 0.012269409174307579, u'other': 0.76610573779261548, u'china': 0.020640451293808131, u'military': 0.011539329423344596, u'terrorism': 0.013669237273240476, u'economy': 0.027303195008701146, u'health': 0.010213130103149778, u'women': 0.007641985479472038}"

How to Drink at a Wedding,huffpo,"Everything worth caring about in food, drink, and travel
By: Matt Lynch
It's summer, so chances are strong you're about to go to a wedding. Or you've already been to a wedding. Or you have no weddings to go to and are really, really lonely, which is sad and I'd truly love to help, but there's only room to help so many people at one time. The people I am aiming to help right now are those who will be drinking at weddings.
I have been to approximately 1,100 weddings during my adult life, and have consumed alcohol at almost all of them (advice on attending a dry wedding: don't, unless it's your brother's or something, because small talk with strangers and casual acquaintances necessitates performance-enhancing substances). I have consumed all of this alcohol without so much as a hint of fisticuffs, police intervention, or friends telling me ""you ruined my wedding,"" which makes me one of the country's foremost experts on wedding drinking. Maybe even one of the fivemost.
Follow these simple, time-tested steps and you too can stroll confidently into the post-wedding hotel brunch as fellow attendees glance up at you and say... nothing, because you did not horribly embarrass yourself, which is the first goal here. The second goal is to have fun out there. It's all quite similar to youth soccer in that respect.
Here's how you're going to play it.
More: The 43 Worst People at Every Wedding
As for day-of concerns, lay a good base at breakfast (eggs and carbs in whatever permutation you prefer) and drink plenty of fluids. In this instance, fluids should not include Bloody Marys. Save it for the main event. Do feel free to get a flask ready if your intel has uncovered a somewhat restrictive booze situation, but in most cases it'll prove unnecessary. Besides, nothing tastes grosser than a metallic swig of lukewarm whiskey that's been slowly heating against your thigh as you tried to impress the one single bridesmaid with your ""Cupid Shuffle"" prowess.
Straighten that tie. Freshen that breath. Frantically scribble out a check because you waited until the last minute and the only stuff left on the wedding registry was three napkin rings and a zester. It's wedding time!
There's nothing wrong with coming out of the gate strong here -- just don't go TOO strong. This is not the time to go double Scotch on the rocks if the only whiskey you ever consume tastes like cinnamon. Get something that's as potent as you're comfortable with, and feel okay about drinking it at a brisk pace as you try to figure out where to best strategically position yourself for optimal access to the trays of bacon-wrapped scallops.
Also, when you get that first drink, quickly ascertain the following from the bartender: 1) is the bar open during dinner, and 2) what time do they shut down, which are both vital pieces of information. Tip a little more generously on that first one in case you're trying to land one last drink just as they're starting to close the bar.
Fantastic. You have your drink. People are mingling. Have you tried the crab cakes with that aioli stuff? They're awesome. Get one. Go forth. Be social. Knock back that first drink and then relax your pace a little, timing it so you just scored a full one as they're herding everyone into the dining room for the more structured portions of the evening, because this is where things can get dicey.

					As protests over the death of Freddie Gray continue to disrupt daily life in Baltimore, a local Whole Foods is coming under fire for apparently taking sides.

On Tuesday, Whole Foods Harbor East, which is close to Inner Harbor, provided a free lunch to the National Guard soldiers patrolling the city, reports Refinery29. The store posted a shout out to their Facebook and Instagram accounts of the smiling men holding up a Whole Foods bag with the caption, “We teamed up with @mtwashingtonwfm to make sandwiches for the men and women keeping Baltimore safe. We are so thankful to have them here and they're pumped for Turkey & Cheese!”ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT

But while soldiers were getting free meals from Whole Foods, an some on social media pointed out that many children who regularly receive free or reduced-price school meals went without lunch on Tuesday since all public schools were closed.

It didn’t take long for outraged users across all social media platforms to hit back at the upscale grocery chain for their apparent “tone-deaf” attitude toward the community.

Some defended the chain and acknowledged that it is not the responsibility of one grocery store to make up for a lack of  government  action when it comes to dealing with issues of poverty.


If poor kids in Baltimore aren't getting a meal today b/c schools are closed, that's on 57 years of Dem city leadership, not Whole Foods.

Within a few hours, Whole Foods deleted the post and issued the following statement to ABC News: “We removed the post because it did not accurately reflect all our local stores are doing to feed people across this city, especially children. Again, we love our community, will continue to support our city in the days to come, as we always do, and extend our heartfelt sympathy to those affected.”

A spokesman for the National Guard told ABC that the men in uniform ""are all 'Baltimoreans,'"" and they are ""neighbors helping neighbors.""",0.0011568070063526501,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.010353769093555114, u'mexico': 0.022587590559459587, u'abortion': 0.016202986342913509, u'immigration': 0.045131053430395453, u'trade': 0.0066950385572195374, u'campaign_finance': 0.0064463515257346471, u'other': 0.19561330894170023, u'china': 0.015270288836980391, u'military': 0.011057987550914443, u'terrorism': 0.018271829085520715, u'economy': 0.0040176949662113683, u'health': 0.010453831850868492, u'women': 0.63789826925852655}"
"Uganda's president, in power for 3 decades, seeks re-election as top challenger cries foul",fox,"
KAMPALA, Uganda –  Uganda's long-serving president has declared his bid for re-election in 2016, saying he is backed by the historical leaders of the former rebel movement that has been in power since 1986.
President Yoweri Museveni said Friday that his goal now is to steer Uganda toward middle-income status.
But even as Museveni was launching his re-election bid, his former prime minister, Amama Mbabazi, said the ruling party was undemocratic and that its top leaders were actively trying to block his own presidential bid.
Mbabazi, who was fired as prime minister last year amid reports he harbored presidential ambitions, told reporters he would no longer seek the presidency as a member of the ruling party.

Catalyzing Major Climate Actions by All Key Players around the World this Year,huffpo,"Director, International Program, Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)
Progress on climate change can seem depressingly slow--especially to young people full of energy and expectation. But look closer, resist the tug of hopelessness, and you can see progress everywhere. Clean energy is both technically and economically viable, and it's challenging dirty energy around the world. Key major economies have already begun to reduce carbon emissions, and many more are poised for even greater action in the coming months. This year we have a critical chance to change that dynamic as the world builds even stronger international actions to address climate change.
This is how change happens. Historical transformations take time. Apartheid didn't end overnight, and the Internet wasn't born in someone's basement in a single moment. Addressing climate change requires a transformation of similar proportions, and it, too, will take sustained efforts.
Even in the slow-and-steady approach to historical change, however, there are always critical moments. The Internet changed fundamentally the day Larry Page and Sergey Brin launched the Google search engine. On February 11, 1990, Nelson Mandela walked out of prison, virtually ensuring the eventual demise of apartheid.
The Paris 2015 meeting can be a similar inflection point in the history of climate change--but only if we lay the groundwork now. Over the next six months countries, companies, cities, and citizens must work together in ways we have not in the past. We need deeper national level commitments captured in an international agreement; a groundswell of actions by cities, states, businesses, financial institutions, and other actors; commitments to tackle discrete climate issues through specific international forums; and stronger public support to encourage politicians. We will be commenting on these dynamics over the course of the year here, but here is a snapshot of what is emerging (and here are some key events throughout the year).
International Climate Agreement with National Commitments from all Key Countries
When the current round of climate negotiations began, countries agreed to commit to more aggressive actions by all key countries. The Paris meeting in December, bringing together decision-makers from over 190 countries will be the culmination of those efforts. As the negotiating mandate stated the new agreement will be ""applicable to all"" meaning that both developed and developing countries will have commitments enshrined in the agreement. This agreement will contain several key elements including (my colleague Han Chen discusses these aspects in more detail):
Deeper national climate targets for the period after 2020. Countries accounting for over 80 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions made specific commitments to reduce their emissions through 2020 as a part of the Copenhagen/Cancun agreements. The Paris agreement will cover targets for the period after 2020. In the run-up to Paris, countries that account for over 50 percent of the world's global warming pollution from energy (including the European Union, U.S., Mexico, and China) have already formally announced their targets or the outlines of what their commitments. More announcements will be coming in the next couple of months (see here for a summary of these targets and information on emissions from these countries). These targets are the roadmap for the kinds of domestic policy changes that these countries will implement at home.
Financial investments to assist developing countries in reducing emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change. In Copenhagen, countries agreed to establish the Green Climate Fund (GCF), a new multilateral fund to help developing countries reduce emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Over $10 billion has already been pledged to the GCF. In addition, countries agreed to mobilize $100 billion per year through public and private financing to assist developing countries in building low carbon and climate resilient societies.
Tools to catalyze action and implementation over time. The agreement will help to strengthen future action by creating a mechanism for countries to extend their targets to future time-periods beyond what is announced in Paris. It will also encourage transparency and accountability to make sure that countries are following through on their commitments.
Groundswell of Climate Actions
Paris will also seek to broaden the engagement of other leaders by adding to the growing ""groundswell"" of climate actions. Governors, mayors, corporations, NGOs, financial institutions, and leaders of all stripes will be tasked to look at what they can do individually and collectively to help address climate change now. This effort will build upon the recent Climate Summit this September that saw commitments to end deforestation in the supply-chain of major companies and countries, major cities agreeing to continue to implement aggressive actions within their jurisdictions, and significant investors agreeing to end investments in fossil fuels. Since that time a growing number of cities, regions, companies, and countries have recognized that these kinds of action are critical if we are to address climate change. In the new NAZCA platform, cities, states, companies, communities and civil society organizations can document the diverse but essential climate commitments being made outside of the formal international arena and national policy. This groundswell of climate actions will form a key pillar of what emerges from Paris and must be a critical part of engaging ""all hands on deck"" to address climate change in the coming decades.
Because the groundswell involves such varied actors and actions, the groundswell may be hard to digest. That is why NRDC and other groups are trying to help ensure that there is a meaningful way to track these actions, see what they add up to, and create tools to hold these leaders accountable to make sure they deliver over time. (For more on the groundswell of climate action, see Brendan Guy's recent commentary.)
Targeted Actions in Other International Venues
Periodic climate change negotiation sessions in Kyoto, Copenhagen, and Cancun have historically grabbed all the headlines in the field of international climate change progress. But other venues are emerging to push forward international action on specific challenges. For example:
Broad Public Support for Action
Nothing positive can happen without the support of citizens across the globe. Last September, more than 400,000 people took to the street in New York to demand strong climate action. Just last month, the release of the U.S. contribution for the Paris climate negotiations garnered widespread support from religious leaders, business groups, labor unions, and community groups. Citizens around the world will have a chance throughout the year to let their voices be heard. These citizens are standing up and saying that they want more action, faster.
 ---------------------------
Each of these actions can make an important dent in finally turning the corner on international efforts to address climate change. The good news is we don't have to start from scratch--the foundation for action is already emerging. There is a deeper, wider, and more varied set of actions being implemented to address this challenge. Now is the time to take them to the next level.",0.00088122474175191077,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.047011870947883956, u'mexico': 0.056559812793954049, u'abortion': 0.011555949989436697, u'immigration': 0.0035915004103502504, u'trade': 0.055538092613941992, u'campaign_finance': 0.010873157522342849, u'other': 0.087117495457019536, u'china': 0.57175226583254379, u'military': 0.015533895004103867, u'terrorism': 0.044482365388760103, u'economy': 0.035756036683012575, u'health': 0.011507996875232225, u'women': 0.048719560481418005}"

The Science of Lying,huffpo,"Author, Modern Day Dale Carnegie

I want to bust some myths about lying by unveiling the truth about dishonesty. Some questions answered in this article:
In this post I am going to take some of the best learnings from our February Book Club book, The Honest Truth About Dishonesty (by Dan Ariely) and the most interesting tidbits from the research on deception.
Lying is a part of human nature.
Even if we don't want to admit it, we all lie. You're a liar. I'm a liar. We lie to others and we lie to ourselves. But here's what's interesting-lying is not rational.
There is some surprising science about lying that will not only help you understand your fellow human beings, but it will also show you how to have more honest relationships, communication and work environments. Read on to find out why.
1. Lying Is Not Rational
Do you believe in SMORC? The Simple Model of Rational Crime (SMORC) says that we decide whether or not to lie or cheat based on an internal cost benefit analysis of 3 factors:
In other words, we don't really think about what is moral or ethical; we decide to cheat or not based on a rational cost benefit analysis. If this were the case, the simple answer to curbing crime and lying would be to have extremely high punishments and lots of watchdogs-police, surveillance cameras and audits. But here's the problem. SMORC is false. Dan Ariely tested the SMORC principle in the lab and found that our cheating is not rational and has very little to do with a cost benefit analysis. Lying is not an internal struggle with pros and cons, it is an internal struggle about how you view yourself...
2. I am NOT a Liar
Remember when I called you a liar at the beginning of this article? Did that make you flinch? Mentally uncomfortable? Angry? We hate to think of ourselves as liars. Research about dishonesty finds that we have 2 conflicting impulses:
Our survive and thrive instincts tell us to cheat, lie and steal to be on top of the food chain. But our communal instincts tell us to be an honest, kind and authentic person. So, while the threat of getting caught or a big punishment can dissuade us from telling the truth, our desire to be a good person is even more powerful. However, there are times when the reward for lying or cheating is higher than our desire to be a good person. And that's where the Fudge Factor comes in.
3. The Fudge Factor
In order to get the benefits of lying without the shame of feeling like a liar, our brain engages in some tricky rationalization and self-deception. The Fudge Factor is what we do when we allow ourselves to engage in small amounts of cheating or lying so we still feel like a good person. Ariely says it nicely, ""We cheat up to the level that allows us to retain our self-image as reasonable honest individuals."" In this way, we rationalize small amounts of lying without feeling too guilty. This is because we don't want to miss out on the small rewards cheating might give us, but at the end of the day we still want to be able to look at ourselves in the mirror and feel good. The amount of cheating that happens is equal to the desire for gain minus the desire to be a good person.
4. What Makes Us Lie More
There are certain things that make the Fudge Factor grow. Ariely found that when people feel distanced from the consequences they steal more. For example, using tokens instead of money distances people from feeling like they are actually stealing money, and they therefore take more. Ariely also found that when you remind someone of their past achievements (even if those are false) people steal more because they rationalize that they deserve it. Or perhaps their internal 'good person' thermometer is already high, so stealing or cheating a little bit is ok-hence a larger Fudge Factor. If we think we can benefit others with our lies, we lie more. Altruistic motives make us feel that we are still good people so the Fudge Factor is larger. For example, if one trick-or-treater was getting candy for himself and his baby sister, he would be inclined to take even more candy from the bowl.
5. What Makes Us Lie Less
Luckily, there are a number of things we can do to encourage people to lie less. These center around reminding someone that they are a good person and the need for honesty should be upheld.
6. Do Liars Have Higher IQ?
When Ariely tested liars' IQ, he found that liars are not smarter than non-liars. However, they are more creative. Really good liars are creative and strategic about both rationalization and self-deception. They can come up with (and believe) elaborate tales that both convince them of their morality and justify their lying (extreme Fudge Factor behavior ensues). The more creative a person, the more they tend to cheat. Ariely even found that when he primed average subjects to feel more creative, their lying behavior increased.
7. The ""What the Hell Effect""
When someone has already cheated a little bit, they might have the tendency to keep going. In other words, they think ""I'm already a cheater, so what the hell, I'm going all the way."" People who were told that they were wearing fake designer sunglasses while completing a challenge cheated more than people who were wearing genuine sunglasses (they were actually identical). Once someone thought they were already 'cheating' by wearing fake sunglasses they cheated more on the task.
8. Interesting...

6 Ways to Love Your Life,huffpo,"Author, Coach, Tips to create freedom at KimanziConstable.com

Life is short. In the last year, I lost the man I consider one of my father figures -- my grandfather. He died in December at 87 years old. When I think back on our time together, my memories are filled with love, tears, education, and strength. He lived a full life and taught me how to live through the example he set in his life.
It doesn't take a death for you to realize that life will quickly pass. I'm sure you can remember a time when you were younger or a memory that was years ago but feels like it was just yesterday. Days and weeks seem to drag up, but often we look up and realize another year is almost gone. 
How you spend each moment is important because those moments are limited. You can never get time back, which makes time a precious resource in each of our lives. There are six ways for you to love your life and use each moment on the things that are important to you. 
1. Do Meaningful Work
Studies from Gallup have shown the average workweek is now 47 hours. You can spend that time doing something you love or hate. Either way, it will affect the other areas of your life. Despite the recovering economy we live in, you can find or create work that you love. Don't spend day in and day out waking up to a job you hate. Use the Internet and technology to create your ideal ""work"" situation. 
2. Cherish Relationships
I, for one, cherish my alone time, but I wouldn't be where I am today if it weren't for healthy relationships. It can be family, friends, or a romantic relationship, but that connection could be the difference between happiness or misery. Good relationships can lift you up or be the shoulder to cry on when things don't go as planned. 
3. Purge Negativity
Good relationships are necessary but negative ones will hold you back in life. As much as it hurts, purge yourself of relationships that don't encourage and strengthen you. Besides relationships, purge negative habits, or activates that don't bring you closer to your goals and dreams. 
4. Live Fully Present
It's easy to get distracted with the 101 things each of us has to do in life. You are busy with work, family, responsibilities, and the curveballs life throws at you. In all that chaos, it's easy to forget to stop and enjoy the little moments in life. Living fully present means you embrace each moment. You put away the phone at dinner, you turn off the TV and enjoy a conversation with someone you love. 
5. Stop Waiting for Permission
A major reason too many of us don't chase our dreams or a big goal is because we're waiting for permission. We're waiting for someone to tell us it's OK or for all the stars to align before we take the leap into uncertainty. Don't wait for permission because no one will give it to you and you don't need it. Claim the life you truly deserve today. 
6. Don't Apologize
This is YOUR life. Don't apologize if you are taking action on the kind of life you want to live. Chase your dreams, travel, live, love, and do the things that matter. Don't feel bad about wanting more because you deserve more. Be grateful for what you have but never give into complacency.
You can have all the things you want and the kind of life you want to live. It starts with the things you tell yourself. If you don't believe it or believe it's possible, you won't take the necessary steps to make your dream a reality. Change impossible to possible in your mind and then do something about it!
What are you doing to create a happy life?

"Five Years After BP Spill, Gulf of Mexico is Rekindling Responsibility for the Gulf's Future",huffpo,"President & CEO, The Nature Conservancy; Author, 'Nature's Fortune: How Business and Society Thrive by Investing in Nature'

By Mark Tercek and Robert Bendick
Last week marked both the fifth anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the 45th Earth Day. Earth Day began in 1970 out of Americans' frustrations with the degraded and declining state of the U.S. environment. Since then, there has been much environmental progress, but one need look no further than the Gulf of Mexico and the BP oil spill to see how much more must be done to pass along a safe and healthy world to our children.
How can we accomplish lasting change? Over the past 45 years, the environmental movement has been organized and institutionalized. While that may have been necessary, we have lost part of the spirit of individual and collective responsibility for our environment that Earth Day was intended to celebrate. The response to the Gulf oil spill, however, is restoring that sense of ownership and setting an example for the rest of the country.
When BP's Deepwater Horizon drilling platform exploded in the Gulf of Mexico five years ago, 11 workers died, and crude oil poured into the Gulf for 87 days. Citizens rallied, setting up booms to catch the oil and protect shorelines wherever they could. But as the oil reached the surface, spread into Gulf coast marshes and coated birds and marine life, they felt unable to affect the outcome. 

Today, more people in the Gulf region feel empowered because money resulting from the spill is being put into the hands of Gulf Coast communities. Those communities are embracing the opportunity to create a stronger Gulf by restoring the natural systems that support their livelihoods, fuel their economies and make their coastlines more resilient to rising seas, storms and other future disasters. 
One source of funding is BP's penalty payments from the now-settled criminal case against the company and other responsible parties. This money has gone to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF), which is distributing the funds to Gulf states for coastal habitat restoration. 
Other funding is through the RESTORE Act, which Congress passed and the President signed into law in the wake of the spill. Under the RESTORE Act, 80 percent of potential penalties from the Clean Water Act will go to Gulf states and counties and to on-the-ground federal agencies for oil spill restoration activities.
RESTORE Act funds have come slowly because the Clean Water Act federal litigation remains unresolved. However, based on the success of the NFWF grants and the many good proposals submitted for RESTORE funding, putting Gulf restoration money into the hands of the people of the Gulf region - who are acting through their government agencies - appears to be a right strategy. 

A recently released report by the Nature Conservancy (TNC) reveals that most of the funds already allocated for Gulf recovery are being spent to restore the Gulf's natural systems. And all five Gulf states are creating their own localized restoration plans tailored to the character of their coastlines. 
Mississippi, for example, is using NFWF funds to design a comprehensive coastal restoration strategy to repair coastal watersheds and make coastal communities safer from storms. Alabama is revising the Mobile Bay Estuary Plan, including recognition of TNC's living shoreline projects. Monroe County in Florida recently approved a project to restore the coral reefs in the Florida Keys, thus recognizing that environmental investments also have economic benefits.
The majority of the state and federal agency projects emphasize restoration of the Gulf's estuaries and their tributaries, reflecting the science that the health of the Gulf as a whole depends on the health of the places where fresh and salt water mix. This estuary approach also breaks Gulf restoration into smaller pieces where individuals and local groups can have long-term influence on the direction of restoration activities in their home waters.
Today, the people of the Gulf of Mexico region - and those who represent them in government - are not only repairing damage from the spill but are taking on the responsibility to care for and create a stronger Gulf for the long term. Their actions serve as a model for how restoring nature can help strengthen coastal communities all over the world. This can be a renewed cause for celebration on Earth Days to come.

Kerry plays it cool in final push for Iran deal,politico,"The secretary of state’s methodical approach could help keep some critics at bay, for now.

Maybe John Kerry isn’t desperate for an Iran nuclear deal after all.
The secretary of state’s mindset has been a key subject for critics of the talks with Iran, with some saying they worry he’s too eager to cement his place in history by striking a deal.
Story Continued Below
But Kerry, as well as some of his powerful co-negotiators, are showing patience this week, willing to blow past a Tuesday deadline and face the threat of triggering a longer congressional review in order to secure a better deal. As Iran has raised tricky last-minute demands, Kerry and his team have stiffened America’s public stance, warning that the negotiations could go either way and that the U.S. will walk away if necessary.
“I think [Kerry’s] probably confident that he can come to an agreement but that he doesn’t care that much about this deadline or that deadline,” said Ilan Goldenberg, a former Obama administration official who specializes in the Middle East. “Politically, it plays well here to the criticism that Kerry’s willing to pursue a deal at any cost. I don’t think that’s true, and showing a little patience is smart right now both for domestic politics in the U.S. and for signaling to the Iranians and others that they don’t have leverage because of this deadline.”
The methodical approach could help keep some critics at bay, for now. Among those worried about Kerry’s ambitions are Republican Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has said Kerry shouldn’t worry about his legacy, and that walking away from a bad deal with Iran could be just as historic an achievement as reaching an accord.

The fate of the talks in Vienna were unclear Tuesday, though negotiators insisted a deal was still achievable and wanted by all parties. Regardless, U.S. and other negotiators confirmed they would not meet Tuesday’s deadline.
The Iranians, meanwhile, confirmed demands that seemed designed to pressure the Americans: asking that the U.N. arms embargo on their country and sanctions targeting its ballistic missile program be lifted. To add a sense of urgency for the U.S., if a deal is submitted to Congress after Thursday — but before Sept. 7 — Congress will get an extra 30 days to review it.
The latest twists are normal in such a complex, multi-lateral negotiation, with every side trying to squeeze what they can out of the other, supporters of the talks argue. Earlier this year, when the various nations involved were trying to reach a preliminary “framework” for the accord, they blew past the deadline by a few days amid last-minute machinations.
“This is the tedious grind of diplomacy,” said Joe Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund, which backs the talks. “We are very close, but there are several tough issues remaining. Iran has to make a decision: Does it want this deal or not? … It is certainly worth it to give Iran a few more days to come around — even if if gives the rest of us a bad case of negotiations interruptus.”
In a sense, Kerry has more at stake than President Barack Obama when it comes to the Iran talks. During his 30-plus years in the public sphere, most of it in the Senate, he’s been criticized for being more talk than action. Obama, on the other hand, can point to several legacies, including the Affordable Care Act, a rapprochement with Cuba and killing Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden.
The Iranians have suggested they don’t care about a deadline. “Even if we do not finish by July 9, it will not be the end of the world,” an Iranian official told reporters at the scene in the Austrian capital. “We need to get a good agreement.”
During a background briefing Tuesday in Vienna, a senior U.S. official also dismissed the notion of deadlines dictating the terms of a deal, according to news reports.
The negotiators from Iran, the United States, Britain, France, China, Germany and Russia are aiming for a deal that lifts international sanctions on Iran in exchange for significant curbs on its nuclear program, which Tehran has always insisted is peaceful but which the West suspects is aimed at making weapons. The talks have progressed for more than 18 months under the auspices of an interim agreement, known as the Joint Plan of Action, that has given Iran some sanctions relief in exchange for limits on its nuclear program.

Throughout the talks, the U.S. has said that only nuclear-related sanctions would be lifted — not sanctions targeting Iran over its ballistic missile program, its support for terrorist groups or its human rights abuses.
Iran’s demands related to the 2007 U.N. arms embargo and sanctions on its ballistic missile program are not entirely new, experts say, but they show how difficult it will be to separate some sanctions from others. Some international sanctions against Iran ostensibly target its nuclear program but also deal with other types of weapons. The U.S. is loath to see Iran get new access to weapons of any kind because it could boost the Islamist government’s interference in Arab states such as Syria, Iraq and Yemen.
Iran has always said that all sanctions related to its nuclear program must eventually be lifted and has denounced past U.N. resolutions against it.
POLITICO PRO
“It’s been clear from the beginning, and the 2013 interim Joint Plan of Action explicitly confirmed it, that the negotiation would need to address all U.N. Security Council resolutions, and those resolutions do include provisions on ballistic missiles and on the arms embargo,” said Simond de Galbert, a former member of France’s nuclear negotiating team and now a visiting fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
Iran is well aware of the pressure Congress could bring to bear on any deal, and its decision to bring up the arms embargo and ballistic missiles could be a bet that the U.S. will cave to some demands to avoid giving lawmakers extra time to scrutinize the agreement. Thanks to a law reluctantly signed by Obama, Congress gets at least 30 calendar days to review a deal. If the agreement is submitted between July 10 and Sept. 7, Congress will have 60 days, in part to accommodate the summer recess in August.
The law, spearheaded by Corker, says only that the full text of an agreement must be “transmitted” to congressional leaders, and does not specify how, meaning negotiators could theoretically email an agreement just before midnight Eastern time Thursday (or 6 a.m. Friday in Vienna).
Under the law, Congress must vote by the end of its review period on whether to approve the deal and allow the president to suspend U.S. sanctions on Tehran. Even if the Republican-led Congress votes to disapprove a deal, administration officials believe they can muster enough Democrats to uphold a presidential veto and preserve the accord.
Asked about the likelihood of a longer congressional review, White House spokesman Josh Earnest stressed that much of it would be vacation time for lawmakers. “It’s not as if Congress is going to spend the entire 60 days studying this agreement,” he said.
If the talks stretch through the summer — a distant but not impossible scenario — then the administration would gain a slight reprieve because Congress’ review period reverts back to 30 days if a deal is not reached and submitted by Sept. 7. By then, however, the administration would likely face more fundamental questions about whether Congress will pass new sanctions on Iran, and whether a deal is achievable at all.
By mid-Tuesday in Washington, it was clear that the Obama administration’s willingness to blow past a deadline wasn’t going to win it plaudits from all Republicans, even though many had urged Kerry and others not to be constrained by the clock.
“Every extension seems to come with more concessions because the Iranians have recognized the window for diplomacy never closes with this president and therefore they keep pushing for more extensions, they keep making more outrageous demands,” said Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a Republican who has advocated for military action against Iran to stop its nuclear program.
A newsletter from the Republican National Committee said the missed deadline was “an embarrassing setback” and noted that Hillary Clinton, who is running for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, had helped launch the talks during her tenure as secretary of state.

Regina Casé as Val in The Second Mother.

If you want to measure a society's political health, two films from Latin America slyly suggest, look at how it treats the help. Sebastian Silva's gleeful 2009 black comedy, The Maid, drew on his own experience as the cosseted son of a well-to-do Chilean family propped up by its housekeeper. Brazilian filmmaker Anna Muylaert began writing her new film, The Second Mother, two decades ago, when she hired a nanny to care for her first child. It's a quieter, more ruminative comedy, but like Silva, Muylaert's as alive to the comic possibilities of liberal guilt as she is to the plight of the ill-paid maids who quietly run innumerable households all around the Americas. The second mother in Muylaert's film is Val (a very good Regina Casé), a middle-aged housekeeper who keeps everyone on track in the home of an affluent Sao Paulo family. She cooks, cleans, and openly dotes on their son Fabinho (Michel Joelsas), a spoiled wastrel who still runs to Val to get his hair stroked whenever he's crossed. If Val is the help, her employers are the helpless. Clearing the table is beyond them, and their friends are no better: At a birthday party for her employer, Dona Barbara (Karine Teles), we follow Val as she goes around with a tray of appetizers, receiving not a word of thanks. A willing accomplice to this lopsided arrangement, Val fetches and carries without complaint, pausing only to grab bits of power here and there that serve only to keep her locked in place. Smugly playing the enlightened employer, Dona Barbara takes a fleeting interest in Val's life only when it costs her nothing. She talks a good game, but to fully understand the warped political economy of this household, you have to follow the camera as it trails after Val like a faithful dog, lingering on the kitchen door that both connects and cordons off her domain with the family's, or on the hallway that leads to the guest room, significantly more lavish than Val's cramped quarters. There, a Disruptive Force has set up operations that will trigger a rising tide of violations of the unwritten code that has made this well-oiled system of servitude work well past its sell-by date. Val's estranged daughter, Jessica (Camila Mardila), has blown into town to take her entrance exam at a prestigious local university, where — to the family's barely suppressed disbelief — she plans to study architecture. A cocksure beauty bearing a massive grudge against her mother, Jessica is also the distillation of a new generation of Brazilians unbound by the archaic hierarchies that hold her mother hostage. Aghast at Val's collusion with her masters, she sets about breaking every rule in the house, while Val, appalled in her turn, strives unbidden to restore the status quo. In the ensuing chaos, the patriarch (Lourenco Mutarelli), a trust-fund baby with more money than sense, floors Jessica with a bizarre proposition that quickens the pace into farce, plunging the entire house into a crisis that will bring down its ancien regime. There may or may not be metaphor at work here regarding Brazil's relationship with its autocratic past. Either way, it's hard to begrudge this warm-hearted movie its crowd-pleasing ending, which bestows on every player the gift of a new beginning. One way or another, everyone gets out of jail, but no liberation is more gratifying than that of hard-working Val, who opens her eyes at last and takes her cue from a daughter pugnacious enough to insist on her own destiny.

Chelsea clinches EPL title,cnn," (CNN)There had been an air of inevitability for several weeks but Sunday Chelsea completed the task and duly clinched the English Premier League title with a 1-0 home win over Crystal Palace.
Man City was playing later in the afternoon but the three points took the west London side into an unassailable advantage over the defending champion and third-placed Arsenal.
Fittingly, it was PFA Player of the Year Eden Hazard who scored the only goal of the match just before halftime after winning a penalty.
It was not without controversy, as there appeared to be very little contact when the Belgian international went sprawling in the area under a challenge from James McArthur.
Hazard got up to take the spot kick, his weak effort was saved by Julian Speroni, but he scored with a header on the rebound.
It was Hazard's only miss from ten penalties he has taken in the EPL this season, but his 14th goal of the campaign was the crucial statistic and enough to take Jose Mourinho's men over the winning line.
Read: Chelsea battles to goalless draw at Arsenal
In common with recent Chelsea displays, including the goalless draw at Arsenal like week, the emphasis was on the result rather than open and attacking football and there was little second half goalmouth action.
For Mourinho, it was his third EPL title with Chelsea and first since his return to the club at the start of the 2013-14 campaign.
Earlier this season, Chelsea took the English League Cup, beating Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 in the final at Wembley.
It was revenge for a 5-3 beating at White Hart Lane on New Year's Day, a rare hiccup in a triumphant league season.
The goals of Diego Costa, many of them assisted by fellow pre-season signing Cesc Fabregas, took Chelsea into an early lead in the title race with the other challengers unable to keep pace.
But it has been Hazard who has proved the ultimate star, winning the acclaim of his fellow EPL players for his sparkling performances.

App Smart: Video Feature: Take On the World With Trivia Game Apps,nyt,"WHEN I’m out with friends I sometimes challenge them with a few trivia questions for fun. But plenty of trivia quiz smartphone apps can do a much better job than I do, and they have social media features too.

Trivia Crack is probably the hottest trivia quiz app, and for good reason: It’s fun and satisfying to play and keeps you coming back to play more.

Think of the game as equivalent to the kind of general-knowledge-based quiz show on TV. You compete against an opponent to see who can better answer a string of questions from categories like science, sports, art and more. You win by gathering “characters” representing each category quicker than your opponent does.

The gameplay is wonderfully simple. But don’t assume the game is overly basic or boring, because it adds some nice touches. You can play against random opponents from around the world or challenge Facebook friends, which makes the game more personal: Everyone likes being able to beat friends at a silly game.

As well as answering questions, you can also submit your own questions — and if you’re lucky other users will see your questions alongside those from the game’s developers.

Its interface makes Trivia Crack easy to use, the graphics are cheerful and the questions will really puzzle you from time to time. It’s not perfect, however, and you can often encounter questions that seem too easy or that you have seen before.

Be careful of the in-app purchases, too. These are tempting because they let you buy things like extra turns, so you are going to want to disable in-app buying if you let a youngster play Trivia Crack on your phone. Since the app is free on iOS, Android and Windows Phone, you can see how much fun it is without spending a penny.

Despite Trivia Crack’s runaway popularity, I actually prefer another trivia game app, QuizUp, because it is slightly more sophisticated in design and I find the questions and game mechanics more interesting.

QuizUp also lets you challenge a friend from Facebook or play against a random opponent. But the game rules are different from Trivia Crack’s: You play against the clock and win by correctly answering questions more swiftly than your opponent.

There are just seven rounds per game, and when you win you increase your “experience points” score in the question category you’ve chosen. A higher score brings rewards like complimentary nicknames that match your category. If you are very clever, you can earn trophies, like becoming the best in your country in a category.

The app’s home page offers new categories to test your knowledge, shows game challenges your friends have made and suggests categories based on what you have played most frequently and most recently. There is also the option to chat with other players, which can be fun and interesting if your opponent is a stranger.

QuizUp’s interface is polished and easy to use, the questions can be challenging depending on the category and each game is swift. You will encounter overly easy questions occasionally and if you play a particular category often enough you will definitely see questions repeated. But there are hundreds of categories, so the app can remain interesting.

QuizUp is free for iOS and Android, but again watch out for those in-app purchases — they’re not critical for gameplay, but tempt you by letting you rise through the ranks more swiftly.

TriviaBurst is an alternative to these two apps, available for iOS, Android, BlackBerry and Windows Phone. (The BlackBerry and Windows Phone editions haven’t been updated in a long time, so their reliability may not be great. The BlackBerry version is $1; the others are free.)

TriviaBurst is a more stripped-down entry in this category. It has a more basic interface and a much smaller question pool, 70,000 questions. But this app still offers a good challenge, and like QuizUp and Trivia Crack you can play against strangers or take on Facebook friends.

I like this app’s uncluttered design. But I do find the menus to be a little inconsistent and confusing. Also, while it is always nice to get questions right, somehow it doesn’t feel very rewarding when you win a game in TriviaBurst.

Lastly, if you’re a movie buff, you’ll love Movie Cat 2, a quiz app covering just one category: films. I’m fond of this app because of its cute graphics and clever gameplay. It also has a nice two-player mode. The app costs $2, is only on iOS, and has only a few thousand questions, but they come in the form of visual puzzles as well as straightforward questions and answers.

"The Iran Deal: Israel, the U.S. and the Middle East",huffpo,"Middle East scholar, former peace negotiator, journalist
They are visibly happy in Tehran and they are visibly very unhappy in Jerusalem. If pictures and body language are indicators of actual diplomacy, then the images project a great Iranian victory and consequently a great Israeli defeat. Images though may not tell the entire and real story. They are too happy in Tehran, too unhappy in Jerusalem, and in both cases they somewhat exaggerate.
Iran made some major concessions, chiefly accepting the regime of international supervision over its military installations, as well as agreeing for the lifting of sanctions on its ballistic missiles project only after eight years and the arms embargo after five years. Also, the readiness to check if and whether nuclear tests were already performed by the Islamic Republic. The West, led by the U.S., had its share of concessions, main among them, the inability to automatically reinstate sanctions on Iran, in case of a violation of its obligations, so the Iranians will have ample time to take care of any violation if one is suspected before any international supervision can and will take place. It is called verification, and this is a key element in any such deal. Suffice it to see what happened with the ill-fated Clinton administration nuclear agreement with North Korea in 1994. So much talk then about a historic agreement, a new dawn and whatnot, and in 2015, North Korea is, by all accounts, a nuclear state. Add up to this the lifting of the economic sanctions (though not in a matter of days, surely not by the U.S.), as well as the fact that none of the military installations will be dismantled, and so with the centrifuges. On balance, Iran conceded less than the West, hence a reason for Israel to feel like the loser. The point is, that in Jerusalem they intentionally dramatize the sense of defeat, at the same time that in Tehran they intentionally do the same with the impression of a victory. It is called politics, mainly domestic, and from now the real battle moves from the PR sphere to the political one. The former battle was determined already, as pictures of Foreign Minister Zarif surrounded by the foreign ministers of the West, John Kerry in particular, look much better than PM Netanyahu surrounded by his ministers.
Netanyau finds himself in a challenging situation. He can say, as already he has, the ""I told you so,"" and feel right about his warnings regarding the agreement, particularly the American role in achieving it. Yet, saying that also exposes him domestically to the inevitable criticism, which is already coming, about putting so much political stock behind his opposition to achieving an agreement which in the end was sealed and signed. So, there starts to be a change of emphasis in Jerusalem. ""We,"" so people around Netanyahu say, ""are committed to prevent Iran from having the bomb, not to force the Western powers to not sign an agreement."" This is a somewhat self-defeating line, because it implies that Iran is not so close to the bomb itself, and preventing her from having the bomb is exactly what President Obama is also committed to do. Clearly, Netanyahu will not be brought down over this failure, as the Center-Left opposition in Israel, while being after his political head, does concur with him that the agreement is very bad to Israel.
This state of affairs leaves Netanyahu with two options. First, to continue to intensify the secret (?) cooperation with Arab countries, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and others, which dread almost as much as Israel the spectre of a stronger Iran, even if it still is short of the actual bomb. Second, Netanyahu can use all his influence in the U.S. Congress. With regard to the the Arabs, the most Israel can expect is to see more concerted and effective Arab action against Iran in Syria, as well as other Middle Eastern theaters, such as Hamas in Gaza. No public displays of a sudden Saudi love affair with Israel are to be expected. Regarding the U.S. Congress, here Netanyahu will not serve Israel's overall interest if he chooses to have another well-publicized, highly visible public battle with the Obama administration. A visit now in the U.S., for example, may prove to be a very serious blunder. Netanyahu never shies away from the limelight, can he be restrained this time? I, for one, doubt it. Congress can thwart the agreement, but with Netanyahu on the Hill, the chances of it happening are slimmer. Yes, there always exists a military option. A realistic one? Well, not now as a first priority for sure, possibly not also in the more distant future.
But then there is also Iran, and its understandable but still dangerous victory celebrations. The Sunni Arab world cannot and will not swallow a strong Iran. The containment of Iran as a first priority will get even greater momentum, and while it will take time, Iran will not become the final arbiter of Middle East politics. Then there is the domestic Iranian arena, and here the picture is not one-dimensional. The regime definitely can show a great diplomatic achievement to the public on the one hand, but also exposes itself to a wave of expectations for a quick and dramatic economic improvement coupled with political liberalization, two scenarios which may not materialize, surely not so quickly. Judging from past experience, rising unfulfilled expectations can be very toxic. The Mullahs may have their moment of celebration, but it could still backfire.
Altogether, an important agreement. Historic moment? Too early to judge, but not too early to view it as another element of instability, judging by Arab and Israeli displeasure. The Middle East  can do without another dose, and such a large one, of uncertainty and concern.

Nadal Crushes Kuznetsov to Reach Last 16 in Style,nyt,"PARIS —  Rafa Nadal's attempt to win the French Open for a 10th time picked up pace with a 6-1 6-3 6-2 third round demolition of unseeded Russian Andrey Kuznetsov at Roland Garros on Saturday.

The Spanish defending champion, seeded a lowly sixth this year after a run of patchy form, showed the quality that has made him the dominant force on clay for a decade, brushing aside his opponent with relative ease.

He moves into the second week with an unblemished record and seems to be finding his best form in time for a likely quarter-final blockbuster with world number one Novak Djokovic -- the man he has beaten in two of the last three finals.

Before that can become a reality he will have to beat American Jack Sock in the last 16.

""Things are going better,"" Nadal said on court. ""Against (Nicolas) Almagro (in the last round) I played a good match and again today I played well and had positive feelings.

""Fourth round is very good news for me.""

Apart from a dropped service game the first set was perfect for Nadal as he overpowered the lightweight Russian.

Kuznetsov did not hold serve until he was 3-0 down in the second set and although he began to make more of a match of it he was outclassed as Nadal improved his record at Roland Garros to 69-1.

New research shows just how much presidents try to manipulate public opinion,washpo,"   (Haraz N. Ghanbari/AP)  The political scientists James Druckman and Lawrence Jacobs have just published a book, “Who Governs? Presidents, Public Opinion, and Manipulation.” Early reviews call it “a breakthrough” and “a fascinating study” whose “picture is not pretty.”  I talked with Druckman and Jacobs about the book via e-mail. An edited version of our exchange follows. Q: If I had to summarize the book in a tweet, it would be “Presidents try hard to manipulate opinion. They often don’t succeed.”  Is that fair?  That’s right. We argue that presidents often use polls to identify the interests of organized and well-resourced groups that support their broad agendas. They then respond to these groups, while simultaneously using polls to devise methods to distract other Americans — leading them to focus on personality and image rather than controversial policy. Presidents don’t consistently succeed at moving public opinion but their efforts to do so make the White House overconfident about pushing their agenda – even if it is unpopular. Q: Talk about the data you gathered for the book, which is pretty unusual.  We worked on this book for 14 years. It relies on a novel body of data that Larry Jacobs collected for more than two decades: the private polls collected by presidents Johnson, Nixon, and Reagan and analyzed by White House staff. We integrate archival and quantitative analysis of these three administrations with research about contemporary politics, which allows us to draw connections and implications to our own time. By studying private White House polling and confidential memos, we demonstrate why presidents favor the policies backed by activists and donors instead of what the majority prefers. We also show how presidents try to use polling to manipulate Americans into supporting their narrow agendas.   Academics and frustrated voters today suspect that politicians play favorites; we supply a “smoking gun” from inside the White House. Thus, we are able to provide unparalleled direct evidence about inequalities in representation. Pioneering work by Larry Bartels, Martin Gilens and Larry Jacobs with Benjamin Page demonstrate that policymakers tend to follow the views of big business and the wealthiest and ignore those of most Americans. We show how presidents actually go about doing this and also how, under varying circumstances, other groups drive presidential decisions. Q: Your data suggest just how integral polling became to the White House during this period. The rise of public opinion research since the 1930s has been mirrored by presidents’ use of this research. The magnitude and importance of polling to presidents escalated with John Kennedy’s presidency, taking off under Nixon and Reagan. The number of polls conducted with White House direction rose from 15 under Kennedy to 110 under Johnson, 173 under Nixon, and 204 under Reagan. Newer technology that allows regular, relatively inexpensive, and targeted surveys contributed to the rise of polling in the White House. Changing politics were also important. With the proliferation of interest groups and the growing independence of individual members of Congress, presidents had an even greater need to marshal public support for their agendas. Q: And you show that it’s more than just that the White House started collecting more polls.  Different presidents had different goals in collecting these data, right? Presidents became more sophisticated at tailoring poll questions to address their specific political needs. There was a shift from just using simple, boilerplate questions about the general political environment (as Kennedy and Johnson tended to do) to developing tailored questions to advance specific political goals (under Nixon and Reagan). For example, Johnson’s polls used an open-ended question to fish for general reactions to the president’s agenda and his personality. By comparison, Nixon and Reagan gauged the public’s reactions to specific personality traits, such as warmth and trustworthiness, as well as their performance as competent and strong leaders. Later presidents also worked more at stitching together a coalition from discrete sets of voters. In comparison to his predecessors, Reagan consistently asked respondents their religion and income and used this information to identify the specific preferences of these groups on issues such as taxes, spending, crime and family values. This equipped him to cater to the preferences of narrow groups on the issues they most cared about – taxes for the rich and family values for Baptists and Catholics. Q: You talk about how Nixon was trying to draw attention to his image, which seems sort of odd given that Nixon’s image is, at least to many people today, a negative one.  What was he up to? True to character, Nixon’s inside strategy is eerie. He clinically dissected the public’s uneasiness with him as a person and the policies that it backed. At one point, a close adviser (Robert Teeter) candidly told him that public didn’t like him. Nixon used polls, which he voraciously consumed in private, to tailor his public speeches to emphasize popular policies on domestic issues and to lift the public’s low regard for him personally by promoting his efforts to recognize China and to find a workable path forward in Vietnam. “If you don’t like me, respect me” seemed to be the theme. Q: You mentioned above Reagan’s interest in groups like the rich and the religious.  Say a bit more about what he was doing. All presidents – including Ronald Reagan – present themselves as representing all Americans. Behind closed doors, we found that presidents and, specifically, Reagan relied on polling to meld their policy positions to the views of their strongest supporters – in Reagan’s case, the rich, Republican loyalists, conservatives and social conservatives. Instead of using polls to follow the majority (as politicians are often assumed to be doing), Reagan used polls to mobilize his base and recruit new supporters among evangelicals. We refer to this as “segmented representation.” Reagan revolutionized polling and produced a striking political innovation that helps to explain a riddle: Why do Americans support politicians who adopt policies that they don’t really agree with? Even as he pushed policies favored by the wealthy and politically organized conservatives, Reagan used polls to figure out how to appeal to Americans on the basis of his winsome personality and to focus them on policies that they did support. Reagan’s innovation also helps shed light on how economic inequality has expanded in America since the 1980s. The mastery of polling and public promotion by Reagan and his successors equipped them with the skills and confidence to pursue policies favored by their supporters while working to fend off punishment at the voting booth. As we saw when Reagan and later George W. Bush supported tax cuts that primarily benefited the affluent, presidents no longer ran scared about pursuing policies that accepted or expanded economic inequality. Q: To figure out whether all of this White House strategy actually affects Americans, you turn to Johnson. What did he want to do, and what did he actually accomplish? We studied one of the most significant and important efforts to move public opinion: Lyndon Johnson’s concerted efforts to use his polling to hold public support as he expanded the number of U.S. troops and bombing sorties in Vietnam. Initially, he enjoyed some success in holding support and in directing public attention away from the treachery of war. But the steady increase in  U.S. casualties by 1967 overtook even the president’s determined efforts. Our conclusion from the Johnson experience – and other research – is that presidents cannot manipulate public opinion as they’d like. But the conclusion is hardly uplifting: they are able to impact what issues the public considers worthy of attention and their over-confidence in moving Americans entices them into damaging blunders (like Vietnam) and squandering their resources on policies that exceed what is feasible. Q: Is there any reason to suspect that the findings from these presidents don’t generalize to the present? We think that they do generalize. Obviously, we don’t have access to the inside operations of the Obama White House but we would expect that it devoted polls to identifying the most effective words, arguments, and symbols to sell its policies and win over public support. The president’s advantage is being able to test and refine his public arguments before he gives them publicly. Q: The way I read the book, you guys often sound pretty pessimistic about, well, American democracy.  Is that a fair impression? We have revealed a somber picture of American democracy as having been contorted to favor the already advantaged and political insiders. But this is not the only story we discovered. We discovered again and again that presidents failed to manufacture public opinion as they planned. Take Reagan, for example, who had to do an about-face when polls revealed the public backlash against his proposal to make Social Security voluntary. Our research convinced us of the importance of realism when it comes to the threats facing American democracy and the opportunities. On the one hand, we need to be alert to how the White House seeks to shape the opinions of Americans. Is public opinion an independent reflection of the “popular will” or manufactured to bend to a White House’s agenda? On the other hand, this realism needs to be accompanied by a determination to seize opportunities to engage citizens in politics and thereby check the powers of presidents.",0.0000088678128294563575,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.050906991319606409, u'mexico': 0.0010330888774916121, u'abortion': 0.0068520251454005764, u'immigration': 0.0095796232844714627, u'trade': 0.013459198785081101, u'campaign_finance': 0.0078996971819699901, u'other': 0.0019315430349647056, u'china': 0.34162115606466392, u'military': 0.010458854978218185, u'terrorism': 0.013289192818152227, u'economy': 0.47284906199926519, u'health': 0.0022210373877936513, u'women': 0.067898529122920867}"
