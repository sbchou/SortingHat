"Poland votes, conservative eurosceptic party looks set to win",http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/worldNews/~3/jYbUopPNr6w/story01.htm,reuters,"WARSAW Poles vote in an election on Sunday that could end nearly a decade of economic and political stability in the country of 38 million, bringing to power a conservative, eurosceptic party whose policies diverge from many of Poland's European allies.
If opinion polls are correct, the ruling Civic Platform (PO), a pro-market, centrist grouping in power for the past eight years, will lose to the conservative Law and Justice opposition party (PiS), run by the twin brother of late president Lech Kaczynski, Jaroslaw.
Most polls show PiS as the frontrunner on more than 30 percent, while PO is second with just over 20 percent. Several small parties are also running, spanning the political spectrum from ultra-right to liberal and extreme left.
Distrustful of the European Union and an advocate of a strong NATO hand in dealing with Moscow, PiS opposes joining the 'euro zone' in the near future, promises more welfare spending on the poor and wants banks subject to new taxation.
It also opposes the relocation of migrants from the Middle East to Poland, arguing they could threaten Poland's Catholic way of life - raising the prospect of tensions with the EU on the issue.
On the campaign trail, Kaczynski and other PiS leaders have sought to tap into anger that the economic success is not more evenly shared out and into nationalist sentiment fanned by immigration fears, particularly among young voters.
""If (PO) maintains power, if we don't manage to take it from them, things will be much worse than before. You may say things cannot get worse. Things can always get worse,"" Kaczynski told supporters during a rally in Lublin, some 80 km (50 miles) from the Ukraine border.
Poland has seen its economy expand by nearly 50 percent in the last decade and is the only EU member not to experience recession after the 2008 financial crisis. But pockets of poverty and stagnation remain, particularly in the east.
""There is a broader phenomenon of a return to national, religious, community values being seen all across Europe,"" said political analyst Aleksander Smolar.
""PiS uses clear ... language in this respect.""

FANNING RACISM    
Kaczynski was accused by some Polish media this month of fanning racism when he said migrants fleeing war in the Middle East and Africa may bring new diseases and parasites to Poland.
PO Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz later quipped Kaczynski, a known cat lover, wasn't too worried to own cats even though they can carry diseases dangerous to people.
""There are many diseases that come from animals, but at the same time that doesn't stop (Kaczynski) from having a cat,"" she said.
PiS's advocacy of a robust Western approach towards Russia following Moscow's 2014 annexation of the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine might also complicate any future bridge-building between the EU and Russia.
Several new parties are running on anti-establishment platforms, supported largely by young voters. 
Among them, Kukiz'15, a grouping run by former Polish rock star Pawel Kukiz, which wants to tax ""bank gangsters"" and says Poland is a ""colony of foreign governments"". Kukiz ran in a presidential election in May, winning a shock 21 percent.
""I hope we enter parliament in such numbers that it will allow us to make a crack in the system, allowing the citizens, the nation to win back control over the state, which has been taken away from them,"" Kukiz told a campaign rally.
The smattering of fringe parties in the election means PiS, even if it wins, will likely have to seek coalition partners to rule, raising the possibility of extended talks in the weeks after the vote. 
It also leaves room for PO to retain its hold on power, if PiS fails to form a functioning majority in parliament and the centrists secure the support of leftist groupings such as United Left (ZL) or liberal Nowoczesna.
Polls open at 7 a.m. local time (0600 GMT) and close at 9 p.m., (2000 GMT). Exit polls will be available immediately after voting ends.

"In Iowa, Clinton camp roars while Sanders faithful sway to the beat",http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/24/politics/jefferson-jackson-dinner-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-rallies/index.html,cnn,"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN)The Des Moines River splits its namesake city everyday, but on Saturday, the river figuratively split the Democratic Party: Hillary Clinton supporters to the west, Bernie Sanders backers to the east.
While the groups rallied around their candidates in preparation for the crucial Iowa Democratic Party's Jefferson-Jackson Dinner, they did so in dramatically different settings, ones that show the differences in their campaigns.
Clinton supporters started lining up at 7:30 a.m., nine hours before pop star Katy Perry serenaded an estimated 4,000 supporters in a parking lot, according to the campaign.
Students from Iowa State University were first in line, eager to get as close to Perry as possible. Protected by blankets in the blustery Des Moines morning, the students somewhat overlooked the other international figure who graced the stage with Perry: former President Bill Clinton.
Asked whether they were excited to see Bill Clinton, the students shrugged, a departure from the early-morning shrieks they offered to Perry's name.
It was hard not to know Perry was in town. 
The speaker system Clinton's campaign set up blared for most of the afternoon, and when the pop star attended a sound check, nearly all of downtown Des Moines could hear her rendition of ""America the Beautiful.""
Down the street from the concert, Dan Bram, a Clinton organizer in Iowa, sported a ""Left Shark"" costume to pump up passersby. The costume is a reference to Perry's Super Bowl performance, when a dancer in a shark costume had trouble keeping up.
Half a mile away, Sanders' supporters were treated to a bit of the concert: Perry's music was, at times, audible to the Iowans backing Sanders.
""We have not been loud enough,"" one Sanders organizer said from the stage. ""I want Katy Perry to hear us!""
Unlike some of his other events across the country -- where thousands come out to see the independent Vermont senator -- Sanders' gathering was not a sizable affair.
The event was not open to the public, and it was less of a rally for Sanders and more of a training session for supporters who were attending the Jefferson-Jackson dinner.
Sanders' aides taught the crowd chants and urged them to be fired up.
""Be loud. Be raucous,"" they implored. 
But throughout the event, it was clear that something else was going on across the river.
""Can they hear us across the river?"" bellowed Sanders' emcee. ""Get loud as hell one more time!""
But even to some Sanders' supporters, Perry was enough of a draw to get them to not attend the senator's rally.
""We are millennials,"" said Sandy Barnard, an organizer for Sanders in Chicago who sported a T-shirt with Sanders' profile at Clinton's rally. ""I don't know when else I am going to see Katy Perry live for free.""
Her friend, Rosie O'Brian, held a sign that read, ""Bert+Ernie=Bernie -- Sesame Street for Sanders.""
""I didn't realize we were supposed to be at a rally for Bernie right now,"" O'Brian said with a smile, acknowledging that she wanted to see Perry.
Before the pop star took the stage for four songs, Bill Clinton addressed the crowd, well aware of his role on this day.
""I never have been the warmup act for Katy Perry before,"" he said. ""But I am well aware I am the warmup act.""
Perry, sporting a white dress emblazoned with Clinton's campaign logo and wearing the American flag as a cape, serenaded the audience with what has become an unofficial campaign anthem, ""Roar.""
The Sanders' campaign wasn't far from mind at the event, though. Circling above the stage was a small plane pulling a banner that read ""Revolution Starts Now Feel the Bern."" The Sanders' campaign paid for the plane and instructed the pilot to fly ""up and down the Des Moines River."" 
The plane, however, never left the few city blocks around the Sanders and Clinton events, and the hum of the engine was clearly audible at lulls in the program at the Perry concert.
Hillary Clinton joined her husband and Perry on stage after the performance.
""Sometimes it is important,"" Clinton said, ""you just have to roar about what we need to fight for.""
In what has become an Iowa Jefferson-Jackson tradition, both Clinton and Sanders supporters marched to the event venue after their respective rallies.
Following a flatbed truck, a mass of Clinton supporters, including high-profile backers such as Iowa Rep. Dave Loebsack, chanted and held signs as they moved up the streets of downtown Des Moines.
Not attending the march: Hillary or Bill Clinton, a break with tradition where candidates escort their supporters to the venue.
Sanders did march from across the river, firing up his raucous supporters by tying his own campaign to the history of the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner march.
Shortly after Clinton's supporters rounded the corner into the dinner shouting, ""Hill Yes,"" Sanders supporters gathered at a different entrance shimmying alongside a Rock Island, Illinois, drill team and its drum line. 
Carrying signs that said ""The Revolution Starts Now,"" the crowd chanted ""Feel the Bern! Feel the Bern! Feel the Bern!"" in unison. When they reached the doors of the Iowa Events Center, the rally leaders held them at the steps for a call-answer chant: ""This is what democracy looks like."" 
""This march will not only get to the event‎,"" Sanders said before listing the ""great marches"" in the United States for civil rights, social justice. ""This is a march that will end up in a year when you will join me at the White House.""
While Clinton's crowd seemed to disperse on their march to the building, Sanders' supporters stayed in a tight pack, swaying to the drum beats and shouting their candidate's name. 
The odd man out in this seemingly two-way race was former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who rallied his supporters a few blocks from Clinton's concert.
O'Malley's campaign offered a concert of their own. But instead of a multi-platinum musician, O'Malley was his own musical act.
""This song was inspired by Johnny Cash,"" O'Malley said before breaking into a version of ""I've Been Everywhere.""
""It's about ... what the hell, it's about running for president of the United States.""
The Democratic field narrowed this week when both former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee dropped out. 
O'Malley, who has long been in the low single digits, now finds himself as the most likely candidate to get out next. Saturday night's Jefferson-Jackson Dinner is an important moment for the former governor to not only introduce himself to Iowa Democrats, but to prove he is going to make it to February's caucus.

Carson brushes off Trump zinger,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-10-24-US--GOP%202016-Carson/id-1df7fe88739d4318a786c826df049294,ap," (AP) â Republican presidential contender Ben Carson is brushing off rival Donald Trump's criticism of him as a ""super low energy"" candidate.
Carson says he does have a tendency to be ""relaxed."" But as a neurosurgeon who operated 18 to 20 hours at a time, he says he takes a backseat to no one when it comes to energy levels. Carson made the comments in an interview taped in Iowa for Sunday's ""Meet the Press"" program on NBC.
Trump and Carson are in a hot race in Iowa for the Feb. 1 caucuses, according to polls.
In a Florida speech Saturday, Trump zinged several rivals, calling Marco Rubio ""sweaty,"" Jeb Bush an embarrassment to his family and Carson sleepy.

First Draft: Bill Clinton Rallies Iowa for Hillary Clinton as ‘Honest and Trustworthy’,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/10/24/bill-clinton-rallies-iowa-for-hillary-clinton-as-honest-and-trustworthy/,nyt," DES MOINES — Appearing at his first rally of the campaign on behalf of his wife, Bill Clinton exhorted the crowd to rise above the deeply partisan tone of this election cycle and said that Hillary Rodham Clinton had shown voters her truest self in recent weeks.

“She’s still got the best friends that she had in grade school,” said Mr. Clinton, whose wife has seen a decrease in the number of voters who view her as “honest and trustworthy” in polls after a summer spent fending off questions about her use of a private email server while she was the secretary of state.

Someone who can make that boast about their friends is by “definition a trustworthy, reliable good person unless they had a toy theft gang going” as a child, Mr. Clinton said.

The last month has been “interesting” for his family, Mr. Clinton said, citing the first birthday of his granddaughter, Charlotte, and his 40th wedding anniversary with Mrs. Clinton.

But over the past few weeks of the campaign the country has finally gotten to see the person he met decades ago, Mr. Clinton said.

“That’s the person I got to see again, without all those barnacles, in the debate and in those 11 hours of testimony,” said Mr. Clinton, referring to her marathon testimony before the House committee investigating the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya.

Earlier, Mr. Clinton said that “the American people in the last six weeks have learned a lot about Hillary — what she’s for, why she’s running, and what kind of president she’d be.” They also learned from Saturday Night Live that she’s “a pretty good bartender, too.”

He said that he had received gushing emails from their friends praising her testimony. He wrote back, “I think I’ll vote for her.”

Mr. Clinton’s aides have long said that he does not use email.

His wife’s policy goals in the campaign are crucial, Mr. Clinton said, using one of his signature phrases in describing them as a “big deal.”

Mr. Clinton largely kept to a short speech, with his love of the stage threatening to take over only occasionally. Several times he promised to say “one more thing,” before remarking on just one more thing.

Mr. Clinton also decried the tenor of the debate in the Republican race, sounding the type of aspirational note that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. urged Democrats to engage in when he announced he would not seek the presidency himself last week.

“If you want an end to negative politics, you have to stop rewarding it,” Mr. Clinton told the rally. He denounced negative ads cut in “dark rooms.” And he suggested that ending wage stagnation was crucially important. The Democratic debate focused on issues, he said, while the Republicans have devolved into tearing each other apart.

Mr. Clinton said that America’s political leaders had to “stop running each other down and start building everybody up.” By contrast, Mrs. Clinton used her remarks to laud President Obama’s accomplishments and warn about what she called Republican efforts to “rip it away.”

Overhead, a plane flew with a sign trailing behind that read, “Revolution starts here! Feel the Bern!” It was a reference to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has emerged as Mrs. Clinton’s main rival in the Democratic contest.

Mr. Clinton also briefly found himself negotiating with a heckler who jumped on the stage in support of animal rights.

As the man continued yelling, Mr. Clinton genially continued talking, and the crowd booed to drown the man out.

But after several moments, Mr. Clinton turned to the man and asked, “We got it. Will you please quit now?” The man was soon escorted from the stage.

The former president turned back to the crowd and said, “At least that guy is for something. He didn’t come here to bad mouth anybody.”",0.80005330964216359
UPDATE 1-UK rate rise not a certainty says BoE's Carney - Mail,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/cyclicalconsumergoodsNews/~3/0UZ2A8InMTE/britain-boe-carney-idUSL8N12O0OX20151024,reuters,"(Adds background)
LONDON Oct 24 (Reuters) - An increase in Britain's
rock-bottom interest rates is not guaranteed although households
should prepare for higher borrowing costs, Bank of England
Governor Mark Carney said in comments published on Saturday.
""If we think there is a prospect, a possibility - that's a
possibility not a certainty - of rate rises, then that is far,
far better to let the British people know so they can prepare,""
he said in an interview with the Mail on Sunday newspaper.
""If events mean that does not happen and rate rises are not
appropriate, then we will do the right thing and we will not
adjust rates,"" Carney was quoted as saying.
The Bank of England cut interest rates to a record low of
0.5 percent in 2009 and has kept them there ever since, even as
Britain's economy recovered strongly over the past two years.
Carney has previously said that a decision about when to
raise rates would become clearer around the turn of the year.
Only one of the bank's nine policymakers has voted for a
hike and investors are not expecting a first BoE move until late
2016 or early 2017 due to China's economic slowdown, Britain's
near-zero inflation rate and the U.S. Federal Reserve's cautious
approach about raising rates.
Carney said in the interview that the Bank expected that
when rates do go up, the path would be ""gentle,"" echoing his
previous guidance on what is likely to happen to borrowing costs
as Britain recovers from the financial crisis.
He also said the bank was ""focused not on loosening monetary
policy, but on raising interest rates and deciding the right
time and place to do that.""
Carney defended recent speeches he has made on risks to the
financial sector from climate change and on the benefits and
risks to Britain's economy from its membership in the European
Union, a sensitive political issue before a referendum on
Britain's EU membership which is due before the end of 2017.
""Speaking as a central bank, it is very likely that Europe
has advantaged the dynamism of this economy. In fact, it is
without question,"" he said, reiterating comments he made earlier
this week.
""We have to say something,"" Carney said, adding that he was
due to address lawmakers on Britain's EU membership. ""The
British people would expect me to have something to say.""

DES MOINES -- Hillary Clinton often says she has learned from the mistakes of 2008 -- and perhaps her biggest test will come tonight at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner, the high-stakes event that launched President Barack Obama’s campaign into the stratosphere eight years ago.
Clinton rallied her supporters with a shouted “We are geared up and ready to go!” at a rally here Saturday afternoon -- at a parking-lot pep rally featuring her husband and pop star Katy Perry. That phrase echoed Obama’s “Fired up! Ready to go!” call-and-response chant that tore through the room then -- and shocked a less organized, less fired-up Clinton campaign that was based on experience and competence.
Story Continued Below
On Saturday, the sting of the 2008 J-J Dinner -- and Clinton’s determination to capture some of the energy that became a feature of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ insurgency -- was at the forefront of the campaign’s planning. Hours before the dinner, the campaign announced an endorsement from David Plouffe, Obama’s 2008 campaign manager. “To be honest, during the most intense days of the 2008 primary, I would never have imagined writing this,” Plouffe wrote. “And I doubt Team Clinton felt any differently about me … She’s the right person to protect President Obama’s legacy on health care and so much else.”
The campaign also seemed to have learned its lesson about being out-organized. More than 100 volunteers and staffers, at points joined by campaign manager Robby Mook, started marching in the streets of downtown Des Moines before 7 a.m. on a chilly fall Saturday. The campaign headquarters in Des Moines was filled by the afternoon with hundreds of volunteers attending a training session, dressed in royal-blue T-shirts that read “I’m Fighting for Her.” The campaign also brought out the big dog for his first official appearance on the trail: Former President Bill Clinton gave a 15-minute speech Saturday afternoon, appearing to relish being back on the campaign trail and in the spotlight.
""The American people in the last six weeks have learned a lot about Hillary — what she’s for, why she’s running, and what kind of president she’d be,"" he told a large crowd that had lined up and waited for an hour-and-a-half for a short set performed by Perry. ""If they watched 'Saturday Night Live,' they know she’s a pretty good bartender, too.""

The dinner also marks a critical moment for Sanders, who needs to show he can maintain the enthusiasm that buoyed him all summer even as Clinton grows in strength after the one-two punch of her debate performance and her testimony Thursday in front of the House Benghazi Committee. At Clinton’s rally, a single-engine plane flying a banner “Revolution Starts Now: FEEL THE BERN,” flew over the modest stage set up in front of the Hy-Vee Hall, a sign of the challenge Clinton still faces, even as she benefits from the boost of a ten-day winning streak.
Sanders’ campaign also planned a rally before the dinner, with alumni of the band Guster getting the crowd amped up. “Our allotted 1,950 seats will all be full,” said Robert Becker, Iowa State director for the Sanders campaign. “Bernie will address the rally, and then we’ll march across the Des Moines River. We’re going to be a diverse and rowdy bunch.”

UPDATE 1-UK rate rise not a certainty says BoE's Carney - Mail,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/financialsNews/~3/WBRVtyHQ9mY/story01.htm,reuters,"(Adds background)
LONDON Oct 24 (Reuters) - An increase in Britain's
rock-bottom interest rates is not guaranteed although households
should prepare for higher borrowing costs, Bank of England
Governor Mark Carney said in comments published on Saturday.
""If we think there is a prospect, a possibility - that's a
possibility not a certainty - of rate rises, then that is far,
far better to let the British people know so they can prepare,""
he said in an interview with the Mail on Sunday newspaper.
""If events mean that does not happen and rate rises are not
appropriate, then we will do the right thing and we will not
adjust rates,"" Carney was quoted as saying.
The Bank of England cut interest rates to a record low of
0.5 percent in 2009 and has kept them there ever since, even as
Britain's economy recovered strongly over the past two years.
Carney has previously said that a decision about when to
raise rates would become clearer around the turn of the year.
Only one of the bank's nine policymakers has voted for a
hike and investors are not expecting a first BoE move until late
2016 or early 2017 due to China's economic slowdown, Britain's
near-zero inflation rate and the U.S. Federal Reserve's cautious
approach about raising rates.
Carney said in the interview that the Bank expected that
when rates do go up, the path would be ""gentle,"" echoing his
previous guidance on what is likely to happen to borrowing costs
as Britain recovers from the financial crisis.
He also said the bank was ""focused not on loosening monetary
policy, but on raising interest rates and deciding the right
time and place to do that.""
Carney defended recent speeches he has made on risks to the
financial sector from climate change and on the benefits and
risks to Britain's economy from its membership in the European
Union, a sensitive political issue before a referendum on
Britain's EU membership which is due before the end of 2017.
""Speaking as a central bank, it is very likely that Europe
has advantaged the dynamism of this economy. In fact, it is
without question,"" he said, reiterating comments he made earlier
this week.
""We have to say something,"" Carney said, adding that he was
due to address lawmakers on Britain's EU membership. ""The
British people would expect me to have something to say.""

Bill Clinton stumps for Hillary in first 2016 campaign trail appearance,http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/24/politics/jefferson-jackson-dinner-bill-clinton/index.html,cnn,"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN)The explainer-in-chief is back.
Bill Clinton made his first public campaign trail appearance for his wife's 2016 campaign on Saturday, spelling out why she is ready for the White House.
The former president, rallying Hillary Clinton supporters before Iowa's big annual Democratic dinner, and acting as a warm-up act for pop diva Katy Perry, made an argument that the stakes in the party nominating race and the general election were simple but profound.
He said that as president, his wife would stop bad things happening in national security, make more good things happen at home and abroad and secure and broaden the economic recovery forged by President Barack Obama.
""The American people in the last six weeks have learned a lot about lot about Hillary, what she is for, why she is running and what kind of president she would be,"" Clinton said in an open-air rally here.
The Clinton campaign is trying to build on a streak of good fortune which has helped revive the former secretary of state's White House bid after a tough summer which was dominated by the controversy over her private email server and the surge by her Democratic Party rival Bernie Sanders.
Bill Clinton praised Obama's legacy of restoring growth and job creation after the Great Recession that struck just before he took office, and said only a Democrat could deliver increased personal incomes and job security.
""I believe that progress has been made, but there is more that needs to be done,"" he said.
And Clinton argued that the next president could get to make between one and three appointments to the Supreme Court, potentially with the chance to shape U.S. politics and public life for decades to come.
He said that his wife's marathon 11-hour testimony over the Benghazi attack on Capitol Hill Thursday had reminded many people why she had the skills needed to be president. He also argued that his wife was the most electable and qualified person in the race to actually serve as president -- perhaps in a veiled swipe at the self-declared ""democratic socialist"" Sanders.
""When you elect a president you have got to say, 'Who is the person I think is most likely to keep big, bad things from happening and to make more good things happen?'"" Clinton said. ""I don't think it is a terribly close question.""
It was the kind of reasoned argument that Clinton had deployed to help give definition to Obama's re-election campaign in 2012, when he was credited with laying out the stakes in a more methodical way than the President himself. Grateful for Clinton's performances at the Democratic National Convention and on the campaign trail, Obama dubbed the 42nd president the ""explainer-in-chief,"" or the ""Secretary of Explaining Stuff.""
Clinton, who served as president from 1993 to 2001, also ended with a tongue-in-cheek reference to his wife's historic potential as the first woman president.
""There has been a lot of talk about breaking the glass ceiling,"" Clinton said. ""I am tired of the stranglehold that women have had on the job of presidential spouse.""

Hillary Clinton borrows a page from Obama's 2008 playbook,http://www.latimes.com/la-na-democratic-candidates-iowa-dinner-20151024-story.html,latimes,"Making his first prominent appearance of his wife's campaign in the early-voting state of Iowa, Bill Clinton came with a simple message Saturday.
“Thank you for coming,” he told a crowd of a few hundred supporters at an outdoor rally before state Democrats’ biggest event of the 2016 election -- a key early taste of how well the candidates are doing here.
At times in Hillary Rodham Clinton’s second run for the presidency, it has seemed her team is conspicuously working to correct the mistakes of the first. In the case of its mobilization efforts in Iowa, the campaign is not bashful about saying so.

The Clinton campaign sought to use the event, the Iowa Democratic Party’s Jefferson-Jackson Dinner, as a showcase for the granular political organizing efforts -- both here and throughout the country -- that the Obama campaign mastered eight years ago. Those efforts were an integral part of how Obama wrested the nomination away from Clinton, the early front-runner for the Democratic nomination that year.

The hearing provided an extraordinary spectacle, starting in...
Hundreds more campaign volunteers who will take leadership roles as precinct captains across the state spent the day at the Clinton campaign’s state headquarters for a boot camp, which included a pep talk from campaign manager Robby Mook.
Clinton's team also recognized the importance of even more symbolic efforts at the dinner, which has become something of a political carnival in the years leading up to the caucus. More than 100 supporters scattered across the heart of Des Moines, Iowa's largest city, early Saturday in a show of force. Other volunteers prepped for the all-important “sign war” that takes place around and inside the HyVee Hall, where the dinner is served. Campaigns compete to paper the area with signs of support, a small achievement that nonetheless is an early barometer of volunteer strength.
Since Hillary Rodham Clinton announced her bid for the White House, she has steadily slipped from inevitable nominee to flawed and vulnerable front-runner amid campaign mishaps and voters' Clinton fatigue – and her rivals anticipated that it all would accelerate in recent days.

Since Hillary Rodham Clinton announced her bid for the White House, she has steadily slipped from inevitable nominee to flawed and vulnerable front-runner amid campaign mishaps and voters' Clinton fatigue – and her rivals anticipated that it all would accelerate in recent days.
But in yet another...
To ensure it would draw a substantial number of supporters, the campaign brought in two of its biggest weapons -- pop star Katy Perry and former President Bill Clinton -- for its pre-dinner rally.
That’s not to say there weren’t signs of the obstacles that remain in Hillary Clinton's pursuit of the nomination. One hovered overhead on Saturday -- a banner in support of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton's main rival for the nomination, being flown in circles above downtown Des Moines.
But Clinton's team hoped at least to prevent the same kind of breakout performance from Sanders on Saturday that Obama had eight years ago at the event.
“The J-J was the moment everything clicked for us in Iowa,"" said Tommy Vietor, a veteran of the Obama team in Iowa that year. ""But that was the result of a lot of work.""

Preparations for the dinner began months in advance, planning almost a guerrilla-style campaign -- with diagrams of the arena to ensure the campaign had the best strategic positions to put up signs, and working to garner a huge turnout of supporters and choreograph their cheers.
“When you describe it, it sounds like this silly thing that campaigns do. But actually it makes you think 400 moves ahead,” he said. “It got the people involved -- our organizers -- so hyped for the event that it was like you were playing in a political Super Bowl.”
In the end, Vietor said, the performance showed that the Obama effort “was for real.”
Another Obama veteran, Mitch Stewart, recalled on Twitter how a colleague said to him after: “I think we just won the caucuses.” For Stewart, the observation prompted a nervous bout of nausea.

Bill Clinton rallies for wife; Sanders on the march,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-10-24-US--DEM%202016-Iowa/id-647a092ce226458f96b93869b25c2520,ap," (AP) â Hillary Rodham Clinton turned to her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and pop singer Katy Perry to energize her campaign's faithful Saturday before a pivotal dinner with thousands of Iowa Democrats.
Her chief Democratic presidential rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, rallied thousands of cheering supporters before marching across a bridge spanning the Des Moines River, telling them: ""This country belongs to all of us, not just wealthy campaign donors.""
One hundred days remain before Iowa's leadoff presidential caucuses, and the afternoon events were designed to generate enthusiasm before the state Democratic party's annual Jefferson-Jackson fundraising dinner.
""She's my firework,"" Perry told Clinton's supporters, wearing a white strapless gown adorned with a Clinton campaign logo and a flowing American flag cape at a free concert.
Bill Clinton told the rally that during the last few weeks the nation has ""learned a lot about Hillary, what she's for, why she's running and what kind of president she would be."" With tongue in cheek, he complained that he was tired of women having a ""stranglehold"" on the position of first spouse and hoped to break that White House gender barrier.
More than 6,000 activists were expected at the dinner, which traditionally serves as a kickoff to the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses.
Clinton and Sanders sit atop a Democratic presidential field that has effectively pared down to a two-person race for the nomination after Vice President Joe Biden announced this week he would not seek the White House.
Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley hoped for a breakout performance at the dinner, which catapulted President Barack Obama in the fall of 2007 and led to his surprising victory in the caucuses.
In the hours before the fundraiser, Iowa's capitol city was full of pageantry as supporters of the three campaigns poured into Des Moines wearing T-shirts and waving signs. Some Clinton enthusiasts painted their cars to show support for the former secretary of state, and her team dispatched young loyalists along street corners to wave signs at passing cars.
Bill Clinton headlined his first campaign rally at the pre-dinner concert featuring Perry, a Clinton backer whose hit song, ""Roar,"" is an anthem at Hillary Clinton events. The former president has raised money for his wife's campaign, but the rally was his first big splash during the race.
Perry got into the act much earlier, recording a wake-up phone message for Clinton's organizers. ""Wake-y Wake-y eggs and bakey. It's Katy Perry here,"" the pop singer said in the call. ""I know it's early, but you know what they say, the early bird gets the votes."" At the free concert, she performed her hits ""Roar,"" and ""Firework,"" along with a rendition of ""America the Beautiful.""
The dinner caps a key stretch for Hillary Clinton, who received a boost from Biden's decision not to run on Wednesday and then put together a grinding, competent appearance on Thursday before a Republican-led congressional committee probing the deadly 2012 attacks on diplomatic outposts in Benghazi, Libya.
Two lesser-known rivals, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee, abandoned the race following Clinton's strong performance on Oct. 13 in the first primary debate.
The dinner, called the ""J-J,"" is an important showcase for Sanders, a Vermont independent who has drawn large crowds with his calls for a ""political revolution"" to address the gap between the wealthy and the poor.
Clinton placed third in Iowa in 2008 and has since vowed to build a formidable organization to power her to victory here. She has sought to present herself as the heir to Obama's legacy, while Sanders offers an anti-establishment message and often notes the large numbers of Democrats who stayed home in the 2014 midterm elections.
O'Malley, who has trailed Clinton and Sanders in polls by wide margins, is a member of a Celtic Irish band and broke out his guitar to perform a cover of Johnny Cash's song, ""I've Been Everywhere"" at a pre-dinner event on Saturday. The ex-governor has campaigned extensively in Iowa and knows the process firsthand: He got his start here as a young field organizer for Sen. Gary Hart's presidential campaign in 1984.
A recent Iowa poll by Bloomberg Politics and The Des Moines Register found Clinton with a slight lead in the state over Sanders, with the two candidates the choice of 9 in 10 voters. O'Malley was at 2 percent.

How did Bill Clinton try to rally a crowd of supporters on the eve of his wife’s big speech in Des Moines Saturday?
By talking about emails.
Story Continued Below
Discussing Hillary Clinton's 11-hour-marathon testimony in front of the House Benghazi committee Thursday, the former president told the crowd rallying for his wife, “we had the friends of our lifetime emailing me furiously saying they thought she was doing great,” he told the crowd that had been waiting an hour and a half for Katy Perry’s concert for Clinton. “To everyone of them, I wrote back, ‘I think I’ll vote for her.’”
The 42nd president, in a blue blazer and jeans, has always minimized his use of emails -- and all technology. In March, he said through a spokesman that he has only sent two email messages in his life, back when he was in the White House.
Clinton was in mid-campaign form, enjoying the spotlight during his first foray onto the campaign trail. 
""The American people in the last six weeks have learned a lot about Hillary — what she’s for, why she’s running, and what kind of president she’d be,"" he said. ""If they watched Saturday Night Live, they know she’s a pretty good bartender, too.""

Referring to the recent Democratic debate, he said, ""I was proud to be a Democrat because I watched five hours of the Republicans debate. [On our side] every disagreement they had was over an issue. that’s politics at its best. Nobody insulted anyone else. no one was out there to get people to stop thinking.""
About 15 minutes into his speech, some of the crowd cheered when he said he was almost finished. While Clinton was on stage, a plane flying a banner “Revolution Starts Now: FEEL THE BERN,” flew over the modest stage set up in front of the Hy-Vee Hall, a sign of the challenge she still faces in the face of the best stretch of her campaign.

Ben Carson: 'My energy levels are perfectly fine',http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/24/politics/ben-carson-donald-trump-energy/index.html,cnn,"Washington  (CNN)Ben Carson on Saturday dismissed attacks from Donald Trump in which he accused the retired neurosurgeon of not having enough ""energy"" to be president. 
""My energy levels are perfectly fine,"" Carson said in Iowa. ""As I've said many times, there have been many times where I've operated 12, 15, 20 hours, and that requires a lot of energy. Doesn't require a lot of jumping up and down and screaming, but it does require a lot of concentration."" 
His comments came the day after Trump told a rally in Miami that Carson has even less energy than Jeb Bush, who he has repeatedly called a ""low-energy"" candidate. 
""Ben Carson is super low energy, right? He's super low,"" Trump said. ""Super low energy. We need tremendous energy. We need tremendous energy."" 
Trump previously had warned Carson that he would start attacking him if he started passing him in the polls. Carson made progress against Trump this week, when two Iowa polls showed him topping the real estate mogul among Hawkeye State Republicans.
Trump delivered on his promise Friday, mocking Carson, who is known for being soft-spoken.
""Donald Trump falls to second place behind Ben Carson,"" Trump said, pretending to read a headline. ""We informed Ben, but he was sleeping.""
Then, at a rally in Jacksonville on Saturday, Trump expressed incredulity at Carson's rise.
""I don't know what the hell is going on there,"" he said. ""I don't get it!""
But Carson has said he will not parry with Trump.
""If he does attack me, I'll continue to talk about issues. I just really don't buy into the attack-your-fellow-Republicans thing. I'm just not going to do that,"" Carson said Friday on Bloomberg's ""With All Due Respect.""

He said Trump has generally been nice to him.
""My personal interactions with him have shown him to be a gentleman,"" Carson said. ""I think there's another element sometimes when he's on camera.""

Trump jabs at Bush in Florida: Not ready to be president,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-10-24-US--GOP%202016-Trump/id-f0c116c4d9f84e93a81a7c7ed4e30ab7,ap," (AP) â Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump mocked former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in his own state on Saturday, saying recent campaign cuts show he's not ready to be president.
""Here's a guy who wants to run our country, and he can't even run his own campaign. And you know what? He's cutting back big,"" Trump told a raucous crowd of thousands gathered along the riverfront of one of Florida's most conservative cities.
The comment came the day after the Bush campaign said it was cutting payroll by 40 percent by trimming staff and requiring an across the board pay cut for those remaining.
Trump said Bush, the son and brother for former presidents, is ""losing badly and embarrassing his family.""
""Bush has no money. He's cutting. He's meeting today with mommy and daddy and they're working on their campaign,"" Trump said.
He chastised Bush for paying his finance director more than $1 million and said that if campaign staffers were willing to work for lower pay, he should have made that deal when the campaign started.
""You don't wait till you're failing,"" he said.
By contrast, Trump said he's only spent about $2 million on his campaign and he's leading in polls.
""So, I've put up less money than anybody else and I'm No. 1,"" he said. ""Wouldn't it be better if we had a country that would spend the least and be No. 1? Think about it.""
The Bush campaign responded by saying people are getting tired of Trump.
""Donald Trump needs a new schtick. Launching absurd attacks at his opponents to distract from his lack of ideas and liberal record is beginning to wear thin with voters. Donald Trump is increasingly showing each day that he is not a serious enough person to be commander in chief and lead the world's most powerful military,"" Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said in an email.
If people are tiring of him, it didn't show Saturday. An overflow crowd gathered at a downtown open-air mall for his visit. Brandon Chance, 25, wore a T-shirt with an artistic rendition of Trump pointing that said ""Washington, D.C. â You're Fired."" Chance said one of the reasons he likes Trump is that he's never held political office and is paying for his own campaign.
""He's not relying on people to work him like a puppet,"" Chance said. ""Politicians just B.S. everybody. They feed everybody a line. Politicians just lie.""
Bush wasn't the only rival Trump targeted during a speech that lasted about an hour and 20 minutes. Florida's junior senator, Marco Rubio, and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson also took hits.
""You've got Rubio doing poorly, and he sweats like a dog,"" Trump said. ""You've got Carson. I don't know what the hell's going on there. I don't get it.""
It was the second straight day Trump campaigned in Florida, where he leads in recent polls â a point he took joy in letting the crowd know.
""Trump is No. 1. Rubio, waaaaay back,"" Trump said. ""You're talking about a guy who's sweating, now he's really sweating.""
He also said Rubio is disloyal because he is challenging Bush for the nomination after saying for years that Bush was his political mentor.
""Everybody said he'd never run. Even I thought, he'll never run because Bush was his mentor."" Trump said. ""Those two guys are fighting like crazy, and I'm laughing watching them fight.""

Trump hits rivals over super PACs days after group backing him disbands,http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/24/politics/donald-trump-super-pac-jeb-bush-marco-rubio/index.html,cnn,"Jake Tapper's full interview with Donald Trump will air Sunday at 9 a.m. ET on CNN's ""State of the Union.""
Jacksonville, Florida (CNN)Donald Trump on Saturday knocked his fellow presidential candidates for having super PACs backing their presidential bids, just two days after a super PAC backing him announced it was disbanding.
""A lot of PACs are crooked business,"" Trump said Saturday at a rally here in Jacksonville. ""Those PACs control the candidates. They totally control. (Ben) Carson is controlled by his PAC. (Jeb) Bush is controlled by his PAC. (Marco) Rubio is controlled by his PAC -- and he needs a lot of water.""
Most notably, Trump knocked Carson -- who overtook Trump as the front-runner in Iowa in two recent polls -- for his campaign ""in Iowa being run by a super PAC.""
RELATED: Trump slams Carson amid dipping poll numbers in Iowa
Since launching his campaign, Trump has repeatedly slammed the influence big-moneyed interests hold over politicians, but a super PAC set up to bolster his candidacy drew scrutiny in recent weeks for its ties to the campaign. The group announced Thursday it would shut down after the Trump campaign denied it ever gave the PAC its blessing.
And on Friday, the Trump campaign in a press release disavowed the ""nine unauthorized super PACs claiming to support him"" and called on other presidential campaigns to do the same.
Trump again on Saturday said he didn't know anything about the PACs that have been set up to boost his chances at winning the White House, and highlighted his independent status, once again claiming to be ""self-funding"" his campaign.
""So when they come to me and they say, 'Donald what are you doing?' I say, 'I don't care I got to do the right thing.' The only people I'm going to be working for is right out here,"" Trump said. ""I don't want anybody from PACs. I don't want any money.""
But while Trump continues to claim that he is self-funding his campaign, he has spent more of other people's money than his own since launching his campaign in June.
Trump spent $3.6 million from campaign contributions that supporters have sent in, while spending $1.9 million from his own pockets.
While Trump's website has a visible ""DONATE"" tab at the top of his webpage, Trump says that he does not solicit campaign contributions and has attributed the donations, which averaged in at $50, to a groundswell of grassroots support.

But even as he has disavowed outside efforts to boost his candidacy, an outside effort looking to help Trump capture the nomination showed its face on Saturday in Jacksonville -- not in the form of a shadowy organization, but in that of local millionaire Jimmy Indianos, who is self-funding a pro-Trump effort in Florida.
Indianos has not set up a formal organization, but pays 15 staffers out of his own pocket -- more staffers than the Trump campaign has in Iowa -- and at the Saturday rally, Indianos and his staff were out in full force, asking supporters to give their names and personal information and distributing free T-shirts as they push to register new voters who will support Trump in the Florida primary.
He set up his operation in May, before Trump even officially announced his candidacy and long before Trump put staff in Florida. The Trump campaign announced the hire of a Florida state director earlier this month.
""We got the mojo rolling right now. We got some momentum and it's working,"" Indianos told CNN.
He said he's been in touch with the campaign's new Florida state director Karen Giorno, who he said was ""pretty excited"" about his work, but wanted to make sure he was not collecting any money, which he is not.
RELATED: Trump sent prank care package to Rubio
""I'm a private citizen -- I think we still got that right ... We'll do anything to help 'em,"" Indianos said, but added that he would stop his operation if the campaign asked him. ""Hey, they tell me to stop, I'll save me a bunch of money and I'll just go back to making money.""
Giorno and the Trump campaign did not return a request for comment. And Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said he did not know anything about Indianos and his operation.
At the rally on Saturday, Trump repeatedly ignored questions about super PACs or his campaign finance reform plans.
Stumping here in Florida, Trump also knocked Bush and Rubio, the top two establishment candidates jostling with Trump for the nomination.
He knocked Bush for deciding Friday to downsize his campaign and slash salaries as he has struggled to remain in the top-tier of Republican candidates in national polls.
""Here is a guy who wants to run our country and he can't even run his own campaign,"" Trump said of Bush, the former Florida governor.
And as Trump has topped both Bush and Rubio in polls of Florida's GOP voters, Trump again used a common attack against the Florida senator.
""Talk about a guy who's sweating,"" Trump said. ""Now he's really sweating!""

First Draft: Jeb Bush Expresses Despair About Toxic Tone of Campaign,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/10/24/jeb-bush-expresses-despair-about-toxic-tone-of-campaign/,nyt,"A day after his campaign slashed staff and salaries to retrench ahead of the Iowa caucuses, Jeb Bush decried the toxic tone of the presidential race and suggesting that “demonizing” people isn’t what he signed up for in this campaign. 

Mr. Bush made the remarks at a town hall in South Carolina, where, according to a report by CNN, he seemed fired up about taking on the person who has overshadowed him during the campaign, Donald J. Trump, who is leading most Republican polls so far. 

“If this election is about how we’re going to fight to get nothing done,” Mr. Bush said, then “I don’t want any part of it. I don’t want to be elected president to sit around and see gridlock just become so dominant that people literally are in decline in their lives. That is not my motivation.”

He added, “I’ve got a lot of really cool things I could do other than sit around, being miserable, listening to people demonize me and me feeling compelled to demonize them. That is a joke. Elect Trump if you want that.”

The rise of Mr. Trump in the Republican contest has confounded Mr. Bush, his family, and his supporters, who had built a battleship-sized campaign operation that was theoretically geared toward a general election. 

Earlier, before the town hall, Mr. Bush told reporters he was not focusing his energy on Mr. Trump. 

“I’m past Donald Trump,” Mr. Bush said.
