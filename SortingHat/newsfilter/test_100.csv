"Poland votes, conservative eurosceptic party looks set to win",http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/worldNews/~3/jYbUopPNr6w/story01.htm,reuters,"WARSAW Poles vote in an election on Sunday that could end nearly a decade of economic and political stability in the country of 38 million, bringing to power a conservative, eurosceptic party whose policies diverge from many of Poland's European allies.
If opinion polls are correct, the ruling Civic Platform (PO), a pro-market, centrist grouping in power for the past eight years, will lose to the conservative Law and Justice opposition party (PiS), run by the twin brother of late president Lech Kaczynski, Jaroslaw.
Most polls show PiS as the frontrunner on more than 30 percent, while PO is second with just over 20 percent. Several small parties are also running, spanning the political spectrum from ultra-right to liberal and extreme left.
Distrustful of the European Union and an advocate of a strong NATO hand in dealing with Moscow, PiS opposes joining the 'euro zone' in the near future, promises more welfare spending on the poor and wants banks subject to new taxation.
It also opposes the relocation of migrants from the Middle East to Poland, arguing they could threaten Poland's Catholic way of life - raising the prospect of tensions with the EU on the issue.
On the campaign trail, Kaczynski and other PiS leaders have sought to tap into anger that the economic success is not more evenly shared out and into nationalist sentiment fanned by immigration fears, particularly among young voters.
""If (PO) maintains power, if we don't manage to take it from them, things will be much worse than before. You may say things cannot get worse. Things can always get worse,"" Kaczynski told supporters during a rally in Lublin, some 80 km (50 miles) from the Ukraine border.
Poland has seen its economy expand by nearly 50 percent in the last decade and is the only EU member not to experience recession after the 2008 financial crisis. But pockets of poverty and stagnation remain, particularly in the east.
""There is a broader phenomenon of a return to national, religious, community values being seen all across Europe,"" said political analyst Aleksander Smolar.
""PiS uses clear ... language in this respect.""

FANNING RACISM    
Kaczynski was accused by some Polish media this month of fanning racism when he said migrants fleeing war in the Middle East and Africa may bring new diseases and parasites to Poland.
PO Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz later quipped Kaczynski, a known cat lover, wasn't too worried to own cats even though they can carry diseases dangerous to people.
""There are many diseases that come from animals, but at the same time that doesn't stop (Kaczynski) from having a cat,"" she said.
PiS's advocacy of a robust Western approach towards Russia following Moscow's 2014 annexation of the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine might also complicate any future bridge-building between the EU and Russia.
Several new parties are running on anti-establishment platforms, supported largely by young voters. 
Among them, Kukiz'15, a grouping run by former Polish rock star Pawel Kukiz, which wants to tax ""bank gangsters"" and says Poland is a ""colony of foreign governments"". Kukiz ran in a presidential election in May, winning a shock 21 percent.
""I hope we enter parliament in such numbers that it will allow us to make a crack in the system, allowing the citizens, the nation to win back control over the state, which has been taken away from them,"" Kukiz told a campaign rally.
The smattering of fringe parties in the election means PiS, even if it wins, will likely have to seek coalition partners to rule, raising the possibility of extended talks in the weeks after the vote. 
It also leaves room for PO to retain its hold on power, if PiS fails to form a functioning majority in parliament and the centrists secure the support of leftist groupings such as United Left (ZL) or liberal Nowoczesna.
Polls open at 7 a.m. local time (0600 GMT) and close at 9 p.m., (2000 GMT). Exit polls will be available immediately after voting ends.

"In Iowa, Clinton camp roars while Sanders faithful sway to the beat",http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/24/politics/jefferson-jackson-dinner-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-rallies/index.html,cnn,"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN)The Des Moines River splits its namesake city everyday, but on Saturday, the river figuratively split the Democratic Party: Hillary Clinton supporters to the west, Bernie Sanders backers to the east.
While the groups rallied around their candidates in preparation for the crucial Iowa Democratic Party's Jefferson-Jackson Dinner, they did so in dramatically different settings, ones that show the differences in their campaigns.
Clinton supporters started lining up at 7:30 a.m., nine hours before pop star Katy Perry serenaded an estimated 4,000 supporters in a parking lot, according to the campaign.
Students from Iowa State University were first in line, eager to get as close to Perry as possible. Protected by blankets in the blustery Des Moines morning, the students somewhat overlooked the other international figure who graced the stage with Perry: former President Bill Clinton.
Asked whether they were excited to see Bill Clinton, the students shrugged, a departure from the early-morning shrieks they offered to Perry's name.
It was hard not to know Perry was in town. 
The speaker system Clinton's campaign set up blared for most of the afternoon, and when the pop star attended a sound check, nearly all of downtown Des Moines could hear her rendition of ""America the Beautiful.""
Down the street from the concert, Dan Bram, a Clinton organizer in Iowa, sported a ""Left Shark"" costume to pump up passersby. The costume is a reference to Perry's Super Bowl performance, when a dancer in a shark costume had trouble keeping up.
Half a mile away, Sanders' supporters were treated to a bit of the concert: Perry's music was, at times, audible to the Iowans backing Sanders.
""We have not been loud enough,"" one Sanders organizer said from the stage. ""I want Katy Perry to hear us!""
Unlike some of his other events across the country -- where thousands come out to see the independent Vermont senator -- Sanders' gathering was not a sizable affair.
The event was not open to the public, and it was less of a rally for Sanders and more of a training session for supporters who were attending the Jefferson-Jackson dinner.
Sanders' aides taught the crowd chants and urged them to be fired up.
""Be loud. Be raucous,"" they implored. 
But throughout the event, it was clear that something else was going on across the river.
""Can they hear us across the river?"" bellowed Sanders' emcee. ""Get loud as hell one more time!""
But even to some Sanders' supporters, Perry was enough of a draw to get them to not attend the senator's rally.
""We are millennials,"" said Sandy Barnard, an organizer for Sanders in Chicago who sported a T-shirt with Sanders' profile at Clinton's rally. ""I don't know when else I am going to see Katy Perry live for free.""
Her friend, Rosie O'Brian, held a sign that read, ""Bert+Ernie=Bernie -- Sesame Street for Sanders.""
""I didn't realize we were supposed to be at a rally for Bernie right now,"" O'Brian said with a smile, acknowledging that she wanted to see Perry.
Before the pop star took the stage for four songs, Bill Clinton addressed the crowd, well aware of his role on this day.
""I never have been the warmup act for Katy Perry before,"" he said. ""But I am well aware I am the warmup act.""
Perry, sporting a white dress emblazoned with Clinton's campaign logo and wearing the American flag as a cape, serenaded the audience with what has become an unofficial campaign anthem, ""Roar.""
The Sanders' campaign wasn't far from mind at the event, though. Circling above the stage was a small plane pulling a banner that read ""Revolution Starts Now Feel the Bern."" The Sanders' campaign paid for the plane and instructed the pilot to fly ""up and down the Des Moines River."" 
The plane, however, never left the few city blocks around the Sanders and Clinton events, and the hum of the engine was clearly audible at lulls in the program at the Perry concert.
Hillary Clinton joined her husband and Perry on stage after the performance.
""Sometimes it is important,"" Clinton said, ""you just have to roar about what we need to fight for.""
In what has become an Iowa Jefferson-Jackson tradition, both Clinton and Sanders supporters marched to the event venue after their respective rallies.
Following a flatbed truck, a mass of Clinton supporters, including high-profile backers such as Iowa Rep. Dave Loebsack, chanted and held signs as they moved up the streets of downtown Des Moines.
Not attending the march: Hillary or Bill Clinton, a break with tradition where candidates escort their supporters to the venue.
Sanders did march from across the river, firing up his raucous supporters by tying his own campaign to the history of the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner march.
Shortly after Clinton's supporters rounded the corner into the dinner shouting, ""Hill Yes,"" Sanders supporters gathered at a different entrance shimmying alongside a Rock Island, Illinois, drill team and its drum line. 
Carrying signs that said ""The Revolution Starts Now,"" the crowd chanted ""Feel the Bern! Feel the Bern! Feel the Bern!"" in unison. When they reached the doors of the Iowa Events Center, the rally leaders held them at the steps for a call-answer chant: ""This is what democracy looks like."" 
""This march will not only get to the event‎,"" Sanders said before listing the ""great marches"" in the United States for civil rights, social justice. ""This is a march that will end up in a year when you will join me at the White House.""
While Clinton's crowd seemed to disperse on their march to the building, Sanders' supporters stayed in a tight pack, swaying to the drum beats and shouting their candidate's name. 
The odd man out in this seemingly two-way race was former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who rallied his supporters a few blocks from Clinton's concert.
O'Malley's campaign offered a concert of their own. But instead of a multi-platinum musician, O'Malley was his own musical act.
""This song was inspired by Johnny Cash,"" O'Malley said before breaking into a version of ""I've Been Everywhere.""
""It's about ... what the hell, it's about running for president of the United States.""
The Democratic field narrowed this week when both former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee dropped out. 
O'Malley, who has long been in the low single digits, now finds himself as the most likely candidate to get out next. Saturday night's Jefferson-Jackson Dinner is an important moment for the former governor to not only introduce himself to Iowa Democrats, but to prove he is going to make it to February's caucus.

Carson brushes off Trump zinger,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-10-24-US--GOP%202016-Carson/id-1df7fe88739d4318a786c826df049294,ap," (AP) â Republican presidential contender Ben Carson is brushing off rival Donald Trump's criticism of him as a ""super low energy"" candidate.
Carson says he does have a tendency to be ""relaxed."" But as a neurosurgeon who operated 18 to 20 hours at a time, he says he takes a backseat to no one when it comes to energy levels. Carson made the comments in an interview taped in Iowa for Sunday's ""Meet the Press"" program on NBC.
Trump and Carson are in a hot race in Iowa for the Feb. 1 caucuses, according to polls.
In a Florida speech Saturday, Trump zinged several rivals, calling Marco Rubio ""sweaty,"" Jeb Bush an embarrassment to his family and Carson sleepy.

First Draft: Bill Clinton Rallies Iowa for Hillary Clinton as ‘Honest and Trustworthy’,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/10/24/bill-clinton-rallies-iowa-for-hillary-clinton-as-honest-and-trustworthy/,nyt," DES MOINES — Appearing at his first rally of the campaign on behalf of his wife, Bill Clinton exhorted the crowd to rise above the deeply partisan tone of this election cycle and said that Hillary Rodham Clinton had shown voters her truest self in recent weeks.

“She’s still got the best friends that she had in grade school,” said Mr. Clinton, whose wife has seen a decrease in the number of voters who view her as “honest and trustworthy” in polls after a summer spent fending off questions about her use of a private email server while she was the secretary of state.

Someone who can make that boast about their friends is by “definition a trustworthy, reliable good person unless they had a toy theft gang going” as a child, Mr. Clinton said.

The last month has been “interesting” for his family, Mr. Clinton said, citing the first birthday of his granddaughter, Charlotte, and his 40th wedding anniversary with Mrs. Clinton.

But over the past few weeks of the campaign the country has finally gotten to see the person he met decades ago, Mr. Clinton said.

“That’s the person I got to see again, without all those barnacles, in the debate and in those 11 hours of testimony,” said Mr. Clinton, referring to her marathon testimony before the House committee investigating the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya.

Earlier, Mr. Clinton said that “the American people in the last six weeks have learned a lot about Hillary — what she’s for, why she’s running, and what kind of president she’d be.” They also learned from Saturday Night Live that she’s “a pretty good bartender, too.”

He said that he had received gushing emails from their friends praising her testimony. He wrote back, “I think I’ll vote for her.”

Mr. Clinton’s aides have long said that he does not use email.

His wife’s policy goals in the campaign are crucial, Mr. Clinton said, using one of his signature phrases in describing them as a “big deal.”

Mr. Clinton largely kept to a short speech, with his love of the stage threatening to take over only occasionally. Several times he promised to say “one more thing,” before remarking on just one more thing.

Mr. Clinton also decried the tenor of the debate in the Republican race, sounding the type of aspirational note that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. urged Democrats to engage in when he announced he would not seek the presidency himself last week.

“If you want an end to negative politics, you have to stop rewarding it,” Mr. Clinton told the rally. He denounced negative ads cut in “dark rooms.” And he suggested that ending wage stagnation was crucially important. The Democratic debate focused on issues, he said, while the Republicans have devolved into tearing each other apart.

Mr. Clinton said that America’s political leaders had to “stop running each other down and start building everybody up.” By contrast, Mrs. Clinton used her remarks to laud President Obama’s accomplishments and warn about what she called Republican efforts to “rip it away.”

Overhead, a plane flew with a sign trailing behind that read, “Revolution starts here! Feel the Bern!” It was a reference to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has emerged as Mrs. Clinton’s main rival in the Democratic contest.

Mr. Clinton also briefly found himself negotiating with a heckler who jumped on the stage in support of animal rights.

As the man continued yelling, Mr. Clinton genially continued talking, and the crowd booed to drown the man out.

But after several moments, Mr. Clinton turned to the man and asked, “We got it. Will you please quit now?” The man was soon escorted from the stage.

The former president turned back to the crowd and said, “At least that guy is for something. He didn’t come here to bad mouth anybody.”",0.80005330964216359
UPDATE 1-UK rate rise not a certainty says BoE's Carney - Mail,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/cyclicalconsumergoodsNews/~3/0UZ2A8InMTE/britain-boe-carney-idUSL8N12O0OX20151024,reuters,"(Adds background)
LONDON Oct 24 (Reuters) - An increase in Britain's
rock-bottom interest rates is not guaranteed although households
should prepare for higher borrowing costs, Bank of England
Governor Mark Carney said in comments published on Saturday.
""If we think there is a prospect, a possibility - that's a
possibility not a certainty - of rate rises, then that is far,
far better to let the British people know so they can prepare,""
he said in an interview with the Mail on Sunday newspaper.
""If events mean that does not happen and rate rises are not
appropriate, then we will do the right thing and we will not
adjust rates,"" Carney was quoted as saying.
The Bank of England cut interest rates to a record low of
0.5 percent in 2009 and has kept them there ever since, even as
Britain's economy recovered strongly over the past two years.
Carney has previously said that a decision about when to
raise rates would become clearer around the turn of the year.
Only one of the bank's nine policymakers has voted for a
hike and investors are not expecting a first BoE move until late
2016 or early 2017 due to China's economic slowdown, Britain's
near-zero inflation rate and the U.S. Federal Reserve's cautious
approach about raising rates.
Carney said in the interview that the Bank expected that
when rates do go up, the path would be ""gentle,"" echoing his
previous guidance on what is likely to happen to borrowing costs
as Britain recovers from the financial crisis.
He also said the bank was ""focused not on loosening monetary
policy, but on raising interest rates and deciding the right
time and place to do that.""
Carney defended recent speeches he has made on risks to the
financial sector from climate change and on the benefits and
risks to Britain's economy from its membership in the European
Union, a sensitive political issue before a referendum on
Britain's EU membership which is due before the end of 2017.
""Speaking as a central bank, it is very likely that Europe
has advantaged the dynamism of this economy. In fact, it is
without question,"" he said, reiterating comments he made earlier
this week.
""We have to say something,"" Carney said, adding that he was
due to address lawmakers on Britain's EU membership. ""The
British people would expect me to have something to say.""

DES MOINES -- Hillary Clinton often says she has learned from the mistakes of 2008 -- and perhaps her biggest test will come tonight at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner, the high-stakes event that launched President Barack Obama’s campaign into the stratosphere eight years ago.
Clinton rallied her supporters with a shouted “We are geared up and ready to go!” at a rally here Saturday afternoon -- at a parking-lot pep rally featuring her husband and pop star Katy Perry. That phrase echoed Obama’s “Fired up! Ready to go!” call-and-response chant that tore through the room then -- and shocked a less organized, less fired-up Clinton campaign that was based on experience and competence.
Story Continued Below
On Saturday, the sting of the 2008 J-J Dinner -- and Clinton’s determination to capture some of the energy that became a feature of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ insurgency -- was at the forefront of the campaign’s planning. Hours before the dinner, the campaign announced an endorsement from David Plouffe, Obama’s 2008 campaign manager. “To be honest, during the most intense days of the 2008 primary, I would never have imagined writing this,” Plouffe wrote. “And I doubt Team Clinton felt any differently about me … She’s the right person to protect President Obama’s legacy on health care and so much else.”
The campaign also seemed to have learned its lesson about being out-organized. More than 100 volunteers and staffers, at points joined by campaign manager Robby Mook, started marching in the streets of downtown Des Moines before 7 a.m. on a chilly fall Saturday. The campaign headquarters in Des Moines was filled by the afternoon with hundreds of volunteers attending a training session, dressed in royal-blue T-shirts that read “I’m Fighting for Her.” The campaign also brought out the big dog for his first official appearance on the trail: Former President Bill Clinton gave a 15-minute speech Saturday afternoon, appearing to relish being back on the campaign trail and in the spotlight.
""The American people in the last six weeks have learned a lot about Hillary — what she’s for, why she’s running, and what kind of president she’d be,"" he told a large crowd that had lined up and waited for an hour-and-a-half for a short set performed by Perry. ""If they watched 'Saturday Night Live,' they know she’s a pretty good bartender, too.""

The dinner also marks a critical moment for Sanders, who needs to show he can maintain the enthusiasm that buoyed him all summer even as Clinton grows in strength after the one-two punch of her debate performance and her testimony Thursday in front of the House Benghazi Committee. At Clinton’s rally, a single-engine plane flying a banner “Revolution Starts Now: FEEL THE BERN,” flew over the modest stage set up in front of the Hy-Vee Hall, a sign of the challenge Clinton still faces, even as she benefits from the boost of a ten-day winning streak.
Sanders’ campaign also planned a rally before the dinner, with alumni of the band Guster getting the crowd amped up. “Our allotted 1,950 seats will all be full,” said Robert Becker, Iowa State director for the Sanders campaign. “Bernie will address the rally, and then we’ll march across the Des Moines River. We’re going to be a diverse and rowdy bunch.”

UPDATE 1-UK rate rise not a certainty says BoE's Carney - Mail,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/financialsNews/~3/WBRVtyHQ9mY/story01.htm,reuters,"(Adds background)
LONDON Oct 24 (Reuters) - An increase in Britain's
rock-bottom interest rates is not guaranteed although households
should prepare for higher borrowing costs, Bank of England
Governor Mark Carney said in comments published on Saturday.
""If we think there is a prospect, a possibility - that's a
possibility not a certainty - of rate rises, then that is far,
far better to let the British people know so they can prepare,""
he said in an interview with the Mail on Sunday newspaper.
""If events mean that does not happen and rate rises are not
appropriate, then we will do the right thing and we will not
adjust rates,"" Carney was quoted as saying.
The Bank of England cut interest rates to a record low of
0.5 percent in 2009 and has kept them there ever since, even as
Britain's economy recovered strongly over the past two years.
Carney has previously said that a decision about when to
raise rates would become clearer around the turn of the year.
Only one of the bank's nine policymakers has voted for a
hike and investors are not expecting a first BoE move until late
2016 or early 2017 due to China's economic slowdown, Britain's
near-zero inflation rate and the U.S. Federal Reserve's cautious
approach about raising rates.
Carney said in the interview that the Bank expected that
when rates do go up, the path would be ""gentle,"" echoing his
previous guidance on what is likely to happen to borrowing costs
as Britain recovers from the financial crisis.
He also said the bank was ""focused not on loosening monetary
policy, but on raising interest rates and deciding the right
time and place to do that.""
Carney defended recent speeches he has made on risks to the
financial sector from climate change and on the benefits and
risks to Britain's economy from its membership in the European
Union, a sensitive political issue before a referendum on
Britain's EU membership which is due before the end of 2017.
""Speaking as a central bank, it is very likely that Europe
has advantaged the dynamism of this economy. In fact, it is
without question,"" he said, reiterating comments he made earlier
this week.
""We have to say something,"" Carney said, adding that he was
due to address lawmakers on Britain's EU membership. ""The
British people would expect me to have something to say.""

Bill Clinton stumps for Hillary in first 2016 campaign trail appearance,http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/24/politics/jefferson-jackson-dinner-bill-clinton/index.html,cnn,"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN)The explainer-in-chief is back.
Bill Clinton made his first public campaign trail appearance for his wife's 2016 campaign on Saturday, spelling out why she is ready for the White House.
The former president, rallying Hillary Clinton supporters before Iowa's big annual Democratic dinner, and acting as a warm-up act for pop diva Katy Perry, made an argument that the stakes in the party nominating race and the general election were simple but profound.
He said that as president, his wife would stop bad things happening in national security, make more good things happen at home and abroad and secure and broaden the economic recovery forged by President Barack Obama.
""The American people in the last six weeks have learned a lot about lot about Hillary, what she is for, why she is running and what kind of president she would be,"" Clinton said in an open-air rally here.
The Clinton campaign is trying to build on a streak of good fortune which has helped revive the former secretary of state's White House bid after a tough summer which was dominated by the controversy over her private email server and the surge by her Democratic Party rival Bernie Sanders.
Bill Clinton praised Obama's legacy of restoring growth and job creation after the Great Recession that struck just before he took office, and said only a Democrat could deliver increased personal incomes and job security.
""I believe that progress has been made, but there is more that needs to be done,"" he said.
And Clinton argued that the next president could get to make between one and three appointments to the Supreme Court, potentially with the chance to shape U.S. politics and public life for decades to come.
He said that his wife's marathon 11-hour testimony over the Benghazi attack on Capitol Hill Thursday had reminded many people why she had the skills needed to be president. He also argued that his wife was the most electable and qualified person in the race to actually serve as president -- perhaps in a veiled swipe at the self-declared ""democratic socialist"" Sanders.
""When you elect a president you have got to say, 'Who is the person I think is most likely to keep big, bad things from happening and to make more good things happen?'"" Clinton said. ""I don't think it is a terribly close question.""
It was the kind of reasoned argument that Clinton had deployed to help give definition to Obama's re-election campaign in 2012, when he was credited with laying out the stakes in a more methodical way than the President himself. Grateful for Clinton's performances at the Democratic National Convention and on the campaign trail, Obama dubbed the 42nd president the ""explainer-in-chief,"" or the ""Secretary of Explaining Stuff.""
Clinton, who served as president from 1993 to 2001, also ended with a tongue-in-cheek reference to his wife's historic potential as the first woman president.
""There has been a lot of talk about breaking the glass ceiling,"" Clinton said. ""I am tired of the stranglehold that women have had on the job of presidential spouse.""

Hillary Clinton borrows a page from Obama's 2008 playbook,http://www.latimes.com/la-na-democratic-candidates-iowa-dinner-20151024-story.html,latimes,"Making his first prominent appearance of his wife's campaign in the early-voting state of Iowa, Bill Clinton came with a simple message Saturday.
“Thank you for coming,” he told a crowd of a few hundred supporters at an outdoor rally before state Democrats’ biggest event of the 2016 election -- a key early taste of how well the candidates are doing here.
At times in Hillary Rodham Clinton’s second run for the presidency, it has seemed her team is conspicuously working to correct the mistakes of the first. In the case of its mobilization efforts in Iowa, the campaign is not bashful about saying so.

The Clinton campaign sought to use the event, the Iowa Democratic Party’s Jefferson-Jackson Dinner, as a showcase for the granular political organizing efforts -- both here and throughout the country -- that the Obama campaign mastered eight years ago. Those efforts were an integral part of how Obama wrested the nomination away from Clinton, the early front-runner for the Democratic nomination that year.

The hearing provided an extraordinary spectacle, starting in...
Hundreds more campaign volunteers who will take leadership roles as precinct captains across the state spent the day at the Clinton campaign’s state headquarters for a boot camp, which included a pep talk from campaign manager Robby Mook.
Clinton's team also recognized the importance of even more symbolic efforts at the dinner, which has become something of a political carnival in the years leading up to the caucus. More than 100 supporters scattered across the heart of Des Moines, Iowa's largest city, early Saturday in a show of force. Other volunteers prepped for the all-important “sign war” that takes place around and inside the HyVee Hall, where the dinner is served. Campaigns compete to paper the area with signs of support, a small achievement that nonetheless is an early barometer of volunteer strength.
Since Hillary Rodham Clinton announced her bid for the White House, she has steadily slipped from inevitable nominee to flawed and vulnerable front-runner amid campaign mishaps and voters' Clinton fatigue – and her rivals anticipated that it all would accelerate in recent days.

Since Hillary Rodham Clinton announced her bid for the White House, she has steadily slipped from inevitable nominee to flawed and vulnerable front-runner amid campaign mishaps and voters' Clinton fatigue – and her rivals anticipated that it all would accelerate in recent days.
But in yet another...
To ensure it would draw a substantial number of supporters, the campaign brought in two of its biggest weapons -- pop star Katy Perry and former President Bill Clinton -- for its pre-dinner rally.
That’s not to say there weren’t signs of the obstacles that remain in Hillary Clinton's pursuit of the nomination. One hovered overhead on Saturday -- a banner in support of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton's main rival for the nomination, being flown in circles above downtown Des Moines.
But Clinton's team hoped at least to prevent the same kind of breakout performance from Sanders on Saturday that Obama had eight years ago at the event.
“The J-J was the moment everything clicked for us in Iowa,"" said Tommy Vietor, a veteran of the Obama team in Iowa that year. ""But that was the result of a lot of work.""

Preparations for the dinner began months in advance, planning almost a guerrilla-style campaign -- with diagrams of the arena to ensure the campaign had the best strategic positions to put up signs, and working to garner a huge turnout of supporters and choreograph their cheers.
“When you describe it, it sounds like this silly thing that campaigns do. But actually it makes you think 400 moves ahead,” he said. “It got the people involved -- our organizers -- so hyped for the event that it was like you were playing in a political Super Bowl.”
In the end, Vietor said, the performance showed that the Obama effort “was for real.”
Another Obama veteran, Mitch Stewart, recalled on Twitter how a colleague said to him after: “I think we just won the caucuses.” For Stewart, the observation prompted a nervous bout of nausea.

Bill Clinton rallies for wife; Sanders on the march,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-10-24-US--DEM%202016-Iowa/id-647a092ce226458f96b93869b25c2520,ap," (AP) â Hillary Rodham Clinton turned to her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and pop singer Katy Perry to energize her campaign's faithful Saturday before a pivotal dinner with thousands of Iowa Democrats.
Her chief Democratic presidential rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, rallied thousands of cheering supporters before marching across a bridge spanning the Des Moines River, telling them: ""This country belongs to all of us, not just wealthy campaign donors.""
One hundred days remain before Iowa's leadoff presidential caucuses, and the afternoon events were designed to generate enthusiasm before the state Democratic party's annual Jefferson-Jackson fundraising dinner.
""She's my firework,"" Perry told Clinton's supporters, wearing a white strapless gown adorned with a Clinton campaign logo and a flowing American flag cape at a free concert.
Bill Clinton told the rally that during the last few weeks the nation has ""learned a lot about Hillary, what she's for, why she's running and what kind of president she would be."" With tongue in cheek, he complained that he was tired of women having a ""stranglehold"" on the position of first spouse and hoped to break that White House gender barrier.
More than 6,000 activists were expected at the dinner, which traditionally serves as a kickoff to the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses.
Clinton and Sanders sit atop a Democratic presidential field that has effectively pared down to a two-person race for the nomination after Vice President Joe Biden announced this week he would not seek the White House.
Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley hoped for a breakout performance at the dinner, which catapulted President Barack Obama in the fall of 2007 and led to his surprising victory in the caucuses.
In the hours before the fundraiser, Iowa's capitol city was full of pageantry as supporters of the three campaigns poured into Des Moines wearing T-shirts and waving signs. Some Clinton enthusiasts painted their cars to show support for the former secretary of state, and her team dispatched young loyalists along street corners to wave signs at passing cars.
Bill Clinton headlined his first campaign rally at the pre-dinner concert featuring Perry, a Clinton backer whose hit song, ""Roar,"" is an anthem at Hillary Clinton events. The former president has raised money for his wife's campaign, but the rally was his first big splash during the race.
Perry got into the act much earlier, recording a wake-up phone message for Clinton's organizers. ""Wake-y Wake-y eggs and bakey. It's Katy Perry here,"" the pop singer said in the call. ""I know it's early, but you know what they say, the early bird gets the votes."" At the free concert, she performed her hits ""Roar,"" and ""Firework,"" along with a rendition of ""America the Beautiful.""
The dinner caps a key stretch for Hillary Clinton, who received a boost from Biden's decision not to run on Wednesday and then put together a grinding, competent appearance on Thursday before a Republican-led congressional committee probing the deadly 2012 attacks on diplomatic outposts in Benghazi, Libya.
Two lesser-known rivals, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee, abandoned the race following Clinton's strong performance on Oct. 13 in the first primary debate.
The dinner, called the ""J-J,"" is an important showcase for Sanders, a Vermont independent who has drawn large crowds with his calls for a ""political revolution"" to address the gap between the wealthy and the poor.
Clinton placed third in Iowa in 2008 and has since vowed to build a formidable organization to power her to victory here. She has sought to present herself as the heir to Obama's legacy, while Sanders offers an anti-establishment message and often notes the large numbers of Democrats who stayed home in the 2014 midterm elections.
O'Malley, who has trailed Clinton and Sanders in polls by wide margins, is a member of a Celtic Irish band and broke out his guitar to perform a cover of Johnny Cash's song, ""I've Been Everywhere"" at a pre-dinner event on Saturday. The ex-governor has campaigned extensively in Iowa and knows the process firsthand: He got his start here as a young field organizer for Sen. Gary Hart's presidential campaign in 1984.
A recent Iowa poll by Bloomberg Politics and The Des Moines Register found Clinton with a slight lead in the state over Sanders, with the two candidates the choice of 9 in 10 voters. O'Malley was at 2 percent.

How did Bill Clinton try to rally a crowd of supporters on the eve of his wife’s big speech in Des Moines Saturday?
By talking about emails.
Story Continued Below
Discussing Hillary Clinton's 11-hour-marathon testimony in front of the House Benghazi committee Thursday, the former president told the crowd rallying for his wife, “we had the friends of our lifetime emailing me furiously saying they thought she was doing great,” he told the crowd that had been waiting an hour and a half for Katy Perry’s concert for Clinton. “To everyone of them, I wrote back, ‘I think I’ll vote for her.’”
The 42nd president, in a blue blazer and jeans, has always minimized his use of emails -- and all technology. In March, he said through a spokesman that he has only sent two email messages in his life, back when he was in the White House.
Clinton was in mid-campaign form, enjoying the spotlight during his first foray onto the campaign trail. 
""The American people in the last six weeks have learned a lot about Hillary — what she’s for, why she’s running, and what kind of president she’d be,"" he said. ""If they watched Saturday Night Live, they know she’s a pretty good bartender, too.""

Referring to the recent Democratic debate, he said, ""I was proud to be a Democrat because I watched five hours of the Republicans debate. [On our side] every disagreement they had was over an issue. that’s politics at its best. Nobody insulted anyone else. no one was out there to get people to stop thinking.""
About 15 minutes into his speech, some of the crowd cheered when he said he was almost finished. While Clinton was on stage, a plane flying a banner “Revolution Starts Now: FEEL THE BERN,” flew over the modest stage set up in front of the Hy-Vee Hall, a sign of the challenge she still faces in the face of the best stretch of her campaign.

Ben Carson: 'My energy levels are perfectly fine',http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/24/politics/ben-carson-donald-trump-energy/index.html,cnn,"Washington  (CNN)Ben Carson on Saturday dismissed attacks from Donald Trump in which he accused the retired neurosurgeon of not having enough ""energy"" to be president. 
""My energy levels are perfectly fine,"" Carson said in Iowa. ""As I've said many times, there have been many times where I've operated 12, 15, 20 hours, and that requires a lot of energy. Doesn't require a lot of jumping up and down and screaming, but it does require a lot of concentration."" 
His comments came the day after Trump told a rally in Miami that Carson has even less energy than Jeb Bush, who he has repeatedly called a ""low-energy"" candidate. 
""Ben Carson is super low energy, right? He's super low,"" Trump said. ""Super low energy. We need tremendous energy. We need tremendous energy."" 
Trump previously had warned Carson that he would start attacking him if he started passing him in the polls. Carson made progress against Trump this week, when two Iowa polls showed him topping the real estate mogul among Hawkeye State Republicans.
Trump delivered on his promise Friday, mocking Carson, who is known for being soft-spoken.
""Donald Trump falls to second place behind Ben Carson,"" Trump said, pretending to read a headline. ""We informed Ben, but he was sleeping.""
Then, at a rally in Jacksonville on Saturday, Trump expressed incredulity at Carson's rise.
""I don't know what the hell is going on there,"" he said. ""I don't get it!""
But Carson has said he will not parry with Trump.
""If he does attack me, I'll continue to talk about issues. I just really don't buy into the attack-your-fellow-Republicans thing. I'm just not going to do that,"" Carson said Friday on Bloomberg's ""With All Due Respect.""

He said Trump has generally been nice to him.
""My personal interactions with him have shown him to be a gentleman,"" Carson said. ""I think there's another element sometimes when he's on camera.""

Trump jabs at Bush in Florida: Not ready to be president,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-10-24-US--GOP%202016-Trump/id-f0c116c4d9f84e93a81a7c7ed4e30ab7,ap," (AP) â Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump mocked former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in his own state on Saturday, saying recent campaign cuts show he's not ready to be president.
""Here's a guy who wants to run our country, and he can't even run his own campaign. And you know what? He's cutting back big,"" Trump told a raucous crowd of thousands gathered along the riverfront of one of Florida's most conservative cities.
The comment came the day after the Bush campaign said it was cutting payroll by 40 percent by trimming staff and requiring an across the board pay cut for those remaining.
Trump said Bush, the son and brother for former presidents, is ""losing badly and embarrassing his family.""
""Bush has no money. He's cutting. He's meeting today with mommy and daddy and they're working on their campaign,"" Trump said.
He chastised Bush for paying his finance director more than $1 million and said that if campaign staffers were willing to work for lower pay, he should have made that deal when the campaign started.
""You don't wait till you're failing,"" he said.
By contrast, Trump said he's only spent about $2 million on his campaign and he's leading in polls.
""So, I've put up less money than anybody else and I'm No. 1,"" he said. ""Wouldn't it be better if we had a country that would spend the least and be No. 1? Think about it.""
The Bush campaign responded by saying people are getting tired of Trump.
""Donald Trump needs a new schtick. Launching absurd attacks at his opponents to distract from his lack of ideas and liberal record is beginning to wear thin with voters. Donald Trump is increasingly showing each day that he is not a serious enough person to be commander in chief and lead the world's most powerful military,"" Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said in an email.
If people are tiring of him, it didn't show Saturday. An overflow crowd gathered at a downtown open-air mall for his visit. Brandon Chance, 25, wore a T-shirt with an artistic rendition of Trump pointing that said ""Washington, D.C. â You're Fired."" Chance said one of the reasons he likes Trump is that he's never held political office and is paying for his own campaign.
""He's not relying on people to work him like a puppet,"" Chance said. ""Politicians just B.S. everybody. They feed everybody a line. Politicians just lie.""
Bush wasn't the only rival Trump targeted during a speech that lasted about an hour and 20 minutes. Florida's junior senator, Marco Rubio, and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson also took hits.
""You've got Rubio doing poorly, and he sweats like a dog,"" Trump said. ""You've got Carson. I don't know what the hell's going on there. I don't get it.""
It was the second straight day Trump campaigned in Florida, where he leads in recent polls â a point he took joy in letting the crowd know.
""Trump is No. 1. Rubio, waaaaay back,"" Trump said. ""You're talking about a guy who's sweating, now he's really sweating.""
He also said Rubio is disloyal because he is challenging Bush for the nomination after saying for years that Bush was his political mentor.
""Everybody said he'd never run. Even I thought, he'll never run because Bush was his mentor."" Trump said. ""Those two guys are fighting like crazy, and I'm laughing watching them fight.""

Trump hits rivals over super PACs days after group backing him disbands,http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/24/politics/donald-trump-super-pac-jeb-bush-marco-rubio/index.html,cnn,"Jake Tapper's full interview with Donald Trump will air Sunday at 9 a.m. ET on CNN's ""State of the Union.""
Jacksonville, Florida (CNN)Donald Trump on Saturday knocked his fellow presidential candidates for having super PACs backing their presidential bids, just two days after a super PAC backing him announced it was disbanding.
""A lot of PACs are crooked business,"" Trump said Saturday at a rally here in Jacksonville. ""Those PACs control the candidates. They totally control. (Ben) Carson is controlled by his PAC. (Jeb) Bush is controlled by his PAC. (Marco) Rubio is controlled by his PAC -- and he needs a lot of water.""
Most notably, Trump knocked Carson -- who overtook Trump as the front-runner in Iowa in two recent polls -- for his campaign ""in Iowa being run by a super PAC.""
RELATED: Trump slams Carson amid dipping poll numbers in Iowa
Since launching his campaign, Trump has repeatedly slammed the influence big-moneyed interests hold over politicians, but a super PAC set up to bolster his candidacy drew scrutiny in recent weeks for its ties to the campaign. The group announced Thursday it would shut down after the Trump campaign denied it ever gave the PAC its blessing.
And on Friday, the Trump campaign in a press release disavowed the ""nine unauthorized super PACs claiming to support him"" and called on other presidential campaigns to do the same.
Trump again on Saturday said he didn't know anything about the PACs that have been set up to boost his chances at winning the White House, and highlighted his independent status, once again claiming to be ""self-funding"" his campaign.
""So when they come to me and they say, 'Donald what are you doing?' I say, 'I don't care I got to do the right thing.' The only people I'm going to be working for is right out here,"" Trump said. ""I don't want anybody from PACs. I don't want any money.""
But while Trump continues to claim that he is self-funding his campaign, he has spent more of other people's money than his own since launching his campaign in June.
Trump spent $3.6 million from campaign contributions that supporters have sent in, while spending $1.9 million from his own pockets.
While Trump's website has a visible ""DONATE"" tab at the top of his webpage, Trump says that he does not solicit campaign contributions and has attributed the donations, which averaged in at $50, to a groundswell of grassroots support.

But even as he has disavowed outside efforts to boost his candidacy, an outside effort looking to help Trump capture the nomination showed its face on Saturday in Jacksonville -- not in the form of a shadowy organization, but in that of local millionaire Jimmy Indianos, who is self-funding a pro-Trump effort in Florida.
Indianos has not set up a formal organization, but pays 15 staffers out of his own pocket -- more staffers than the Trump campaign has in Iowa -- and at the Saturday rally, Indianos and his staff were out in full force, asking supporters to give their names and personal information and distributing free T-shirts as they push to register new voters who will support Trump in the Florida primary.
He set up his operation in May, before Trump even officially announced his candidacy and long before Trump put staff in Florida. The Trump campaign announced the hire of a Florida state director earlier this month.
""We got the mojo rolling right now. We got some momentum and it's working,"" Indianos told CNN.
He said he's been in touch with the campaign's new Florida state director Karen Giorno, who he said was ""pretty excited"" about his work, but wanted to make sure he was not collecting any money, which he is not.
RELATED: Trump sent prank care package to Rubio
""I'm a private citizen -- I think we still got that right ... We'll do anything to help 'em,"" Indianos said, but added that he would stop his operation if the campaign asked him. ""Hey, they tell me to stop, I'll save me a bunch of money and I'll just go back to making money.""
Giorno and the Trump campaign did not return a request for comment. And Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said he did not know anything about Indianos and his operation.
At the rally on Saturday, Trump repeatedly ignored questions about super PACs or his campaign finance reform plans.
Stumping here in Florida, Trump also knocked Bush and Rubio, the top two establishment candidates jostling with Trump for the nomination.
He knocked Bush for deciding Friday to downsize his campaign and slash salaries as he has struggled to remain in the top-tier of Republican candidates in national polls.
""Here is a guy who wants to run our country and he can't even run his own campaign,"" Trump said of Bush, the former Florida governor.
And as Trump has topped both Bush and Rubio in polls of Florida's GOP voters, Trump again used a common attack against the Florida senator.
""Talk about a guy who's sweating,"" Trump said. ""Now he's really sweating!""

First Draft: Jeb Bush Expresses Despair About Toxic Tone of Campaign,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/10/24/jeb-bush-expresses-despair-about-toxic-tone-of-campaign/,nyt,"A day after his campaign slashed staff and salaries to retrench ahead of the Iowa caucuses, Jeb Bush decried the toxic tone of the presidential race and suggesting that “demonizing” people isn’t what he signed up for in this campaign. 

Mr. Bush made the remarks at a town hall in South Carolina, where, according to a report by CNN, he seemed fired up about taking on the person who has overshadowed him during the campaign, Donald J. Trump, who is leading most Republican polls so far. 

“If this election is about how we’re going to fight to get nothing done,” Mr. Bush said, then “I don’t want any part of it. I don’t want to be elected president to sit around and see gridlock just become so dominant that people literally are in decline in their lives. That is not my motivation.”

He added, “I’ve got a lot of really cool things I could do other than sit around, being miserable, listening to people demonize me and me feeling compelled to demonize them. That is a joke. Elect Trump if you want that.”

The rise of Mr. Trump in the Republican contest has confounded Mr. Bush, his family, and his supporters, who had built a battleship-sized campaign operation that was theoretically geared toward a general election. 

Earlier, before the town hall, Mr. Bush told reporters he was not focusing his energy on Mr. Trump. 

“I’m past Donald Trump,” Mr. Bush said.

Top Obama backer says he'll support Clinton,http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/24/politics/david-plouffe-clinton-endorsement/index.html,cnn,"Washington (CNN)Seeming to let bygones be bygones, President Barack Obama's top 2008 campaign strategist threw his enthusiastic backing behind Hillary Clinton Saturday, saying she was best positioned to carry Obama's legacy.
David Plouffe -- who during a drawn-out Democratic primary battle in 2008 deemed Clinton ""one of the most secretive politicians in America"" -- wrote in an online posting that over the years he's come to respect Clinton's tenacity.
""Here's what I, and so many of my fellow Obama campaign veterans, have learned about Hillary: She doesn't quit. And there were times I wish she had!"" Plouffe wrote on Medium. ""But you have to deeply admire that strength and persistence.""
He said in the post that seven years ago, he ""would never have imagined writing this piece."" But as the icy relations thawed between Obama and Clinton, he said it became clear that Clinton was the Democratic Party's best bet at keeping control of the White House.
""Americans still need a president who will wake up every day, prepared to overcome any obstacle on their behalf,"" he wrote. ""Hillary Clinton should  --  and I believe will  -- be that president.""
With the exception of a few cabinet officials, top names in Obama's orbit have resisted backing a candidate in the Democratic primary, waiting instead until Vice President Joe Biden made his political aspirations known. He said this week he would not enter the race.
The decision prompted signs of relief from some of Obama's top aides, who see Clinton as the candidate most likely to capture the Democratic nomination and defeat a Republican rival. 
Even in public, the White House was more ebullient about Clinton this week than in weeks past, when the focus was on Biden.
On the day Clinton was testifying before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, spokesman Eric Schultz said watching her he was ""reminded of why President Obama chose Hillary Clinton to be his secretary of state in the first place.""
""This is someone who clearly cares deeply about the issues, someone who has worked tirelessly to strengthen our relationships with our partners around the world,"" he said.
In his online posting Saturday, Plouffe, who served in the Obama administration's first term as a senior adviser before becoming a top official at Uber, laid out the stakes of the upcoming vote. He produced a list of potential Republican rivals that notably excluded Jeb Bush, whose campaign has slumped in the polls recently.
""The difference between Hillary Clinton and a President Trump, Carson, or Rubio could not be more profound,"" Plouffe wrote. ""Once again, we need a leader who understands the challenges we face  -- and someone who can and will do something about it. Hillary is that leader, for this time.""

"Bill Clinton, Katy Perry rallying Iowans for Hillary Clinton",http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-10-24-US--DEM%202016-Iowa/id-ecbbd50b7f1947ffa6ea40e58a09f123,ap," (AP) â Pulling out all the stops, Hillary Rodham Clinton was bringing her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and pop singer Katy Perry to Iowa on Saturday in a show of force before a pivotal dinner with thousands of Iowa Democrats.
Her chief rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, planned to rally his supporters before marching across a bridge spanning the Des Moines River. One hundred days remain before the state's leadoff presidential caucuses, and the afternoon events were designed to generate enthusiasm before the state Democratic party's annual Jefferson-Jackson fundraiser. More than 6,000 activists are expected to attend the event, which traditionally serves as a kickoff to the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses.
""If we win here in Iowa, and I think we've got a good chance to do it, and if we win in New Hampshire, and I think we have a good chance to do that, we have a road to victory,"" Sanders said Friday night at a ""#RockinTheBern"" concert in Davenport, Iowa.
Clinton and Sanders sit atop a Democratic presidential field that has effectively pared down to a two-person race for the nomination after Vice President Joe Biden announced this week he would not seek the White House.
Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is hoping for a breakout performance at the dinner, which catapulted President Barack Obama in the fall of 2007 and led to his surprising victory in the caucuses.
In the hours before the dinner, Iowa's capitol city was full of pageantry as supporters of the three campaigns poured into Des Moines wearing T-shirts and waving signs. Some Clinton enthusiasts painted their cars to show support for the former secretary of state, and her team dispatched young loyalists along street corners to wave signs at passing cars.
Bill Clinton was headlining his first campaign rally at the pre-dinner concert featuring Perry, a Clinton backer whose hit song, ""Roar,"" is an anthem at Hillary Clinton events. The former president has raised money for his wife's campaign, but the rally is his first big splash during the race.
""He's an enormous asset,"" said Clinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri.
The dinner caps a key stretch for Hillary Clinton, who received a boost from Biden's decision not to run on Wednesday and then put together a grinding, competent appearance on Thursday before a Republican-led congressional committee probing the deadly 2012 attacks on diplomatic outposts in Benghazi, Libya.
Two lesser-known rivals, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee, abandoned the race following Clinton's strong performance on Oct. 13 in the first primary debate.
The dinner, called the ""J-J,"" is an important showcase for Sanders, a Vermont independent who has drawn large crowds with his calls for a ""political revolution"" to address the gap between the wealthy and the poor.
Clinton placed third in Iowa in 2008 and has since vowed to build a formidable organization to power her to victory here. She has sought to present herself as the heir to Obama's legacy, while Sanders offers a more anti-establishment approach and often notes the large numbers of Democrats who stayed home in the 2014 midterm elections.
O'Malley, who has trailed Clinton and Sanders in polls by wide margins, is a member of a Celtic Irish band and plans to break out his guitar at pre-dinner events on Saturday. The ex-governor has campaigned extensively in Iowa and knows the process firsthand: He got his start here as a young field organizer for Sen. Gary Hart's presidential campaign in 1984.
A recent Iowa poll by Bloomberg Politics and The Des Moines Register found Clinton with a slight lead in the state over Sanders, with the two candidates the choice of 9 in 10 voters. O'Malley was at 2 percent.
""Bernie Sanders is still a threat,"" said Mo Elleithee, a former Clinton campaign aide who now leads the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service. ""He can still mobilize a significant portion of the Democratic base.""
But he said Clinton is getting stronger and ""more and more people who were nervous are feeling more comfortable with her.""

"Op-Ed Columnist: Rubio, the Unusual Front-Runner",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/opinion/sunday/rubio-the-unusual-front-runner.html,nyt,"FOUR years ago this week, I boldly predicted that Mitt Romney would inevitably be his party’s nominee.

It was admittedly not really the boldest of predictions. But at the time the press corps was obsessed with the revolving door of non-Romney “front-runners,” and many intelligent people were still convinced that Romney’s ideological deviations would cost him the nomination in the end.

They did not, and you could predict as much by using a very simple method: All of the other candidates were impossible to imagine as the party’s nominee, so by process of elimination, Romney it simply had to be.

2016 is very different: The G.O.P. candidates are stronger overall, there’s no one with Romney’s hammerlock on money and endorsements, and Donald Trump and Ben Carson have more staying power than Michele Bachmann or Herman Cain.

But you can still play a version of the elimination game this time around.

Play it with me. No major party has ever nominated a figure like Trump or Carson, and I don’t believe that the 2016 G.O.P. will be the first. Rand Paul’s libertarian moment came and went, Carly Fiorina seems like she’s running for a cabinet slot, John Kasich is too moderate (and ornery about it), Chris Christie has never recovered from the traffic cones. Scott Walker and Rick Perry are gone. Ted Cruz has the base’s love, but far too many leading party actors hate him. Bobby Jindal and Mike Huckabee are boxed out by Carson and Cruz; Rick Santorum, Lindsey Graham and George Pataki are boxed out by voter indifference.

That leaves Jeb! and Marco Rubio. But Jeb’s campaign has been one long flail. His favorable ratings are terrible, he and Trump topped a recent poll of Iowans that asked which candidate should drop out expeditiously, and as a Republican consultant pointed out for National Review this week, his candidacy looks like a pure creation of the super-rich: He has raised only three times as much from small-dollar donors as Lawrence Lessig, the good-government academic running a quixotic campaign against Hillary Clinton.

So that leaves Rubio. And unlike all the rest, it’s surpassingly easy to imagine the Florida senator as the nominee. He sits close to the party’s center ideologically, and his favorable ratings with Republicans are consistently strong. He’s an effective debater with a great personal story and an appealing style, and a more impressive policy portfolio than most of his rivals. He scares Democrats in the general election, and strikes the most politically-useful contrasts with She Who Has Always Been Inevitable. His past support for comprehensive immigration reform is a major liability, but Rubio has shown a lot more finesse on that issue than has Jeb, and one liability isn’t usually enough to doom a candidate who otherwise looks like a winner.

And that’s how Rubio looks right now. The betting markets have him as the most likely nominee, and — since this is quadrennial prediction time — I’ll say that I agree: I think he’s the real front-runner, and I predict that he will win.

But I make that prediction gingerly, not boldly, because Rubio is a very strange sort of front-runner. He has never led a national poll. He is not cleaning up endorsements, nor raking in the cash: His recent fund-raising totals were weak given his seemingly-enviable position. Nobody seems impressed with his early state organization. He’s earned a round of favorable coverage after each debate without making much progress overall.

It’s also easier to imagine him winning a national primary than it is to figure out which early state he’ll win: He’s a little too moderate for Iowa, a little too conservative for New Hampshire, perhaps not quite combative enough for South Carolina … and so he might end up in the Rudy Giuliani-esque position of banking on his native Florida.

It is possible to win a party’s nomination without winning the earliest states, if the candidates who do win seem unelectable: That’s how Bill Clinton won in 1992, and Rubio’s candidacy has certain obvious similarities to Clinton’s.

It’s also quite possible that there will be a consolidation of money and support around Rubio that enables him to eke out a narrow Iowa or New Hampshire win, in which case he could very easily run the table thereafter.

But the question people keep asking — I had a smart political reporter ask me just the other day — is why that consolidation isn’t happening already. If Rubio is actually the front-runner, shouldn’t a few more big donors be drifting from Jeb’s camp into his? Shouldn’t a few more debate-watching voters be saying to themselves, and then to pollsters: The Donald is fun and I admire Carson, but let’s get real: I’m going to vote Rubio?

I think they will. I predict they will.

But in the event they don’t, I’m guessing that Mitt Romney is still ready to serve.",0.99965422847019969
Runoff expected as Louisiana votes for governor,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/exvkXM3mcW0/story01.htm,reuters,"NEW ORLEANS Louisiana voters headed to the polls on Saturday to choose a successor to Governor Bobby Jindal, but experts and surveys suggest the race may go to a runoff after a faltering campaign by early favorite Republican U.S. Senator David Vitter.
The contest, dubbed a ""jungle primary"" with candidates from all parties on the same ballot, has generated little interest from the electorate, making it unlikely the primary vote will result in an outright victor, analysts said. 
If no candidate garners at least 50 percent of the vote on Saturday, the top two finishers will meet in a runoff on Nov. 21.
Vitter has mounted a front-runner's campaign, even as he dropped in the polls. The two-term U.S. senator, dogged by a 2007 prostitution scandal, participated in only two of eight gubernatorial debates and shunned the media.
Some polls in October showed Democrat John Bel Edwards, the minority leader in the state House, beating Vitter in a head-to-head match-up.
Even so, University of New Orleans political science professor Ed Chervenak said the Democrat would face an uphill battle to win the governorship in the deeply Republican state.
Light early-voting numbers have led most pollsters to forecast low overall turnout, which tends to favor Republicans in Louisiana. Chervenak said he had not noticed a strong effort by the Democrats to get out the vote in Orleans Parish, one of a few strongly Democratic areas of the state.
Edwards' campaign focused on his military service and time as a cadet at West Point. In speeches and campaign commercials, he vowed: ""I will never embarrass you.""
Vitter admitted in 2007 to ""a very serious sin"" after disclosures that his phone number had appeared on the list of clients of so-called ""D.C. Madam"" Deborah Jeane Palfrey's escort agency.
""The straight-arrow image (Edwards) has been able to project has been very effective,"" said G. Pearson Cross, a political science professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.
Two other Republicans have trailed in the polls. 
Scott Angelle serves in an elected post on the state's utility regulatory board. He formally switched parties from Democrat to Republican in 2010.
Known for his folksy charm, Lieutenant Governor Jay Dardenne has won statewide races three times, including two terms in his current post and a stint as secretary of state.
Jindal's approval rating plunged during the waning years of his second term, a factor that has likely depressed the enthusiasm for Republican candidates, Chervenak said. 
The outgoing governor is seeking the 2016 Republican nomination for the White House, but poll numbers for his candidacy have stagnated in the low single digits.

JOHANNESBURG (AP) Tokyo Sexwale (sesh-WAH'-lay), a South African businessman and former political prisoner who fought against apartheid, says he intends to be a candidate in the FIFA presidential election.
Sexwale announced his intention to run Saturday, two days ahead of the deadline for candidates to submit papers for the Feb. 26 emergency election to replace Sepp Blatter.
Four other men have already submitted their papers: UEFA President Michel Platini, whose chances appear to have been thwarted by an ethics investigation, Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, ex-FIFA official Jerome Champagne and David Nakhid of Trinidad and Tobago.

No talk of campaign troubles as Bush tears into Trump,http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/24/politics/jeb-bush-campaign-donald-trump/index.html,cnn,"Daniel Island, South Carolina (CNN)If Jeb Bush's campaign is struggling to stay afloat, he didn't show it on Saturday.
A day after slashing salaries and cutting campaign staff, the former Florida governor got an enthusiastic reception and delivered one of his strongest campaign performances to date. He tore into Donald Trump repeatedly and rousing some in the crowd to their feet on answers about the military and foreign policy.
Bush took part in a town hall series hosted by South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, drawing an audience of more than 500 people, about twice the number Bush normally attracts on the campaign trail.
Rep. Trey Gowdy, who led the daylong Benghazi hearing on Thursday, also headlined the event and joined Scott on stage to help ask questions.
Bush got one of his biggest responses from the crowd when he lamented the state of politics in Washington and argued that Trump is not the kind of leader that could break through the gridlock.
""If this election is about how we're going to fight to get nothing done, then ... I don't want any part of it,"" he said. ""I've got a lot of really cool things I could do other than sit around, being miserable, listening to people demonize me and me feeling compelled to demonize them. That is a joke. Elect Trump if you want that.""
Less than 24 hours before, Bush's campaign announced a major reshuffling of its resources, saying it was cutting some salaries by 40% and letting go of some people in order to shift more focus on the campaign's ground game in the early voting states.
It was a big move by Bush's campaign as he's fighting to regain the lead after rivals Trump and Ben Carson have held onto the top spots in the polls for weeks.
Speaking to reporters before the event, Bush assessed the changes as normal adjustments that campaigns need to make, citing the ""new phenomenon"" of ""the rise of candidates that have had no practical experience in politics"" as a reason for his decision. 
""In business, when you anticipate how things are going to be, you anticipate them, you don't wait for them,"" he said. 
As for the whisper campaign that he's falling apart, Bush was more frank.
""Blah blah blah, Blah,"" he said. ""That's my answer."" 
He went on to point to other candidates like Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton in 2008, who were expected to take their parties' nominations but failed in the end.
Pressed with questions about Trump, especially the real estate mogul's recent slipping in the polls in Iowa to Carson, Bush grew tired of talking about his rival. ""I'm past Donald Trump,"" he said.
But that certainly wasn't true in the town hall a few minutes later, when Bush repeatedly needled Trump, gaining applause and laugh lines for going after the candidate who's currently dominating the GOP field in South Carolina. According to a recent CNN/ORC poll, Trump came in first at 36%. Bush had 6%. 
""There's a lot of big personalities on the stage. A lot of them. One in particular,"" he said, before throwing his arms up to mock one of Trump's favorite words. ""Huge, huge, huge!""
On a more serious note, he blasted Trump for saying that he would send refugees back to Syria if he becomes president.
""If we don't stand for people that will die because of their faith, wow, we have really lost our way. I think Donald Trump is dead wrong on this, and I am right,"" Bush said, before adding that he's anticipating a Twitter attack from Trump now that he's said that.
It was Bush's second trip to South Carolina this month, a state that he has already predicted he'll win.""You can take it to the bank,"" he said during a stop here last month. He opened up his third office in the state recently and has eight paid staffers on the ground, with plans to add more. 
It's a state that was good to his brother's run for president in 2000 and shares a border with the state that Bush governed for eight years. 
The audience often broke out into cheers, whistling and occasionally some people stood up while applauding Bush's answers. When he first stepped on stage, a woman from the crowd yelled out: ""We love you, Jeb!"" She was followed by a man across the room: ""And your brother!""
""And my mother,"" Bush added. 
As he was shaking hands afterward, he was swarmed by voters, with many of them telling him to hang in there. 
""Don't give up,"" one voter pleaded with Bush. ""We are for you. Don't give up.""
Another told Bush that his weight loss -- he's dropped more than 40 pounds in the past year due to his the paleo diet -- was looking good on him. 
""I'm svelte,"" Bush replied, with a stride in his step. ""I'm a fighting machine.""

High stakes for Sanders ahead of major Iowa dinner,http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/24/politics/jefferson-jackson-dinner-democrats-iowa/index.html,cnn,"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN)They've hired staff, opened offices, signed up volunteers, canvassed across the state, and committed thousands of Iowans to caucus on February 1. And for Democratic presidential hopefuls, the first test of all of that grassroots support is Saturday in Des Moines at the Iowa Democratic Party's Jefferson-Jackson Dinner.
The dinner is a big pep rally dinner for Iowa Democrats, and this year, it's an important stop for the three remaining Democratic candidates looking to seal the deal with potential supporters 99 days ahead of the caucuses. 
The pressure is especially on for Bernie Sanders, who, in a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll out this week, is within just 7 points of Clinton in the Hawkeye State. 
Advisers within the Sanders campaign admit that this weekend, but more specifically Sanders' speech at the dinner, is a big moment for him as a candidate.
""We thought the debate was a turning point for him and the Internet and the campaign donations,"" said Sanders Iowa press secretary Lilia Chacon. ""So we hope the same thing happens again, that people exposed to his message will think of him as a viable candidate. But by the same token, we're running our own campaign and we've had so much enthusiasm and such a great vibe going, so much great momentum, that we're doing what we need to do and that's working great for us."" 

The event is traditionally held ""in the round,"" meaning that the candidates on stage will be surrounded by the audience. The candidates will give speeches in reverse alphabetical order: first Sanders, then Martin O'Malley, followed by Hillary Clinton. More than 6,000 people are expected to attend, with tickets ranging from $50 to $1,000. 
""The Jefferson-Jackson Dinner in Iowa is significant because Iowa's most active Democrats are in attendance. These are the people who make the phone calls, knock on the doors, and generate the enthusiasm for a candidate in their local community. Appealing to these activists with a strong Democratic vision for the future can help galvanize a campaign,"" longtime Democratic strategist Joe Shannahan told CNN. 
There are individual rallies for each candidate leading up to the dinner: President Bill Clinton and Katy Perry will hold a kick off rally for Hillary Clinton supporters Saturday afternoon. O'Malley will serenade his supporters at a meet-and-greet outside the venue. And Sanders is holding a march with supporters across a nearby bridge, in addition to seven dinner watch parties across the state, and held a Friday evening #RockinTheBern concert in eastern Iowa. 
The dinner and events surrounding it, Shannahan said, are ""an early test of organizational strength for each campaign."" 
The 2007 dinner was seen by many in the political establishment as a turning point in then-Senator Barack Obama's campaign, catapulting him to an Iowa caucus victory a few months later. 
Following last week's debate, Vice President Joe Biden's decision to not enter the race, and a strong performance at the Benghazi hearing, Clinton has had a good week, with strong national poll numbers to boot. She's been widely praised for performances at other Iowa cattle calls, including the Wing Ding dinner in August and the Iowa Democratic Party Hall of Fame dinner in July. 
One thing to watch for: Sanders, who almost always speaks from behind a podium, could be challenged by the ""in the round"" style of the event. Aides have been trying to prepare Sanders for the ""performance"" element on the moment, especially for speaking in front of the crowd, but always caution that they always want to leave room to let Bernie be Bernie, and not overly coached.
""There's some debate at how he's going to react to it. The thing with him is he doesn't use a teleprompter. He knows this stuff. But he does kind of lean in his way and that is what has made him so easy to parody, but I don't know. He'll do his thing. He knows what his issues are, he knows how to communicate, and we'll see,"" Chacon said. 

Democratic activist and Iowa Starting Line blogger Pat Rynard, who worked for Clinton in 2008 but has not yet endorsed a candidate, said Sanders now needs to match the enthusiasm and excitement that his campaign has generated with the support of longtime activists and insiders who will be in attendance and can help him win in February. 
""The question is, does he vary his message at all? He's been doing very well with the message he's got. It's not conventional, but he's doing better than expected. He needs something a little different on Saturday to go that final distance in Iowa,"" Rynard said. 
The theme of revolution, a major one throughout the Sanders' campaign, will be one that the campaign doubles down on this weekend in Iowa, with events surrounding the dinner.
When Sanders takes the stage at the dinner, he will be walking out to Steve Earle's ""The Revolution Starts Now,"" according to campaign aides. New campaign signage will be revealed for this weekend's festivities, ""The Revolution Starts Now"" and ""The Revolution Starts Here"" (written over a picture of the state of Iowa).
Saturday's events will be key for cementing the support of those key activists. 
""After this weekend, it's going to be decision time for Iowa Democrats. Biden is out, there's no one to hold out for. The best activists will be here at the dinner to see the three candidates give one last big pitch, and then you will start seeing a lot of movement in Iowa as people decide who to back,"" Rynard said. 
Andy McGuire, the Iowa Democratic Party chair, said a successful Jefferson-Jackson Dinner performance will come down to who connects with the voters. 
""I won't predict what's going to happen, but many times, that night is a good time for really enthusiastic Democrats who really are the workers of our party, and they will look at these candidates and they will many times decide who they think should be the best person to lead this country,"" she said.

Race, Bush 41 Is Glad to Be Old",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/us/politics/watching-gop-race-bush-41-is-glad-to-be-old.html,nyt,"He has given up his “C.S.I.” reruns, consuming campaign coverage on Fox News — intently but fretfully — when he is perched in front of the television in his Houston home.

He reads three print newspapers daily, dials into briefings given by advisers to his son Jeb’s presidential campaign and stays up late to watch prime-time debates — after sitting through the so-called undercard, too.

Former President George Bush, who is frail and uses a wheelchair at 91, is straining to understand an election season that has, for his son and the Republican Party, lurched sharply and stunningly off script. And he is often bewildered by what he sees.

“I’m getting old,” he tells friends, appraising today’s politics, “at just the right time.”

These are confounding days for the Bush family and the network of advisers, donors and supporters who have helped sustain a political dynasty that began with the Senate victory by Prescott Bush, the older Mr. Bush’s father, in Connecticut 63 years ago. They have watched the rise of Donald J. Trump with alarm, and seen how Jeb Bush, the onetime Florida governor, has languished despite early advantages of political pedigree and campaign money.

On Friday, the Bush campaign said it was slashing staff salaries and positions after disappointing polls and lackluster debate performances, a recognition that a vast operation built when Mr. Bush was leading the pack early this year cannot be maintained.

No one, it seems, is more perplexed than the family patriarch by the race, and by what the Republican Party has become in its embrace of anti-establishment outsiders, especially the sometimes rude Mr. Trump.

In July, even after breaking a vertebra in a fall that left him hospitalized in Maine, the elder Mr. Bush was fuming at the news of the day: Mr. Trump had belittled Sen. John McCain of Arizona for being taken prisoner in Vietnam.

“I can’t understand how somebody could say that and still be taken seriously,” Mr. Bush said, according to his longtime spokesman, Jim McGrath, who had visited him.

This weekend, generations of Bush loyalists plan to descend on a Houston hotel for a gathering for Jeb Bush’s campaign that will feature both the 41st and 43rd presidents. Strategists are eager to reassure them and highlight the campaign’s relative organizational strength, fund-raising capacity and ability to endure a delegate battle that could last well into spring.

But those who have long been in the Bush family orbit are also being forced to reckon with a party that seems to be moving on from them.

“I have no feeling for the electorate anymore,” said John H. Sununu, the former New Hampshire governor who helped the elder Mr. Bush win the 1988 primary there and went on to serve as his White House chief of staff. “It is not responding the way it used to. Their priorities are so different that if I tried to analyze it I’d be making it up.”

Mr. Sununu, like many establishment-aligned Republicans, is especially mystified by Mr. Trump’s appeal. “He supports single-payer federal health care and he loves eminent domain, and the Tea Party hates both of those things,” he said. “So explain to me how people are voting on issues.”

Contempt for Mr. Trump runs deep in the clan. Two people interviewed, who are in direct communication with the elder Mr. Bush but requested anonymity to avoid betraying a confidence, said Mr. Trump had revived painful memories among the Bushes of another blunt populist who upended an election: H. Ross Perot. The family have long believed Mr. Perot’s third-party candidacy helped Bill Clinton capture the White House from Mr. Bush in 1992.

Jeb Bush’s brother Neil has also vented privately about how bad Mr. Trump is for the country, according to people who have spoken to him but did not want to be quoted revealing private conversations.

And their father has been highly irritated by Mr. Trump’s ridicule. The former reality TV star has in recent weeks taunted both former President George W. Bush and Jeb over the Sept 11 attacks.

“He is throwing shoes at the TV when his son gets attacked and insulted by our favorite candidate,” Jeb Bush joked, referring to his father and Mr. Trump, at a campaign stop in New Hampshire.

“They’re all challenged by what’s going on,” Andrew Card said about the Bush family, referring to the “roller-coaster ride” of a campaign.

But Mr. Card, who served key roles in both Bush administrations and was with members of the family last week for a Points of Light foundation celebration, said that though the current race had not gone as planned, it had been a boon for the first President Bush. “It’s keeping him young,” Mr. Card said.

Jeb Bush echoed that statement, calling the campaign rejuvenating for his father. And the elder Mr. Bush has long had a particular attachment to Jeb and his aspirations, once publicly weeping as he recalled his son’s grace in defeat during a 1994 run for governor.

Barbara Bush, 90, likes to tease her husband about how obsessive he has become about the election. She will often pick up a book or turn to her knitting as the former president absorbs the political chatter on cable television, while the two sit side by side in their Houston home’s graceful library. Still, she is doing her part: She has affixed a “Jeb!” sticker to her walker, and when people remark on it, she reaches into a stash of stickers she carries, During a brunch last year with Dave Carney, an old Bush hand from New Hampshire, she spent 20 minutes grilling him about her son’s prospects in this first primary state.Her husband has had to forgo some of his cherished activities. He can no longer jot the handwritten notes that were such a part of his identity for so long. His speech is now more labored and he cannot send many emails, but he still talks frequently on the phone with his candidate son, especially after major events like debates or speeches.

“He is not much in the advice business these days, but he is sure interested in what is going on,” Jeb Bush wrote in an email to The New York Times. “The only advice he gives is to go win. And that is what I intend to do.”

The former governor’s campaign has struggled amid steeper-than-expected competition for establishment-leaning Republican donors and an inability to harness the kind of passion powering rivals like Mr. Trump. His aides are now promising a wide-scale shift, with staffing levels at the campaign’s Miami headquarters reduced sharply. There have been pledges that the candidate will spend more time in front of voters in early states, particularly New Hampshire.

The Houston donor retreat is the second time this year that Bush supporters have gathered with the elder Bushes. Over the summer, the family’s Kennebunkport, Me, compound was the site of a similar event. Attendees there thought they would get only a glimpse at Mr. and Mrs. Bush, who spend the summer in Maine, at a reception in their seaside home. But then both showed up for a detailed political briefing held for the donors, receiving a standing ovation.

The couple are still particularly active. They joined more than 100,000 other fans attending the Alabama-Texas A&M football game last Saturday and then were out in Houston for five consecutive nights this week. They are expected to attend at least three events next month involving Mr. Bush’s library and foundation in College Station, Tex., including a forum dedicated to the release of Jon Meacham’s biography of the 41st president, the first major work on his life.

More is at stake in this race than Jeb Bush’s political career, Friends of the family say. The Bush name has been prominent in national politics for three decades, and a rejection of the younger son by the electorate, especially in the primary, could be deeply wounding to a family proud of its role in American history. 

But the Bushes do not talk much about losing. 

George W. Bush, who has become a regular on the fund-raising circuit for his younger brother, tells audiences that he and his father have developed a routine. The elder Bush asks his son, “When is the inauguration?” George W. Bush reminds him that it is January of 2017.

“I’ll be there,” the father replies",0.87417874695851183
IOWA UP FOR GRABS Trump targets 'low-energy' Carson after new poll,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/24/trailing-in-iowa-trump-now-battling-like-true-outsider/,fox,"

New polls show Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is trailing in first-voting state Iowa but his strategy so far appears unchanged -- touting his outsider status and attacking rivals like a scrappy up-and-comer.
Trump on Friday attacked primary rival Ben Carson, whom he described as “super low energy” but who leads him in Iowa, according to the polls.
“The press was going crazy,” Trump said at an event in Miami. “We have a ‘breaking story,’ Donald Trump has fallen to second place to Ben Carson. We informed Ben, but he was sleeping.”
The remark repeats a familiar Trump complaint that the news media doesn’t like him and included his signature tagline for political opponents whom he bashes, “But I think he’s a nice guy.”
The New York real estate mogul and first-time candidate still leads in national polls.
However, a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll released Friday shows Trump now trailing Carson by 9 percentage points. And a Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday shows him trailing Carson, a retired pediatric neurosurgeon and social conservative, by 8 percentage points among Republican voters.

“I have a feeling we’re doing much better in Iowa than the polls are showing,” Trump said on the Hugh Hewitt Show after the release of the Quinnipiac poll.
Trump also argued that he was “very, very surprised” by the poll numbers, considering the large and enthusiastic crowds he’s drawing in Iowa.
After continuously rising in the polls despite a series of controversial remarks, Trump is now in the unusual position of dropping and having what political and campaign reporters deem “a bad week.”
Jeb Bush, the GOP establishment candidate and once-presumptive party frontrunner, is also having a tough week.
Amid sluggish poll and fundraising numbers, the Bush campaign on Friday announced several reductions including payroll cuts of roughly 40 percent.
The Iowa primary is now about just three months away. The Quinnipiac poll has Bush tied for sixth place in Iowa with 5 percent of the vote.
Trump’s so-called bad week began in part with a story Sunday in The Washington Post about a super PAC with ties to his campaign, a problem considering his opposition to such groups, criticizes for having too much money and influence in elections.
On Thursday, he issued a statement calling for pro-Trump super PACs to disband and reiterating that his self-funded campaign, unlike others, will not be controlled by lobbyists, special interest groups and others, according to The Wall Street Journal.
“We don’t want super PACs,” Trump also said in Miami. “Close them up ideally, hopefully to give money back.”",0.99861085806440442

"Wisconsin GOP abolishes John Doe probes, seeks other changes",http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-10-24-US-Wisconsin-Republican-Power/id-dcf92eccd4cd48d7b35337e2e2d63397,ap," (AP) â Wisconsin Republicans are moving at breakneck speed to abolish secret investigations into political corruption such as one that haunted Gov. Scott Walker, do away with the state's unique nonpartisan elections board and legalize coordination between candidates and shadowy issue advocacy groups that don't disclose their donors.
The moves come after Republicans were angered by a secret investigation of Walker approved by the elections board that focused on coordination with conservative issue advocacy groups.
Republicans deny they're seeking retribution for the probe, which the state Supreme Court in July ended as unconstitutional. But Democrats and independent observers say the changes will transform the state's elections and regulatory process, making it more difficult to investigate politicians for wrongdoing in office.
""It's overreach. It's arrogance. It's the arrogance of power,"" said Jay Heck, director of the nonpartisan government watchdog group Common Cause in Wisconsin. ""These changes in the law benefit the people in power, and it just happens to be Republicans at this point. If Democrats had enacted this same agenda, it would benefit them.""
Walker and Republicans swept into power in 2010, taking control of Wisconsin's Legislature away from Democrats. Republicans increased their majorities in the Legislature after they redrew political boundary lines following the 2010 Census.
In 2011, Walker and Republican lawmakers joined to effectively end collective bargaining for state workers, a fight that led to protests as large as 100,000 people and forced Walker and 13 state senators into recall elections. Walker survived and used the national attention to launch his short-lived presidential bid this year.
For five years, legislative Republicans have passed nearly everything they have wanted over Democratic objections, including making Wisconsin a right-to-work state.
But their newest push has Democrats incensed. One bill would replace the nonpartisan elections board with one comprised of partisan appointees. A second would relax campaign finance restrictions. A third â just signed into law by Walker on Friday â ends a tool unique to Wisconsin known as the John Doe investigation.
""We have a party here going after one party rule forever with the laws that they're putting in place,"" said Democratic state Rep. Terese Berceau. ""They have redistricting. They're going to get rid of our watchdog. They're going to change state law regarding whether politicians can be investigated for wrongdoing. What more can they possibly do? There'll be something next week, I'm sure.""
Republicans defend the changes, saying they're about bringing Wisconsin law into line with recent court opinions and with how other states handle such matters. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos accused Democrats of having ""Walker derangement syndrome"" that blinds them to the need for some of the legislation.
The Government Accountability Board overseeing elections, campaign finance laws, ethics issues and lobbying was created in a nearly unanimous vote in 2007, after a scandal that ensnared legislative leaders from both parties in 2002.
Wisconsin is the only state with such a model, which features a board consisting of nonpartisan judges.
Republicans cite audits that show the board didn't check voter lists for felons casting ballots as required by law. They say emails from its staffers show a partisan bias. And they complain that the ballot designs and scheduling of recall elections favored Democrats.
It was the board's role in approving the John Doe investigation into Walker and the conservative groups that finally led to the proposal to do away with the board's director and remove the judges, replacing them with an equal number of Republican and Democratic appointees. Republicans say it is more honest and transparent than pretending that former judges have no bias.
A John Doe investigation is similar to a grand jury, but done before a judge. Witnesses can be compelled to testify and they, as well as prosecutors and defense attorneys, are prohibited from speaking publicly about anything related to the investigation.
Republicans say the probes can drag on for years, leaving those involved not knowing whether charges are coming and not able to speak about it.
While Walker's signature on Friday eliminated use of the tool to investigate political misconduct, including bribery, theft and campaign finance wrongdoing, it still can be used for some drug crimes and violent felonies. Walker also is generally supportive of the proposed changes to the election watchdog and campaign finance law.
Every other state is able to use the grand jury process to prosecute crimes and Wisconsin district attorneys can do the same, Assembly speaker Vos said.
But district attorneys who have used the John Doe process say it's more effective, more efficient and less expensive than grand jury proceedings.
Heck, of Common Cause, said doing away with the John Doe law and nonpartisan elections board will open the door to more corruption.
""I don't think any citizen views this other than just a self-serving agenda for politicians,"" he said. ""I think there's a bit of anger and concern about that.""

Argentines go to the polls on Sunday to elect a new president, after a dozen years of being led first by Nestor Kirchner and later by his widow, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. There are three candidates in the race: Daniel Scioli, governor of Buenos Aires province; the mayor of Buenos Aires city Mauricio Macri; and Congressman Sergio Massa. To secure victory in the first round, a candidate will need to win 45 percent of the vote or 40 percent with a lead of ten percentage points over the closest competitor. Polls show Scioli — who has been endorsed by outgoing President Kirchner — is poised for victory. The economy dominated the campaign. Inflation is around 25 percent and Argentina's currency reserves are dwindling. A major issue confronting the next president is whether to negotiate with hedge funds that own nearly $100 billion in bonds Argentina defaulted on in 2001. Kirchner, who is constitutionally prohibited from running for a third consecutive term, has refused to sit down with the so-called ""hold out creditors,"" which, in turn, locked the country out of global lending markets. According to the New York Times, Scolio is expected to seek an agreement with the funds, led by the firm Elliot Management. The Kirschners' long reign was marked not just by economic populism, but also social progressivism. In 2010, Argentina became the first South American nation to legalize gay marriage. And under Cristina Kirschner, the government expedited justice for the perpetrators of the country's so-called Dirty War, during which thousands of Argentinians were tortured and murdered. The crimes were committed during a military dictatorship which ruled Argentina from 1976-83. Earlier this year, Argentina was rocked by the death of special prosecutor Alberto Nisman, who was found shot in his apartment on January 18, 2015. He was poised to testify before Congress that President Kirchner had tried to cover up Iran's orchestration of the 1994 bombing of a Buenos Aires Jewish center that killed 85 people. Kirchner said she believed disgruntled spies she had fired had been involved in the murder.

Paul reassures supporters: 'I'm not getting out until people vote',http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/6Oo08IXbW0Q/,fox,"
Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul tied with establishment favorite Jeb Bush and surpassed former business executive Carly Fiorina in separate polls released this week. But he is still fielding questions about a potential departure from the Republican presidential field.
Appearing Saturday morning on CNN's ""Smerconish,"" the Kentucky senator was asked to respond to speculations that he may not survive until the earliest nominating contest on Feb. 1 in Iowa.
""We're not getting out until someone votes,"" Paul told host Michael Smerconish.
""In fact, we think our fortunes are actually improving,"" he added.

Mike Allen's must-read briefing on what's driving the day in Washington 
10/24/15 08:56 AM EDT
By Mike Allen (@mikeallen; mallen@politico.com) and Daniel Lippman (@dlippman; dlippman@politico.com)
Good Saturday morning. PLAYBOOK IN-BOX -- From a wise GOP operative: ""If our candidates (and the donors) are struggling to deal with being outraised [by] $10 million or so by primary opponents, they should buckle up for the general.""
Story Continued Below
DRIVING THE WEEKEND: Tonight’s Iowa Democratic Party Jefferson-Jackson Dinner, at Hy-Vee Hall in Des Moines – Des Moines Register’s Jason Noble: “Over and over, I’ve found, the JJ has been a major event and sometimes the critical turning point in the caucuses contest. As a political pageant and historical moment, the JJ probably hit its peak in 2007, when Barack Obama outshined Hillary Clinton and John Edwards just weeks before the 2008 caucuses. ...
“Seven presidential candidates attended the ’75 dinner, and the Register organized a straw poll of attendees to gauge their organizational strength. Jimmy Carter won with 256 votes – about 23 percent of those cast. That little poll was thrown together by a newspaper and conducted on an electorate of just 1,094 hardcore activists, but it was reported nationally and helped establish Carter as the Democratic frontrunner.” http://dmreg.co/1R3sEcB
**SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/1M75UbX
THE NARRATIVE: Dems up, GOP down – “GOP, Dems moving in opposite directions after a pivotal week,” by AP’s Steve Peoples and Lisa Lerer: “As Democrats showered a confident Clinton with ... praise, ... [t]he fresh evidence of Bush’s struggles ... darkened the clouds ... over the party’s field. Some Republicans have intensified calls for an organized campaign to take down ... Trump, fearing [he] is doing lasting damage to the GOP’s standing among women and minority voters — Hispanics in particular.’’ http://bit.ly/1GobeHd
--“Fundraising Favors Cruz,” by Laurence Brinton in National Review: “Cruz is the only candidate who has shown that he can extensively raise hard dollars from both large and small donors, ranking second in hard dollars to Carson and second in total dollars (including from Super PACs) to Jeb Bush. Cruz’s fundraising is almost evenly balanced between small and large donors.” http://bit.ly/1MfMdjT 
INSIDE THE CAMPAIGNS -- “Bush slashes costs as campaign gasps,” by Alex Isenstadt and Eli Stokols, with Marc Caputo and Ben White: “Starting on Nov. 1, the campaign will cut payroll costs by 40 percent, downsize its Miami headquarters by more than 50 percent, reduce travel costs by 20 percent and cut 45 percent of spending on things other than media and voter contact. Even if those moves ease financial pressures, ... they only reinforce the prevailing narrative about a candidate, not long ago viewed as a front-runner, in freefall.
“According to donors, some of whom called for Bush to rein in its spending, the campaign’s assurances about its organizational and financial advantages have worn thin; and the third-quarter financial report, filed last week, gave further definition to their growing concerns about the state of a big-spending campaign failing to deliver results. ... [One bundler:] ‘There’s a lot of frustration that a lot of money’s been spent and it hasn’t moved anything.’ ... 
“Bush’s team didn’t know the depths of its problems until it got to look at the other campaigns’ finance reports. The just-ended quarter — the first full period in which all the major candidates had announced and campaigned — set off alarms in Miami. ... [A Bush staffer]: ‘Suddenly Marco’s campaign had about as much money as we did, but it wasn’t as big.’
“This weekend, Bush goes to Houston for a weekend meeting with his father and brother, an event conceived as a reward — a pep rally of sorts — for major donors but one that now serves to further underline the campaign’s reliance on an old network of family funders ... 
“The anxiety inside Bush’s Miami headquarters was running high ... as staffers met with their bosses to discuss possible reassignments. As local reporters and photographers gathered outside the building, staffers were encouraged not to speak to the press when leaving and to remove their ID badges before walking out. ... During ... meetings with division directors, senior adviser Sally Bradshaw and [campaign manager Danny] Diaz, staffers were given the option of transferring to jobs in the early-voting states ... 
“After months of insisting that no one state is of critical importance to what was billed as a national campaign, it’s clear that New Hampshire is increasingly Bush’s top priority. ...
“Of all the GOP presidential candidates, Bush ... spent the most on early state ads ($9.8 million), consulting services ($2 million), charter-air service ($922,000), and payroll ($1.7 million) on the biggest staff (134) ... David Kochel, along with Bradshaw and Diaz, had already taken significant pay cuts earlier this summer.” http://politi.co/1PMTZBp

10/24/15 11:17 AM EDT
A private investigator working for Sen. David Vitter's gubernatorial campaign was arrested Friday and charged with illegally recording a conversation involving a local sheriff, throwing a last-minute wrench into Saturday's all-party primary as other campaigns pounced on the news.
Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand told the Baton Rouge Advocate he noticed a man acting strangely while he was having breakfast with several friends at a local coffee shop Friday morning. Normand confronted the man, who denied any wrongdoing, but Normand noticed the man had recording software open on a handheld device. Later, a member of the group took a photo of the man, prompting him to flee out of the restaurant and the breakfast group to give chase. Normand eventually called into sheriff's deputies to search for the man, identified as Robert J. Frenzel, and arrested him for criminal mischief.
Story Continued Below
Frenzel, 30, works for J.W. Bearden & Associates, a Dallas-based private investigation firm. Vitter's gubernatorial campaign has paid the firm more than $135,000 for ""legal services"" during the campaign. Normand told the paper there was probable cause to charge Frenzel with interception of communications. In Frenzel's car, police found documents on Jason Berry, a blogger who has been posting unsubstantiated reports about Vitter's relationship with prostitutes. On his recording device, they found Frenzel had recorded several minutes of the group's conversation.
In a statement to the Advocate, the Vitter campaign acknowledged Frenzel was working for them — but denied he was there to taping Normand and said he was focused on John Cummings, a prominent New Orleans-area attorney and backer of state Rep. John Bel Edwards, the major Democratic candidate in Saturday's primary. Normand, a Republican, is a backer of Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne in the governor's race.
""This person works for a firm that we hired to do research, all within the bounds of the law,"" Vitter spokesman Luke Bolar said. ""This includes John Bel Edwards' business associate and major donor, and his relationship with the John Bel Edwards campaign. It has nothing to do with Newell Normand.""
The arrest presents a last-gasp opportunity for two Republicans trailing Vitter in the contest to knock him out of the second runoff spot. Edwards, the lone Democrat, is thought to be guaranteed a spot in the runoff. Dardenne and Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle are chasing a wounded Vitter for the second runoff spot.

""So we know this about David Vitter. He's cheated, he's lied and now he's been caught spying,"" Dardenne says direct to the camera in a web ad his campaign shot late last night. ""We're no stranger to political corruption, but they usually wait until after they're elected to betray our trust. This time, it's on us. We now know the real David Vitter. And today is our chance to say, 'No, we've had enough. We're better than this.'""
""This is shocking and beyond troubling. It reeks of old-school politics,"" Angelle said in a statement. ""The questions about David Vitter continue and he refuses to provide any answers. This is yet another reason why Louisiana can't afford to elect David Vitter governor.""
Early voting in the state started two weeks ago, and it's unclear how much a late-breaking news story could change Saturday's outcome. 
Normand told the Advocate he was determined to get to the bottom of why Frenzel taped the conversation.
""What do I have to do with the governor’s race? Everybody knows I endorsed Jay Dardenne,"" Normand said. ""Everybody at that table is very upset with this. I didn’t know we had become the state of Russia.""

Paul Krugman Blog: Delusions of Failure,http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/24/delusions-of-failure/,nyt,"Sometimes you almost have to feel sorry for Mitt Romney. He has one great achievement in life: the Massachusetts health reform, which acted as a template for the Affordable Care Act. If he were a member of a sane political party, he’d be boasting about that record. But he wanted to be president, which meant having to accommodate himself to his party; and in Iowa, 81 percent of Republicans say that Ben Carson’s statement that Obamacare is the worst thing since slavery makes him more attractive as a candidate. So he has to trash the best thing he’s done.

Sometimes, it turns out, he can’t maintain the facade. The other day he took credit for setting the stage for Obamacare. Then he tried desperately to walk it back, claiming that Obamacare has failed — which is literally and figuratively the party line.

Which raises the question, if this is a failure, what would policy success look like?

Obamacare has led to a rapid drop in the number of uninsured, especially in states that have fully implemented its provisions. It hasn’t covered everyone, but it wasn’t expected to: it doesn’t cover undocumented immigrants, and the relative complexity of the program always meant that some eligible people would fall through the cracks. The original CBO estimates were that eventually 92 percent of non-elderly residents would have coverage, and in Medicaid expansion states we’re getting there.

Meanwhile, the whole thing has come in well below projected costs; insurance premiums will rise for 2016, but after two years of remarkably small rises that still leaves things cheaper than expected. And overall health care spending has come in far below expectations.

None of the other terrible things that were supposed to happen — job loss, destruction of full-time employment, a surge in the budget deficit — have happened either.

But to be a good Republican you have to insist that it has been a disaster. And Mitt Romney is therefore in the position of trashing his own life’s work. Sad. But he has nobody but himself to blame.",0.85331135394305935

As Democrats gain from the nation's growing diversity — attracting solid majorities among Hispanic and African American voters — Republicans are gaining among white, working-class voters, a group that was once a Democratic stronghold. Nowhere is this clearer than in West Virginia, where the president touched down this week to talk about drug addiction.

 How EPA Rules Would Hit Coal-Heavy West Virginia






A few hours before Air Force One was due to land in Charleston, an anti-Obama rally took shape outside the state capitol building. A dozen speakers, including local officials and state and federal office holders took turns attacking the president for environmental policies they say are killing the coal industry. ""We are going to win the war on coal. We have to stay strong, we have to stand together, and we absolutely have to get through the [2016] election,"" said Chris Hamilton of the state-funded West Virginia Coal Forum. About 75 people stand listening, some with signs. There was: ""Obama your change destroyed our hope."" And another that exclaims, ""Obama is not West Virginia's president!"" Today there are few places where Obama is less liked. For decades, though, Democrats could count on West Virginia voters in presidential contests, with only rare exceptions. But Bill Clinton is the last Democrat to carry the state, and in 2012 Obama received just 35 percent of the vote. Charlotte Kainser, who's married to a retired miner, holds a sign that says ""Coal Miners Matter."" She shakes her head at the state's worst-in-the-nation jobless rate. ""The economy's bad – bad, bad, bad,"" Kainser says. ""So why would you really want to come to West Virginia? Why would you want to live here?"" Young people are leaving the state in search of jobs, and the overall population is aging. Kainser says she's still a registered Democrat, but one who can't remember the last Democratic nominee she voted for. That's not uncommon. As for this year, she kind of likes Mike Huckabee — and Donald Trump. ""I vote for the best person,"" she says. ""When it comes down to the main election I would vote for Trump on top of Hillary Clinton,"" and probably over any of the Democrats, she adds. 






            In the past few presidential elections, Republicans have won the popular vote over Democrats in West Virginia.

A couple hours north is the campus of West Virginia University. Twenty-year-old Dakota Workman grew up in coal country and comes from a family of Democrats going back many generations. But when Workman registered to vote for the first time, he declared himself a Republican. ""My mom called my grandma and told her, 'You'll never believe your grandson just came home registered Republican.' And my grandma was like, 'Well, good job, I voted Republican since Bush's first election,' "" he says, even though she was registered as a Democrat. Workman, vice chair of the local College Republicans, is a perfect example of what has happened in the state. White, working-class Democrats are abandoning the party over environmental issues like coal, and on things like gun rights and abortion. There's been a similar shift among such voters nationally. Meanwhile, still loyal Democrats in the state, like Samantha Shimer, are frustrated by the turn of events. ""For West Virginia, I would say that I feel kind of rock bottom,"" says the West Virginia University sophomore. ""However, my views on the political shift in the country as a whole is it's shifting progressively."" That's good news nationally, she says, but she feels her home state is being left behind, using an analogy: ""West Virginia is one of those little speed bumps,"" she says. ""But that's the boat West Virginia is in right now."" The state may be a speed bump for progressive Democrats, but it's a rising stronghold for Republicans.

Hillary Clinton said Friday that threats to impeach her on the first day of her possible presidency are ""ridiculous."" 
""It's just laughable!"" Clinton told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow in an interview conducted a day after her 11-hour testimony before the House Benghazi Committee. ""It's so totally ridiculous.""
Story Continued Below
Clinton was referring to comments by Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), who told radio host Matt Murphy last week that on her first day as president, she'd face impeachment. 
""And in my judgment, with respect to Hillary Clinton, she will be a unique president if she is elected by the public next November, because the day she's sworn in is the day that she's subject to impeachment because she has committed high crimes and misdemeanors,"" Brooks said.
Clinton said statements like Brooks' are good politics for a certain part of the party's base.
""It perhaps is good politics with the — you know, the — the most intense, extreme part of their base. I guess that is, or otherwise why would they be doing it?"" She said. ""And I think we have to — you know, really try to build a — a larger base of our own that cuts across all kinds of geographic and and political gradations.""
As for Vice President Joe Biden, who announced this week that he would not run for president, Clinton said he is now ""liberated.""
""I am a huge Joe Biden admirer, friend, a former colleague, and I know this was an excruciating decision in a time of just such pain and grief for him and his family. He is liberated and I don’t think history is done with him,"" Clinton said. ""There is a lot for him and the president to keep doing in the next year and a half. And I want to build on the progress that they are leaving behind.""
Pressured by Maddow to explain the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy and the Defense of Marriage Act from her husband's administration, Clinton cast them as ""defensive action"" against would could have possibly been constitutional amendments or harsher policies against LGBT population.
""It was a defensive action. The culture rapidly changed so that now what was totally anathema to political forces, they have ceded. They no longer are fighting, except on a local level and a rear-guard action. And with the U.S. Supreme Court decision, it's settled,"" Clinton said.
Asked how she felt after Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the head of the Benghazi Committee, suggested that Thursday's hearing didn't reveal much new information, Clinton said she was commited to testifying.
""I said I would do it and I did it because if there is anything new — which is unlikely after the eight prior investigations that have been held —we should know about it because the point is: What are we going to do to both honor the people that we lost and try to make sure this doesn't happen again?"" Clinton said. ""We do want to have a good conversation where people come to the table ready to actually learn about what we can do. I'm afraid that's, you know, not necessarily what this particular committee is doing, but we have learned a lot from our previous investigations, and I'm certainly, you know, committed to doing all I can to make sure we do save lives.""
Clinton told Maddow that after the hearing, which ended at around 9 p.m. Thursday evening, she and her aides celebrated by retiring to her Whitehaven St. mansion.
""Well, I had my whole team come over to my house and we sat around eating Indian food and drinking wine and beer. That's what we did. It was great,"" she said.

The fate of Obamacare’s next enrollment push may be decided in places like Ben’s Chili Bowl.
The renowned D.C. eatery will serve up health insurance along with its half-smokes late at night as part of the drive to sign up many of the remaining uninsured — particularly the so-called young invincibles amid signs that Obamacare enrollment is trending older and sicker.
Story Continued Below
Recruiting younger, healthier people is a make-or-break issue as the health law’s third open enrollment season gets underway Nov. 1. While the administration is tempering expectations by projecting only modest sign-up growth, it is intent on recruiting healthier and therefore less-costly people in a bid to keep a lid on rising premiums and ensure the new insurance marketplaces thrive.
To that end, advocacy and community groups plan to make person-to-person pitches at hipster hangouts like Ben’s, not to mention at sports bars during college championships and at movie theaters for the openings of the new Star Wars and the next installment of The Hunger Games.
The economic and political stakes could not be higher. In several states, insurance premiums will rise by double digits this year, though most people eligible for Obamacare health plans receive federal subsidies (though not everyone understands they are eligible.) Many middle-class families make too much money to qualify for the federal tax breaks yet struggle to afford health insurance, leaving them vulnerable to potentially high medical bills from an emergency.
Some eye-popping rate hikes by dominant carriers have already sparked outrage from Republicans and concern from consumer advocates. BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee will raise individual rates by more than one-third, while the Blue plan in Minnesota will jump by nearly 50 percent.
But those examples could ultimately prove to be aberrations when everything shakes out. Three of the largest states — Florida, New York and California — will see average premium hikes of less than 10 percent for next year.
Polls show that affordability remains a major barrier even for people with Obamacare coverage. Forty-four percent of people surveyed by the nonpartisan Robert Wood Johnson Foundation described paying their premiums “difficult,” while a majority (56 percent) said they might consider dropping their insurance if the costs rose over the next few months.

Cristina Calvillo-Rivera, who manages outreach for Young Invincibles, a millennial-focused advocacy group, says her group will promote benefits like free preventive care and birth control for women.
“They want to know, ‘Why am I paying $50 to $100 a month for health insurance?’” she says. 
But the law’s critics remain skeptical that will make a difference.
“Why wouldn’t the uninsured jump on this? Because it is not a good value for the money,” says Chris Conover, a critic of the law and a research scholar at the Center for Health Policy & Inequalities Research at Duke University. “Only people with lowest income will get pulled in and enticed by the subsidies.”
For backers of the law, the politics of this enrollment season are more urgent than ever against the backdrop of a presidential campaign in which every Republican is vowing to repeal the law. The more people who benefit from Obamacare, the harder it becomes for Republicans to undo or weaken it, even if the GOP wins the White House. And Republicans on the campaign trail, as well as some in Congress are not backing down from their pledges to repeal the law.
The Democrats “know it will take us into bankruptcy if we don’t watch it, and they know the additional costs are just about to alight on people’s desks,” says Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.

In the face of that opposition, advocacy and community groups say they plan to work hard not just to reach the uninsured but to make sure the more than 9 million paying Obamacare customers re-up during the three-month open enrollment season.That includes Americans who will lose their insurance plans at the end of this year, thanks to the failure of nine co-ops. Other enrollees will contend with rising premiums, or changes in their income and are being urged to shop around for alternative plans. Critics argue that people may simply drop out of Obamacare rather than deal with the bureaucratic hassle of finding another plan.
""We’re getting really focused,” says Jodi Ray, project director of Florida Covering Kids and Families at the University of South Florida in Tampa, one of the many groups signing people up. “We’re not doing the cast-the-wide-net thing anymore.”
The administration and advocacy groups plan to concentrate their efforts this year in a handful of cities: Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Northern New Jersey, and Miami, which have large concentrations of people eligible for subsidized coverage
They’ll also lean on “theme weeks” to reach out to particular groups. The week of Nov. 16, for instance, has been designated LGBT and Native-American outreach week, says Calvillo-Rivera.
For Latinos, much of the outreach effort this year hinges on digital media, advertising, texting, and in-person service — a very targeted strategy that blends lessons learned from both political campaigns and marketing. In Austin, Texas, a not-for-profit called Insure Central Texas plans to do a bilingual phone bank and call the 12,000 individuals they’ve enrolled in Obamacare so far to ensure that they keep their coverage.
“The focus on renewal will be stronger this year,” says Rachelle Rubinow, with Community Catalyst, an advocacy group based in Boston that works with Latinos. “We’re promoting the benefits of coming back to the marketplace.”

Insure Central Texas’s data from the first enrollment season showed that only 12.6 percent of the people they originally enrolled in 2013 signed up for a second year of coverage. The messages about re-enrolling in insurance plans confused many people in Texas, says Elizabeth Colvin, director of Insure Central Texas. 
Her clients mixed up paperwork, or made mistakes on applications about re-verifying their income, leading to confusion and dropped coverage. Colvin expects the same amount of churn this year during open enrollment season. 
The National Health Alliance for Hispanic Health, with a $1.3 million grant, will take the notion of one-on-one help a little further this year by incorporating text messaging that allows Latinos to make sign-up appointments to get help enrolling.
The Obama administration has also made clear that it won’t be shy about pointing out that the penalty for not having insurance has risen for the second year. The hammer that began as $95 in 2014 will now be $695 for an individual, or 2.5 percent of household income, whichever is higher, in 2016. 
Research from Enroll America found that one-third of consumers who enrolled in Obamacare the first year did so because of the penalty.
“We need to make sure we’re very clear and explicit about that $695 penalty, so that people understand the choice that they’re making,” says Lori Lodes, communications director for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

Sen. David Vitter spent the summer on a glide path to becoming Louisiana's next governor. But even if Vitter earns a spot in the general election after Saturday's all-party primary, the Republican's ascension to the governor's mansion is in serious trouble.
Vitter is still blessed with the most financial backing of any of the candidates and near-universal name recognition in the state. But over the past few months, his approval ratings have slipped underwater after Vitter's opponents — including two fellow Republicans — have spent significant time and money rehashing Vitter's 2007 prostitution scandal. 
Story Continued Below
Most polls suggest that the lone Democrat, state Rep. John Bel Edwards, is a near-lock to qualify for the Nov. 21 runoff election. Vitter has consistently placed second, but the size of his lead over two fellow Republicans, Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne and Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle, has varied from double digits in some polls, to within the margin of error in others.
Edwards has thus far been content to stay out of the intra-GOP warfare that has dominated the race. Angelle escalated the rhetoric earlier this week during a televised debate, directing a statewide audience to a blog posting unsubstantiated allegations about Vitter and prostitutes. Vitter in 2007 admitted committing a ""serious sin"" after allegations linking him to a Washington brothel — but has avoided questions about the scandal since. Vitter campaign spokesman Luke Bolar called the allegations a ""story on a shady blog that’s been proven completely untrue.""
""There is a shadow that has been cast over Sen. Vitter, a shadow that if it continues, will follow Louisiana,"" Angelle said at the debate at Louisiana State University. ""When that follows Louisiana, it hurts our ability to create jobs. It hurts our ability to grow our economy. We can’t have a cavalier attitude about this.""
Dardenne also hasn't been afraid to reference the scandal. At a candidate forum in late August, Dardenne was asked what separated him from Vitter. His answer: ""I have not frequented prostitution, especially not on the floor of the U.S. Congress.""

Vitter, who has been criticized by his opponents for skipping debates, wasn't in attendance to respond directly to Angelle, but his campaign views the rocks thrown at him as a sign of strength.
""Our three opponents and five super PACs are all running the same campaign, spending millions against me, which tells us I’m leading in this race, and they know I will reform their good ol' boy style of politics,"" the senator said in a statement.
Angelle and Dardenne are using the scandal to make an explicit appeal to Republican voters: A vote for Vitter now will increase Democrats' chances of winning back the governor's mansion. Two anti-Vitter PACs, one funded by more than $1 million from a single Baton Rouge law firm, have also run ads directly attacking Vitter over the scandal. 
Dave Carney, a New Hampshire-based consultant working for Dardenne, hasn't been shy about posting the allegations on his Twitter account. He said Republicans in the state need to be warned about the risk of pitting Vitter head-to-head with Edwards.
""This is just a tease of what [the blogger] is going to release during the runoff,"" he said. ""And you'll have [Vitter] against John Bel Edwards, a pro-gun, pro-life, West Point Democrat.""
Cross, Angelle's campaign manager, agreed. ""David Vitter is a direct threat to Republicans holding the governorship,"" he said.
The senator's campaign has noted then-Democratic Rep. Charlie Melancon similarly tried to use the 2007 prostitution scandal against Vitter during their 2010 Senate race. Vitter won the contest, 57 percent to 38 percent.
Vitter apologized in 2007 for a ""serious sin in my past"" after his phone number was included in a list of client numbers kept by Deborah Jane Palfrey, known as the D.C. Madam. (Palfrey killed herself in 2008 shortly after her conviction on federal racketeering and money laundering charges.) Since then, other admitted prostitutes in the New Orleans area have stepped forward to claim they also had encounters with Vitter. 
Vitter rarely speaks to the media and has largely avoided questions about the scandal. At a debate earlier in the race, an attendee asked Vitter if he had ever violated the state's criminal code. 
""I've spoken about my past and how my family has dealt with that,"" Vitter said, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune. ""If that's not good enough for you, then that's not good enough. But it's good enough for Wendy [Vitter's wife].""
Wendy Vitter is also starring in a Vitter campaign ad. ""Do I think David Vitter has the courage and vision we need to turn Louisiana around?"" Wendy asks in the ad. ""I don't think it. I know it.""

The scandal hasn't slowed Vitter's career. He has served as both a gadfly — his relentless campaign to force congressional staffers onto Obamacare exchanges has aggravated members of both parties — and a bipartisan dealmaker with Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) on transportation funding and with Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) on chemical safety reform. Three GOP presidential hopefuls — former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz — have backed his gubernatorial bid.

                            Vitter's lead over the other Republicans running in the all-party primary has varied from double-digits in some polls to within the margin of error in others. | AP Photo
""I’ve had the pleasure of serving with David Vitter in the U.S. Senate, and he and I have fought side-by-side over and over again,"" Cruz wrote in an email to supporters this week. ""Together, we've led the fight against President Obama's unconstitutional amnesty, and together, we've led the fight to defund Planned Parenthood.""
Vitter's fundraising, boosted by Louisiana's plentiful oil and gas money, has consistently blown away his opponents. A month out from the election, Vitter and his super PAC, the Fund for Louisiana's Future, had $7.1 million on hand combined. The forces aligned against him, including the three major candidates, two super PACs boosting the other Republicans and two PACs set up explicitly to oppose him, had just $5.6 million in total.
That warchest has enabled a barrage of negative ads aimed at Dardenne and Angelle. The Vitter campaign has run ads claiming Dardenne ""even voted to stop illegals from coming to take our jobs."" Vitter's super PAC has dubbed the state's No. 2 official ""double-dipping Dardenne"" and accused him of using taxpayer money for Valentine's Day and birthday vacations to Europe. The same super PAC has also run spots linking Angelle to a deadly sinkhole and accused both men of abusing privileges given to government employees. A Vitter campaign spot also claims Angelle ""has a lot in common with Obama"" and cites Breitbart.com to claim Angelle expanded the ""Obamaphone"" program.
Angelle and Dardenne dismiss the charges. The so-called ""Obamaphone"" program actually began under Ronald Reagan, Angelle's campaign notes. Dardenne says he took his wife to Europe, but she paid her own way, and his campaign argues they played a key role in boosting tourism. Many pro-business Republicans voted with Dardenne on the immigration bill Vitter cites.

The normally mild-mannered and moderate Dardenne is clearly bothered by the attacks. In his final ad of the contest, he speaks directly to the camera and accuses Vitter of orchestrating a ""second Louisiana purchase,"" using out-of-state campaign money. In Angelle's closing-argument TV ad, he ends with a declaration that he will ""never embarrass you"" and calls himself the state's ""trusted conservative."" 
But his image has steadily eroded over the course of the campaign. A automated Harper Polling survey of Louisiana voters conducted last week found 56 percent had a negative image of Vitter, while only 36 percent viewed him favorably. By contrast, 61 percent of voters had a favorable opinion of Edwards, and 29 percent viewed him unfavorably.
Even in the weeks leading up to the primary, Republicans were concerned what had been an almost-certain hold for the GOP was in danger. The Republican Governors Association has been running television ads for the past two weeks attacking Edwards, hoping to soften him up before the runoff. The Democratic Governors Association is still debating whether or not to invest in the state.
Polls show a surprise second-place finish from either Dardenne or Angelle would boost Republicans' chances in the runoff. But Bradley Beychok, who managed Melancon's failed bid against Vitter five years ago, thinks neither Republican has been direct enough to sink Vitter in an open primary — despite the increasingly explicit references to Vitter's past.
""This is Godzilla. To slay Godzilla, you got to go directly at him,"" Beychok said. ""You can't slay a dragon by chopping at his feet.""

Make America Great Again. It's Donald Trump's campaign slogan. It's on the caps his campaign sells to admirers, and it's also the name of an ostensibly independent superPAC. Or it was until this week, when the superPAC said it was going out of business. It ran aground on stories in the Washington Post, revealing connections linking the superPAC with Trump's campaign and his office. The Post reported that Colorado political consultant Mike Ciletti has business ties to Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, and also runs the superPAC. The paper also reported that Ciletta seemed to be soliciting superPAC contributions from Trump business contacts. Federal law bars candidates and their campaigns from soliciting big, unregulated contributions for superPACs. Ciletti is also a principal in a company called Wizbang Solutions. The Trump campaign paid Wizbang $41,300 in the third quarter for printing, design and direct mail. Ciletti didn't respond to NPR's request for comment. Trump's campaign finance lawyer, former Federal Election Commission chairman Donald McGahn, wrote to MAGA and eight other pro-Trump superPACs on Wednesday, telling them to stop using Trump's name and image. McGahn said Trump appreciates small, unsolicited contributions, but didn't want donors misled into ""supporting an unauthorized effort, one which is subject to no oversight."" MAGA got a $100,000 contribution this summer from the mother-in-law of Trump's daughter Ivanka. Another link between Trump and MAGA is its very name. Donald Trump filed in 2012 to trademark the phrase Make America Great Again for use with a political action committee. He first used it this past May – an essential step in the application process – and the Patent and Trademark Office registered it in July. McGahn and the campaign didn't respond to questions about the name and usage rights.

Kirchner Legacy Frays Even at Its Source,http://www.wsj.com/articles/kirchner-familys-hold-on-argentina-frays-even-at-its-patagonian-source-1445679031,wsj,"RÍO GALLEGOS, Argentina—From the main drag to the graveyard of this windswept Patagonian outpost, the imprint of Argentina’s first family is everywhere.
Walls are decorated with graffiti lauding President  Cristina Kirchner. Her late husband and predecessor, Néstor Kirchner, has an avenue named after him, and his remains lie in a mausoleum with an eternal flame partly inspired by Napoleon’s tomb. Staring down from campaign billboards are the faces of their son, Máximo Kirchner, and  Alicia Kirchner, the president’s sister-in-law.
“Since 1987 there has always been a Kirchner on the ballot,” said  Javier Bielle, a former legislator here in Santa Cruz province, the base of the Kirchner family’s political dynasty. This sparsely populated expanse of glaciers and oil fields in Argentina’s deep south is to the Kirchners, he said, “what Arkansas was for Bill and  Hillary Clinton.”
Yet even here, the Kirchner juggernaut that has controlled the presidency over 12 years appears to be losing momentum as Argentines prepare to cast ballots in Sunday’s general elections.
Cristina Kirchner, 62 years old, is constitutionally barred from a third consecutive term but she could run again in 2019, and her 41.7% job-approval rating is higher than that of several other South American presidents. In speeches, Mrs. Kirchner has called on her handpicked successor and current presidential front-runner,  Daniel Scioli, to stay true to her populist economic policies that have included company takeovers and currency controls.
Mr. Scioli has sent strong signals that if he wins, he will chart a more centrist economic course to combat rising poverty, 25% inflation, and dwindling foreign reserves. His advisers have hinted he would negotiate with U.S. hedge-funds Mrs. Kirchner has denounced as “vultures” after they held out from a settlement of Argentine sovereign debt.
The president hopes to retain her redoubt in Río Gallegos, the capital of Santa Cruz, 1,500 miles from Buenos Aires. It was here in 1987 that “Kirchnerismo” began when her husband was elected mayor. He became governor of Santa Cruz in 1991.
Now the president’s son, Máximo, is running for one of the province’s two seats to Argentina’s lower house. Until recently, the reticent 38-year-old shunned the spotlight and preferred sleepy Río Gallegos to cosmopolitan Buenos Aires. He is under investigation for alleged money-laundering linked to the Kirchner family’s hotel business in Patagonia, and his critics point out that serving in congress would provide immunity from prosecution. He couldn’t be reached for comment. The family has denied any crime was committed.
Alicia Kirchner, who is Néstor Kirchner’s sister and the Minister of Social Protection, is in a tight race for Santa Cruz governor against incumbent  Daniel Peralta and opposition candidate  Eduardo Costa, who is leading in the polls.
“If she loses Santa Cruz, it would be a blow to the heart of the Kirchner movement,” said Mr. Costa.
To fend off that outcome, Cristina Kirchner has traveled to Santa Cruz three times this month for appearances with her son and sister-in-law. One was a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a public swimming pool in Río Gallegos, an event Argentine television stations were ordered to broadcast live.
Pre-empting TV programming for official announcements is supposed to be reserved for “grave” or “exceptional” events, such as a coup d’état or weather emergency. But  Fernando Torrillate, a spokesman for the government’s TV regulator, insisted the swimming pool’s inauguration met the “exceptional” standard.
In her speech, Cristina Kirchner recalled how her late husband never learned more than the dog paddle because the town lacked a public pool. Like other projects Mrs. Kirchner has rushed to inaugurate ahead of Sunday’s vote, the swimming pool isn’t yet finished. As construction workers with hammers and power saws worked at the pool site a few days after Mrs. Kirchner’s visit, Néstor Turri, who lives across the street, shook his head. “Cristina is a demagogue,” he said.
Calls to the presidency seeking comment weren't returned.
What critics consider the Kirchners’ authoritarian political style was honed in Santa Cruz in the 1990s. As governor, Néstor Kirchner pushed lawmakers to change electoral rules so he could serve three terms and pressured the media for favorable coverage, said Milagros Pierini, a local human rights activist.
More than half of Santa Cruz’s workforce are government employees. “Here, the government is also your supervisor, your boss,” said Pablo Manuel, an editor at TiempoSur, a Río Gallegos newspaper.
Home to major petroleum and natural-gas deposits but just 350,000 people, Santa Cruz has long boasted the highest per-capita budget of any Argentine province. Mr. Kirchner used it to build schools and pave roads connecting far-flung oil towns, Atlantic ports and tourist resorts flanked by massive glaciers.
A tireless campaigner, he seemed to know everybody’s name. “Even as president, Néstor would call down here to ask about some old woman to find out how she was doing and to make sure we were taking care of her,” said  Juan Carlos Batarev, a local Peronist official.
Mr. Kirchner was succeeded by his wife in 2007 and then died of a heart attack three years later. Since then, Santa Cruz has been rocked with corruption scandals, some involving real estate deals in which the Kirchners were allegedly implicated.
During a 150-day strike by municipal workers this year, trash piled up in Río Gallegos before being blown into surrounding pastures by the fierce Patagonian wind. The outskirts of town now look like a dump, prompting some residents to say it is time to change course.
But at the swimming pool event, where she shared the stage with candidates Alicia and Máximo Kirchner, Mrs. Kirchner implored voters to extend the family legacy.
“Our political project isn’t about last names,” she said. “It’s about Argentina.”",0.38677739071586392
"GOP, Dems moving in opposite directions after a pivotal week",http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-10-24-US--Campaign%202016-Pivotal%20Week/id-7482ae58284545598151330c68243206,ap," (AP) â After a pivotal week, the presidential race has become a tale of two parties on sharply different trajectories: Hillary Rodham Clinton has tightened her grip on the Democratic nomination while Republican concern is reaching new heights. Some officials are even considering what could turn into a GOP civil war to stop Donald Trump â with no fallback option.
Clinton took what was essentially a victory lap on Friday, cheered by excited Democrats a day after her strong performance during an 11-hour Republican-led probe of the 2012 Benghazi attacks. The former secretary of state's high marks for the congressional hearing capped a week in which three of her five Democratic rivals bowed out of the race â none more important than Vice President Joe Biden, who said he wouldn't be getting in.
""She's gone in the course of two weeks from being a wobbly front-runner to the almost-certain nominee,"" said Fergus Cullen, a former New Hampshire Republican Party chairman. The GOP field, Cullen said, is more splintered than ever.
As Democrats showered a confident Clinton with fresh praise, one-time Republican front-runner Jeb Bush announced deep cuts to his campaign staff. The former Florida governor slashed the payroll by 40 percent and downsized his Miami headquarters in a move that sounded alarms for GOP officials who long assumed Bush would shake off his slow start and ultimately emerge as their party's nominee.
The fresh evidence of Bush's struggles only darkened the clouds of uncertainty over the party's field.
Some Republicans have intensified calls for an organized campaign to take down their dominant candidate, Trump, fearing the tough-talking reality television star is doing lasting damage to the GOP's standing among women and minority voters â Hispanics in particular â heading into 2016.
The Club for Growth, an influential Washington-based group focused on fiscal conservatism, seized on fresh polls in Iowa suggesting that Trump's front-runner status could be in jeopardy.
""Trump loses when voters know the truth about him,"" Club president David McIntosh said Friday, noting that his group recently spent $1 million on anti-Trump television ads. ""He's not a conservative, and he's really just the worst kind of politician.""
Yet Trump remains atop most Republican polls. And with Bush's struggles, it's unclear who would take the billionaire businessman's place if he should fall. Several candidates have been stuck for months in the single digits of polling â among them, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
""At this point there's no singular alternative to Trump,"" said Republican donor Fred Malek, adding that the state of affairs is ""very concerning"" roughly three months before the Iowa caucuses.
Malek's hope: ""Someone will have a breakthrough moment and catch a little bit of fire and get that bounce in support. When we have one clear alternative to Trump, that person will go on to win.""
Despite no political experience, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson is making an argument to be that person. His campaign manager, Barry Bennett, told The Associated Press Friday that Carson's campaign raised $10 million in October alone â a new mark of fundraising success that makes Carson the envy of many Republican rivals.
And as Republicans fight among themselves, Clinton appears to be getting stronger.
Supporters who met with her privately during a Friday appearance at the Women's Leadership Forum said she laughed when they advised her to go home and get some rest.
""She was glowing,"" said Pamela Eakes, a Clinton donor from Seattle. ""We're grateful to Republicans for giving her the best week ever.""
The Benghazi hearing came in the midst of a major political winning streak for Clinton.
Her poll numbers in early voting states are rebounding after her commanding performance in the first Democratic debate. Biden decided against a 2016 run, removing a major threat. And two of her other challengers, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee, dropped out this week.
Clinton on Friday also won the endorsement of the 1.6 million-member American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
""Obviously it's a good week for Secretary Clinton,"" Chafee said Friday shortly after announcing his departure from the race. ""It's time to move on and support the party any way I can.""
Clinton aides tried to downplay her winning streak, stressing that capturing the Democratic primary nomination will still require a lot of work. But, they said, her strong performance in both the debate and her congressional testimony showed off her foreign policy credentials and command of the issues for a broader audience.
Clinton's surge has resurrected dismissive Republican talk that the Democratic contest is simply ""a Clinton coronation.""
Yet there is little doubt the Republicans would love the certainty that Democrats now enjoy. And in the meantime, the intraparty divide between the GOP's own establishment and anti-establishment wings grows deeper.
Republican factions on Capitol Hill appear to have unified behind Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan for House speaker, but that's likely to have little impact on the party's political success in 2016. And Democrats suggest that the ongoing Benghazi investigation, at least for now, has helped rather than hurt Clinton's presidential ambitions.
""You watch that yesterday and you say this woman should be president of America,"" Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said after a Clinton appearance on Friday. ""We'll let the Republicans keep doing what they're doing.""

Clinton goes to Iowa Democrats' dinner with newfound energy,http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-10-24-US--DEM%202016-Iowa/id-3552dd633d8647308a0e656a81945a0c,ap,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) â Hillary Rodham Clinton is embracing President Barack Obama's legacy, now that she doesn't have to worry about a challenge from his vice president, as the Democratic campaign shifts to Iowa in what has essentially become a two-person race for the nomination.
The pared-down presidential field is set to address Iowa Democrats on Saturday night at an influential party fundraiser, a venue that helped launch Obama eight years earlier. Clinton is coming to the annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner with newfound energy after Vice President Joe Biden announced he would not enter the presidential race and she put a grinding appearance at a congressional committee probing the deadly 2012 Benghazi attacks behind her.
Two lesser-known rivals, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee, abandoned the race following Clinton's strong performance in last week's first primary debate.
Joining with Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, her 2008 presidential campaign chairman, Clinton held up Obama and Biden on Friday as a model for the country and said she would build upon their agenda.
""Their records should make Democrats proud and they should make Americans proud,"" Clinton said. In an interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, Clinton said she wanted to ""build on the progress that they are leaving behind. I feel very strongly about that.""
Biden's move has effectively turned the Democratic campaign into a contest between Clinton, who remains the front-runner, and Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has drawn large crowds as he calls for a ""political revolution"" to address the chasm between the wealthy and the poor.
""I worry very much that both economically and politically our country is sliding into oligarchy,"" Sanders said Friday during a women's forum sponsored by the Democratic National Committee.
Clinton, Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley were to appear before more than 6,000 activists at the annual Iowa fundraiser, called the ""J-J,"" for the state party. The event traditionally serves as a kickoff to the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses.
Obama used a breakout performance at the dinner in 2007 to fuel his campaign and capped it off a few months later with a surprising triumph in the caucuses. Clinton placed third in Iowa that year and has since vowed to build a formidable organization to power her to victory.
Obama remains a popular figure within the party. Clinton's association with his agenda could help her with Democrats who have viewed her warily after a rough spell for her campaign, marked by scrutiny over her use of a private email system while she was secretary of state and her family's sprawling charitable foundation.
Sanders, meanwhile, repeatedly notes the large numbers of Democratic voters who stayed home in the 2014 midterm elections and says the party needs to mobilize working-class voters who have eluded Democrats in recent times.
The three Democratic campaigns planned parties, concerts and rallies to stoke enthusiasm at the Iowa dinner.
Former President Bill Clinton was set to headline a Saturday afternoon concert along with pop star Katy Perry.  He's appeared at private fundraisers and joined his wife at an early New York rally but has yet to campaign actively.
""He's an enormous asset,"" said Clinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri.
Sanders held a Friday night concert in Davenport, Iowa â dubbed ""Bernie's All-Star Band â with members of Alice in Chains, The Samples and MC5. On tap for Saturday: a march with supporters along a bridge over the Des Moines River.
O'Malley, who has badly trailed Clinton and Sanders in polls, is a member of a Celtic Irish band and planned to break out his guitar at pre-dinner events.
A recent Iowa poll by Bloomberg Politics and The Des Moines Register found Clinton with a slight lead in the state over Sanders, with the two candidates the choice of 9 in 10 voters. O'Malley was at 2 percent.
""Bernie Sanders is still a threat,"" said Mo Elleithee, a former Clinton campaign aide who now leads the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service.  ""He can still mobilize a significant portion of the Democratic base.""
But he said Clinton is getting stronger and ""more and more people who were nervous are feeling more comfortable with her.""
Following Clinton's appearance before the Benghazi panel, her campaign announced that it had more than 500,000 donors since launching in spring, including about 100,000 new donors in October. Sanders has reported about 650,000 donors through the end of September, with the vast majority of his $40 million coming from small online contributions.

"No longer patient, Bush backers fret about sluggish campaign",http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/89ae8247abe8493fae24405546e9a1aa/Article_2015-10-24-US--GOP%202016-Bush/id-674a279a1965437cb9a66f142640d8e4,ap," (AP) â For months, Jeb Bush's campaign insisted it was too early.
Too early to worry about the Republican presidential candidate's sluggish poll numbers. Too early to fret over the rise of unorthodox candidates Donald Trump and Ben Carson. Too early to question if the one-time front-runner is merely a pedestrian candidate.
But with just over three months until primary voting gets underway in Iowa, and Bush still mired in the middle of the crowded GOP field, some supporters fear it could soon be too late.
""The moment is now,"" said New Hampshire State Rep. Carlos Gonzalez, reflecting the sense of urgency among nearly two dozen Bush supporters interviewed this past week by The Associated Press.
On Friday, Bush signaled to supporters he understood the need to make a change. Faced with slower-than-expected fundraising, the campaign announced sweeping spending cuts, including a 40 percent payroll reduction, that will deplete staff at its Miami headquarters and refocus resources in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada â the first four states to hold nominating contests.
""It means I have the ability to adapt,"" Bush said of the changes. ""The circumstances when we started the election were different.""
But interviews with supporters in early states reveal concerns that extend far beyond the campaign's allocation of resources. There are fears Bush is failing to distinguish himself from his rivals, despite a month of aggressive television advertising. Many said they were eager to see Bush be more assertive and forceful in debates, in his TV ads and at campaign appearances.
They worry he may not be capable of doing so.
""God gives us our personalities and our looks and we can't help that,"" said Robert Rowe, another New Hampshire state representative who is switching his allegiance from Bush to Ohio Gov. John Kasich. ""We are who we are.""
Said Bush supporter Steven Zumbach, an attorney from Des Moines, Iowa: ""He's going to need to take some risk. Unless he does something like that, it's going to be difficult.""
Bush campaign aides say they understand the anxiety, but blame it on an unusual political season that has diverted attention away from more traditional candidates â not a sign of weakness in the former Florida governor. Bush himself has urged voters to stay patient, reminding them that candidates who sit at the top of polls at this stage in the race often fade.
""Four years ago Herman Cain was the front-runner. Two weeks prior to that it was Rick Perry,"" Bush said Wednesday during a campaign stop in Nevada. ""Both are great guys, but they didn't win the nomination.""
Indeed, many voters in Iowa and New Hampshire wait until just before their states' contests to settle on a candidate. The outcomes in those first two states have ripple effects in South Carolina, Nevada and other states that quickly follow.
There are also signs of volatility in the GOP contest. After spending the summer and fall atop the Republican field, Trump appears to be losing ground in Iowa to Carson, an untested politician with a penchant for provocative comments about Muslims and the Holocaust.
Bush is still among the candidates viewed as most electable among Republican voters, according to a new Associated Press-GfK poll. Six in 10 registered Republicans say he could possibly win a general election â putting him just below Trump and about tied with Carson atop the field.
Most of those interviewed by the AP said they remain loyal to Bush. Even as his campaign fundraising slows, they see his heavily funded super PAC as an advantage that could help him outlast his rivals. They believe his methodical approach to issues and record as Florida governor make him the most qualified Republican to be president.
But they wonder if there's room for a candidate like Bush in a race where voters seem eager to voice their displeasure with Washington and anyone with a history in politics.
""Within about a month, he's going to need to step forth,"" said Barbara Smeltzer, a longtime GOP activist from Dubuque, Iowa. ""He's going to have to start to show some muscle.""
Added Carroll Duncan, a councilwoman in Dorchester County, South Carolina, ""My main concern is that his message is not getting out there. That's up to his campaign to turn that around.""
Bush aides say they've been trying to do just that, with both the campaign and Right to Rise super PAC blanketing the airwaves with advertisements. Right to Rise accounted for one of every two 2016 presidential ads last week, according to information collected by Kantar Media's CMAG advertising tracker.
Right to Rise began its media blitz the week of Sept. 15 with a $1.3 million buy in New Hampshire and Iowa, expanding to South Carolina the following week. The super PAC has spent about $2 million each week on ads, CMAG shows. The group's media plans continue through mid-February â by which time it will have spent $42 million if it follows through on all of its airtime reservations.
Bush's campaign is trying to supplement the ad spending with a large footprint on the ground in early states. The campaign has 12 paid staffers in New Hampshire, 10 in Iowa, eight in Nevada and seven in South Carolina.
The overhaul the campaign announced Friday aims to boost those numbers. Supporters hope the changes will be enough to keep Bush afloat through a long, and so far surprising, campaign.
""Jeb is not spectacular,"" said Lynn Stewart, a state assemblyman from Henderson, Nevada. ""But he's solid and steady.""

"No longer patient, Bush backers fret about sluggish campaign",http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2015-10-24-US--GOP%202016-Bush/id-674a279a1965437cb9a66f142640d8e4,ap," (AP) â For months, Jeb Bush's campaign insisted it was too early.
Too early to worry about the Republican presidential candidate's sluggish poll numbers. Too early to fret over the rise of unorthodox candidates Donald Trump and Ben Carson. Too early to question if the one-time front-runner is merely a pedestrian candidate.
But with just over three months until primary voting gets underway in Iowa, and Bush still mired in the middle of the crowded GOP field, some supporters fear it could soon be too late.
""The moment is now,"" said New Hampshire State Rep. Carlos Gonzalez, reflecting the sense of urgency among nearly two dozen Bush supporters interviewed this past week by The Associated Press.
On Friday, Bush signaled to supporters he understood the need to make a change. Faced with slower-than-expected fundraising, the campaign announced sweeping spending cuts, including a 40 percent payroll reduction, that will deplete staff at its Miami headquarters and refocus resources in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada â the first four states to hold nominating contests.
""It means I have the ability to adapt,"" Bush said of the changes. ""The circumstances when we started the election were different.""
But interviews with supporters in early states reveal concerns that extend far beyond the campaign's allocation of resources. There are fears Bush is failing to distinguish himself from his rivals, despite a month of aggressive television advertising. Many said they were eager to see Bush be more assertive and forceful in debates, in his TV ads and at campaign appearances.
They worry he may not be capable of doing so.
""God gives us our personalities and our looks and we can't help that,"" said Robert Rowe, another New Hampshire state representative who is switching his allegiance from Bush to Ohio Gov. John Kasich. ""We are who we are.""
Said Bush supporter Steven Zumbach, an attorney from Des Moines, Iowa: ""He's going to need to take some risk. Unless he does something like that, it's going to be difficult.""
Bush campaign aides say they understand the anxiety, but blame it on an unusual political season that has diverted attention away from more traditional candidates â not a sign of weakness in the former Florida governor. Bush himself has urged voters to stay patient, reminding them that candidates who sit at the top of polls at this stage in the race often fade.
""Four years ago Herman Cain was the front-runner. Two weeks prior to that it was Rick Perry,"" Bush said Wednesday during a campaign stop in Nevada. ""Both are great guys, but they didn't win the nomination.""
Indeed, many voters in Iowa and New Hampshire wait until just before their states' contests to settle on a candidate. The outcomes in those first two states have ripple effects in South Carolina, Nevada and other states that quickly follow.
There are also signs of volatility in the GOP contest. After spending the summer and fall atop the Republican field, Trump appears to be losing ground in Iowa to Carson, an untested politician with a penchant for provocative comments about Muslims and the Holocaust.
Bush is still among the candidates viewed as most electable among Republican voters, according to a new Associated Press-GfK poll. Six in 10 registered Republicans say he could possibly win a general election â putting him just below Trump and about tied with Carson atop the field.
Most of those interviewed by the AP said they remain loyal to Bush. Even as his campaign fundraising slows, they see his heavily funded super PAC as an advantage that could help him outlast his rivals. They believe his methodical approach to issues and record as Florida governor make him the most qualified Republican to be president.
But they wonder if there's room for a candidate like Bush in a race where voters seem eager to voice their displeasure with Washington and anyone with a history in politics.
""Within about a month, he's going to need to step forth,"" said Barbara Smeltzer, a longtime GOP activist from Dubuque, Iowa. ""He's going to have to start to show some muscle.""
Added Carroll Duncan, a councilwoman in Dorchester County, South Carolina, ""My main concern is that his message is not getting out there. That's up to his campaign to turn that around.""
Bush aides say they've been trying to do just that, with both the campaign and Right to Rise super PAC blanketing the airwaves with advertisements.

"Bush slashes campaign budget, refocuses on key primary states",http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/p3GSnighiOk/,fox,"

Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush is slashing his campaign budget with across-the-board pay cuts and other changes, overhauling an operation that started as a political juggernaut but now may need to stay lean to survive. 
The one-time GOP front-runner has seen his political momentum undercut by outsider candidates Donald Trump and Ben Carson, who now lead in most polls, relegating the former Florida governor to the middle of the pack. 
In a bid to recalibrate its strategy and operations, the Bush campaign plans to cut its budget by as much as 45 percent. This includes pay cuts of 40 percent, cuts to travel costs and a downsizing of its Miami headquarters staff, Fox News has learned. 
The overall changes will save the campaign approximately $1 million a month, Bush senior sources say. In recent months, Bush's biggest expenses have been air travel and staff, having spent $1.6 million on payroll alone over three months. 
An internal campaign memo on the changes, obtained by Fox News, acknowledged the shifting dynamics in the race. 
""It's no secret that the contours of this race have changed from what was anticipated at the start. We would be less than forthcoming if we said we predicted in June that a reality television star supporting Canadian-style single-payer health care and partial-birth abortion would be leading the GOP Primary,"" the memo said. 

The changes come despite a combined fundraising haul of well over $100 million by his campaign and a pro-Bush super PAC. In another setback for Bush, fellow Florida politician Sen. Marco Rubio has been gaining in the polls, often edging out Bush -- increasing frustration not only among some of Bush's network of donors, but also longtime Florida supporters. 
The campaign is describing the budget changes as an effort to focus on what matters most: Increasing his presence in the early-voting states, with an eye toward laying out a modified path to winning the nomination. 
""We are making changes today to ensure Jeb is best positioned to win the nomination and general election. Jeb is the one candidate with a proven conservative record, bold ideas and the strong leadership needed to fix the problems America faces,"" campaign spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said in a statement. ""We moving our resources into the states to ensure that voters in primary and caucus states are introduced to his record and vision for the future."" 
In the internal memo, the Bush campaign also touted its extensive field operations in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, as well as its formidable fundraising effort that has raised roughly $25 million so far this year -- not counting the over $100 million raised by the pro-Bush super PAC, Right to Rise USA, that is separate from the campaign. 
In the coming days, the campaign hopes to regain lost ground, and strengthen its overall message by concentrating on Bush's record as Florida governor where he cut state budgets and issued tax cuts. The mantra, according to the campaign, will be that ""Jeb Can Fix It."" 
""We're going to focus the argument of this campaign around the fact that after seven years of incompetence, corruption and gridlock in Washington, we need a president 'Who Can Fix It.'"" The memo states. ""Jeb is the only person in the field on both sides of the aisle who can make this statement."" 
The full e-book on Bush's tenure in Tallahassee will also be released in the ""next couple weeks,"" according to the internal memo.   Serafin Gomez covers Special Events and Politics for FOX News Channel and is also a contributor to FOX News Latino.

Wisconsin Governor Walker signs bill restricting secret investigations,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/MostRead/~3/4oGYF7ZIftU/story01.htm,reuters,"MILWAUKEE Wisconsin Republican Governor Scott Walker on Friday signed a bill into law that prohibits prosecutors from using the state's secret investigation law to probe political crimes - a measure used to convict four of his aides and investigate his campaign. 
In Wisconsin, prosecutors can use a so called ""John Doe"" proceeding law to call witnesses, request search warrants and offer immunity without probable cause that a crime has been committed.
Under the legislation Walker signed, prosecutors can no longer use the law to investigate cases of bribery or political misconduct. Instead, the law is limited to the investigation of certain crimes, such as ones involving violent felonies. 
""We may never know if there are political crooks popping champagne corks today knowing that their crimes will now be very difficult to investigate and even harder to prosecute,"" said Democrat Rep. Peter Barca in a statement.  
The new law also places a six-month time limit on secret probes in Wisconsin and limits the secrecy to judges, district attorneys, law enforcement officials and investigators and not to witnesses and suspects under investigation.
""These changes were desperately needed in Wisconsin and our state is better off now that it’s law,"" Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said in a statement. 
The Republican-led state Senate and Assembly approved the measure along party lines during the last several days.  
In June 2012, Walker became the first governor in U.S. history to survive a recall election. 
Two months later, a John Doe investigation was launched into coordination between Wisconsin Club for Growth, conservative advocacy group and Walker's campaign and other recall campaigns involving other candidates.  
The Wisconsin Supreme Court in July 2015 ruled that Walker's campaign and conservative groups did not break campaign finance laws during recall elections. 
A John Doe investigation also produced convictions against six people, including four of Walker's aides, when he was Milwaukee County Executive from 2002 to 2010, on charges ranging from embezzlement to misconduct in office.
Walker, who withdrew from the U.S. presidential campaign last month, was not charged in either investigation.

Nasdaq 100 index may see record with Apple earnings due Tuesday,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/MostRead/~3/Myv7PTX1SBQ/story01.htm,reuters,"NEW YORK The Nasdaq 100 index, dominated by U.S. technology stocks, may set a record high next week, helped by good earnings from Apple Inc expected on Tuesday. 
Technology shares led the U.S. stock market's recovery this  week from its worst correction in four years in August, thanks to gains in Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft, after the three companies reported better-than-expected earnings results. 
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.9 percent to 17,646.70, the S&P 500 index recovered another 1.1 percent to 2,075.15, and the Nasdaq Composite closed the week up 2.27 percent at 5,031.86.
Shares across Asia, Europe and the Americas all climbed, boosted by Thursday's message from European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi that he was ready to increase the ECB's bond buying program, and by an interest rate cut by China's central bank. 
Factors this coming week that may provide further support for U.S. stocks include a Federal Reserve policy meeting, which is not expected to raise interest rates yet, a report on U.S. third-quarter economic growth, and earnings from Apple.
The Nasdaq 100 index, including Apple, is just 1.5 percent below its year high and 4.0 percent from its record high back in March 2000.
Intel and Microsoft have seen their stocks recover more than 30 percent each since Aug. 25, while Amazon and Facebook rose 28 percent and 23 percent,  respectively. 
But the 'underperformer' among these companies has been Apple, up only 14.8 percent from its Aug. 25 close, less than the Nasdaq 100's 15.1 percent gain in that time.
In contrast to Microsoft, Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon, Apple shares did not post record or multi-year highs this week, even though it rose 7.2 percent, the largest weekly gain in a year.
On Tuesday, though, Apple is expected to report $51.1 billion in revenue, a 21.3 percent increase compared to the same quarter of last year. Earnings are seen at $1.879 per share.
""The bar has been raised a bit on its earnings report from where it was a week ago. The price action is telling you there's more optimism built into it,"" said Michael James, managing director of equities trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
Options market action shows traders expect Apple shares to move roughly 5.0 percent by the end of next week. The average move for the stock the day after its report in the last eight quarters was 4.4 percent, up or down.
""Will an above-estimates from Apple and raised guidance help? Sure it will. But we could still get there without that happening,"" said James of the possibility of the Nasdaq 100 hitting a record.
""The power of the moves in some of these large cap tech stocks has been breathtaking,"" he said.
Chip makers were also among the top five percentage gainers in the Nasdaq 100 since the index closed at its 2015 low on Aug. 25, with SanDisk topping the list with a 70 percent jump on the back of a takeover bid from Western Digital.
The overwhelming leadership from established technology companies is a positive for this market move higher, according to Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.
""The last time the Nasdaq 100 was the market leader a lot of it was speculative investments, but these (tech) companies actually return money to shareholders,"" she said.
""Tech deserves the leadership; the stock market is rewarding growth.""

BIOTECH THE FLIP SIDE TO TECH STOCK LEADERSHIP
While technology stocks have led the market recovery, biotech stocks have been a drag on performance. 
The Nasdaq Biotech Index is down 3.5 percent from its Aug. 25 close, and more than 20 percent below its year high. The three index components with the largest declines in market capitalization in the last eight weeks are Mylan, Illumina and Biogen.
""There has been a major rotation out of healthcare and into tech and it has continued after the recent earnings reports,"" said Wedbush's James, referring to strong results from Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet.
Biotech stocks were shaken in September when U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton first tweeted concerns about drug prices and the selling spread to other areas of the healthcare sector. Investors have been dumping shares of everything from hospitals to traditional pharmaceutical companies and insurers in recent weeks.
Since peaking in July, the Nasdaq Biotech Index has fallen 23 percent, the broad S&P Health Care Index has lost 12 percent and the S&P 500 Health Care Facilities index is down 31 percent. 
Fund managers now say they expect regulatory threats on drug prices, disappointing earnings, higher interest rates that could hurt heavily indebted hospitals, and the loss of the initial Obamacare boost to business to all weigh on health sector stocks this year.

Under the legislation Walker signed, prosecutors can no longer use the law to investigate cases of bribery or political misconduct. Instead, the law is limited to the investigation of certain crimes, such as ones involving violent felonies. 
""We may never know if there are political crooks popping champagne corks today knowing that their crimes will now be very difficult to investigate and even harder to prosecute,"" said Democrat Rep. Peter Barca in a statement.  
The new law also places a six-month time limit on secret probes in Wisconsin and limits the secrecy to judges, district attorneys, law enforcement officials and investigators and not to witnesses and suspects under investigation.
""These changes were desperately needed in Wisconsin and our state is better off now that it’s law,"" Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said in a statement. 
The Republican-led state Senate and Assembly approved the measure along party lines during the last several days.  
In June 2012, Walker became the first governor in U.S. history to survive a recall election. 
Two months later, a John Doe investigation was launched into coordination between Wisconsin Club for Growth, conservative advocacy group and Walker's campaign and other recall campaigns involving other candidates.  
The Wisconsin Supreme Court in July 2015 ruled that Walker's campaign and conservative groups did not break campaign finance laws during recall elections. 
A John Doe investigation also produced convictions against six people, including four of Walker's aides, when he was Milwaukee County Executive from 2002 to 2010, on charges ranging from embezzlement to misconduct in office.
Walker, who withdrew from the U.S. presidential campaign last month, was not charged in either investigation.

Pricey generic drugs to get competition from Imprimis,http://www.latimes.com/la-fi-imprimis-drug-20151023-story.html,latimes,"Turing Pharmaceuticals sparked nationwide outrage and government investigations by raising the cost of Daraprim, a drug for treating AIDS and cancer, from $13.50 a capsule to $750 last month.
This week, the biomedical company Imprimis Pharmaceuticals of San Diego introduced a competitor to the medication — for $1 a capsule.
Imprimis plans to take the same strategy to undercut other generic drugs sold at far more than their manufacturing cost. Like Daraprim, these medications tend to be used in niche markets that until now haven't attracted much competition.
Daraprim is a brand-name formulation of the generic drug pyrimethamine. Turing's chief executive, Martin Shkreli, has gained notoriety because his company acquired the rights to it — then raised its price 5,000%.
Imprimis' version combines pyrimethamine with another generic drug. This strategy allows Imprimis to operate as a compounding pharmacy, which doesn't require approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its products. The setup spares the company a long FDA review process — and saves it money.
Turing isn't the first company to suddenly raise the price of a generic drug. Valeant Pharmaceuticals became well-known for the practice. It increased the prices of two heart drugs, Nitropress and Isuprel, by a respective 212% and 525%, immediately after acquiring them.
Valeant also raised the price of the San Diego-originated heartburn drug Zegerid by 550% this year, according to Deutsche Bank.
Valeant's actions have provoked a storm of opposition. Politicians have joined the fray, including Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bernie Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont.
But Turing took the practice to a new level, Imprimis CEO Mark Baum said. He hopes his company's response provides a market-based answer to exorbitant drug pricing.
Pharmaceutical companies argue the high prices pay for expensive research. Shkreli says his company's pricing finances innovative drugs and provides a profit motive to bring existing drugs to market.
The company spends more than half its revenue on research and development, Shkreli wrote on Twitter.
""Please get your facts straight before lumping us in with others,"" he wrote.
Turing also said it offers major price discounts for patients in programs such as Medicaid.
However, a company that buys a generic drug didn't pay for the research and development expenses — and its purchase price is far lower than if the medication was still under patent. That's why industry groups like Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America have condemned actions such as Turing's and Valeant's.
""There was no justification for it other than profit,"" said Joe Panetta, CEO of the San Diego-based life science trade group Biocom.
Turing was able to dramatically raise the price of Daraprim because it was the only seller of pyrimethamine, which is used to treat various infections like the parasite-linked toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasmosis is dangerous for people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV and patients undergoing chemotherapy.
Pyrimethamine is generic, meaning that any qualified drug maker could introduce a competitor. But it occupies a niche market, and its previously low price meant that other companies didn't see a market opportunity.
Turing's huge price hike provided an opening for Imprimis.
Imprimis said it now offers customized, compounded formulations of pyrimethamine and a type of folic acid in capsules for as low as $99 for a bottle of 100 capsules.
Baum noted that there's a limitation: The formulation can be sold only through a doctor's prescription made out to a specific individual, not as an over-the-counter product. Although Imprimis' combo drug isn't FDA-approved, the drug's ingredients have been cleared by the FDA, and the company's compounding operations have been cleared by the agency.
Filing for FDA approval of the compound itself would take years and millions of dollars, Baum said.
Although complaints about high-priced drugs are long-standing, what's new is that the prices of formerly inexpensive drugs are now being raised significantly — making them unaffordable for some patients, said Dr. Sherry Franklin, a pediatric endocrinologist in Solana Beach.
For example, she said the rising cost of doxycycline, used to treat acne, makes it impractical for that purpose. The price has reportedly risen in recent years by 600% or more.
""The bottom line is the price of drugs in the United States of America is ridiculous,"" Franklin said. ""I think it's reached a point where we can't continue to do this.""

"Kasich shoots hoops, exudes confidence in New Hampshire",http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/23/politics/john-kasich-new-hampshire-basketball/index.html,cnn,"Manchester, New Hampshire (CNN)John Kasich was in a good mood here on Friday, joking with voters at two town halls and shooting hoops at a local basketball course with staffers. 
But the GOP presidential candidate made it clear to the press that his mind was on the campaign trail, and not on the happenings in Washington hundreds of miles away. 
When reporters asked Kasich earlier in the day about the congressional hearing on Benghazi where Republicans grilled Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for 11 hours on Thursday, Kasich said he'd been too busy to catch it. 
""I just didn't see it. I'm sorry,"" Kasich said. ""I don't know where it stands right now, but I've been busy. I was busy all day yesterday here.""
A question on Paul Ryan's jump into the race for House speaker drew Kasich's usual reply, saying he didn't weigh in on legislative leadership issues ""because that's not my job.""
The Ohio governor has staked a lot in New Hampshire, saying at his first office opening in early October, ""If we don't do well, it's all going to end here.""
The latest GOP polls in New Hampshire show Kasich in fifth or sixth place, hovering around 7%. That's down from his third-place position when he announced his candidacy in late summer.
After finishing a town hall Friday in Milford at an athletics club, Kasich challenged his communications director to a game of H.O.R.S.E., shooting hoops as staffers and press stood by.
Kasich started off hot, making shot after shot and egging on his opponent, saying, ""If you don't make this one, it's over!""
But as Kasich started to miss shots, he grew frustrated. But he refused to give up.
""No, I'm not done. I don't quit,"" he said.
True to his word, Kasich stayed on the court until he sank a shot from the three-point line.
Kasich told reporters he expects to do well in New Hampshire. He ignored a question about Donald Trump's call Friday for candidates to disavow their super PACs by calling on the groups to return their donations.
He chose instead to focus on the last part of the question, which noted that the super PAC supporting Kasich, New Day for America, has a particularly strong presence in New Hampshire. 
""Is it? Good. I'm glad. I'm thrilled. I hope it gets stronger,"" Kasich said.
New Day announced Thursday it is sending 40 volunteers to New Hampshire to door knock for Kasich over the weekend, and the PAC also plans to spend heavily on TV ads in the state from November until the primary. 
When asked if he is concerned about blurred lines between the efforts of the super PAC and campaign, Kasich returned to one of his favorite themes on the trail: music. 
""Blurred lines? That was a song. I never really got it,"" he said.

"Bush slashing spending, shifting staff amid campaign woes",http://hosted2.ap.org/apdefault/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2015-10-23-US-GOP-2016-Bush/id-b3ef3e8dd5384cd7869f5d379e8f5f70,ap," (AP) â Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush is drastically slashing campaign spending, including an across-the-board pay cut for staff, and focusing more narrowly on early states, as the one-time front-runner seeks to salvage his bid for the GOP nomination.
The moves will reduce the campaign's payroll by 40 percent, while also cutting travel costs by 20 percent and eliminating extraneous overhead spending. Most campaign officials were told of the cost-cutting on Friday.
The changes mark a significant setback for a campaign that spent months building a large operation, but there are no signs Bush is on the verge of withdrawing from the race.
During an event Friday at Regent University in Virginia, Bush said the moves will allow his campaign to operate ""lean and mean"" going forward. Asked whether the changes signaled trouble for his White House hopes, he said, ""It means I have the ability to adapt.""
The former Florida governor - a son and brother of former presidents - has been under pressure from supporters to revamp his campaign as the early voting contests draw closer. The first-to-vote Iowa caucuses take place 100 days from Friday.
Despite financial and organizational advantages, Bush has struggled to break out of a crowded Republican field so far dominated by unorthodox candidates, including billionaire Donald Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.
The changes predominantly impact staff at Bush's Miami headquarters. Only about 25 percent of campaign staff will remain in Florida. Another one-fourth of the staff was already in early voting states and the remaining Bush aides will either be offered jobs there or other posts at reduced salaries, according to a campaign memo.
Campaign officials said the changes would allow Bush to bolster his resources in early voting states, particularly New Hampshire. Officials also suggested that by shifting staff out of Miami, Bush can make more and longer trips to New Hampshire, as well as Iowa, South Carolina and Nevada.
""We are moving our resources into the states to ensure that voters in primary and caucus states are introduced to his record and vision for the future,"" Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said.
It's unknown how many of Bush's Miami staff will accept positions elsewhere.
The narrower focus on the early contests is a strategic shift for the Bush campaign, which has been spending money and time in states that vote later in the primary cycle. It suggests the campaign feels increased pressure to have a strong showing in one of the first four states or risk not being able to remain competitive.
Bush officials acknowledged that the changes reflect a campaign landscape that looks far different than what they originally expected. Trump's unexpected rise has pulled attention away from other candidates and revealed deep voter frustration with Washington and experienced politicians.
Bush's campaign has urged supporters to be patient, pointing to its large organization and heavily funded super PAC as signs their operation is built to last through a long campaign. The campaign and super PAC have been spending heavily on television advertisements in early voting states, but so far there is little sign that his standing in the race is significantly improving.
While Bush's super PAC remains heavily funded, his campaign fundraising slowed in recent months. He reported collecting $13.4 million between July 1 and Sept. 30, less than Carson, who led the field with about $20 million. Bush ended September with about $10 million in cash.
While Bush has benefited from a traditional fundraising style that his father and brother perfected - even inheriting many of the same money-raisers - his campaign has struggled to capture the power of harvesting small contributions over the Internet.
Only about 4 percent of what he's collected since the beginning of his campaign comes from donors giving $200 or less. That makes him one of the worst low-dollar fundraisers in the GOP field. Those donors are important because they can give again and again, providing waves of cash without taking up any of the candidate's time.

"Op-Ed Columnist: Happy Birthday, Hillary Clinton",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/24/opinion/happy-birthday-hillary-clinton.html,nyt,"Monday is Hillary Clinton’s birthday. Don’t bother sending a gift. This week has given her all the presents she needs.

What a time she’s been having — the debate, Joe Biden’s non-candidacy announcement and then the total meltdown of the Benghazi Committee. It’s not often these days that a special House investigatory committee makes Democrats sing, but there you are. In a speech on the House floor, Representative Steve Israel claimed Thursday’s marathon inquisition had been like an “I Love Lucy” episode — “same plot, same characters, same script and nothing new.” This seems totally unfair to Lucy. Remember the one with the candy conveyor belt? Vitameatavegamin? How many of you think that 63 years from now, anyone will be saying: “Remember the question about Sidney Blumenthal’s email?”

Heck of a run for Clinton. And to top everything else off, Lincoln Chafee withdrew from the president’s race, leaving the field wide open for her to grab that metrics issue and run with it.

Things have been going so well, it’s impossible not to think a disaster is looming. Pop quiz – Hillary Clinton’s next headache will be:

• Revelation that she kept a secret flock of State Department carrier pigeons.

• Revelation that Justin Bieber is an old family friend with whom she corresponds regularly.

• Revelation that major donors to the Clinton Foundation have included El Chapo and Lance Armstrong.

• Revelation that during long family car trips, Clinton’s dog Seamus was kept in the trunk.

• Oh, I don’t know — something about Bill.

But let’s get back to the birthday. Clinton will be 68. There was a time when it seemed as if her age might be an issue. After all, we’ve only had two presidents come into office when they were 68 or beyond. One of them was Ronald Reagan and the other was William Henry Harrison, who did not do future 68-year-old candidates any favors by dying one month after the inauguration.

Last year the Wisconsin governor, Scott Walker, chortled that he “could run 20 years from now for president and still be about the same age as the former secretary of state is right now.” Which, as it turned out, was a lucky break for him. See you in 2034, governor.

Now, the major candidates on both sides are in their 60s — except for Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, who are 44, and Bernie Sanders, who is 74. Donald Trump is older than Hillary Clinton, although of course when we talk about the possibility of a Trump presidency, age is about the 4,353rd topic of concern.

It’s not that age no longer matters, but that we’ve come to realize it hits different people in different ways. Some lose energy and focus, while others seem to get smarter and stronger. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the Supreme Court, at 82, does push-up routines with her trainer. Gloria Steinem celebrated her 80th birthday riding an elephant in Botswana.

In high-end politics, what we need to know is less about calendar years than staying power. Marco Rubio keeps talking about “generational change,” but he seems to have less energy than a koala. (Koalas sleep 18-22 hours a day. I am bringing this up so you can’t say I never teach you anything.) Really, where is that man? He hardly seems to be campaigning and he misses nearly half the Senate votes. Pre-millennials, is this the guy you want representing you?

Meanwhile, Clinton wowed the country with her endurance during this week’s Benghazi hearing. If we remember the House Select Committee on Benghazi at all, it will be as the folks who gave Hillary a chance to demonstrate her staying power. Even accounting for breaks, 11 hours of questioning must be close to some kind of record.

“Yoga always helps,” Clinton said as she departed.

She is — except for the part about yoga — a throwback to the first era of American public women, people like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, who came into their own in late middle age. Stanton, who like Clinton had an ability to make herself nap at will, kept promising the impatient Anthony that when her kids grew old enough to fend for themselves it would be exactly the right time for their great campaign for equal rights. “We shall not be in our prime before fifty, and after that, we shall be good for twenty years at least,” she assured Anthony. Actually, both of them were good for quite a bit longer, and still giving speeches at 80. Justice Ginsburg has a picture of Stanton in her Supreme Court office.

Clinton will be having a birthday party on Sunday in New York, and naturally it will be a fund-raiser. That sounds like the worst possible way to celebrate, but if there’s anything we know at this point, it’s that she can take the stress.",0.99217955622349097
Argentina Election Won't Make Investors Rush In,http://www.wsj.com/articles/argentina-election-wont-make-investors-rush-in-1445635703,wsj,"Investors are looking forward to the election Sunday of a new president of Argentina, but few expect a quick resolution of a long standoff with creditors or a quick pickup in foreign investment.
Political analysts say that a regime change following Sunday’s presidential election could lead to a resolution of a 14-year debt battle between a government and American hedge funds that has kept the country locked out of foreign capital, drawing down its reserves in the process.
But investors say Argentina will need to get its economic house in order first if it expects to woo the international investor community amid the recent retreat from emerging market debt.
“I don’t buy into the view that Argentina just needs to settle their holdout issue and everything is fine. They have a massive fiscal imbalance that is only getting worse,” said David Hinman, senior portfolio manager at Salient+Forward, which manages $265.7 million in emerging market debt.
Unofficial inflation estimates in Argentina are near 27% and the country has been running at a current-account deficit since 2011. While the 1% of GDP deficit is small in relation to other emerging market countries, the central bank has had to run down its foreign exchange reserves to fill the gap and prop up its currency, which using the unofficial exchange rate is trading at record lows, down 15% year-to-date against the dollar.
The South American nation hasn’t been able to broadly borrow on the global market since 2001 when it defaulted on nearly $100 billion in bonds and failed to fully settle with creditors who’ve been holding out for a better deal.
Foreign reserves have dwindled to $27 billion this year from $46 billion in 2011 as it hasn't been able to broadly borrow from international capital markets because existing court judgments in New York in favor of the holdout creditors would open any proceeds to seizure.
“Can Argentina come to the market?” Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America strategy at Jefferies, asked at a recent panel discussion hosted by the Emerging Markets Trade Association. Ms. Morden said even if Argentina settles with creditors and reopens its doors to international lending markets it isn’t clear whether investors will be interested in buying what Argentina has to offer.
Global credit conditions have deteriorated this year amid a broad investor retreat from risk that is highlighting the challenges facing many emerging market countries at a time of rising uncertainty over slowing economic growth, plummeting commodity prices and large debt burdens.
In the third quarter of 2015, a net $40 billion left emerging markets investments, about half from emerging market debt. That compares to $61 billion in net inflows during the same quarter last year, according to the Institute of International Finance.
“It’s not like 2013 when (emerging markets) were issuing debt and (investors) were just vacuuming it up,” said Win Thin, global head of emerging markets at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York.
With sovereign bond yields in the developed world “close to zero,” Mr. Thin said, investors will pay attention if Argentina enters the market with high enough yields after it settles its battle with debtholders. Investors say a resolution will take time and is unlikely to be the first priority of the new administration. Investors expect the country to start selling debt in the global lending market in the second quarter of 2016 at the earliest.
“They probably would have been better served to have settled this earlier,” said Peter Lannigan, head of emerging market strategy at CRT Capital Group. “I think they’ve avoided a crisis, but they’re running out of time. If they don’t regain access to markets, they’re going to run out of reserves.”
About 44% of investors believe a new administration in Argentina will settle with the holdouts led by hedge fund NML Capital Ltd and Aurelius Capital Management Ltd, according to a recent IMF/World Bank survey. Argentina’s benchmark dollar-denominated bonds due in 2033 have been trading above par in anticipation of a payout to creditors who still hold $1.7 billion in defaulted bonds.
To be sure, some investors say the idiosyncratic nature of Argentine bonds—which don’t trade in tandem with the larger emerging market debt market—will make them attractive to investors who are interested in bonds with a growth story behind them that aren’t tied to a grim global macroeconomic picture.
“I think the international community would be happy to welcome Argentina back to the market,” said Jorge Mariscal, director of investment research at UBS Wealth Management, which advises clients worth a total of $2 trillion.
If the holdout issue is resolved, he said, he expects Argentine bonds to begin trading a 400 basis point above benchmark U.S. Treasurys, compared with 600 basis points today.
However, Mr. Mariscal said he has been advising his clients not to buy the defaulted bonds that are trading on the secondary market before there are signs that a new administration can reign in spending and align the foreign exchange rate to match market value.
“There’s a lot of money waiting offshore. Argentina would see a pickup in real-estate prices, a pickup in the stock market, they would see growth again. It would be pretty evident and it would happen rather quickly. That doesn’t mean all the problems would be solved overnight,” said Mr. Mariscal.

"Bush Cuts Costs, Carson Eclipses Trump in Iowa and G.O.P. Frets",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/24/us/politics/jeb-bush-cuts-costs-ben-carson-eclipses-donald-trump-in-iowa-and-gop-frets.html,nyt,"A beleaguered Jeb Bush slashed his campaign spending. Donald J. Trump lost his lead in Iowa. And a surging Ben Carson galvanized his support among social conservatives.

With Hillary Rodham Clinton emerging as the unrivaled leader in the Democratic contest, the unruly Republican presidential field suddenly seemed to lack a center of political gravity, leaving party strategists and voters to fear a long nomination fight that could end with a damaged standard-bearer facing a more unified left.

On Friday, Mr. Bush cut salaries, fired consultants and laid off or reassigned many campaign workers. It was the latest sign that contenders vying for support from moderates and the party’s establishment are all but running on fumes — exhausting their cash, or the patience of their supporters, but barely moving in the polls.

Mr. Trump, for months a leading candidate, has now fallen behind in Iowa to Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, raising questions about how aggressively he will act to reverse his sagging poll numbers. And Mr. Carson, whose fund-raising has roughly kept pace with his climb in the polls, is moving to run television commercials in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, positioning himself to influence the outcomes in those states and others if he manages to continue locking down evangelical Christian voters.

Yet amid the tumult on the right, the contours of the state-by-state fight for the Republican nomination have also become more apparent.

In Iowa, where Republicans have crowned Christian conservatives in the last two caucuses, the most intense competition is for the support of hard-line Republicans among Mr. Trump, Mr. Carson and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Whoever emerges as the victor among these voters, many of whom dislike traditional politicians, will be strongly positioned to break out as the favored candidate among the same bloc of conservatives in later states.

And with Mr. Bush scaling back and focusing more intensely on the New Hampshire primary, he has helped ensure its role as a decisive, perhaps do-or-die test for his candidacy and those of other center-right hopefuls like Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio.

More immediately, the Republicans’ third debate, on Wednesday night, now looms as a potentially decisive moment for several candidates — above all Mr. Bush, whose performances have been lackluster so far, and whose staid, sober manner is proving an ill fit with voter discontent with long-serving elected officials.

Wobbliness in the earlier debates helped drive former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin from the Republican race as supporters lost faith and the candidates failed to redirect staff and resources quickly enough to recover, as Mr. Bush is trying to do now.

Mr. Bush has more resources, including support from a “super PAC” with nearly $100 million on hand, but he has been spending heavily and needs a strong showing to reassure his donors and give clearer reasons for voters to support him.

“The Republican camp is in total disarray,” said Edward J. Rollins, a veteran Republican strategist, who lamented the prospect of several more sprawling debates that fail to narrow the field, saying that Mr. Trump’s “reality show antics” would get in the way of the winnowing that needs to occur, and the sooner the better. “A long, dragged-out battle on our side only makes it more difficult to get ready for Hillary,” he said.

In Miami, where Mr. Bush’s campaign is based, aides were on edge Friday. Many were waiting to hear whether they would receive pay cuts, be sent to an early state or laid off entirely. The mood was brighter among those already in early states, who have been seeking more of Mr. Bush’s time and now will apparently get it. According to an internal memo, first reported Friday by Bloomberg News, Mr. Bush plans to reduce payroll costs by 40 percent this week and cut travel spending by 20 percent.

Some Bush strategists grumbled about what they described as an excessively large infrastructure at the headquarters. One department that will be particularly thinned out, advisers said, is the group of video producers and editors, called “Jeb TV,” that was assembled for what had been a robust digital effort.

“We will be working with staff today and going through each person’s situation, but expect sizable changes,” Danny Diaz, Mr. Bush’s campaign manager, said by email.

Mr. Bush, campaigning Friday in Virginia Beach, insisted that the shake-up was not ominous.

“This means lean and mean, and it means that I have the ability to adapt,” he said, pointing to Mr. Trump’s unexpected rise. “Every dollar we can save in overhead is a dollar that goes on television, goes on radio, goes on media, goes on voter outreach.”

While Mr. Bush is in poor shape now in Iowa, which holds the first-in-the-nation nominating contest on Feb. 1, the dynamics of the race there are hardly settled. Mr. Trump led Iowa polls of Republicans for 78 days, but a remarkable shift occurred on Thursday and Friday as Mr. Carson surged ahead in back-to-back polls, largely by consolidating the support of Christian conservatives.

Mr. Trump’s slide undercuts a key part of his sales pitch on the campaign trail: That opinion polls prove he is the most popular and formidable Republican in the presidential race.

“Do we love these polls?” Mr. Trump asked a crowd at a rally on Wednesday in Burlington, Iowa. “Somebody said, ‘You love polls.’ I said that’s only because I’ve been winning every single one of them. Right? Right? Every single poll.” He added that, “very importantly,” he was “winning big” in Iowa.

At a rally Friday night at the Trump National Doral Miami resort in Doral, Fla., Mr. Trump bragged about his poll numbers in a variety of states.

He acknowledged “bad news” in the form of the new Iowa polls, but described himself as “a great Christian,” blamed the news media for blowing the polls out of proportion and asserted that the pollsters behind those surveys “do not like me.”

“Believe me, I’m not dropping out of anything,” Mr. Trump said, adding, “I love Iowa, and I honestly think those polls are wrong.”

Sounding like a newscaster, he also jabbed Mr. Carson. “We have a breaking story: Donald Trump has fallen to second place behind Ben Carson,” Mr. Trump said. “We informed Ben, but he was sleeping.” Mr. Trump went on to deride Mr. Carson as “super low energy.”

Whether Mr. Trump will now start spending heavily from his personal fortune on his campaign, as he has said he would do, remains unclear: He has donated roughly $1.9 million of his own money, and he has yet to spend on television. Weeks ago, his advisers said Mr. Trump had hired a media firm in Florida that normally does not work for political clients, boasting proudly of his unconventional thinking. But they have refused to identify the firm, and Mr. Trump has continued to interview additional media consultants.

Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, was emphatic that the candidate would not retreat from Iowa.

“We’re going to compete every place, all the time, forever,” Mr. Lewandowski said.

But when asked if Mr. Trump had settled on a contingency plan if his numbers in Iowa continue to erode, Mr. Lewandowski said, “It’s not that he hasn’t decided, it’s that he hasn’t shared this information.”

Mr. Carson has slowly but steadily emerged as a soft-spoken alternative to the fiery Mr. Trump among Republicans fed up with politicians and craving an outsider. A focus group of Republicans in Indianapolis this week, conducted for the nonpartisan Annenberg Public Policy Center, used words for Mr. Trump like “self-serving” and “disturbing.” In contrast, Mr. Carson was called “wise” and “a gentleman.”

“It’s like a moth to the flame,” said the pollster Peter D. Hart, who conducted the focus group, of Mr. Trump’s supporters. “They’re drawn there, but all of a sudden, as they look closer, they say: ‘No, no, no. I’m backing away.’ ”

In New Hampshire, meanwhile, Mr. Bush is drawing inspiration from another candidate who also struggled with money troubles — Senator John McCain of Arizona. Several times in recent weeks, Mr. Bush has recalled an encounter with Mr. McCain at the Atlanta airport during the 2008 presidential primary campaign.

“He’s carrying his bag, he has no aide, he’s running for president, he has no staff,” Mr. Bush said in New Hampshire last month. “The campaign was basically over. Everybody said it. All the pundits said, ‘It’s over; why waste your time?’ ”

But Mr. McCain persisted, Mr. Bush said, implicitly making an analogy-cum-prediction for his own predicament.

“He won New Hampshire, he won Florida, he won the nomination and he should have been president,” Mr. Bush said.",0.99945441207528973
Letter: Regulating Dietary Supplements,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/24/opinion/regulating-dietary-supplements.html,nyt,"To the Editor:

Re “Dietary Supplements Cause 20,000 E.R. Visits Each Year” (news article, Oct. 15):

This important study by federal researchers reminds us of how important regulations to ensure safety and efficacy are and that their absence can harm any of us.

The unregulated dietary supplement market has left the public vulnerable to dangerous and unmonitored side effects from the use of supplements. Although they may not be viewed as medications by the general public, our bodies don’t know the difference between something that comes from a regulated medicine and something that comes from an unregulated supplement.

Ensuring accurate dosages and tracking adverse events are necessary for the protection of the public. Giving supplements a pass on regulatory scrutiny will continue to put us at risk, particularly the younger demographic that uses supplements at a higher rate.

If Congress doesn’t act to strengthen regulation of supplements, we will know that corporate business concerns trump public health.

MIAMI — Donald Trump does not believe polls that show him losing in Iowa to Ben Carson.
“I love Iowa and I honestly think those polls are wrong,” said Trump on Friday at a rally at his Trump National Doral resort and golf club.
Story Continued Below
After an extended wind-up in which he cited an extensive list of nationwide polls and polls from other states that continue to show him winning by wide margins, he said, “Let me give you the bad news.” Then he acknowledged the results of two Iowa polls this week that showed him falling behind retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.
“The biggest headline yesterday, he said: ‘Trump Falls to 2nd Place in Iowa Behind Ben Carson. We Informed Carson But He Was Sleeping.'""
“Ben Carson is leading Iowa supposedly. Ben Carson is super low energy. We need tremendous energy,"" Trump continued, recycling an attack he’s used repeatedly on Jeb Bush for Carson, who projects a mellow demeanor on the campaign trail.
The polls in question, conducted by Quinnipiac University's Peter Brown and Des Moines-based J. Ann Selzer, showed Carson ahead of Trump by 8 and 9 percentage points, respectively.
But Trump was having none of it.
“I don’t believe those polls, by the way, because both of those pollsters don’t like me,” he said, adding, “Both of those polling groups do not like me at all, and I disagree.”
He also criticized the press for playing up the numbers, which showed Trump falling behind one of his Republican rivals for the first time in months. “They made it seem like the greatest defeat in history,” he said.
“All day long, ugh my head,” he said of the aggravation the extensive news coverage of the polls has caused him.

Amid growing Democratic accusations of overreaching, especially on the matter of Hillary Clinton’s emails, Republicans on the House Benghazi Committee are now reconsidering how aggressively to pursue the email scandal that’s been dogging the Democratic front-runner. 
The committee is also undecided about whether to call ex-Clinton campaign staffer Heather Samuelson, who helped screen Clinton’s State Department emails, according to a GOP source. Just a few weeks ago, GOP members of the panel were eager to question Samuelson, because panel sources say she was the lawyer who initially chose which of Clinton’s emails were work-related — and thus should be turned over to the State Department — and which would ultimately get deleted.

Now, however, Republicans are debating whether to bring her in.
“The question becomes: Is it worth the hassle and the drama?” the GOP source said.
The reevaluation follows a Thursday hearing which was widely seen as a success for Clinton, while Republicans failed to strike any decisive blows. Meanwhile, Democrats amped up their claims that the entire investigation was a partisan witch hunt. 
The panel’s mandate was to investigate the circumstances surrounding the killing of four Americans outside the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012, in the waning months of Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state. But after the revelation that Clinton used a private email server for her State Department correspondence, Republicans on the panel began probing further into whether she had turned over all relevant emails.

Still, GOP leaders maintained that they’ve never focused directly on Clinton's email setup, which is currently being investigated by the FBI, although a fired GOP committee staffer said they zeroed in on the issue after the server was discovered. 
Faced with a growing barrage of Democratic accusations that they’re targeting Clinton for political reasons, Republicans on the panel are downplaying the email question — at least for now. After their high-profile turn in the national spotlight with Clinton’s Thursday testimony, the panel is headed back behind closed-doors for purely Benghazi-related interviews with officials from the White House, the Department of Defense and CIA, sources said.
Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) has long maintained he’s only interested in the emails because he wants to assemble a complete record of Clinton’s communications when she ran the State Department. During their investigation, Benghazi Republicans found about 15 Clinton emails that she never turned over — raising GOP suspicions that more might be missing. 
But the email issue only came up briefly at the tail end of her marathon Benghazi hearing. And Republicans spent the bulk of their time pressing Clinton over the security failures at the Libyan diplomatic mission, and attacked her leadership of the State Department. 
Still, even Gowdy admitted Clinton’s 11-hour testimony failed to produce any major new revelations. “I don’t know that she testified that much different today than she has previous times,” he told reporters after the hearing Thursday.
Republicans say Clinton’s testimony wasn’t about scoring points or catching her in a “gotcha” moment over the Benghazi attacks — or the emails issue, for that matter. They said they were aiming to piece together a larger mosaic around the Sept. 11, 2012 terrorist attack that left four Americans dead. 
But after a lengthy day of tense, and sometimes confrontational testimony, Democrats aren’t buying it. 
“I think the American people are left wondering what prompted the select committee at all; there is not a single new ray of light shed on the tragedy that took place years ago,” said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on a telephone call with reporters Friday. “The committee Republicans badgered Hillary Clinton at every turn, they interrupted her and threw the kitchen sink at her. But despite all of the attacks Hillary was rock solid.”

Panel Republicans and Democrats took to the TV cameras Friday to try to spin the hearing, with the left repeating their calls for the panel to disband, and the right insisting Clinton had been evasive.
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during a CNN appearance touted a series of new emails he questioned Clinton about, which show that she told her daughter, Chelsea, and the Egyptian prime minister that the attacks were pre-meditated — a statement that contrasted with what U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice would say on TV shortly after the assault. 
He also defended Gowdy’s comment that suggested Clinton had broken no new ground in her testimony. 
“Of course she gave the same answer; she stuck to her story,” he said. “That … is not that surprising.”
Jordan, a dogged Oversight panel member with a reputation for rapid-fire questions, was the only Republican who really took Clinton to task on the email issue Thursday. During the last round of questions, he pressed Clinton on why she would say she was being “as transparent as possible” when it took numerous lawsuits and demands from the committee before she turned over her documents.
Clinton did not offer a direct answer for many of Jordan's questions, including why she had given different dates for when she started using her private email and why she suggested the Secret Server protected her server. 
“Secretary Clinton, seems like there's a pattern, pattern of changing your story,” Jordan said. “[Y]ou say one thing, the truth comes out, weeks and months later, you say something else.”
Clinton said the panel should talk to her attorneys about those specifics.
And that was that. The committee spent less than 20 minutes on the matter in the 11 hour hearing.
Committee spokesman Jamal Ware said the panel will spend the next few weeks interviewing “two individuals whose identities must remain secret,” adding to more than 50 of about 70 they’ve already completed.
In the meantime, the committee might not say much about Clinton for a while, at least until the panel’s final report. 
“She’s an important witness, you can’t investigate Benghazi without talking to the secretary of state at the relevant time, but as I said this morning, she is one important witness out of 50,” Gowdy said shortly after the hearing ended on Thursday night. “In terms of conclusions drawn, I don’t draw conclusions until the end…. We’ll keep going on until we’re able to interview all the witnesses that we think have access to relevant information.”

Justice Department Says No Criminal Charges In IRS-Tea Party Investigation,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/10/23/451250865/justice-department-says-no-criminal-charges-in-irs-tea-party-investigation,npr,"
The U.S. Department of Justice said Friday that it did not find evidence to warrant criminal charges over the Internal Revenue Service's improper targeting of the Tea Party and other conservative groups in 2010 through 2013. The scandal led to a barrage of congressional hearings and an overhaul of IRS management, which forced out Commissioner Lois Lerner. ""The IRS mishandled the processing of tax-exempt applications in a manner that disproportionately impacted applicants affiliated with the Tea Party and similar groups,"" Assistant Attorney General Pater Kadzik said in a letter to lawmakers. ""However, ineffective management is not a crime."" NPR's Peter Overby reports for the Newscast unit:  ""Republicans alleged that the IRS targeted Tea Party and other conservative groups as they sought tax-exempt status as 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations. 501(c)(4)s are a fast-growing category of political groups that can keep their donors secret. ""Now, the Justice Department has told Congress it found no evidence of criminal intent at the IRS. It said ineffective management is not a crime. DOJ faulted one official, Lois Lerner, for poor decision-making, but said her personal political views were not a factor. ""Republican Congressman Darrell Issa who tried to have Lerner cited for contempt of Congress called the findings ""a low point of accountability for the administration.""  Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, echoed Issa's condemnation in a statement: ""The lack of accountability for the targeting scandal will hit a lot of Americans as plain wrong,"" he said. ""Anybody who deals with the IRS is entitled to the expectation that IRS employees respect taxpayer rights, and that those employees are well aware of those rights. None of that was true in the targeting scandal, yet the responsible IRS employees, including Lois Lerner and her bosses, were allowed to move on. Where was the IRS commissioner while the agency was treating conservative groups so poorly?""

Wisconsin Governor Signs Bill Limiting Political Corruption Inquiries,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/24/us/wisconsin-governor-signs-bill-limiting-political-corruption-inquiries.html,nyt,"CHICAGO —  Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who gave up his quest for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination last month, signed into law on Friday a measure that limits a longstanding tool against political corruption that has been used in investigations of Mr. Walker and his allies.

The John Doe law, as it is called in Wisconsin, has given prosecutors the power to obtain search warrants and order people to testify and turn over documents in investigations that typically take place in secret.

Under the measure, which easily passed both Republican-controlled chambers of the State Legislature, prosecutors will no longer be allowed to use the John Doe law to investigate crimes that include bribery and misconduct in office. The legislation will also limit proceedings to six months and lift an order that barred subjects of an investigation from discussing it publicly.

Prosecutors can still use the John Doe law to investigate violent crimes and drug-related felonies.

Six of Mr. Walker’s aides or allies were convicted as a result of a John Doe investigation. Mr. Walker’s former government office and, later, his campaign were the focus of John Doe investigations of campaign activities and fund-raising, but he was never charged.

Kelly M. Rindfleisch, deputy chief of staff to Mr. Walker during his time as Milwaukee county executive, pleaded guilty in 2012 to felony misconduct in public office after facing charges that she had used county time to perform campaign work.

Republicans said the change in the law was required to curb what they called unnecessarily long and intrusive investigations that amounted to political witch hunts. They said that other tools, like grand juries, could be used to investigate possible political crimes. In a joint statement last month, Robin Vos, the Assembly speaker, and Scott Fitzgerald, the Senate majority leader, said the legislation would allow “sensible changes to the state’s broad John Doe statutes.”

This week, the Assembly approved the bill overwhelmingly, 61 to 36, and the Senate passed it 18 to 14. Both votes fell along party lines.

Democrats denounced the bill as a measure to give politicians cover for committing crimes in office.

Peter Barca, the Democratic minority leader of the Assembly, said last week in anticipation of the bill’s passing, “The era of clean, open and transparent government in Wisconsin is over.”

“I fear for the future of democracy in Wisconsin, and I am not overstating the problem, in my judgment,” Mr. Barca said. Democrats also decried a bill, passed this week, to loosen campaign finance restrictions in the state.

Jennifer Shilling, the Senate minority leader, said in a statement on Friday that the bill to limit use of the John Doe law was “a gross abuse of political power.”

“Republicans should be less concerned about covering up Governor Walker’s political scandals and more focused on helping hardworking Wisconsin families,” she said.

Laurel Patrick, a spokeswoman for Mr. Walker, did not respond to a request for comment.

Jay Heck, executive director of Common Cause in Wisconsin, a nonprofit organization that lobbies for clean and open government and opposed the new legislation, said the John Doe law had allowed district attorneys to successfully prosecute political corruption that might not have been pursued otherwise.

“What this new law does is it exempts from the John Doe process crimes that are committed involving elections, campaign finance and ethics,” he said. “In other words, the crimes that politicians would be most likely to commit. They have carved out a special exemption for themselves.”",0.54948631977141593
Special New York Senate Race Shows Voters’ Distaste for Albany,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/24/nyregion/special-new-york-senate-race-shows-voters-distaste-for-albany.html,nyt,"BINGHAMTON, N.Y.  — A Republican state senator felled in a corruption investigation. A respected local Democrat running to replace him. An enthusiastic governor, also a Democrat, backing her campaign.

In a different year, or a different part of New York, those ingredients might have added up to a bonanza for Democrats. The party has aimed to take control of the State Senate in the 2016 elections, with a presidential campaign pulling voters to the polls and Republican incumbents on the defensive over a wave of ethics investigations targeting the Legislature.

But the special election in the economically distressed Southern Tier region along the Pennsylvania border has instead become an early barometer of voters’ disgust with state government — and perhaps a reality check for Democrats who hope to compete in rural parts of New York in 2016.

To compete after the resignation of Senator Thomas W. Libous, who was convicted in July of lying to federal investigators, both parties drafted candidates who have positioned themselves as political reformers. Barbara Fiala, 71, a former Broome County executive who served in Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s cabinet, seemed to give Democrats their best chance to compete in the conservative-leaning district.

But with the Nov. 3 vote approaching, even Ms. Fiala acknowledged that her bid has been largely overpowered by a Republican advertising campaign that has cast her opponent, a comparatively obscure law enforcement official named Fred Akshar, as a chainsaw-wielding political outsider eager to do battle in Albany.

The only public survey of the race, a Time Warner/Siena College poll released in late September, showed Mr. Akshar leading by 28 percentage points.

Ms. Fiala has tried to highlight her achievements in Broome County, branding herself in campaign materials as “the real choice for change in Albany.”

But she lamented that in the current environment, voters seemed to recoil from her experience in government. Republicans have assailed her for her tenure leading the State Department of Motor Vehicles under Mr. Cuomo, whose popularity has fallen steadily upstate.

“They don’t trust government; they don’t trust their politicians; they don’t trust Albany,” Ms. Fiala said of the voters, adding, “I have a good track record as county executive, and we’ve tried to bring that out in our message.”

The same poll exposed undiscriminating distaste for New York’s political leaders: About three in five voters said they had an unfavorable view of both Mr. Cuomo and the Republican-held State Senate. Fifty-six percent had a negative view of Mr. Libous.

Robert Blizzard, a pollster who advises Senate Republicans and the Akshar campaign, said Republicans had succeeded in making the race “a contrast between an Albany insider and a fresh face.”

Mr. Cuomo’s diminished standing in the district, he said, has also helped the Republican cause in the contest to serve the remainder of Mr. Libous’s unexpired term.

“Clearly, anything with ‘Albany’ attached to it is toxic,” Mr. Blizzard said.

Ms. Fiala has tried mightily to puncture Mr. Akshar’s aura of novelty; last week, she held a news conference to release a State Police report from 2009 that she said implicated Mr. Akshar, 36, in having “covered up a domestic violence incident” involving a nephew of his longtime girlfriend.

In the report, Mr. Akshar, a Broome County undersheriff, is portrayed as having helped retrieve the nephew from the scene of a car crash — which the nephew’s girlfriend accused him of deliberately causing while under the influence of alcohol — before the authorities could investigate.

The episode, Ms. Fiala said, revealed Mr. Akshar’s flawed character. “I do know corruption when I see it,” she said.

Mr. Akshar denied that he did anything improper in the matter and said at a brief news conference that a review cleared him of wrongdoing. But his aides declined to make him available for an interview.

The Republican has run a tightly controlled campaign operation, rarely speaking to the news media and leaning on television advertising and paid political mail to communicate his message. The Akshar campaign denied a reporter’s request to observe the taping of a television debate last week.

State Senate Republicans have given muscular financial support to Mr. Akshar’s campaign: At the start of the month, they reported sending him nearly $200,000 in contributions from their political committee and from the individual campaign accounts of several lawmakers.

Mr. Akshar has channeled that money mainly into television commercials, spending nearly a quarter-million dollars on ads, according to his campaign finance report — nearly three times Ms. Fiala’s television spending.

Bijoy Datta, the chairman of the Broome County Republican Party who speaks frequently for Mr. Akshar, said Republicans had blunted any backlash over Mr. Libous’s downfall by recruiting a youthful candidate with a background in the sheriff’s office.

“There’s no question that there’s a clear differentiation, when you have a guy who has such a stellar record like Fred, who comes from law enforcement,” said Mr. Datta, a former political aide to Mr. Libous.

If that political model appears to be working for Republicans in the 52nd District, in a special election campaign fought over inexpensive airwaves, the party is likely to face a far taller order replicating that approach in 2016.

Indeed, in 2016, Democrats are eager to apply nearly the same messaging — outsiders challenging insiders, candidates channeling revulsion with Albany — in races with entrenched Republican senators on the ballot, defending more diverse and suburban districts across the state.

Since Mr. Libous’s resignation, Republicans hold 31 seats in the 63-seat Senate chamber — short of a majority, but their numbers have been padded by six senators who were elected as Democrats but caucus with Republicans.

In addition to the seat held by Mr. Libous, one other Senate district is on the ballot this fall: a seat based in Brooklyn that was previously held by John L. Sampson, a Democrat convicted in July in a corruption trial.

Democrats are expected to easily retain that seat.

Senator Michael N. Gianaris, who leads the Democratic campaign committee, said the party was looking forward to putting Republicans on the defensive over what voters widely perceive as a broken Legislature.

“Next year is going to be a very favorable environment for Democrats running against Republican incumbents, who have been part of the problem in Albany for so long,” said Mr. Gianaris, from Queens. “And a presidential election is widely known to increase Democratic turnout, so that should also work in our favor.”

Ms. Fiala, too, said she could imagine a more inviting political environment in 2016, when the Libous seat comes up for re-election. Should she lose this time, Ms. Fiala said, she could consider a second try.

A longtime Broome County politician who started her career in the Civil Service, Ms. Fiala entered the special election early in the summer, after Mr. Libous’s resignation.

She had spoken in the past to Senate Democrats about potentially seeking the seat, but the campaign accelerated quickly after Mr. Cuomo declared in a radio interview that Ms. Fiala was the best possible Democrat to run there.

Ms. Fiala, who said she had not requested a campaign visit from Mr. Cuomo, called the governor’s endorsement a testament to her abilities.

“I was part of his cabinet,” she said. “He knows my work ethic. He knows what I can do. He knows I know government.”",0.39879663462200693

Benghazi: GOP's helping hand for Hillary Clinton,http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/23/opinions/gergen-gop-helping-hand-for-hillary/index.html,cnn,"David Gergen is a senior political analyst for CNN and has been a White House adviser to four presidents. A graduate of Harvard Law School, he is a professor of public service and co-director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School. Follow him on Twitter: @david_gergen. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.
 (CNN)For Hillary Clinton, Republicans have become the gift that keeps on giving. Mrs. Clinton owes much of her extraordinary comeback to her own abilities, but surely she must be grateful to the GOP as well. Never in modern times has a political party done so much to rehabilitate the leading presidential candidate in the other party.  
The gifts have come in rapid succession:
-- The way Republicans have converted Donald Trump into GOP front-runner. For all for their misgivings about Clinton, Trump scares the bejesus out of millions of Americans. How long before we see sprouting of groups like ""Republican Women for Hillary""?
-- The assertion by two Republican House members -- one the GOP majority leader -- that the Benghazi hearings were rigged to discredit Clinton. 
-- The ouster of Speaker John Boehner by hard-right Republicans because he hasn't been sufficiently tough enough, a clear signal of who is running the House. Ask Mitt Romney how damaging it was to him to be seen as a captive of the far right.
-- And, of course, this week's marathon grilling of Clinton by the Benghazi committee that fortified the widespread belief -- some 70% of people on the eve of the testimony according to a CNN poll -- that the hearings were a partisan witch hunt.
The hearings could be especially helpful to Clinton because they played out on prime-time television before a sizable audience -- some 5.24 million between Fox, MSNBC and CNN -- so that massive numbers of voters could judge for themselves. As it turned out, those prime-ime hours were the ones in which Republican members, tired and frustrated, did their worst badgering.  
Naturally enough, some conservatives relished the hearings. Editorial writers for the Wall Street Journal, for example, argued that instead of yielding nothing, the hearings showed that even as Clinton was telling the Egyptians that terrorists had planned and carried out Benghazi, the administration was still claiming a film had triggered a spontaneous attack. 
They have a good point, just as do Republican members who complain about how slow the Obama administration has been in yielding documents.  But these disputes are not the stuff of scandal.  (And who has been telling the bigger lie: those who first misled us about the film -- and soon corrected themselves -- or those who continue to insist the Clinton hearing was impartial?)    
What most Americans instinctively want are leaders who are respectful of each other, listen well and are open-minded.  And for much of the post-World War II period, that was usually the norm (the McCarthy period was a great exception).  
As Clinton pointed out in her opening statement, there have been numerous instances in recent years in which terrorists broke through our defenses and murdered Americans. Investigations always followed but never the kind of disrespectful treatment against a secretary of state as the nation saw this week.  And never the impugning of the integrity of distinguished public servants like Ambassador Tom Pickering and Adm. Michael Mullen as we witnessed.
Do you think the Benghazi committee would have conducted itself this way if the star witness had not been Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee? The question answers itself.  
In this coming political year, the country needs a robust debate about our direction and plans for going forward. We are at a critical inflection point on many fronts.  And we would be best-served if we could decide between two strong candidates representing two strong parties. But judging from recent events, we may not get there -- the Republicans could give it away long before the vote.

Trump slams Carson amid dipping poll numbers in Iowa,http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/23/politics/donald-trump-ben-carson-iowa-polls-immigration/index.html,cnn,"Jake Tapper's full interview with Donald Trump will air Sunday at 9 a.m. ET on CNN's ""State of the Union.""
Miami (CNN)Donald Trump on Friday knocked Ben Carson as weak on trade and immigration as he reacted to two new polls showing Carson overtaking the real estate mogul for first place in Iowa.
Trump told CNN's Jake Tapper that he was ""really surprised"" to see his fortunes dipping in Iowa and said he is going to need ""to work a little bit harder in Iowa"" to win back support in the first-in-the-nation caucus state. Two polls released Thursday and Friday showed Trump slipping to second place in Iowa with 20% and 19% of support, respectively, while Carson surged to first place with 28% in both polls.
""I've done really well with the evangelicals and with the tea party and everything and I just don't understand the number, but I accept the number,"" Trump said. ""It means I have to work a little bit harder in Iowa.""
While Trump has repeatedly emphasized that he is a ""counter-puncher"" and only attacks other candidates once they've attacked him, his assault on the retired neurosurgeon wasn't a response to anything Carson has said about Trump. In fact, Carson has been one of the only candidates to pull his punches against Trump, repeatedly refusing to criticize the billionaire who maintains his lead in the national polls.
""I like Ben, but he cannot do with trade like I do,"" Trump said. ""He can't do with a lot of things like I do, so we'll just have to see what happens.""
He added that he worries that Carson is ""just not going to be able to do deals with China, to be able to do deals with Japan.""
Trump's business and deal-making experience are key planks of his candidacy.
Trump most fiercely criticized Carson on immigration, accusing him of supporting amnesty.
""He's very, very weak on immigration and I'm very strong on immigration,"" Trump said. ""Ben Carson is very, very weak on immigration. He believes in amnesty strongly. He believes in citizenship. He's going to give citizenship to people who are here illegally -- you can't do that.""
Carson supports giving undocumented immigrants guest worker status if they come forward and report their presence in the country.
He has repeatedly denied the characterization of his plan as amnesty, but has left the door open to those guest workers eventually becoming citizens.
""We have to recognize that we can't just round them up, but we can give them an opportunity to register,"" Carson said last month on CBS. ""I would give them an opportunity to become guest workers -- not citizens, not voting people, not people who get goodies. I think that would be a fair way to do it. In terms of them becoming citizens later on down the road if they've done things the right way, we the American people will decide what the criteria for that ought to be.""

Protesters interrupt Trump during rally,http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/23/politics/donald-trump-miami-rally/index.html,cnn,"Miami (CNN)Groups of protesters disrupted Donald Trump's speech here three times on Friday night.
His supporters vigorously drowned out the protesters with boos, cheers and shouts of ""USA,"" We want Trump"" and ""Go home.""
Some Trump supporters also jostled the protesters and called them ""illegals"" as they were booted from the event by campaign staff and security.
""Don't hurt 'em, don't hurt 'em,"" said Trump, mindful that past protests have pushed some of his supporters to physical violence. ""You can get 'em out, just don't hurt 'em.""
Trump added, ""That's what freedom of speech is about.""
There were three separate groups of protesters, but only a handful in each group. As the third disruption of protesters broke out, Trump warned any potential hecklers that he would not be so nice if they interrupted him again.
He continued to fire up his supporters who had gathered at his National Miami Doral resort.
""Isn't this more fun than having like a normal deal?"" Trump asked. ""This is more fun, right?""

Wall St Week Ahead-Nasdaq 100 index may see record with Apple earnings due Tuesday,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/companyNews/~3/k-Px86Ttbss/story01.htm,reuters,"NEW YORK Oct 23 The Nasdaq 100 index,
dominated by U.S. technology stocks, may set a record high next
week, helped by good earnings from Apple Inc expected
on Tuesday.
Technology shares led the U.S. stock market's recovery this 
week from its worst correction in four years in August, thanks
to gains in Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft
, after the three companies reported
better-than-expected earnings results.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.9 percent to
17,646.70, the S&P 500 index recovered another 1.1
percent to 2,075.15, and the Nasdaq Composite closed the
week up 2.27 percent at 5,031.86.
Shares across Asia, Europe and the Americas all climbed,
boosted by Thursday's message from European Central Bank chief
Mario Draghi that he was ready to increase the ECB's bond buying
program, and by an interest rate cut by China's central bank.
Factors this coming week that may provide further support
for U.S. stocks include a Federal Reserve policy meeting, which
is not expected to raise interest rates yet, a report on U.S.
third-quarter economic growth, and earnings from Apple.
The Nasdaq 100 index, including Apple, is just 1.5 percent
below its year high and 4.0 percent from its record high back in
March 2000.
Intel and Microsoft have seen their stocks
recover more than 30 percent each since Aug. 25, while Amazon
 and Facebook rose 28 percent and 23 percent, 
respectively.
But the 'underperformer' among these companies has been
Apple, up only 14.8 percent from its Aug. 25 close,
less than the Nasdaq 100's 15.1 percent gain in that time.
In contrast to Microsoft, Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon,
Apple shares did not post record or multi-year highs
this week, even though it rose 7.2 percent, the largest weekly
gain in a year.
On Tuesday, though, Apple is expected to report $51.1
billion in revenue, a 21.3 percent increase compared to the same
quarter of last year. Earnings are seen at $1.879 per share.
""The bar has been raised a bit on its earnings report from
where it was a week ago. The price action is telling you there's
more optimism built into it,"" said Michael James, managing
director of equities trading at Wedbush Securities in Los
Angeles.
Options market action shows traders expect Apple shares to
move roughly 5.0 percent by the end of next week. The average
move for the stock the day after its report in the last eight
quarters was 4.4 percent, up or down.
""Will an above-estimates from Apple and raised guidance
help? Sure it will. But we could still get there without that
happening,"" said James of the possibility of the Nasdaq 100
hitting a record.
""The power of the moves in some of these large cap tech
stocks has been breathtaking,"" he said.
Chip makers were also among the top five percentage gainers
in the Nasdaq 100 since the index closed at its 2015 low on Aug.
25, with SanDisk topping the list with a 70 percent
jump on the back of a takeover bid from Western Digital.
The overwhelming leadership from established technology
companies is a positive for this market move higher, according
to Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt
Capital Group in Pittsburgh.
""The last time the Nasdaq 100 was the market leader a lot of
it was speculative investments, but these (tech) companies
actually return money to shareholders,"" she said.
""Tech deserves the leadership; the stock market is rewarding
growth.""

BIOTECH THE FLIP SIDE TO TECH STOCK LEADERSHIP
While technology stocks have led the market recovery,
biotech stocks have been a drag on performance.
The Nasdaq Biotech Index is down 3.5 percent from its
Aug. 25 close, and more than 20 percent below its year high. The
three index components with the largest declines in market
capitalization in the last eight weeks are Mylan,
Illumina and Biogen.
""There has been a major rotation out of healthcare and into
tech and it has continued after the recent earnings reports,""
said Wedbush's James, referring to strong results from Amazon,
Microsoft and Alphabet.
Biotech stocks were shaken in September when U.S.
presidential candidate Hillary Clinton first tweeted concerns
about drug prices and the selling spread to other areas of the
healthcare sector. Investors have been dumping shares of
everything from hospitals to traditional pharmaceutical
companies and insurers in recent weeks.
Since peaking in July, the Nasdaq Biotech Index has
fallen 23 percent, the broad S&P Health Care Index has
lost 12 percent and the S&P 500 Health Care Facilities index
 is down 31 percent.
Fund managers now say they expect regulatory threats on drug
prices, disappointing earnings, higher interest rates that could
hurt heavily indebted hospitals, and the loss of the initial
Obamacare boost to business to all weigh on health sector stocks
this year.

HIGHLIGHTS
BUSH CAMPAIGN CUTS SALARIES, LAYS OFF HEADQUARTERS STAFF: Republican presidential candidateÂ Jeb BushÂ is cutting staff salaries across the board and downsizing his Miami headquarters to reduce payroll costs by 40% as he struggles to regain front-runner status in the polls and campaign fundraising.Â Mr. Bush is also cutting travel costs by 20% and 45% of his non-media, voter-contact budget.Â The campaign will be recalibrated to focus more intensely on the states hosting the earliest nominating contests, particularly New Hampshire.
The drastic measures â announced to staffers in a conference call Friday morning â followsÂ Mr. Bush’s Â fall to fifth place in theÂ latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.Â The donor network built by his father and brother,Â former Presidents George H.W. Bush and President George W. Bush, is mostly disengaged and splintered. A campaign memo said the campaign isÂ “unapologetic about adjusting our game plan to meet the evolving dynamics of this race” to ensure a win.Â Beth Reinhard reports.

WASHINGTON WIRE: DONALD TRUMP HAS A BAD WEEK
Donald Trump is dropping in the polls. Cable TV networks are no longer taking his rallies live. His assertion he was funding his campaign with his own cash has turned out not to be true. He blamed an unsavory retweet on an intern.

State Can’t Verify Clinton Email Claim Made At Benghazi Hearing,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/10/23/state-cant-verify-clinton-email-claim-made-at-benghazi-hearing/,wsj,"The State Department said it can’t confirm one of the assertions Hillary Clinton made at Thursday’s House Benghazi Committee hearing from her tenure as Secretary of State.
One of the sticking points in Mrs. Clinton’s testimony in front of the Benghazi panel was her claim that 90% to 95% of her work emails were automatically preserved in the State Department’s system.
Late in Mrs. Clinton’s marathon, 11-hour long appearance on Capitol Hill, she told the panel’s Republican chairman that “90 to 95% of my work related emails were in the State’s system, if they wanted to see them, they would certainly have been able to do so.”
But State Department spokesman Mark Toner on Friday said the figure is something her campaign is using and referred questions to them for “the rationale or the background behind it.”
“I’m not aware that we have given that figure,” he said at a press briefing. “I’m not in a position right now to confirm that.”
During her testimony, the former secretary sourced that statistic to the State Department, and stuck by it upon questioning from the panel’s Republican chairman, Trey Gowdy.
“We learned that from the State Department and their analysis of the emails that were already on the system. We were trying to help them close some gaps that they had,” said Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic front runner in the 2016 presidential race.
The question goes to the heart of the controversy over Mrs. Clinton’s email arrangement: Did her use of a personal server adversely impact the federal government’s ability to keep records about her time in office?
Mrs. Clinton’s defense is that when she emailed government officials, she used their work email accounts and therefore most of her emails should have been captured on government servers and available there.
But electronic and paper government recordkeeping systems are far from perfect, and searching every inbox across the entire federal government to get access to Mrs. Clinton’s email records would be a logistically impractical — if not impossible — way to obtain her full email archive, which has long been sought by journalists, investigators and Republican opposition researchers.
A spokesman pointed to a Clinton campaign fact sheet from March as the possible source of the statistic.
The fact sheet in question finds that more than 90% of the emails in Mrs. Clinton’s inbox were with officials with a “.gov” account. That’s a separate claim from they were automatically preserved and accessible to officials.
Mrs. Clinton’s campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment.
The department’s record-keeping systems have been under intense scrutiny since the story about Mrs. Clinton’s email broke. An inspector general report in March found that only about 60,000 emails out of more than a billion sent and received in 2011 were saved electronically.
By law, Mrs. Clinton’s work-related emails — whether on a personal server or a government account — are public records eligible for at least partial release under the Freedom of Information Act. There are more than 30 lawsuits pending against the State Department related to Mrs. Clinton’s records.

"Democrats Demand End to Benghazi Panel, But Will Continue to Participate",http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/10/23/democrats-demand-end-to-benghazi-panel-but-will-continue-to-participate/,wsj,"One day after former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton‘s testimony before a congressional panel probing the 2012 Benghazi attacks, seniorÂ Democrats called for it to be shut down entirely â but say they won’t pull out ofÂ the committee.
âAfter meeting with [Democratic Minority Leader Nancy] Pelosi today, we are calling on [House Speaker John] Boehner to immediately shut down this abusive, wasteful, and obviously partisan effort,” the five Democrats on the panel said in a joint statement. âIf the speaker rejects our request, Democrats will continue to participate at this point in order to make sure the facts are known and the conspiracy theories are debunked.”
The five Democratic members of the panel are Reps. Elijah CummingsÂ of Maryland, Adam Smith of Washington, Adam Schiff and Linda Sanchez of California, and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois. TheyÂ came to Mrs. Clinton’s defense during the day-long hearing, counteringÂ their Republican colleagues by allowingÂ herÂ time to giveÂ detailed answers about the attacks and objecting loudly to lines of questioning they complained were inappropriate.
Increasingly in recent weeks, Democrats have been questioningÂ the motivationÂ of the panel, which is charged with probing the 2012 attack that killed four Americans, including a U.S. ambassador. They have alleged that its aimÂ is to damage Mrs. Clinton’s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. She testified all day Thursday before the panel, but emerged largely unscathed.
Four seniorÂ Senators also demandedÂ the committee to be dissolved. Sens. Chuck Schumer, Dianne Feinstein, Claire McCaskill and Jeanne ShaheenÂ said Friday it had become clear the panel was a partisanÂ political exercise.
“The committee is a political sham that dishonors the memories of Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty,” said Mr. Schumer, a New York Democrat, referring to the four victims of the attack,
Democrats pointed toÂ the tone of the questions, the length of the hearing and the fact that few new facts were uncovered after hours of questioning.
“I know of no historical fact that indicates that any secretary of state of this country has ever been treated like this. I found that appalling,” said Mrs. Feinstein.
Republicans defended need for another congressional investigation â the eighth inquery into the Benghazi attacks.
“This committee is the first committee to thoroughly and individually interview scores of other witnesses, many of them for the first time. This committee is the first committee to review thousands of pages of documents from top State Department personnel,” said chairman Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican, in his opening remarks on Thursday.

Video Report: How Benghazi Played Out on Social Media,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/10/23/video-report-how-benghazi-played-out-on-social-media/,wsj,"Social media was abuzz as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton faced questions from the House Select Committee on Benghazi. According to Twitter trends, there were more than 320,000 posts about the hearing with the hashtag #benghazicommittee.
Despite the plethora of political jabs, one of the most buzzworthy moments of the day didn’t involve a word of Clinton’s testimony; it was centered around a fiery exchange between Rep. Trey Gowdy (R., South Carolina) and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D., Md.) regarding the transcript of a previous interview with Mrs. Clinton’s informal adviser Sidney Blumenthal. Here’s a video report from WSJ’s Shelby Holliday.

"Jeb Bush campaign in reboot mode as salaries, staff cut",http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/MostRead/~3/4enDh8DYyFw/story01.htm,reuters,"WASHINGTON Republican Jeb Bush's struggling presidential campaign is cutting salaries across the board and reducing staff in a money-saving effort intended to concentrate resources on early voting states, an internal memo said on Friday.
The memo, seen by Reuters, said payroll costs were being slashed by 40 percent and staff at the campaign's Miami headquarters drastically cut back with some workers offered positions at reduced pay in states that vote early in the nominating process, such as New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina and Nevada.
The move follows a dramatic fall in Republican voters' support for Bush's attempt to secure his party's nomination for the November 2016 election and to become the third member of the famous Bush family to win the White House.
""We are making changes today to ensure Jeb is best positioned to win the nomination and general election,"" the memo said.
Once considered the heavy favorite for the nomination, the former Florida governor is running far behind poll leaders Donald Trump and Ben Carson in national polls and in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states on the 2016 election nominating calendar.
Now, Bush is facing questions as to whether he has the ability to remain a viable candidate. A key test will be next week when he appears on stage with his rivals at the third Republican debate, in Boulder, Colorado.
Appearing at a forum on Friday at Regent University in Virginia Beach, Virginia, Bush was asked by moderator Pat Robertson whether the cost-cutting was aimed at making his campaign leaner ""or does this mean you're in trouble?""
""This means lean and mean and means that I have the ability to adapt,"" Bush said. ""I have not met a person who thought Donald Trump would be the front-running candidate at this point. God bless him for his success in that regard. We'll see how long it lasts. But you have to adapt.""
In a poll of likely Iowa Republican caucus participants released on Thursday by Quinnipiac University, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson led the Republican field with 28 percent support, followed by Trump at 20 percent. Bush was tied in sixth place with former business executive Carly Fiorina with 5 percent.
Bush's move to reduce expenses comes a month after the departure from the race of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who ran out of cash.
""If you do the right thing about budget cuts at the right time, they don't necessarily affect your chances,"" said Republican strategist Charlie Black, citing the examples of Ronald Reagan in 1979 and John McCain in 2007.

DONOR RETREAT THIS WEEKEND
Bush's heavy policy focus has shown him to be among the more serious candidates in the Republican field, but he has often been drowned out by Trump's bombastic rhetoric and has lacked the polished communication skills of rivals such as U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.
Bush announced last week that his third-quarter fund-raising was $13.4 million, a competitive sum but not enough to finance the large campaign operation he had built. As of last week he had $10 million in cash on hand.
""It's no secret that the contours of this race have changed from what was anticipated at the start,"" the memo said.
The Bush campaign also sought to reassure donors who have started to doubt that their candidate still has a path to the nomination. 
Bush and his senior aides are staging a two-day donor retreat in Houston on Sunday and Monday that will feature appearances by his father, former President George H.W. Bush, and his brother former President George W. Bush.
The retreat will give donors a sense of where the campaign stands now and what is planned for the next 100 days, an aide said.
The staff deployments from Miami will have a special focus on increasing the Bush presence in New Hampshire. Bush will make more trips to the early voting states as well.
""We are unapologetic about adjusting our game plan to meet the evolving dynamics of this race to ensure that outcome,"" the memo said.
The cost-cutting moves were welcome in the Bush donor community, where there have been concerns about his prospects.
""I particularly appreciate that this strategy shift was quick, strategic and bold. As a donor, I am thrilled to see the campaign focus the lion's share of resources on voter contact and this will redirect energy to early states,"" said Slater Bayliss, a Florida lobbyist who is bundling donations for Bush.

Wall St Week Ahead-Nasdaq 100 index may see record with Apple earnings due Tuesday,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/technologysectorNews/~3/yon48O1rujI/story01.htm,reuters,"NEW YORK Oct 23 The Nasdaq 100 index,
dominated by U.S. technology stocks, may set a record high next
week, helped by good earnings from Apple Inc expected
on Tuesday.
Technology shares led the U.S. stock market's recovery this 
week from its worst correction in four years in August, thanks
to gains in Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft
, after the three companies reported
better-than-expected earnings results.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.9 percent to
17,646.70, the S&P 500 index recovered another 1.1
percent to 2,075.15, and the Nasdaq Composite closed the
week up 2.27 percent at 5,031.86.
Shares across Asia, Europe and the Americas all climbed,
boosted by Thursday's message from European Central Bank chief
Mario Draghi that he was ready to increase the ECB's bond buying
program, and by an interest rate cut by China's central bank.
Factors this coming week that may provide further support
for U.S. stocks include a Federal Reserve policy meeting, which
is not expected to raise interest rates yet, a report on U.S.
third-quarter economic growth, and earnings from Apple.
The Nasdaq 100 index, including Apple, is just 1.5 percent
below its year high and 4.0 percent from its record high back in
March 2000.
Intel and Microsoft have seen their stocks
recover more than 30 percent each since Aug. 25, while Amazon
 and Facebook rose 28 percent and 23 percent, 
respectively.
But the 'underperformer' among these companies has been
Apple, up only 14.8 percent from its Aug. 25 close,
less than the Nasdaq 100's 15.1 percent gain in that time.
In contrast to Microsoft, Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon,
Apple shares did not post record or multi-year highs
this week, even though it rose 7.2 percent, the largest weekly
gain in a year.
On Tuesday, though, Apple is expected to report $51.1
billion in revenue, a 21.3 percent increase compared to the same
quarter of last year. Earnings are seen at $1.879 per share.
""The bar has been raised a bit on its earnings report from
where it was a week ago. The price action is telling you there's
more optimism built into it,"" said Michael James, managing
director of equities trading at Wedbush Securities in Los
Angeles.
Options market action shows traders expect Apple shares to
move roughly 5.0 percent by the end of next week. The average
move for the stock the day after its report in the last eight
quarters was 4.4 percent, up or down.
""Will an above-estimates from Apple and raised guidance
help? Sure it will. But we could still get there without that
happening,"" said James of the possibility of the Nasdaq 100
hitting a record.
""The power of the moves in some of these large cap tech
stocks has been breathtaking,"" he said.
Chip makers were also among the top five percentage gainers
in the Nasdaq 100 since the index closed at its 2015 low on Aug.
25, with SanDisk topping the list with a 70 percent
jump on the back of a takeover bid from Western Digital.
The overwhelming leadership from established technology
companies is a positive for this market move higher, according
to Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt
Capital Group in Pittsburgh.
""The last time the Nasdaq 100 was the market leader a lot of
it was speculative investments, but these (tech) companies
actually return money to shareholders,"" she said.
""Tech deserves the leadership; the stock market is rewarding
growth.""

BIOTECH THE FLIP SIDE TO TECH STOCK LEADERSHIP
While technology stocks have led the market recovery,
biotech stocks have been a drag on performance.
The Nasdaq Biotech Index is down 3.5 percent from its
Aug. 25 close, and more than 20 percent below its year high. The
three index components with the largest declines in market
capitalization in the last eight weeks are Mylan,
Illumina and Biogen.
""There has been a major rotation out of healthcare and into
tech and it has continued after the recent earnings reports,""
said Wedbush's James, referring to strong results from Amazon,
Microsoft and Alphabet.
Biotech stocks were shaken in September when U.S.
presidential candidate Hillary Clinton first tweeted concerns
about drug prices and the selling spread to other areas of the
healthcare sector. Investors have been dumping shares of
everything from hospitals to traditional pharmaceutical
companies and insurers in recent weeks.
Since peaking in July, the Nasdaq Biotech Index has
fallen 23 percent, the broad S&P Health Care Index has
lost 12 percent and the S&P 500 Health Care Facilities index
 is down 31 percent.
Fund managers now say they expect regulatory threats on drug
prices, disappointing earnings, higher interest rates that could
hurt heavily indebted hospitals, and the loss of the initial
Obamacare boost to business to all weigh on health sector stocks
this year.

Hot Dog Lovers Relish Emoji Victory,http://www.wsj.com/articles/hot-dog-lovers-relish-emoji-victory-1445592601,wsj,"A Chicago-area hot dog stand is relishing its victory after a nearly two-year social media campaign to secure a place for the all-American meat product in the lexicon of emojis.
A new version of software for Apple Inc.’s iPhone, iPad and other products released this week included a pictogram of a hot dog on a bun with mustard that users can employ to spice up their texts and tweets.
Laura Ustick, a third-generation member of the family that owns Superdawg drive-in, couldn’t be more pleased.
Ms. Ustick said she was monitoring “the hot dog emoji chatter on the Internet” while working the lunch shift at the two-outlet chain’s restaurant in Wheeling, Ill., on Wednesday, when she saw that the new operating system was available.
“I had to run off the line and download it,” she said. “I think I was one of the first ones. I had to do that to truly spread the word to everyone.”
Now, the restaurant’s Twitter account is virtually lined with hot-dog emoji wallpaper.
Ms. Ustick said she helped organize and harness the interest in a hot-dog emoji, but the effort really took off with a page one article in The Wall Street Journal in March 2014.
At the time, a spokesman for the Unicode Consortium, an international nonprofit that standardizes coding for things like emojis, said a hot-dog emoji seemed like a long shot. But after pressure from Ms. Ustick and her Hot Dog Emoji Coalition on Facebook, the group eventually relented.
In June 2015, Unicode gave thumbs up to a hot dog emoji, along with emojis for unicorn, taco and popcorn, among other things.
Ms. Ustick said she had vowed not to use any emojis until the hot dog was approved.
Now that she has access to the hot dog, she’s exploring the world of emojis almost for the first time. “I’m going a little crazy,” she said.

"New Mexico Secretary of State, Dianna Duran, Pleads Guilty to Fraud",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/24/us/new-mexico-secretary-of-state-dianna-duran-pleads-guilty-to-fraud.html,nyt,"PHOENIX — The New Mexico secretary of state, Dianna Duran, pleaded guilty on Friday to embezzlement and money laundering for using campaign contributions to pay gambling debts. She had resigned hours earlier, one of the terms of a plea agreement that, if approved by the judge, could spare her from prison time.

Speaking to reporters after her appearance before Judge T. Glenn Ellington of State District Court, Ms. Duran said, “I realized that I made some choices that were not healthy, and I will be seeking professional help.” Later, she said her decision to plead guilty was made “in the best interests of my family and all New Mexicans.”

Her sentencing has been scheduled for Dec. 14.

Ms. Duran, a Republican, faced 65 charges, after the attorney general, Hector Balderas, a Democrat, filed a criminal complaint in August accusing her of illegally transferring about $13,000 in campaign donations to personal accounts, where it was used in casinos around the state. Campaign finance reports were also modified to hide the transfers.

She had remained in office despite pressure from both sides of the aisle and calls for her resignation by a leading newspaper in the state.

Through the deal, she admitted to six charges, four misdemeanors and two felonies, in exchange for five years of probation.

In a statement, Mr. Balderas said, “I am hopeful that this resolution will begin to rebuild the public trust and compel the new leadership to improve oversight and compliance in our campaign finance system and electoral process.”

As the first Republican to serve as New Mexico secretary of state since 1928, Ms. Duran had once been considered an integral part of the party’s rise under Gov. Susana Martinez in a traditionally Democratic stronghold. She entered public service in 1979 and won her first election, for Otero County clerk, in 1988. From there, she rose to the State Senate and, in 2010, became the second-highest elected official in the state.

Ms. Duran submitted a brief resignation letter to Ms. Martinez late Thursday after canceling a previously scheduled hearing to discuss changes to campaign finance rules. In it, she wrote: “Although I may be leaving office, I shall always reflect upon the last 36 years of service, honored to work with you and others, serving the citizens of New Mexico.”

Ms. Martinez will pick a replacement to fulfill Ms. Duran’s term, which ends in 2016. She was expected to announce her selection in the coming weeks, a spokesman for the governor, Chris Sanchez, said in a statement. Until then, the position will be filled by the deputy secretary of state, Mary Quintana.",0.37775835707758543

Hillary Clinton rarely stumbled during Thursday's marathon House Benghazi Committee hearing, but as the session wore on some of the Democratic presidential candidate's comments about her private email setup mangled the facts and fueled lingering questions about how her team decided which messages to turn over to her former agency.
One of Clinton's assertions fell into doubt Friday as the State Department said it was unaware of any basis for her claim that the agency ""had between 90 and 95 percent of all [her] work-related e-mails"" even before she turned over 54,000 pages of records last December.
Story Continued Below
""I'm not aware that we have given that figure,"" State spokesman Mark Toner told reporters Friday. ""We've not been able to confirm that. I not sure where that information comes from.""
Pressed by House Benghazi Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy on the issue late in the 11-hour hearing, Clinton said her former agency made the assessment that nearly all her emails were already on file.
""We learned that from the State Department and their analysis of the emails that were already on the system. We were trying to help them close some gaps that they had,"" she said.
Toner referred questions about Clinton's remarks to her campaign, which did not respond to requests for comment on the issue Friday. In a fact sheet released in March, Clinton's office said about 90 percent of the emails she turned over were produced because they contained ""state.gov"" or other official federal government addresses. Her team did not assert at that time that State had concluded it already had 90 percent of her work-related emails.
State officials have said that their electronic record-keeping practices at the time were lax and that sending or receiving an email on an official account did not guarantee that it would be archived. In fact, automatic archiving for senior State officials other than the secretary did not begin until February of this year, officials said.



            By 
Gabriel Debenedetti

""Just because an email is sent or received from a '.gov' address doesn't mean it is automatically being archived somewhere. That is a common misperception made by people employed at all levels of government,"" said Jason R. Baron, a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration.
Baron also said it is doubtful State had the ability to reach the conclusion Clinton claimed about how much of her work-related email the agency was storing.
""I do not believe State is in the position to give a precise percentage like that because they honestly wouldn't know how many of the secretary's emails did in fact make their way into an official record keeping system,"" he said.
During her testimony Friday, Clinton also sowed confusion by providing differing descriptions of her involvement in the process of reviewing her private emails in response to an official State Department request last October to turn over all official government records in her possession.
At one point , she stressed her detachment from the decisions about what to turn over, while at another juncture she suggested she was effectively sorting her emails during her tenure by forwarding work-related ones to aides and not forwarding others. GOP lawmakers have said informal Clinton adviser Sidney Blumenthal provided 15 email exchanges to the committee that Clinton did not turn over to the State Department.
Clinton told Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) that her lawyers made the decision on what to deem work related and what was considered private. ""They did all of that, and I did not look over their shoulders, because I thought it would be appropriate for them to conduct that search, and they did,"" she said.
However, minutes later, Clinton appeared to tell Gowdy that any differences in what was turned over were due to her effectively sorting the emails on the fly during her time as secretary. 
""He had some that I didn't have, and I had some that he didn't have,"" the former secretary said of Blumenthal. ""I was under no obligation to make any of his emails available unless I decided they were work related. And the ones that I decided that were work related I forwarded to the state.gov accounts of the people with whom I worked.""
When Gowdy asserted there was ""no ambiguity"" that the messages Blumenthal's attorney turned over related to work, Clinton suggested there was.
""They were from a personal friend ... not any government official,"" she said. ""I determined on the basis of looking at them, what I thought was work related and what wasn't. And some I didn't even have time to read, Mr. Chairman.""
Clouding the situation even further, a review of the messages turned over to State which originated from Blumenthal shows that Clinton's team turned over some that she forwarded to government colleagues, but also some that she does not appear to have forwarded. Clinton has said her team erred on the side of disclosure and has noted that the National Archives has determined that 1200 emails Clinton produced were actually entirely personal.
""We sent so many that some were going to be returned because they were clearly not work related. We did our best,"" Clinton said.
Baron said the significance of Clinton's over-production was open to interpretation.
""The fact....might indicate that the secretary and her staff were being conscientious in turning over more than they had to — but it also raises a question as to whether the individuals making the decisions on what to turn over were aware of and were adhering to NARA’s regulations on what emails were official and what were personal in nature,"" he said. ""Regrettably, there are still some legitimate issues here caused by the secretary’s initial decision to adopt a highly unusual and unorthodox arrangement for recordkeeping.""
""One consequence of that is when she was finally asked to return a large volume of official records in her custody, she and her lawyers had to make decisions on what were official records and what were personal records to be deleted. We just don’t know how those decisions were actually implemented, and the remarks the secretary made yesterday unfortunately muddy the waters a little bit,"" Baron added.
Another indication that the email issue is certain to linger for Clinton came at a court hearing Friday in one of dozens of lawsuits in which news organizations and conservative groups are seeking copies of emails and other records sent or received by Clinton and her top aides.
A Justice Department lawyer provided figures indicating the State Department might take more than the next year to complete disclosure of tens of thousands of pages of emails between former Clinton communications aide Philippe Reines and several dozen news organizations.
Justice Department attorney Stephen Elliott said about 81,000 electronic files are being prepared for release along with about 16,000 pages of emails Reines turned over from his private email account at State's request.
While State has only released 71 pages of the messages up to this point, Eliiott told U.S. District Court Judge Ketanji Jackson that the agency will ramp up disclosure to 4,800 pages per month beginning in November. The plan appears to call for the releases to continue for well over a year and perhaps for several years.
It's ""very difficult to say how long this will take,"" Elliott told the judge. ""The 4,800 pages is definitely an upper limit of what the State Department is capable of.""
""This sounds like it could take years,"" said Brad Moss, an attorney representing media outlet Gawker in the Freedom of Information Act case. ""We have no idea when this is going to end.""

             and

Moss quipped that while the information might be of interest to voters in the 2016 presidential race, the disclosures might wind up impacting the 2020 election as well. ""We could be into a second term, if Hillary Clinton is elected and re-elected, before this gets done,"" he said.
In August, State told the court in a written report that only about 18,000 of the 81,000 files the agency found were likely responsive to Gawker's request for all emails between Reines and 37 news organizations. It is unclear why the government is now indicating that the larger number is now in the pipeline for release.
The State Department initially said it had no records responsive to Gawker's request. However, after the controversy over Clinton's emails erupted, State said it had located some of Reines' state.gov emails and requested that he turn over work-related messages exchanged on his personal account. Reines sent 20 boxes of printed emails to the department in July and later turned them over in electronic form. Officials said most of the bulk was due to daily news clippings sent to his personal and official accounts.
There has been no explanation from State about why the first search for records came up with nothing. Elliott said the current process has been complicated by the fact that journalists often used their personal accounts to exchange emails with Reines, so the names of the news organizations often don't appear in the records. and the reporters' affiliations have to be determined from other sources.
Reines has said he rarely used his personal account for official business, was careful to forward or copy such messages to his state.gov account and does not know why State initially failed to locate them. He also said he could not prevent journalists who had his private email from using it to contact him.
Monthly releases of Clinton's emails ordered by another judge in a separate FOIA case are scheduled to continue through January, days before the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses.

Letters: Grilling Clinton About Benghazi,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/24/opinion/grilling-clinton-about-benghazi.html,nyt,"To the Editor:

Re “Benghazi Panel Engages Clinton in Tense Session” (front page, Oct. 23):

Kudos to the select House committee on Benghazi! The committee gave Hillary Rodham Clinton an unparalleled opportunity to present herself to the nation.

Faced with a panel of hostile interrogators, she displayed qualities essential to a successful president in these times: thorough command of the facts and the ability to remain composed and focused in the face of sustained, unrelenting attacks. These are qualities that the next American president must have in dealing with a fractious Congress, a hostile Russia, a bullying China and a chaotic Middle East.

Would that each of the other presidential aspirants also had to undergo 11 hours of such hostile interrogation rather than the comfortable superficiality of the debates.

ROCHELLE BRAUNSTEIN

New York

To the Editor:

This continuing obsession of House Republicans with Hillary Rodham Clinton’s role in Benghazi and her emails is beyond exasperating. It is beyond tiresome.

Dear Republicans: This behavior may please your most conservative, your most extreme supporters, but the rest of us are sick and tired of hearing about this.

Roads and bridges all over this country are falling apart. The effects of global warming have undeniably arrived. And nothing. They’re not talking about it, they’re not doing anything about it. This behavior by House Republicans is the equivalent of fiddling while Rome burns.

The outrage should not be directed toward Mrs. Clinton but toward House Republicans for putting on a spectacle instead of working on the things that we really need to be done. Enough! Stop this stupidity and get to work.

GARY DORST

To the Editor:

As a Bill Buckley conservative, I’m embarrassed by the naked partisanship of these hearings. This is clearly a political cheap shot against Hillary Rodham Clinton, and it may well backfire.

I remember the 1983 bombing of our embassy in Beirut. There was no political backlash remotely near this scale against President Reagan and his administration.

Nearly 7,000 American men and women have been killed in Afghanistan and Iraq since 2001. Where are the hearings on that debacle?

First Draft: Donald Trump in Tempest Over Tweet About Iowans,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/10/23/donald-trump-in-tempest-over-tweet-about-iowans/,nyt,"Who in Trumpland really sent The Tweet?

That is the question now fluttering around the Internet after Donald J. Trump said a campaign intern had sent a Twitter post that mocked Iowans — and then another intern on his campaign suggested that was not plausible.

The Twitter tempest started when the popular Twitter account of Mr. Trump, who fell behind Ben Carson in polls of Iowans this week, retweeted a fan who playfully suggested that Iowans had brain impairments because of the corn they eat —  a no-no for any presidential candidate seeking to win over the state.

— Nicolas R-V (@mygreenhippo) October 22, 2015



But it’s unclear whether campaign interns actually have access to Mr. Trump’s Twitter account. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Mr. Trump said that he himself tapped out many of his tweets and dictated the rest to his assistant and his head of social media. Neither are interns.

But a campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said that an intern was among those who controlled Mr. Trump’s Twitter profile while he was on the road.

“There are a handful of people, including an intern, who have access to Mr. Trump’s Twitter account,” she said.

On Friday, the digital news company International Business Times quoted what it said was a Trump campaign intern who said that neither he nor his fellow interns had the ability to use the candidate’s account, casting doubt on Mr. Trump’s explanation.

“As an intern for the internal headquarters campaign, we do not manage or in that case have any access to Mr. Trump’s personal Twitter,” the intern, identified as Garrison Groeschke, told the Business Times, which said that Mr. Groeschke’s personal website and LinkedIn profile listed him as a 2016 Trump intern.",0.95642615697014699
First Draft: Carly Fiorina Defends Decision to Hold Off on Ads,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/10/23/carly-fiorina-defends-decision-to-hold-off-on-ads/,nyt,"With her poll numbers down and interest in her campaign seeming to plateau, Carly Fiorina on Friday sought to explain, in explicitly political process terms like “fave and unfave ratings,” why everything was fine.

Speaking to reporters after addressing an auditorium of seniors at a residential community dotted with bocce ball courts and golf carts in Bluffton, S.C., Ms. Fiorina responded to reports that Jeb Bush was scaling back part of his campaign by talking about having “the lowest burn rate of any campaign.” She added, “We are spending our money very carefully, because we have to go the long haul.”

But the wisdom of Ms. Fiorina’s decision not to spend money on advertising is debatable, given the momentum she gained after her performance in the first Republican debate. Asked when she would buy air time, she said: “Well, not for awhile. I think we have spent our time between the efforts of the campaign, and what I understand the ‘super pac’ Carly Fiorina is doing, we have spent our time making sure we have people on the ground.” 

She added: “Of course, I take advantage of earned media any chance I get. The debates are a really important opportunity for me. Every time I get out on that debate stage more people say ‘Oh, I didn’t know she was running for president. I kind of like her.’ So there will come a time for ads but honestly, other candidates have already spent millions on ads and it’s done nothing for them. So I think the time is not yet.”

So why the dip in the polls? Ms. Fiorina argued that it had nothing to do with attacks on her business record.

“If the attacks were working, you’d start to see it in my favorable and unfavorables,” she said, referring to poll data. “And in fact I have very, very strong fave and unfave ratings. I think what you are seeing is that in the debate, half the audience saw me for the first time. And you don’t make a sale in one impression. Also we have been off national television for the last couple of weeks. We have been doing more regional media and more on the ground town halls.

New Scrutiny on Vote Buying as Argentine Elections Near,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/24/world/americas/argentina-elections-cristina-kirchner.html,nyt,"BUENOS AIRES — Some voters received sacks stuffed with bottles of cooking oil, pasta and flour. Others were ferried to the polls in convoys of cars. There were even reports of a raffle in which the grand prize was a Chevrolet.

In return, the voters promised to cast their ballots for particular candidates during recent municipal elections in Tucumán, in the north of Argentina. The rampant vote buying was branded a “scourge” last month by judges looking into the validity of the polls, although the results were allowed to stand since the practice, which experts say is widespread in Argentina, is not actually illegal.

The vote buying, documented by election observers from the National University of La Plata and highlighted in the news media, has ignited debates about the frailty of the country’s democracy as it prepares for presidential and parliamentary elections on Sunday.

“The problem is poverty and that there are people willing to lose their voting freedom for a bag of food,” Margarita Stolbizer, a candidate for the Progressive Front, said in an interview with the newspaper Perfil.

Vote buying strategies will most likely sway between 5 and 12 percent of Argentine voters on Sunday, according to estimates by Rodrigo Zarazaga, the director of the Center for Research and Social Action, a Jesuit institute. Mr. Zarazaga is an expert on clientelism, the term used when politicians turn the electorate into clients over a long period of time, offering services and goods in exchange for support, a common practice in the region that has been closely scrutinized here in recent weeks.

Many voters fear that such practices could skew the results of the national elections. “They won’t vote according to their convictions,” said Héctor del Bianco, 61, who works at a car showroom. “They’ll vote because of the money.”

In Tucumán, while all parties engaged in vote buying, the majority was attributed to the Front for Victory, an arm of the Peronist political movement that has dominated Argentine politics for decades, and which is led by President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. The party has been in power since 2003, and is well placed to secure a fourth consecutive term in Sunday’s elections, led by Mrs. Kirchner’s successor, Daniel Scioli.

Some party officials conceded that there was vote buying in Tucumán, where the party’s candidate for governor, Juan Luis Manzur, won easily.

But Mr. Scioli, the governor of Buenos Aires Province, denounced the opposition’s efforts to annul his victory. “It’s the impotence of the opposition,” he told reporters. “They didn’t get the result they hoped for, so they looked to delegitimize the elections.”

Under Mrs. Kirchner, supporters say, the Front for Victory has modernized Argentina’s democracy, which is enjoying its longest unbroken run — 32 years — since a suffrage law was passed a century ago. They underscore Mrs. Kirchner’s liberal social agenda and her expansion of welfare benefits. She has also pushed for the prosecutions of former military leaders on human rights crimes charges and moved to restrict the size of news media empires.

But this progress has been undermined by a resilient culture of vote buying that is most rife within the Peronist movement, according to experts, explaining that clientelism has long been practiced by Argentina’s incumbent parties.

“If you’re buying the votes of the poor, you are silencing their preferences and that is tragic,” said Mariela Szwarcberg, a politics professor at Reed College in Portland, Ore.

Evidence of vote buying in Tucumán includes a video posted online of two men who were candidates for a town council. They had filmed themselves driving to the town, Tafí Viejo, to hand out packs of herbal tea. “Let’s make a trade,” says one, before adding: “Vote for me.”

The men, who later claimed they had been joking, were candidates for Kolina, an organization that is part of the Front for Victory’s grass-roots support network.

Sacks containing staples like flour, cooking oil and sugar, worth a total of $15 to $20, were systematically distributed by several parties to voters statewide, said Sebastián López Calendino, one of the election observers.

Other practices condemned by the judges were the use of convoys, reported by election observers, to transport voters to polling places and raffles organized in the days before the elections.

One Front for Victory official raffled off a Chevrolet hatchback car, according to the local news media.

There is no provision in Argentina’s electoral code that explicitly criminalizes vote buying. Julia Pomares, a leading specialist on election issues and director at Cippec, an Argentine public policy research center, noted that the validity of the elections in Tucumán was challenged on constitutional grounds. Because polling booths ensure secrecy, the judges decided, vote buying does not actually suppress the constitutional right to freely choose candidates.

Politicians often use networks of go-betweens, known locally as “punteros,” to whom they give public funds and resources. They supply poor voters with basic items, like food, medicine and construction materials, experts say.

Often, these campaign workers — who were the subject of a fictional hit TV series in 2011 called “The Puntero” — also hand out welfare benefits and jobs.

In Argentina, the punteros are largely concentrated in the sprawling outskirts of Buenos Aires, the capital city that is home to nearly a third of the country. In these outlying neighborhoods, Peronists have the most extensive networks, said Mr. Zarazaga of the Jesuit research center. But other parties, like Republican Proposal, led by Mauricio Macri, the mayor of Buenos Aires and Mr. Scioli’s chief rival in the elections, also rely on punteros.

“It’s a historic and commonplace practice; Peronism gets stigmatized, but there’s no party that hasn’t used it,” said Mario Gómez, 58, a social leader who works at a cultural center in Villa 21-24, a slum on the city’s south side.

“People are used to it,” said Yessica Ibáñez, 32, a self-described “full-time mom” from Villa 21-24, explaining how friends and family had been offered jobs as janitors, or goods like mattresses and corrugated iron, a useful roofing material, in the run-up to elections. “If you ask for somebody’s vote, they ask you what you’re offering in exchange.”

Experts say that the punteros are often allowed to administer access to some of the welfare benefits and social programs expanded by the Front for Victory. Some argue that by doing this they are performing a vital role, spanning the gap between the state and marginalized corners of the country that policy makers might ignore.

“People don’t get the social ambivalence,” said Javier Auyero, a sociology professor at the University of Texas at Austin who researched clientelism here in the 1990s when, he said, it surged under a Peronist government. “It’s a strategy of control, but it’s also how poor people solve their most pressing needs,” he added.

But Sergio Massa, a congressman who lies third in the polls, has promised to “sweep away the go-betweens who extort people with welfare benefits.” “That breaks the circle of clientelism,” he told reporters.",0.35855258351268471
Carson: I won't respond to Trump if he attacks,http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/23/politics/donald-trump-ben-carson-attacks/index.html,cnn,"Washington (CNN)Although Ben Carson is leading in several Iowa polls this week, he said he doesn't plan to respond to Donald Trump if the mogul attacks him.

Trump previously said that he would start attacking Carson given the retired neurosurgeon's rise in the polls.

""My personal interactions with him have shown him to be a gentleman,"" Carson said. ""I think there's another element sometimes when he's on camera.""

Carson said the biggest issues that differentiate him from Trump are their tax plans and immigration stances. Unlike Trump, Carson is not in favor of deporting undocumented immigrants, but favors a path to legal status. 
Carson also believes all residents should pay taxes, whereas Trump wants to exclude the poorest Americans from having to pay taxes.
The retired neurosurgeon also commented on the Benghazi hearings, saying that Hillary Clinton was caught ""lying."" He pointed to the revelation that while senior State Department aides initially told the public that Benghazi was not a terrorist attack, Clinton told family and others in emails that it was.
""I believe she plays fast and loose with the truth,"" he said.
Carson also blasted Clinton's judgment for using work-related emails on a private server.
""If she doesn't have enough judgment to know better than that, I don't want you to have the keys to everything,"" he said.

Story Continued Below
JEB SCALES BACK: POLITICO’s Eli Stokols and Alex Isenstadt report: JEB BUSH's campaign insists the wholesale restructuring announced Friday is a merely a course correction, a reallocation of resources and heightened focus on New Hampshire. Starting on Nov. 1, the campaign will cut payroll costs by 40 percent, downsize its Miami headquarters by more than 50 percent, reduce travel costs by 20 percent and cut 45 percent of spending on things other than media and voter contact. Even if those moves ease financial pressures on Bush's large campaign operation, they only reinforce the prevailing narrative about a candidate, not long ago viewed as a front-runner, in freefall.
This weekend, Bush goes to Houston for a weekend meeting with his father and brother, an event conceived as a reward — a pep rally of sorts — for major donors but one that now serves to further underline the campaign's reliance on an old network of family funders and its glaring lack of rank-and-file support beyond the GOP's moneyed class.
The anxiety inside Bush's Miami headquarters was running high Friday afternoon, as staffers met with their bosses to discuss possible reassignments. As local reporters and photographers gathered outside the building, staffers were encouraged not to speak to the press when leaving and to remove their ID badges before walking out.

Happy Friday, no, we won’t sit for 11 hours of questions. But here is your 2016 Blast. Henry C. Jackson (@henrycjjackson) is here to guide you through your post-hearing wrap up. Send your tips, complaints and hottest hot takes to: hjackson@politico.com. 
TRAIL MIX: Here’s what’s popping on the campaign trail
In today’s campaign news, HILLARY CLINTON is hitting her stride, LINCOLN CHAFEE is ending his race, and MARTIN O’MALLEY grabs a baton from Montana. On the Republican side, JEB BUSH’s campaign goes paleo. DONALD TRUMP fades — and BEN CARSON surges — in Iowa. MARCO RUBIO made tradeoffs on the path to power and RAND PAUL faces pressure to prioritize.
THE DAILY CLINTON
FALL FORWARD: POLITICO’s Todd S. Purdum reports that if HILLARY CLINTON eventually becomes President Clinton, we’ll look at this week as the week she broke the hoodoo. “Like the first brisk snap of fall, Clinton’s terrible, horrible, no good, very bad summer has morphed overnight into the best week of her campaign: JOE BIDEN is out, her poll numbers are up, her crisp debate performance reassured nervous Democrats and her measured resolution before the House Benghazi committee made her interrogators (of both parties) seem small by comparison.” http://politi.co/1GmBjGE 
BENGHAZI WINDFALL: POLITICO’s Annie Karni reports that donations have been pouring in since Clinton’s testimony to the House Select Committee on Benghazi began. Her performance thrilled fundraisers “on the eve of a weekend-long finance committee meeting that couldn’t have come at a better time. According to communications director Jennifer Palmieri, the hour between 9:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. last night was their best fundraising hour of the campaign to date.” http://politi.co/1OWtAjM 
UNION MUSCLE: POLITICO’s Brian Mahoney reports Clinton won the endorsement of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees on Friday. http://politi.co/1NrNLV0 
IOWA STRENGTH: A new Quinnipiac University poll has HILLARY CLINTON up 11 points from its September survey, at 51 percent among Iowa voters. http://bit.ly/2040uUW 
 THE PROGRESSIVE RESISTANCE
HIT THE RHODE: POLITICO’s Gabriel Debenedetti: “Democratic presidential candidate LINCOLN CHAFEE, always a long shot, dropped out of the race for his party’s nomination on Friday morning.”
THE SCENE: “Immediately after announcing the end of his campaign, Chafee pivoted to the importance of women — by referencing a 2,500-year-old anecdote about politicians' wives punishing their belligerent spouses by denying them sex.” http://politi.co/1R1zyz0
RHODE ISLAND REAX: Providence Journal: “’It looks like we can put our metric system converters away for a few years,’ said Rep. Joseph McNamara, state Democratic chairman.” http://bit.ly/1GnahPj GRIZZLY BOOST: Former Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer, who mulled his own presidential bid, announced he was endorsing MARTIN O’MALLEY on Friday. “I believe he is the candidate that best represents the future of our Party,” Schweitzer said in a statement, adding, “Martin and I don’t agree on every issue, but he is the only candidate with a proven record of getting things done, and I believe he is the best candidate to take on Republicans in November 2016.”
USA! USA! USA!: In an open letter to BERNIE SANDERS, The Nation argues he should talk more about “our own American radical tradition” as he preps for his big Democratic Socialism speech, and not espousing the virtues of, say, Copenhagen. “There’s nothing wrong with Denmark … But most Americans don’t know or care much about Scandinavia.” http://bit.ly/20410SF  
GUN SHOT: Business Insider reports HILLARY CLINTON took an implicit shot at BERNIE SANDERS while speaking at a Democratic National Committee event. ""I've been told to, and I quote, 'stop shouting' about gun violence. First of all, I'm not shouting. It's just sometimes when women talk people think we're shouting,"" Clinton said, as the audience applauded. “And second, I will not be silent, because we will not be silenced. Not by the gun lobby, not by the size of this challenge, not by any of it. Stopping gun violence is worth fighting for."" http://read.bi/1NYnCAa

TRUMP ON THE STUMP
INSIDERS BELIEVE: POLITICO’s Katie Glueck reports early state insiders see the odds of a DONALD TRUMP nomination increasing. “Eighty-one percent of Republican insiders say the likelihood that Trump becomes their party’s nominee is more today than it was a month ago, and 79 percent of Democrats said the same. http://politi.co/1W8ORfR 
IOWA ISSUES?: The New York Times reports that a second poll in as many days shows BEN CARSON pulling ahead of DONALD TRUMP in Iowa. The latest, a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll has Carson capturing 28 percent of likely caucus goers. http://nyti.ms/1OWzBgp
REFUND BACKER: POLITICO’s Nick Gass reports DONALD TRUMP wants all of the donations made to super PACs backing him to be refunded, and he’s calling on all the other super PACs to return their donations, too. http://politi.co/1jZ5Gsc 
CARSON’S COURSE
PRIVATE PRACTICE: POLITICO’s Kyle Cheney and Jason Millman report BEN CARSON is running on a platform of killing Medicare and Medicaid and replacing them with private savings accounts. “Republicans have fended off accusations for years that they'd gut Medicare for seniors and end the program ‘as we know it.’ Not BEN CARSON. The former neurosurgeon acknowledges he would abolish the program altogether. Carson … would eliminate the program that provides health care to 49 million senior citizens, as well as Medicaid, and replace it with a system of cradle-to-grave savings accounts which would be funded with $2,000 a year in government contributions.” http://politi.co/1OMFXAh 
MODELING MARCO: The Wall Street Journal reports aides are showing Carson clips of MARCO RUBIO to prep him for next week’s debate, hoping he can mimic his style of interrupting without looking like he’s interrupting. http://on.wsj.com/1NrRkuh 
CROWNING CARLY
UNIMPRESSED: In an interview with ABC, CARLY FIORINA said HILLARY CLINTON’s marathon Benghazi hearing did not impress her. “She never answered a fundamental question. And the fundamental question is this: Knowing that this was purposeful terrorist attack, why did you go the next morning and address the American people and talk about a videotape? ... And why did you continue to do that over the bodies of the fallen and for several weeks after?’” http://abcn.ws/1jYjqn0 
THUMPS TRUMP: In an interview with Fox News Radio Fiorina said she believed the only candidate HILLARY CLINTON could beat was DONALD TRUMP. http://bit.ly/1S1czVo 
JEB’S JOURNEY
CUTBACKS: New York Times: “Mr. Bush’s deep cutbacks were perhaps the most telling admission that he will be unable to match the structure of his brother’s well-funded and sprawling 2000 campaign. In public and in private, Mr. Bush has invoked another example of late, recalling an encounter in October 2007 with Sen. John McCain at the Atlanta airport. ‘He’s carrying his bag, he has no aide, he’s running for president, he has no staff,’ Mr. Bush said in New Hampshire last month. ‘The campaign was basically over. Everybody said it. All the pundits said, ‘It’s over, why waste your time?’” But Mr. McCain persisted, Mr. Bush said, implicitly drawing an analogy-cum-prediction for his current race.” http://nyti.ms/1PM01lE
CIRCUMSTANCES: Bloomberg: ""’The circumstances when we started the election were different,’ Bush told Pat Robertson in an interview at Regent University hours after news of the shakeup broke. ‘I have not met a person that thought that Donald Trump would be the front running candidate at this point. God bless him for his success in that regard, we’ll see how long that lasts. But you have to adapt.’ He said his new ‘lean and mean’ campaign will allow him to do that. ‘Every dollar we can save in overhead is a dollar that goes on television, goes on radio, goes on media, goes on voter outreach,’ Bush added.” http://bloom.bg/1kzKQAf
ENJOY THE SNOW: “According to the campaign, staff cut from Miami will be offered jobs in early voting states, but at reduced salary. Staffers were told that job functions would change for some.” http://politi.co/1GZtz81 
OPTIMAL LOCAL HEADLINE: WMUR’s headline on the Bush cutbacks: “National staff cuts mean more emphasis on New Hampshire.” http://bit.ly/1MY7VYp 
RUBIO’S RACE
YOUNG MARCO: The New York Times has a deeply reported look at MARCO RUBIO’s rise in Florida politics and beyond, including the political bargains he made en route to becoming speaker of the Florida House. “The image of Mr. Rubio as a young man in a hurry has persisted ... And at a time when Republican presidential politics are being dominated by candidates who are outsiders to the political system, Mr. Rubio, with his ability to navigate intraparty politics and win over powerful benefactors, has proved himself to be a master of the inside game.” http://nyti.ms/1PAujbL 
BADGER BASE: The Wisconsin State Journal reports MARCO RUBIO picked up the endorsement of state Sen. Leah Vukmir, the state Senate’s assistant majority leader. Vukmir will “serve as his presidential campaign co-chairwoman. Vukmir was a top supporter of Gov. SCOTT WALKER.” Rubio told her “Wisconsin will be a key state on the way to the 2016 GOP nomination.” http://bit.ly/1jEuSoc 
SURVEYING THE 2016 LANDSCAPE
RAND, PHONE HOME: POLITICO’s Shane Goldmacher and Anna Palmer report RAND PAUL is facing increasing pressure from Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his allies to curtail his presidential bid and focus on retaining his Senate seat. “So far, those efforts have stopped short of urging [Paul] to outright abandon his national campaign. But there are growing concerns that Paul ... is courting trouble by dividing his time between the two races.” http://politi.co/1OVQnw3 
BEST SELLERS*: The Christian Science Monitor explains why BEN CARSON and TED CRUZ, or the super PACs backing them, are buying up their own books in bulk. “Among politicians and political candidates, it's a fairly widely practiced, if somewhat less-than-honest, trend with clear payoffs: publishing, then buying one's own book to gain lucrative bestseller status and free media attention rapidly and easily.” http://bit.ly/1MfwqkV 
AIRBALL: Bleacher Report has everything you need to know about a feud between JOHN KASICH and the Philadelphia 76ers, whom he met, insulted and complimented all in one news cycle while campaigning in New Hampshire. http://ble.ac/1NYu7mB 
MORE THAN JUST DINNER: The New York Times previews this weekend’s Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Iowa, a run-of-the-mill party fundraiser that — in presidential election cycles — has taken on a certain kind of mythology. “The dinner this weekend will unfold amid the hoopla of a mini-nominating convention. There will be bands, parades and orchestrated cheering sections … Bill Clinton, on his first visit to Iowa this year, will appear at a pre-dinner rally for Mrs. Clinton outside the Iowa Events Center in downtown Des Moines that will include a performance by Katy Perry.” http://nyti.ms/1OWHlij 
NEXT NEWS CYCLE
HILLARY CLINTON, BERNIE SANDERS and MARTIN O’MALLEY attend the Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Iowa. 
DONALD TRUMP has a rally in Jacksonville, Fla.
MARCO RUBIO campaigns in South Carolina
JEB BUSH also campaigns there.
THE DAILY NUMBER
45. That’s the percentage of costs — besides media ad buys — that JEB BUSH plans to cut his campaign operation, a sign of financial troubles and a significant shake up in Miami. http://politi.co/1GvZWAr
