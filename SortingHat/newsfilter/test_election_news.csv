GOP Establishment Wouldn’t Support Trump. Here’s Why It Should Say So.,wsj,"It was a striking moment Thursday, at the beginning of the prime-time debate, when Donald Trump refused to swear off an independent run and pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee. Given Mr. Trump’s post-debate antics, conservatives and Republicans in leadership positions might consider answering a variation of the question that Fox News’s Megyn Kelly opened with.
Specifically, would the GOP leadership, former White House alumni, right-leaning think tanks, and political consultants pledge to support Mr. Trump were he to become the Republican Party nominee for president? Would they forswear running an independent/third-party candidate against Mr. Trump?
I suspect the answer to both would be, almost uniformly and emphatically, no.
So maybe it is time for the Republican political class to make clear how and in what ways the political values and sensibilities inherent to the GOP are incompatible with Mr. Trump’s demeanor, disposition, and worldview.
For example, Republican foreign policy experts have spent the past six years in the wilderness, watching President Barack Obama‘s policy toward Russia, China, the Middle East, and Israel with frustration. Many have studied, strategized, and planned how to reinvigorate U.S. influence in the world. The thought of Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, responding to world affairs with name-calling or other bullying antics, is antithetical to what many Republicans hope will be a new era of respected U.S. global leadership.
Donald Trump and Fox News’s Megyn Kelly spar over his comments on women.

And conservatives might assume that Mr. Trump’s treatment of Megyn Kelly in the aftermath of her tough debate questioning is a snapshot of how he treats strong women. Those female Republicans who hope to serve in senior capacities under a Republican president come January 2017 could make clear that doing so in a President Trump’s Cabinet is not in their career plan.
Jeff Greenfield’s Politico piece “What If Trump Wins?” should be required reading for Republicans who hope to help the next GOP president govern. Best to make clear soon that should Republican primary voters decide to make Mr. Trump the GOP nominee, which leadership and political/policy wonks won’t pledge to support him–and won’t desist from building the infrastructure to support a third-party candidate.

Financial Wellness and Millennials: Hard Times Yield Important Lessons,huffpo,"Partner and National Leader of Employee Financial Education and Wellbeing, PricewaterhouseCoopers
We all know by now that millennials are different. Not different in a bad way, just different. So it is no surprise that when it comes to managing their personal finances, millennials are taking a different path than the generations before them. Until recently, Baby Boomers and older Gen Xers generally stuck to the straight and narrow and reaped good results: work hard, buy a home, invest in the stock market, and then retire on your pension, savings and Social Security. This worked well for most of their careers, as they rode a wave of stock and housing appreciation.
But millennials have good reason to question that approach. Having come of age during the Great Recession, many millennials entered their professional years saddled with burdensome student loans only to find a tight job market with disappearing pension plans, stagnant wages and continuing questions about the future of Social Security. To make matters worse, many millennials also watched as their parents' home values and retirement savings plummeted. 
Unsurprisingly, these traumas have impacted millennials' attitudes about personal finances. PwC's recently released Employee Financial Wellness Survey illuminates many of the generational differences in attitudes about financial wellbeing by comparing millennials, Generation X and Baby Boomers. Here are some of the most important aspects of millennials' approach to their finances:
This picture may look dark, but there are a couple silver linings, fortunately. First, things are improving for millennials. Although 35 percent of millennials find it difficult to meet monthly household expenses on time, that figure is down from 41 percent last year. Similarly, of the 52 percent of millennials who consistently carry credit card balances, only 30 percent find it difficult to make their minimum payments on time versus the 39 percent who did last year. And while a large proportion of millennials (52 percent) report financial stress, it is a decrease from 60 percent last year. 
Second, these tough circumstances may ultimately benefit millennials. Their frugality, including their deployment of digital savvy to find the lowest prices and willingness to live at home longer, along with their tendency to push off major expenses like buying a home (only 46 percent of the full-time employed millennials surveyed own a home), getting married, and having kids, will likely serve them well financially as they age in an increasingly uncertain landscape for retirement and other benefits. As millennial Kelly Clarkson famously sings, ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.""",0.80959503211641692,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.038828003499603289, u'mexico': 0.016180676954963703, u'abortion': 0.029520636700027806, u'immigration': 0.014376470206338726, u'trade': 0.015404524990794081, u'campaign_finance': 0.01444105767037052, u'other': 0.53800476019057286, u'china': 0.038465923666065778, u'military': 0.016010098825851603, u'terrorism': 0.07865553001674426, u'economy': 0.12421189482759799, u'health': 0.026751810488585732, u'women': 0.049148611962483719}"
Poll: Trump sits in second place in New Hampshire,cnn,"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump is outpolling all other Republican candidates in New Hampshire except for Jeb Bush, according to a new survey released Tuesday.
In a poll fielded immediately after their presidential announcements last week, Bush earned 14% of the vote in the crowded GOP field, followed by Trump with 11%. Nearly a third of respondents said they were undecided.
The results from Suffolk University are the clearest indication yet that Trump, the billionaire with a penchant for bombastic rhetoric and outlandish claims, is catching on with Republican voters early on in the cycle. Pollsters tend to caution that surveys more than six months before any votes are cast may simply be registering each contender's name recognition -- of which Trump has plenty.
Trump, though, is a deeply polarizing figure in the Granite State -- 49% of respondents said they had an unfavorable opinion of him, while only 37% viewed him positively.
""Trump's controversial candidacy is being constructed in a way that gives him visibility and exposure in the short term but may also limit his growth in the long run, like a glass ceiling,"" David Paleologos, who directed the poll, said in a statement.
New Hampshire, with its first-in-the-nation primary, is a key battleground for 2016 hopefuls.
Trailing Bush and Trump were Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker at 8%, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at 7%, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson at 6% and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at 5%. No other candidates earned more than 5% in the Suffolk survey.
When asked for their second choice candidate, 14% of likely GOP voters named Bush, 13% selected Rubio, 10% picked Walker, 7% said Trump and 6% said businesswoman Carly Fiorina.
Suffolk surveyed 500 likely New Hampshire Republican voters between June 18 and June 22, yielding a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.

"Trump, the Insult Comic Dog",wsj,"Donald Trump’s support is broader than you may think. Last night your humble columnist appeared as “special guest commentator” at the Women’s National Republican Club’s debate-watch party. Rather than provide our commentary, which we do every day in this space, we decided to lead an audience discussion, which we began with an informal and entirely unscientific predebate preference poll. Our method was to call for a show of hands for each candidate and eyeball the results.
Trump was the clear winner, with Scott Walker a close second. Third place was a rough three-way tie between Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and John Kasich. The last two—respectively the No. 9 and 10 seeds in the Fox poll contest—made the audience an outlier, presumably because they’re from the Northeast and, we’re guessing, somewhat less socially conservative than the GOP base. (Not a single hand went up for No. 4 seed Mike Huckabee.)
We asked Trump supporters to explain why they like him. One woman raised her hand and said it was because “I support free speech.” Her point was not that Trump is an advocate of free speech but that he is a practitioner of it: He speaks bluntly and abjures political correctness.
Once the debate started, Trump himself made the same argument, in an early exchange with Megyn Kelly. Let’s go to the transcript:
This exchange demonstrated another downside of Trump’s unfiltered style. By complaining to Kelly about “the way you have treated me,” he betrayed weakness. And in case there was any doubt that Kelly got under his skin, he continued his bellyaching in the spin room after the debate, as the Washington Examiner reports:
It’s undoubtedly true that the comments about which Kelly asked Trump were politically incorrect. But that is not the only reason why one might be put off by them. They were also rude. Kelly’s objection was that they were unpresidential, and Trump didn’t have an answer to that.
His defense was that the comments were humorous. We can’t judge that, not having heard them in their original context, but we’ll give Trump this: He is funny. We don’t think we’ve ever laughed as much at a political candidate—and to be fair, we were laughing with him as well as at him. He lived up to his billing, in a recent Tablet article, as “our last great Vaudevillian.”
Trump is a master of insult comedy, So of course he is rude—that’s what makes him fun to watch. If Don Rickles had run for president in, say, 1980, that year’s primary debates surely would have yielded many lines more memorable than “I’m paying for this microphone, Mr. Green.” But does anyone think President Rickles would have been better for the country than President Reagan?
This columnist has no objection to insult comedy per se, and indeed we have been known to employ it. We also yield to no one in our loathing of political correctness. But insult comedy—or, as it’s more commonly known these days, snark—is frequently an instrument of political correctness. We’d go so far as to say that during the Obama years, it has become the left’s primary rhetorical idiom.
As we reviewed our reader emails this morning, we kept an eye out for examples. We weren’t disappointed:
The Washington Post reports that a reporter asked White House press secretary Josh Earnest yesterday if Obama planned to tune in to the debate. “I’d be surprised if the president spent a lot of his evening devoted to watching the debate,” Earnest replied, seemingly in earnest:
Breitbart reports that Jim Carmey, a “campaign surrogate” for Wisconsin 2016 Senate candidate Russ Feingold, explained Feingold’s defeat six years earlier as follows: “2010 was just so different, with Obama just having come in and a lot of the tea party people just kind of coming out of the woodwork—coming out of the trailer parks, essentially.” That’s reminiscent of Jim Carville’s 1995 jape at Paula Jones’s expense: “If you drag a hundred-dollar bill through a trailer park, you never know what you’ll find.”
And Emily Yoffe, Slate’s “Dear Prudence” advice columnist, responds to a reader whose grandmother reacted badly to the news that the reader’s brother is gay: “The world will be a better place when such grandmas shuffle off this mortal coil.” The wit here lies in the prettified, high-minded formulation of an ugly, low thought: that Yoffe wishes her reader’s grandmother would just die already.
Jon Stewart built a fabulous career by using snark to further liberal politics. It’s fitting that his final episode of “The Daily Show” aired on the same night as Trump’s debate debut—and that, as Politico reports, “Trump’s corporate website was hacked” over the weekend by cyber-vandals who “wanted to thank comedian Jon Stewart for his work.”
Even leftists who lack wit aspire to be Stewart. Look at Salon, whose content is all insult, albeit with very little (intentional) comedy. Sample headline: “The GOP Freakshow Is Upon Us: Why Tonight’s Fox News Debates Could Make ‘Lord of the Flies’ Look Like a Picnic.”
The tone is set at the top. In a 2012 debate with Mitt Romney, President Obama channeled David Spade: “Gov. Romney, I’m glad that you recognize that Al Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what’s the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaida; you said Russia, in the 1980s, they’re now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War’s been over for 20 years.”
Well, you had to be there.
Just the other day, Obama asserted that “Iranian hard-liners” were “making common cause with the Republican caucus.” The White House transcript reports that his audience greeted this calumny with “laughter and applause.”
All this helps explain why Trump appeals to some conservatives and Republicans. Having endured this kind of abuse for years, why shouldn’t they be attracted to a candidate who seems willing and able to fight back in kind?
But that is a dangerous temptation. For one thing, Obama did not get elected in 2008 by out-snarking the competition but by projecting a thoughtful, temperate mien. Dropping the mask—“you’re likable enough, Hillary”—might have cost him the New Hampshire primary.
Obama’s performance as president should be enough to warn anyone—especially conservatives and Republicans—off from the temptation to put an insult comic in the White House. To be sure, unlike Obama, nobody has ever mistaken Trump for a thoughtful man. That is hardly an argument in the latter’s favor.

Bailey doesn’t mention when Trump issued that broad denunciation, but as Fox News reported last month: “Trump first made his inflammatory remarks during his non-scripted, June 16 presidential announcement speech.”
So Trump saw his campaign take off after announcing his campaign. That doesn’t sound quite so dramatic, does it?

Surprise! Golfer’s wife learns that ‘Open week’ doesn’t mean ‘open week’,washpo,"   Ben Martin during the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open last week. (Jan Kruger / Getty Images)  Ben Martin’s wife learned the hard way that maybe it’s a good idea to declare all summer activities not related to golf off limits. Emily Martin consulted the family’s calendar while conferring with her sister about her sibling’s possible wedding dates and was excited to see “Open week” written on July 18. Alert the band, the caterers, the venue and the preacher — we had a date! Book it! Oops. Ben Martin arrived home and noted the potential problem immediately. “That doesn’t sound like a very good weekend,” he said, according to Golf Digest’s Shane Ryan. “No, it was in my calendar,” Emily replied. “It was open.” “Yeah,” he said. “The Open Championship. The British Open.” It was too late to change the wedding and, besides, it wasn’t a certainty that Martin would qualify for the Open that begins Thursday at St. Andrews. He did, though, and he’ll miss his sister-in-law’s nuptials. Emily Martin will miss his tournament. Don’t ask what happens if he wins.

Republican Presidential Candidates Are Rallying Around Term Limits For Judges,huffpo,"WASHINGTON -- Judicial term limits aren't the sexiest, most inspiring campaign issue of modern times. But they've been mentioned in recent weeks in speeches and appearances by several potential Republican presidential candidates, suggesting that they could very well become a prominent fixture of the GOP’s 2016 primary. 
At the Conservative Political Action Conference last week in National Harbor, Maryland, two of the base’s more popular candidates delighted the audience by offering support for the idea. 
“Maybe we should term limit out-of-control federal judges,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said on the stage of the main hall. He delivered the line almost as a throwaway. 
At a side session hours earlier, Ben Carson, the pediatric neurosurgeon and likely presidential candidate, said the time had come to reconsider lifetime appointments for federal judges. 
“Remember, when that was put in place the average age of death was 47,” said Carson, no stranger to helping people live longer lives. “So it really didn’t matter that much. Now it matters a lot.” 
It wasn’t just at CPAC either. A month earlier at the Iowa Freedom Summit, former Gov. Mike Huckabee (R-Ark.) also pointedly declared the country’s need for term limits. “Not only for the executive and legislative branches,” he told the crowd, “we need term limits for the judicial branch because nobody ought to wear a black robe for the rest of his or her life.” 
A sense that the federal judiciary could benefit from axing lifetime tenure isn’t unique to either the Republican Party or the 2016 campaign. It’s been an oft-discussed topic in political, legal and academic circles for some time, spanning ideological divides. Usually, it’s tempered by the realization that changing the system would be a monumental task: requiring an amendment to Article III of the Constitution, which provides that federal judges “shall hold their offices during good behaviour.” 
But the growing talk of the idea among potential presidential candidates this cycle has left advocates of the concept more excited about the prospect of change, even if it remains far off. 
Back in 2012, then-Gov. Rick Perry (R-Texas) was one of the few preaching judicial term limits on the trail. He called himself a “true believer” in the concept, arguing that “too many federal judges rule with impunity from the bench, and those who legislate from the bench should not be entitled to lifetime abuse of their judicial authority.” The speech was described as a Hail Mary in the press.
There are a variety of reasons why the Republican Party has grown more receptive since then. Frustration with seeing notable court cases not go their way has been supplemented by a growing belief that, in an era of governmental gridlock, the judicial system is an effective vehicle for influencing policy. 
“There obviously has been dissatisfaction with the Supreme Court for a very long time on the right, and the health care [individual mandate] case can’t have helped matters in that regard,” said Randy Barnett, a law professor at Georgetown University who helped bring that challenge to the mandate in front of the Supreme Court. 
Barnett himself doesn’t support limiting terms on the bench. Justices, he argues, are already susceptible to political influence. Removing one of the layers protecting them wouldn’t help matters; it would make them worse. “I do think there is virtue to having the court be stable all the time and not move around,” he said. “It is very difficult for the court to stand up to popular opinion and majoritarian branches under the best of circumstances. Making it even more difficult is a mistake.”
But other lawyers and prominent legal observers say that the downsides of changing the system are outweighed by the problems of the status quo. 
“I think term limits are a good idea,” said Jeffrey Toobin, a legal commentator on CNN and an author for the New Yorker. “Some combination of term limits and or mandatory retirement makes a lot of sense. The framers created the federal judiciary at a time when average life spans meant that 10 years would be about it for most judges. And fortunately, we don’t live in a world where people die in their 50s much more. “
Among the various proposals for ending lifetime tenure, the most popular is to implement a single 18-year term staggered in a way so that each president in a single term in office would have two vacancies to fill. Most commonly associated with law professors Steve Calabresi and James Lindgren, the idea counts longtime Supreme Court correspondent Linda Greenhouse and prominent D.C. scholar Norm Ornstein among its supporters. 
Toobin, likewise, called 18-year-terms a “very reasonable” policy to restructure how judges serve. But, he said, it doesn’t  “have a chance in the world because it would involve amending the Constitution, and fortunately it is very difficult to amend the Constitution.”

Cardinal Wuerl backs pope on global warming but says Bush's response was 'legitimate',fox,"			
			 
							
							
								   					
							
						
						
							mboxCreate('FoxNews-Politics-Autoplay-Videos-In-Articles');
						
						Cardinal Donald Wuerl said on Sunday that Pope Francis’ recently-released thoughts on global warming are intended to open the dialogue on the issue, not to be a definitive statement, and that GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush’s skeptical response was “legitimate.” 
Bush, a devout Catholic and former GOP Florida governor, praised the pope after he released his encyclical, or letter to all Roman Catholic Church bishops, on Thursday on global warming and its environmental impact. 
“But I don't get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinals or from my pope,” Bush said. 
Wuerl, the archbishop of Washington, told “Fox News Sunday” that he thought Bush “had a legitimate position.” 
“I would hope that no politician gets policy from his faith committee, his faith community,” Wuerl continued. “The pope is talking about what we should be doing, not ‘Here is a political agenda that you must accept.’  … “This is one of the great blessings of America. We are all allowed to speak our minds.” 
Wuerl also suggested several times that the pope thinks global warming is a moral issue because, according to some scientists, human activity his heating up the earth, which is impacting all of humanity, especially the poor.
 
“What we get is the moral frame of reference by which we arrive at those policy positions,” the cardinal told Fox News. “That’s what the church brings to this discussion.” 
Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum, a practicing Catholic, said in early June that ""there are more pressing problems on Earth"" than global warming for the pope to be tackling.  
The former Pennsylvania senator also told Fox News that that it’s more appropriate for him and other lawmakers than the pontiff to weigh in on the issue because they make public policy decisions affect American workers. 
Those decisions, he said, include ones on ozone regulations, efforts to revitalize U.S. manufacturing and energy production and create job opportunities.

"Clinton defends, Trump attacks Saturday at the high-profile Iowa State Fair",fox,"







							mboxCreate('FoxNews-Politics-Autoplay-Videos-In-Articles');
						
Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump -- the presidential candidates dominating polls and news headlines -- took their turns Saturday at the Iowa State Fair, with the flamboyant Trump staying on the attack and Clinton suggesting her email controversy is “usual” partisan politics.
Clinton reiterated that she did not send or receive emails marked classified from her homemade email server while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, an issue that continues to overshadow her campaign.
She told reporters that she would let the inquiry into her email use continue, while she blamed her Republican challengers and House GOP members for turning the issue into a partisan affair.
""The facts are the same as they have been from the very beginning,"" Clinton said.
She also hit all the highlights of the fair, including the famed butter cow and the pork chop on a stick, amid a moving mass of media and onlookers.
""Nice to be here,"" Clinton said as she started an hour-long stroll through the fairgrounds at the side of former Iowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin.

Trump arrived in a private helicopter about a mile away from the fair and talked with reporters before taking children for a ride in his helicopter.
He slammed several other 2016 candidates, including GOP challenger Jeb Bush over recently suggesting the United States needs to have ""skin in the game” to justify helping end the chaos in Iraq.
Trump said the U.S. spent $2 trillion and that thousands of American soldiers were either killed or wounded in trying to bring Democracy to Iraq while Bush argues the U.S. must to prove it has “skin in the game.”
“I think it may be one of the dumbest statements I've ever heard,"" said the billionaire Trump, who reportedly just opened a campaign office in the first-caucus state of Iowa.
He also called Clinton “the single worst secretary of state in the history of this country.”
Essentially all of the roughly 20 major Democratic and Republican candidates will attend the 10-day fair, with Democratic challenger Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Republican Rick Santorum scheduled to attend Saturday.
Clinton recently turned her server over to the FBI to investigate the security of her email setup, which The Associated Press in March traced to an Internet connection at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y.
Clinton later said she set up her own system -- rather than use a State Department account -- for the convenience of using one BlackBerry device.
Thousands of pages of her emails publicly released in recent months show Clinton did, in fact, receive messages later marked classified, including some that contained material regarding the production and dissemination of U.S. intelligence information.
Clinton said in March she had exchanged about 60,000 emails during her four years in the Obama administration, about half of which were personal and were deleted. She turned over the others to the State Department, which is reviewing and releasing them on a monthly basis.
Last month, the inspector general of the nation's intelligence community raised concerns that classified information had traversed the email system and sent a counterintelligence referral to the Justice Department. The referral did not allege any criminal wrongdoing, and her attorney has said authorities want assurances that the emails continue to be properly stored and that Clinton is ""actively cooperating.""
It's unclear how well her email system was secured, whether it had proper data backups and whether it was constantly monitored for intrusions by hackers.

CNN to host first Democratic presidential debate,cnn,"Washington (CNN)CNN and the Democratic National Committee announced Thursday the network will host the first Democratic primary debate in Nevada on October 13. The exact location will be announced in the coming weeks.
The announcement adds to the trio of Republican debates CNN is hosting, the first of which is September 16 at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.
The field of major Democratic candidates is significantly smaller than the 17-member Republican one, at five candidates, and it's been dominated by frontrunner Hillary Clinton. But that hasn't stopped candidates like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders from running neck-and-neck with Clinton in New Hampshire or former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley from clamoring for more debates.
The field, meanwhile, could expand from five to six, if Vice President Joe Biden decides to enter the fray.

First Draft: Republicans Cite Health Care Ruling in Pushing Candidacies,nyt,"Republican presidential candidates were quick to pivot off the Supreme Court’s ruling to uphold Affordable Care Act subsidies, arguing that the decision shows the need to replace President Obama with a member of their party.

Former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said that it should not be left to the Supreme Court to “save us from Obamacare.”

“We need leadership in the White House that recognizes the folly of having to pass a bill to know what’s in it,” Mr. Perry said. “We need leadership that understands a heavy-handed, one-size-fits-all policy does nothing to help health outcomes for Americans.”

Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said the court erred in trying to correct Mr. Obama’s mistakes. The decision was another reason that he should be elected president, Mr. Rubio said.

— Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) June 25, 2015



Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin said the decision should be more motivation for Congress to overturn the law.

“Today’s Supreme Court ruling upholding the administration’s implementation of Obamacare means Republicans in the House and Senate must redouble their efforts to repeal and replace this destructive and costly law,” he said. 

Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said he was the man to lead the overturn of the law.

“This decision turns both the rule of law and common sense on its head,” Mr. Paul said in a statement. ” As president, I would make it my mission to repeal it, and propose real solutions for our health care system.” 

Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida said that if he becomes president, he will make fixing the health system through the private sector a top priority.

“We need to put patients in charge of their own decisions, and health care reform should actually lower costs,” Mr. Bush said.  “Entrepreneurs should be freed to lower costs and improve access to care – just like American ingenuity does in other sectors of the economy. ” 

The Republican National Committee decided to focus its statement not on Mr. Obama, but on Hillary Rodham Clinton and the 2016 election.

“Today’s ruling makes it clear that if we want to fix our broken health care system, then we will need to elect a Republican president with proven ideas and real solutions that will help American families,” said Chairman Reince Priebus. “Hillary Clinton supports big government mandates and expanding the government’s reach into our health care system, maneuvers that have made our health care system worse off.”

"As Senate Dems move to back Obama trade deal, Clinton takes heat for staying on sidelines",fox,"

					Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton is staying mum on whether she supports legislation to give President Obama broad authority in global trade deals, amid calls for her influential support and even as congressional Democrats now appear to back the measure. 
Liberal Capitol Hill Democrats had opposed the measure, largely arguing it poses a threat to U.S. workers. 
But negotiations this week on several provisions -- including one to crack down on suspected currency manipulation by China and other U.S. trading partners -- seems to have satisfied enough Democrats to get the bill passed as early as next week. 
The legislation, the Trade Promotion Authority bill, is supported by Republicans and moderate Senate Democrats, who want to give Obama so-called “fast-track” authority on deals that they say will improve the U.S. economy and create jobs by expanding America’s markets for goods and services. 
Clinton as secretary of State from 2009 to 2013 had supported one of two deals the legislation should help Obama expedite -- the Trans-Pacific Partnership with 11 Pacific Rim nations. The other is the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. 
But Clinton, the 2016 Democratic frontrunner, has publically said little since running for president, out of apparent concern for alienating her party’s liberal base.
 
Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill recently said that Clinton wants the final legislation to benefit American workers and that she has two major concerns: the bill’s impact on national security and the currency-manipulation issue that now appears resolved. 
Robert Kagan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank, this week criticized Clinton for failing to support the critical legislation and further suggested that history shows that she would unlikely champion it, if elected. 
“There are two things no serious candidate for the White House in 2016 can equivocate on: defense spending and the Trans-Pacific Partnership,” Kagan wrote in a column Wednesday for The Washington Post. “To cower in the face of possible criticism from the irresponsible wing of (Clinton’s) party gives little assurance that she has what it takes to lead the nation in the very difficult years ahead.”   
Kagan also argued that those who oppose the legislation are thinking of “nothing more than the most narrow and parochial of U.S. interests,” not foreign policy or America’s role in the world. 
Clinton’s apparent sideline strategy has brought out an array of critics -- from conservative PACs to potential primary challenger former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley. 
They argue Clinton has already changed her positions on gay marriage and immigration reform and that opposing the trade deal would be yet another reversal. 
“She will soon have to decide whether she will continue standing with the sitting Democratic president on trade, or whether she will flip flop and join the union activists who are vehemently opposed to this bipartisan deal,"" said Jeff Bechdel, spokesman for the conservative America Rising PAC. 
Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent running for the Democratic presidential nomination, continues to oppose the bill and has called on Clinton to “make it clear” that it should be rejected. 
O’Malley, who is set to announce May 30 whether he will challenge Clinton for the Democratic nomination, prior to the Senate negotiations this week also opposes the bill, arguing it would “hurt middle-class wages and ship middle-class jobs overseas.” 
House Speaker John Boehner, who said this week that his chamber will vote after the Senate, has called on Clinton to support the legislation to help get enough Democratic votes for passage. 
He said Clinton ""cannot sit on the sidelines and let the president swing in the wind."" 
The White House has so far defended Clinton, with Press Secretary Josh Earnest saying she should take her time to “make up her own mind … as we’re encouraging everybody to do.”

The Best Reason to Take Rand Paul Seriously Has Nothing to Do With His Politics,nyt,"Although Rand Paul — who declared his bid for the presidency on Tuesday — has spent several years now inching toward the Republican mainstream, there is still a tendency among the political classes to view him as a sideshow candidate. The crankiness of his announcement-week interviews certainly suggests that he’s still getting a handle on retail politics. And though his policy views — calls for more rational sentencing guidelines, a less intrusive national-security apparatus and a restrained foreign policy — give him potential appeal with young, minority and libertarian-leaning voters, they also make him an outlier in the field of declared or likely Republican contenders.

Paul’s (relative) unorthodoxy makes him that rare candidate whose policy views draw gobs of media attention: He’s teaming up with Democrats to scale back mandatory-minimum drug sentencing and likens the war on drugs to Jim Crow? (The same Rand Paul who once said he opposed parts of the Civil Rights Act?) He’s in the same party as Senator John McCain, and yet he opposed arming the Syrian rebels?

But in fact, it’s the boring details of the organization that Paul is building that provide the best reason to take him seriously. If Paul’s views are unusually idealistic, the ground game that his team is planning is pure realpolitik. His staff is focused on the delegate math and party rules that could determine the next Republican nominee — a game-theory style of presidential politics at which the Paul team is particularly adept.

The process by which presidential candidates are nominated is, at its most basic level, a race toward a magic number of party delegates — in the Republican Party’s case, 1,235 required to win — amassed state by state and, in some cases, congressional district by congressional district. Getting them depends not only on the speechifying, door-to-door vote-hunting and million-dollar ad buys we associate with campaigning, but also on a bewildering array of procedural minutia: obscure national bylaws that overlay a mind-bending patchwork of local rules that can vary drastically from state to state, some of which award delegates not based on votes received in primary elections but on back-room wrangling at local party conventions and meetings that take place weeks or even months after votes are cast.

You would think that mastering these arcana would be a priority for campaigns, given their importance. But even the best-funded, most-inevitable-seeming candidates mess them up all the time — and long-shot candidacies have been made, or at least sustained, by getting them right. Barack Obama’s Democratic primary victory in 2008 came in large part because his strategists understood the way delegates were being doled out state by state — even to the losing candidate, based on his or her share of the vote — better than Hillary Rodham Clinton’s team did.

In 2012, Rick Santorum employed a novel strategy of focusing his resources only on states where he stood to gain the most delegates. He left other states uncontested and later tried to steal delegates from Mitt Romney in states where delegates were awarded at the state and local conventions and caucuses. It wasn’t enough to take him to the general election, but it propelled a remarkable run as the primaries’ pre-eminent spoiler — he kept Romney fighting for the nomination until April — by a candidate whom few took seriously at first.

Santorum is expected to make another run in 2016 — but unfortunately for him, two of the main strategists who worked for him in 2012 are now working for Paul. One of them, Mike Biundo, was Santorum’s campaign manager and co-piloted his cross-country hopscotching strategy. The other strategist, Paul’s national political director, John Yob, was part of Santorum’s later-stage delegate-hunting efforts. (Santorum’s chief strategist, John Brabender, told me this week that if Santorum runs, he will be just fine without Biundo and Yob and will build a “more sophisticated” operation than the one he had four years ago). With Santorum, Biundo and Yob learned the rules and the ins and outs of the electoral map in a way few others had. Only one campaign knew them still better: Ron Paul’s.

The elder Paul’s team first showed that it knew its way around the primary rules in 2008, when it took McCain’s campaign by surprise by showing up in force at state conventions to push the election of Paul-friendly convention delegates long after McCain thought he had vanquished all of his Republican rivals. “We weren’t ready for the intensity and organization they put together,” Ryan Price, a McCain national deputy political director who helped run his delegate strategy that year, told me.

The McCain team — on which Yob served as a political director — was able to keep the damage from Paul’s efforts to a minimum. Mitt Romney had less luck in 2012, when the Paulites used the knowledge they had gained from 2008 to win a plurality of delegates in several states long after their primaries and caucuses — none of which Paul actually won — were over. “They were very sophisticated about the chess match,” says Katie Packer Gage, Romney’s 2012 deputy campaign manager. “They definitely caused a lot of headaches.” As I wrote last month, Paul’s success prompted party leaders to enact new rules to discourage candidates from repeating his insurrection, which Rand Paul’s team is scrutinizing now in hopes of figuring out how to work around them.

Ron Paul, of course, never came close to winning the nomination. But if his son can mount a bigger, more credible campaign than that of his father, as he is expected to do, he could use the same apparatus and approach to expertly navigate the rules and cause more than just headaches. “If they can bring all of that with them, then it would be very, very beneficial,” Gage told me. But she added a caveat: “I just wouldn’t make the assumption that his team is going to have it just because his dad’s team had it.”

The family legacy is mixed for Rand Paul. His team does have several veterans of the Ron Paul campaigns, starting with the candidate himself; Ron Paul’s Iowa vice chairman, A. J. Spiker; and Ron Paul’s former campaign manager — and grandson-in-law — Jesse Benton (though Benton is heading to a Paul-supporting “super PAC” and, once that happens, will have to cease direct contact with the official campaign under federal elections law). But as Paul seeks to build a broader base than his father had, he is alienating some of the hard-core, grass-roots Ron Paul loyalists — the same people who were so galvanized by his father’s candidacy that they mastered the minutiae of their state party rules and infiltrated local Republican committees on his behalf.

And all of the Paul team’s savvy at counting delegates and working state rules will only take him so far if another candidate — a Jeb Bush, say, or a Scott Walker — builds early momentum and wins a series of primaries out of the gate. A truly inevitable candidate does not need to worry about the small stuff or try to game the rules. Great victories bring great caches of delegates.

But in a close-fought, state-by-state contest between two or more competitive candidates, the campaign that best understands the intricacies of delegate allotment will have a real edge — and at this point, that campaign is almost certainly Paul’s. Like Obama in 2008, Paul is a first-term senator who, aware of his underdog status, is spending the campaign’s early days planning for all the scenarios it can envision.

When I asked Yob — a second-generation Michigan Republican who knows better than to show any kinship with Obama — about the parallels, he laughed off the question. “We are simultaneously building early-state organizations that are the strongest in the field while also preparing for the possibility of a nominating process that extends to the caucuses and state conventions, where convention delegates will ultimately be selected,” he told me. “It is safe to say, I like our chances in caucus systems and conventions across the country.”",0.99999998381944954,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.026896210813943604, u'mexico': 0.033011557150593451, u'abortion': 0.031926149399794983, u'immigration': 0.002062007826761453, u'trade': 0.11515747426190834, u'campaign_finance': 0.13240036455916682, u'other': 1.8915220899126571e-05, u'china': 0.010222276700553916, u'military': 0.0083182691439918355, u'terrorism': 0.17557492805455507, u'economy': 0.40756626152381648, u'health': 0.004800147857327782, u'women': 0.052045437486687204}"
Green Bay Packers 2015 Draft Preview,fox,"			
			 (SportsNetwork.com) - Ted Thompson has the great draft rep but a lot of his    recent history in the first round has come up snake eyes. The three-year stint    before Ha Ha Clinton-Dix in 2014 produced Derek Sherrod, Nick Perry and Datone    Jones, not exactly a murderer's row.Point being, the sterling reputation as a talent evaluator may not be all that 
  it's cracked up to be when you put it under the microscope. Thompson was 
  certainly right back in 2005, though, when he selected Aaron Rodgers with the 
  24th overall pick out of Cal and that one selection has masked many a 
  deficiency in recent years.
The early returns are positive on Clinton-Dix so maybe the worm has turned for 
  Thompson, who starts this year's process with the 30th overall selection.
Surprisingly the Packers brought back both B.J. Raji and Letroy Guion at 
  defensive tackle so if you read the tea leaves Green Bay will likely shift its 
  focus toward the secondary to bolster a cornerback group that needs 
  reinforcements.
From a pure football perspective, Washington's Marcus Peters is regarded by 
  some as the best corner prospect in this draft class and the top man- to- 
  man coverage option in the process. He comes with plenty of baggage, though, 
  problems which become far more palatable late in the first round.

Hillary Clinton lays out climate change initiative,washpo,"   Hillary Rodham Clinton speaks at the Veterans Memorial Building before the Iowa Democratic Party's Hall of Fame Dinner on July 17 in Cedar Rapids. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)  DES MOINES — Hillary Rodham Clinton called for harnessing the power of the sun to generate enough renewable energy to run every home in the country within the next decade, as part of a climate change initiative announced Sunday. ""Future generations will look back and wonder, 'What were we thinking? How could we possibly be so irresponsible?' "" the Democratic presidential candidate says in a video that accompanied the plan, which was posted on her Web site Sunday night. ""I'm just a grandmother with two eyes and a brain and I know what's happening in the world will affect my daughter and especially my granddaughter,"" she said. In addition to touting her plan, which would include installing more than half a billion solar panels nationwide during the first term of her presidency, Clinton criticized the Republican presidential candidates, who generally dismiss the notion of climate change. ""It's hard to believe that people running for president refuse to believe the settled science of climate change,"" she says in the video as quotes attributed to GOP hopefuls fill the screen. One such quote, attributed to former Florida governor Jeb Bush, reads: ""I'm a skeptic. I'm not a scientist."" Earlier Sunday, while campaigning in Iowa, she used the ""grandmother with two eyes and a brain"" quip, receiving chuckles and applause. She praised Iowa's efforts to embrace renewable energy, noting that the state produces 30 percent of its energy from wind. Windmills are a common sight on the horizon across the state.

GOP candidates jockey for position in final debate dash,fox,"







							mboxCreate('FoxNews-Politics-Autoplay-Videos-In-Articles');
						
Less than a week before a bushel of 2016 Republican presidential hopefuls square off for the first time in two Fox News debates, billionaire businessman Donald Trump is holding firm to his primary lead -- while his lower-polling rivals battle for visibility in hopes of making the cut for the prime-time stage. 
Trump, seemingly reveling in his role as instigator and bipartisan punching bag, opened up a 7-point lead over the rest of the field in the most recent national poll. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush also are polling consistently well. 
Rather, the 11th-hour dash is among those in the middle and back of the pack, competing for the last of 10 slots in the prime-time event at Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena. 
The Aug. 6 debate is hosted by Fox News, in conjunction with Facebook and the Ohio Republican Party.  
The 9 p.m. ET stage will be open to the top 10 candidates in recent national polls. With 17 total candidates now in the race – former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore was the latest, announcing his bid Thursday – not everyone will make the cut.  
Those who don’t can qualify for an earlier debate, at 5 p.m. Fox News has eased the criteria for that debate, and candidates will no longer have to reach at least 1 percent in the polls to make the stage, though there are other criteria.

But there is heavy competition for the main event, the first time leading candidates will face off after seemingly weekly campaign kick-offs.  
“There’s too many, and so there is going to be a culling of the herd,” said Mark Jones, political science fellow at the Baker Institute at Houston’s Rice University. 
With national poll placement dictating who gets prime-time, the candidates on the margin are doing their best to boost their visibility, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Texas Gov. Rick Perry.  
Perry challenged poll-leader Trump to a pull-up contest after a week of pummeling the billionaire real estate tycoon for his comments on Mexican illegal immigrants and Sen. John McCain.  
Meanwhile, Christie declared war on marijuana this week, promising Coloradans they had better enjoy legalized pot today because he will enforce federal laws against it when he is in the White House.  
Speaking with Fox News on Thursday, the Garden State guv said ""we're very confident we'll be at the 9:00 debate."" 
After spending the last several months going after Bush – now third in the RealClearPolitics poll average, behind Walker – Christie is competing these days more with Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Christie clocked in at 3 percent in the same RCP average, right behind Kasich, putting them on the tail end of the top 10.  
Potentially outside the margin, but fighting to get in, are Perry, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, ex-Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum.  
Former New York Gov. George Pataki and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham are further behind. Each, though, has been trying to take on Trump in recent weeks, with the latter putting out a viral video of himself destroying a cell phone – a response to Trump giving out his number during the McCain flap (Graham had lashed out at Trump for questioning his friend McCain’s heroism, triggering Trump’s ire).  
“I think the top eight candidates are comfortable where they are,” said Jones. “[The others] are pushing the envelope with the goal of rising above the dust that was created when you have 17 candidates running.”  
Not making the prime-time cut isn’t the end of the road by any means, and there’s still plenty of time before the Iowa caucuses.  
“I don’t think being left out of the debate is a death knell,” said Steve Deace, who hosts a conservative radio talk show in the Hawkeye State. However, he said, “it can hurt from a momentum standpoint, in that it is a spotlight you are not getting.” 
“It will be a huge spotlight and I think for someone who is underfunded and under-organized who is impressive when they are in front of people, like Bobby Jindal, this is the spotlight they are going to need.”  
Perhaps an indication of how comfortable the GOP front-runner feels right now, Trump is in Scotland and attended the Women's British Open at one of his resorts – though he still talked campaign shop with reporters Thursday.  
Bush, though, is back on the stump stateside on Friday, with plans to address the National Urban League, along with retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Walker and Christie are campaigning in Iowa Friday, as is Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. Kasich is in New Hampshire. 
For all the buzz and attention surrounding Trump, there is now pressure on him to perform.  
“He is clearly the man of the hour from a buzz standpoint,” Deace said. “I think with one or two exceptions, the goal of the others is to get him to go from zany to crazy, to self-immolate.”  
But that might be difficult, considering he’s weathered a string of controversies over his blunt remarks since entering the race. The worst thing that can happen is for Trump to pull his punches and wimp out, Deace said. “His entire campaign is based on him being a blunt instrument he can get back at Washington with. If he dulls those edges, that would be the death knell for him.”  
Deace said the others, though, have something to gain by not going for the bait.  
“It will be interesting to see how Scott Walker performs in this environment. I think we have to see if this [debate] diminishes his stature or he is able to craft an everyman persona who is a nice contrast to the bigger personalities,” he said. On the other hand, “I think Ben Carson has a much more reserved, laid-back way of communicating than the rest of these candidates. Will he bore people, or be seen as the adult in the room?” ",0.99999999854703825,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.01553926241540657, u'mexico': 0.018681565223783506, u'abortion': 0.039189275527711606, u'immigration': 0.51963457455965156, u'trade': 0.22077670381339137, u'campaign_finance': 0.056313253278379598, u'other': 1.1004157855722709e-05, u'china': 0.00080665258625374915, u'military': 0.0019690913288764379, u'terrorism': 0.059954967321795435, u'economy': 0.034809233911062047, u'health': 0.0029324762190660438, u'women': 0.02938193965676646}"
Coffman's Smoke and Mirrors on Immigration Reform,huffpo,"Former media critic at the Rocky Mountain News; Blogger, www.bigmedia.org.
In response to my recent post urging reporters to spotlight Mike Coffman's weak advocacy for immigration reform, Coffman's spokesman Tyler Sandberg told me via Twitter that ""Google is Your Friend,"" and directed me to an instance when Coffman said he was ""deeply disappointed"" with House opposition to a resolution allowing young immigrants to gain citizenship via military service.
Google is my friend, and it confirms my larger point that Coffman does little to promote immigration reform besides create the appearance of seriousness without the much substance at all.
Coffman has expressed disappointment, yes, but he hasn't seriously challenged Boehner, who's arguably been the biggest obstacle to immigration reform in the country.
Where was Coffman's disappointment when the Senate's bipartisan immigration legislation, with Marco Rubio's name on it, died in the House. Coffman didn't even support a vote on the bipartisan and comprehensive bill, despite Coffman's public statements in favor of comprehensive immigration reform.
And what did he do instead? Nothing on comprehensive reform, except scrub his website of the phrase ""comprehensive immigration reform"" and to tell the Aurora Sentinel, ""What Boehner has said, and I agree with, is that a comprehensive approach doesn't have to be a comprehensive bill.""
Coffman's legislation for young immigrants and his alleged support for a guest worker program fall short of comprehensive reform no matter how you wordsmith it, and they've failed, in part, because Coffman goes to a fundraiser with Boehner at the Brown Palace and doesn't talk about immigration on the same day Coffman's bill is being killed by Republican leadership in Washington.
Via Twitter, I asked Coffman's spokesman Sandberg to write a blog post explaining how his boss has pushed Boehner for serious immigration reform--and better yet, to show us how it's done.
There's no public record of the kind of effort we've seen from Coffman on other issues. Nothing close.

Obamacare repeal vote fails in Senate,politico,"Mike Lee, pictured, is expected to ask the Senate to reconsider the Obamacare amendment. | AP Photo
By Jennifer Haberkorn
7/26/15 4:10 PM EDT
The Senate on Sunday voted down a Republican effort to repeal Obamacare, the GOP’s first attempt to get rid of the president’s health law since the party took control of the chamber in January.
The effort fell 49-43, exactly along party lines, with eight senators not voting in the rare weekend session. Third-fifths of the Senate would have had to vote to add Obamacare repeal to a highway funding bill.
Story Continued Below
Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) is expected to ask the Senate — likely Monday — to reconsider the Obamacare amendment. He would propose a procedural motion to change Senate rules in order to try to repeal the Affordable Care Act with just 51 votes.
Such a momentous change in the Senate’s rules is unlikely. But conservatives have suggested that they would chastise Republicans who would block a rule change that could lead to repealing the health law that they detest.

BURGESS EVERETT and MANU RAJU
Republican Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) all initially voted against repeal but changed their votes within minutes after the apparent mistakes. Paul’s aide was spotted on the floor talking with the senator after the initial vote was cast. Collins and Sasse corrected their votes at the same time and shared comments on the Senate floor.
Other than that, Sunday’s repeal vote played out as expected. No Republican or Democrat has expressed any hint that they would break from their party’s firmly held position on Obamacare.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) predicted that outcome on Friday as he railed against Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s decision to hold the vote, saying it was done to placate conservatives who were angry that another vote was called to authorize the Export-Import bank.
“We’ll have a vote on repealing Obamacare. The Republicans will all vote yes, the Democrats will all vote no. It will be at a 60-vote threshold, it will fail,” Cruz said then. “It will be an exercise in meaningless political theater.”
Yet the vote does allow Republicans — particularly freshman lawmakers — to say that they’ve cast a vote to repeal the ACA. Several had said they wanted a chance to get on the record on a campaign promise they’d all made.
“What I’m trying to do in my short time here is look at the commitments I made to the constituents and voters of Alaska and follow through on those commitments,” first-term Sen. Dan Sullivan said last week. “And that was a commitment, and I want to follow through on it.”

But Sullivan, like many other Republicans, also said he’d like to see the Senate act on changes to the health law that have a chance of becoming law, such as repealing its medical-device tax or changing its definition of “full time” work from 30 hours to 40 hours.
“Obviously a full repeal and replace is going … to be unsuccessful,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said before the vote was scheduled. “So I would like to see us do things like move the work week to 40 hours.”
Democrats used Sunday’s vote as an opportunity to praise the health care law.
“The House has voted 55 times. The Supreme Court said it’s fine. We’re reaching 20 million Americans who now have health care,” Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said Friday. Repeal “would hurt too many people, it would create chaos.”
The Senate has voted three other times on legislation to fully repeal Obamacare — in March 2010, February 2011 and March 2013. All were on party lines. The Senate has voted about three dozen times on bills to repeal or defund all or part of the health care law since it was passed in 2010.

Oklahoma woman named Miss USA; Trump a no-show,reuters,"Oklahoma's Olivia Jordan was crowned Miss USA on Sunday, capping weeks of controversy in the run-up to the annual beauty pageant after its co-owner Donald Trump made incendiary remarks about Mexican immigrants while announcing his run for president.
Several judges, guests and the event's hosts all backed out after the real estate mogul described some migrants from Mexico to the United States as drug-runners and rapists while announcing in June he was seeking the Republican nomination.
Despite the controversy, no incidents or disruptions were apparent either in the audience or on stage during the live broadcast from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, carried on cable channel Reelz after NBC dropped the show over Trump's remarks.
Trump, who traditionally attends, said on Saturday he would be campaigning and would not be on hand.
Jordan, 26, an actress and graduate of Boston University, won the 64th pageant after deftly answering a question about the nation's next hot-button issue. Other finalists stumbled while answering similarly topical questions from the judges, who were all past pageant winners such as Miss Universe and Miss USA.
""We still need to talk about race relations in the country, we have not solved this issue,"" Jordan said. ""We really need to work on being an accepting society.""
The other finalists came from Rhode Island, Maryland and Nevada, with Texas' Ylianna Guerra winning first runner-up.
Several of the top 15 finishers spoke of their Latin American heritage, including Rhode Island's Anea Garcia, who was raised by her grandmother, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic. Garcia came in third among 51 contestants.
One segment focused specifically on contestants' multi- cultural backgrounds, with the women speaking in taped segments about being bi-racial or coming from immigrant families.
Among the few indirect or veiled references to Trump's remarks, Miss USA 2013 Erin Brady said during a live interview that she was happy to be on hand cheering the contestants on, ""especially given the chaos of the past two weeks.""
Game show host Todd Newton and former Miss USA Alex Wehrley shared hosting duties after MSNBC newsman Thomas Roberts and ""Dancing With the Stars"" host Cheryl Burke dropped out.
Hinting at the controversy, Newton referred at the show's outset to ""what has become the most anticipated and what will be the most exciting night in recent pageant history.""

Donald Trump Exaggerates Crowd Size At Phoenix Rally,huffpo,"Despite Donald Trump's assertion that the crowd at his Saturday campaign event in Phoenix was the largest of any presidential candidate so far in the race, all other estimates put the number of attendees significantly below what the Trump campaign said.
The campaign moved the rally from the Arizona Biltmore hotel to the Phoenix Convention Center to allow more people to attend. When Trump arrived at the podium, he claimed the crowd was larger than those at Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) presidential campaign events.
""This blows away anything Bernie Sanders has gotten,"" Trump said.
By comparison, Sanders' largest crowd was 10,000 in Madison, Wisconsin.
In a tweet, which has since been deleted, Trump said he was ""[s]peaking to 20,000+ patriots in Arizona."" A post on his Facebook page claimed 15,000. After the event, a campaign press release also had the crowd at 15,000 and called the event ""the largest campaign event of any presidential candidate this cycle.""
 But the Washington Post report on Trump's event put the audience at 4,200 individuals, less than a third the size of Trump's estimate. The Phoenix Fire Department said the crowd was capped at that number in accordance with the fire code for the ballroom.
Trump, who is now leading opinion polls in the Republican presidential primary race, has a theory on why no one agrees with his estimates.
This isn't the first time Trump's crowds have come under question.

Letter: Restrict Campaign Money?,nyt,"To the Editor:

Should we, as Lawrence Lessig suggests, place restrictions on campaign funding (“Free Our Democracy,” Op-Ed, July 21)? Well, campaigns are now no different from any other form of media advertising. Should we place restrictions on advertising campaigns for products and services?

While there are worthwhile and sensible rules that do regulate advertising (a modicum of truthfulness; nothing that harms outright like cigarettes, age-appropriate branding), our most effective means of countering the flood of media messages is more rigorous education to make the consumer aware.

Too bad educating the public is not a political priority.

The No. 1 Reason You Should Hire a Family Member,fox,"
Many small businesses have and continue to be run by families. For a long time, I doubted how well that really worked. I care about my work deeply -- too deeply, some might argue. Did I really want to risk bringing any more responsibility or stress into my home?
But over the years, I’ve watched my best friend Brian Riddle, who I’ve written about before, run his farm in the Central Valley that way. He absolutely loves working with his sons and his wife. They’re very close. It’s obvious that the experience has been extremely rewarding for all of them.
Related: What My Father Taught Me About Getting Started in Entrepreneurship
My wife has always been my business partner, but not quite in the same way. Although she weighs in on every important decision I make, it’s from afar rather than up close. When you run your own business, you can’t help but bring it home to some extent.
But recently I’ve changed my tune. I think hiring family members has serious long-term benefits. Working together towards a common goal has the potential to strengthen, not weaken or break, your bonds. At the end of the day, we all benefit, in a very tangible way, from the work we put in. We’re invested. We share an incentive to grow and maintain a healthy, strong business.
At least, that’s been my experience thus far -- last October, I hired my eldest daughter full time.
In truth, she’s been helping me manage my content for years now. At the beginning, I had my doubts. Would we be able to work together? At first, it really was a challenge. If I’m being honest, it took years for us to understand and respect each other’s strengths and weaknesses.
But this past year has been the best ever. Having someone so much younger on my team has been very helpful. She has truly given me a whole new outlook. She keeps me current. In turn, I get to watch her grow as an entrepreneur and a person. We set goals together. All those years we spent figuring out how to work effectively with one another have paid off.
Related: 4 Secrets to Highly Successful Family-Owned Businesses
Sure, there are lots of reasons to fear hiring a family member. Adam Callinan wrote about of few of them for this website just a couple of days ago. Those fears are reasonable, to be sure. But in my eyes, there is one incredibly significant benefit to working with a family member: My daughter tells me no when others would simply say yes. I can always count on her to give me her honest opinion. I might not like it, and I often don’t, but there you have it.
I think that’s essential to a true partnership: Honesty.
How often do you feel like you get an honest opinion from anyone, let alone your co-workers, boss or employees? Her willingness to keep it real with me moves our business forward that much faster. She doesn’t waste any time beating around the bush. And that’s because she’s looking out for both of our interests.
The truth is that I want to help all of my children succeed. This way, we’re both helping each other. Looking back, I felt like I was going to teach her about business. I think I have, but I also feel like she’s taught me just as much about people and relationships. I wasn’t expecting that. What a gift! I consider myself one the luckiest people on the planet.
My fingers are crossed that no one else is able to pay her as well I can for a long time to come!

"Martin O’Malley Announces Presidential Campaign, Pushing Image of Vitality",nyt,"BALTIMORE — In another campaign year, Martin O’Malley’s résumé and good looks might be irresistible to Democratic primary voters. He is a former big-city mayor whose story of renewal in Baltimore seemed well tailored to an increasingly urban and minority party. He is a former two-term governor of Maryland — and the lead singer and guitarist in a rock ’n’ roll band.

But Mr. O’Malley is running in an election cycle in which Democratic elected officials and donors have overwhelmingly focused attention on Hillary Rodham Clinton. And he already faces competition from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for the support of liberals who dislike Mrs. Clinton or merely want to see her pushed further to the left.

After a two-year exploratory phase, Mr. O’Malley, 52, on Saturday began to make a case for why Democrats should bet on him instead of on Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Sanders, who has captured early enthusiasm among progressives as an authentic populist.

“Today, the American dream seems for so many of us to be hanging by a thread,” he said in formally announcing his candidacy before hundreds of supporters under a baking sun in Federal Hill Park in Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, with the towers of the city’s downtown behind him.

“This is not the American dream,” he added. “It does not have to be this way. This generation of Americans still has time to become great. We must save our country now. And we will do that by rebuilding the dream.”

His aides say Mr. O’Malley is a true progressive, one who became involved early on the issue of same-sex marriage, and a scrappy underdog who takes to tough political fights. He staked out early ground on an immigration overhaul in 2014, accusing the Obama administration of heartlessness in deporting children who had crossed the border from Mexico.

But Mr. O’Malley was also a staunch supporter of Mrs. Clinton in her 2008 presidential campaign, and he rose to prominence as a tough-on-crime mayor in Baltimore, a city scarred by drugs and violence. In two years of travels to Iowa and New Hampshire, he has frequently been reluctant to discuss Mrs. Clinton or to draw a pointed contrast with her, doing so only obliquely — faulting unnamed politicians for “triangulation,” for example, a word associated with the Clintons’ up-the-middle political calculations since the 1990s.

It is also unclear whether Mr. O’Malley can aggressively raise funds without a devoted base of support, which Mr. Sanders can draw on, or a raft of major donors, which Mrs. Clinton enjoys. His aides have declined to say whether he has a single backer who would be willing to contribute millions of dollars to a “super PAC” to keep him afloat.

And Mrs. Clinton’s team is making inroads in Maryland: The state’s two senators, Barbara A. Mikulski and Benjamin L. Cardin, have already endorsed her.

Still, Mr. O’Malley’s team believes he fills a natural void in the Democratic primary, and Mrs. Clinton’s team acknowledges that a significant portion of the primary electorate is likely to favor someone else.

“Here you’ve got a clear generational divide, and a lot of Americans think about that,” said Gary Hart, a former Colorado senator and Democratic presidential candidate. “They are less inclined to divide themselves in the world between ‘liberals’ and ‘conservatives,’ and more between the past and the future.”

That, Mr. Hart said, would give Mr. O’Malley an advantage.

And it is Mr. Hart’s come-from-behind candidacy in the 1984 Democratic primaries, which ultimately fell short, that has helped inform Mr. O’Malley’s thinking about his own race.

Mr. O’Malley, who grew up in the Washington suburbs, took time off from Catholic University to work on Mr. Hart’s campaign that year. He later moved to Baltimore, married into a political family, became a city councilman and won the first of two terms as mayor in 1999 in a crowded field. He was credited with a crackdown on crime and on drugs.

He went on to win two terms as governor of Maryland, with his star still rising. He was often described as a results-oriented policy expert, whose successful push for a same-sex marriage referendum was well ahead of the curve of a national movement. He signed into law a bill raising the minimum wage, but he also presided over a disastrous rollout of a health care exchange under the Affordable Care Act.

In recent weeks, he returned to Baltimore to walk the streets after an unarmed black man died of injuries sustained while he was in police custody.

In the days before Saturday’s announcement, his advisers and allies shaped the race with generational contours, though aides to Mr. O’Malley insist they are not trying to play up Mrs. Clinton’s age (she is 67).

The contrast has been unmistakable, though: In a video released by his aides on Friday morning, Mr. O’Malley plucked a guitar (to the tune of “Hail to the Chief”) while the camera focused on his hands. And his aides have repeatedly used the word “old” — as in “old guard” or “old way of thinking” — in veiled references to Mrs. Clinton, something that has not been lost on her allies.

Mr. O’Malley’s team is still being formed. He has three deputy campaign managers, including Lis Smith, who has handled his communications for several years. His top consultant is Bill Hyers, who managed Bill de Blasio’s victory in the 2013 New York City mayor’s race.

But he still had not announced a campaign manager when he took the stage on Saturday.",0.98356962708894957,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.04758513908851119, u'mexico': 0.2817451973606408, u'abortion': 0.050610071794678441, u'immigration': 0.43691464131758145, u'trade': 0.0070770731920037563, u'campaign_finance': 0.11560346285315796, u'other': 0.0026482004874681607, u'china': 0.0042849580364052982, u'military': 0.0063313464889770115, u'terrorism': 0.028664099711812337, u'economy': 0.0029513933519017431, u'health': 0.0079092252336805113, u'women': 0.0076751910831811664}"
Republican Strategist: I Don't Need Hillary Clinton To 'Drown Me In Estrogen',huffpo,"GOP strategist Ana Navarro said she's had enough of Hillary Clinton doing that whole ""woman thing.""
You know the thing: where she gets on stage and talks about hugely important, fundamental family and women's issues as she campaigns to become the first female president of the United States. 
Navarro claimed on CNN that Clinton's ""woman thing"" is ""lacking subtlety"" this time around. 
""I don't need her to drown me in estrogen every time she opens her mouth,"" Navarro said Sunday. ""Every time she opens her mouth it's about the granddaughter and Chelsea's wedding and the yoga routines ... She doesn't need to have a sign that says, 'I'm a woman, hear me roar!'""
The rest of the CNN panel backed away from Navarro's views, arguing that the fact that Clinton is a mom, a grandmother and a woman means that femininity is ""a part of her.""
""Isn't it a part of all of us?"" former Sen. Blanche Lincoln added. ""It's our family. It's what we talk about. It's what we fight for.""

Oligarchy Of Super PAC Megadonors Have Conquered American Politics,huffpo,"WASHINGTON -- A new oligarchic era of American politics came into full view on Friday, as super PACs disclosed fundraising details showing billionaires bankrolling the 2016 presidential race to an unprecedented degree. 
The unlimited-money super PACs account for one-third of all federal election funds raised in the first half of 2015 -- up from 4 percent at this time in the last presidential election. Three-quarters of all super PAC money came from more than 500 wealthy donors, corporations and unions in contributions above $100,000. More than half the money in the presidential race so far -- to super PACs and to campaigns -- came from donors who have given at least $100,000.
For the first time in more than a century, the majority of funding for a presidential election is coming in six-figure or larger checks from corporations and the wealthiest Americans. The presidential campaigns, limited to a maximum of $5,400 from a single donor, raised a combined $128 million. Super PACs supporting those candidates pulled in $260 million, with $208 million from those giving $100,000 or more. 
“The 2016 presidential candidates and their individual-candidate Super PACs are wiping out the nation’s anti-corruption candidate contribution limits,” Democracy 21 president and longtime campaign finance reform advocate Fred Wertheimer said in a statement. “In doing so, the presidential candidates and the Super PACs supporting them are creating the kind of system that the Supreme Court has described as an inherently corrupt system.”
The dramatic shift to a campaign finance system built upon outsized contributions of the wealthy and their businesses comes five years after the Supreme Court’s 5-4 Citizens United decision opened the door to unlimited electoral spending by corporations, unions and, individuals so long as it remained independent of candidates. 
Overall, super PACs raised $314 million through the end of June, compared with $26 million at the same time in 2011. More than 500 donors have given at least $100,000, for a total of $238 million -- 75 percent all super PAC donations.
The super PAC expansion appears likely to take over much of the political fundraising system, especially at the presidential level.
As an oligarchy of campaign contributors has begun to dominate political fundraising, opposition is mounting, with activists calling for campaign finance reform and a rejection of super PAC politics. In Iowa, a coalition of Republicans and Democrats called Iowa Pays the Price are spotlighting the influx of big money into their state to bring attention to the issue. A group called the New Hampshire Rebellion is calling attention to the trend in the nation’s first presidential primary state.
Former President Jimmy Carter this week took note of what was happening to the nation’s politics as candidates race for larger and larger checks from billionaires and millionaires.
""It violates the essence of what made America a great country in its political system,"" Carter said in a radio interview July 28. ""Now it’s just an oligarchy, with unlimited political bribery being the essence of getting the nominations for president or to elect the president.""
Numerous candidates have obliterated the requirement that their super PACs operate independently, by directly coordinating with the groups and raising money for them. Republican Jeb Bush personally raised $103 million for his super PAC during a six-month period when he declared that he was not officially running for president. 
Bush raised a combined $114 million, including his official campaign and his super PAC. Of that, 63 percent came from donors giving $100,000 or more. Twenty-four of Bush’s super PAC donors gave $1 million or more.
Much of Bush’s money came from a vast pool of large donors. Unlike the rest of the Republican field, Bush’s Right to Rise super PAC collected $100,000-plus donations from about 300 individual donors. His donor list includes more than 1,000 people, corporations or political committees that gave at least $10,000.
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) racked up 71 percent of his super PAC and campaign fundraising from big donors, almost all of it from three million-dollar contributors: $15 million from the fracking Wilks family, $11 million from New York hedge fund executive Robert Mercer, and $10 million from Texas private equity investor Toby Negeubauer.
Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's (R) campaign and super PAC raised 60 percent of their combined total from six-figure donors, most from million-dollar contributors. He raised $5 million from his longtime personal funder, luxury car dealer Norman Braman, $3 million from Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, $2.5 million from a thoroughbred horse stable owned by Benjamin Leon and $2 million from the Israeli-American wife of the Marvel Entertainment CEO, Laura Perlmutter.
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) hasn't reported any fundraising for his official campaign. But two unlimited money groups working for him had raised $26 million. Those groups raised 77 percent of their money from donors giving more than six figures. Like other candidates, Walker's groups were predominantly funded by a few million-dollar checks, including $5 million from Wisconsin roofing billionaire Diane Hendricks, $5 million from Chicago Cubs owners Marlene and Joe Ricketts, $2.5 million from Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein, and $1 million from Access Industries, a company run by billionaire Len Blavatnik. 
New Day for America, a group that has since converted into a super PAC, supports Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) and raised more than $11 million, with 86 percent from those giving more than $100,000. Four gave $1 million.
The same can be said for nearly every candidate on down the line: Six-figure donors fueled 85 percent of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s (R) super PAC fundraising; 62 percent for two groups backing Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal; 83 percent for former Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s (R) groups; 83 percent for Sen. Lindsey Graham’s (R-S.C.) super PAC; more than 90 percent for three groups supporting Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.); and 62 percent for former tech CEO Carly Fiorina’s super PAC.
Some big billionaire names were absent from the list of Republican presidential candidate megadonors, including casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer and the industrialists Charles and David Koch.
While the big-money race on the Republican side of the presidential campaign is most intense, it's not absent from the Democratic Party. Frontrunner Hillary Clinton’s super PAC, Priorities USA Action, a hand-me-down from President Barack Obama, raised $15.6 million, with 99 percent of it coming from $100,000-plus donors. Her group raised nine $1 million checks from George Soros, Haim and Cheryl Saban, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg, Herbert Sandler, Donald Sussman, a union for plumbers and pipefitters, and a union-backed political group.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (I) eschews the big-money super PAC race. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley’s (D) Generation Forward raised $290,000.
Large super PAC fundraising also occurred outside the presidential race.
Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer donated $5 million to his personal super PAC, NextGen Climate Action Committee. The United Brotherhood of Carpenters, the AFL-CIO and United Steelworkers each gave more than $1 million to their own super PACs. Singer, who so far has not put his chips down in the presidential race, gave more than $1 million to his super PAC in support of Republicans who favor gay marriage (of which there are very few). And then there’s Cruz’s benefactor, Mercer, who gave $1 million to a super PAC controlled by the neoconservative former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton.
A new super PAC launched by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to support his Republican majority pulled in three $1 million donations, from Houston Texans owner Robert McNair, Home Depot co-founder Bernard Marcus and Singer.

Justice Department: No criminal referral over Clinton emails,reuters,"WASHINGTON The Justice Department said Friday it has received a request to examine the handling of classified information related to the private emails from Hillary Clinton during her time as secretary of state, but it is not a criminal referral.
The department's statement followed a report by the New York Times that Justice Department officials had received a request to open a criminal investigation into the Clinton emails. 
A separate memo disclosed Friday from government inspector generals expressed concern about how the emails were being handled as they were prepared for release to the public.

Democratic candidates want the rich to pay for fatter Social Security checks,washpo,"   Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley addresses the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C. on Sept. 4, 2012. (AP/J. Scott Applewhite)  In a policy paper released Friday, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley called for more generous Social Security benefits, partly paid for with higher taxes on workers who make more than $250,000 a year. The presidential contender's proposal is similar to the one released earlier this year by his rival, Bernie Sanders. President Obama had advanced the idea as a candidate in the 2008 campaign, but the consensus among Democrats is still missing an important member. Hillary Clinton, the frontrunner in next year's primary, has yet to put out a detailed plan. In 2008, she said she opposed the tax increase, although she recently suggested her views may be changing. [Clinton is open to raising Social Security taxes on six-figure earners] With relatively few workers saving for retirement, progressive activists and Democrats in Congress have argued for fattening Americans' monthly Social Security checks. At the same time, the system's trust fund will be exhausted sometime about 20 years from now, according to current projections. If that happens, Social Security won't be able to pay out in full the benefits that retirees would be owed, even at the current level. Higher taxes on well-heeled workers could help pay for more generous benefits. Workers only pay Social Security taxes on their yearly income below a certain limit. This year, the limit is $118,500 in earnings. They won't pay taxes on the rest, and Social Security will not count anything above that limit toward their benefits. O'Malley and Sanders would impose Social Security payroll taxes on workers who earn more than $250,000 a year. Workers who make less than $250,000 but more than the existing limit ($118,500 this year) would pay the same amount in taxes.  [A simple guide to the real differences between the Democratic candidates for president]  Sanders proposed a larger tax increase than O'Malley did. The independent senator from Vermont also called for an additional 6.2 percent tax on investment income above $250,000, which would ensure that wealthy people who get most of their income from dividends and stock sales instead of salaries also pay more into Social Security. Social Security actuaries project that under Sanders's proposal, the system's trust fund would be exhausted in 50 years, rather than 20, as shown in the chart below.    Social Security Administration.  O'Malley's proposal does not include a tax on investment income, and also includes other benefits not in Sanders's plan. O'Malley wants to allow people who take time off work to care for a child or aging parent credit that time toward their benefits when they retire, even though they may have limited or no income in those years. Independent estimates of how O'Malley's plan would affect Social Security's finances in the long term aren't available yet, but his proposal would probably would do less to shore up the system than Sanders's would. ""Social Security remains an especially critical lifeline for our parents and grandparents,"" O'Malley's plan reads. ""We should expand Social Security so they can retire with the dignity they have earned over the course of their working lives."" [Read more: O’Malley proposes expanding Social Security benefits, other measures to aid seniors] Andrew Biggs, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said O'Malley's math didn't add up. ""The very definition of fiscal irresponsibility is promising more benefits before you've figured out how to pay the benefits you’ve already promised,"" Biggs said. Americans generally agree that Social Security should be expanded. Polls show that Americans support increases in Social Security taxes, along with more generous benefits. But that doesn't mean a change in the limit on taxable income would be easy to move through Congress. Sanders's proposal, in particular, would amount to a substantial tax increase on the rich.",0.88635193812690738,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.0023820347608175482, u'mexico': 0.002441306057743081, u'abortion': 0.0054301731849282662, u'immigration': 0.016220322659098698, u'trade': 0.0094033954995389121, u'campaign_finance': 0.0045262249291213525, u'other': 0.00093135082974292623, u'china': 0.017173335032403335, u'military': 0.0028819246832828874, u'terrorism': 0.032643942697767291, u'economy': 0.895045970524598, u'health': 0.0031094181798058695, u'women': 0.0078106009611518768}"
"Trump won't apologize to McCain, suggests backlash led by trailing GOP rivals - VIDEO: Trump responds to backlash",fox,"







							mboxCreate('FoxNews-Politics-Autoplay-Videos-In-Articles');
						
Donald Trump on Sunday declined to apologize for his comments about war veteran and Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain, suggesting the backlash is being fueled by fellow Republican presidential candidates trailing him in the polls.
“Republican candidates, some of whom are registering one percent and zero, they're very upset that I'm leading the polls by actually a nice margin,” Trump, a self-funded, billionaire real estate mogul, told ABC’s “This Week.” “They started attacking me.”
On Saturday, Trump acknowledge that McCain, a former Navy fighter pilot who spent five-and-a-half years as a prisoner during the Vietnam War, was indeed a war hero but only “because he was captured.”
“I like people who weren’t captured,” he also said.
The feud between Trump and McCain appeared to have started during a recent event in Phoenix, Ariz., that swelled to 1,500 people, many apparently energized by Trump suggesting that he would, if elected, build a wall along the southern U.S. border and that some Mexicans coming into the country are rapists and drug dealers.
McCain, whom Trump financially backed in his failed 2008 presidential bid, called the attendees “crazies,” which upset Trump, who called for an apology.
Most of the 14 other GOP candidates have condemned Trump’s remarks about McCain, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry who are calling for Trump to quit the race.
“This is not just an insult to John McCain, who clearly is a war hero and a great man,” Rubio said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “But it's an insult to all POWs, to all men and women who have served us in uniform, who have been captured in battle. … It's ridiculous. And I do think it is a disqualifier as commander in chief.”
Within hours of Trump’s “war hero” comments, Perry called for him to drop out, and he repeated his position Sunday.
“I really don't understand his strategy here of taking on a bullet that went through John McCain and a hit a lot of us that wore the uniform of this country,” Perry said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “And I still stand by my statement. Until Mr. Trump apologizes directly to John McCain and to the veterans of this country, I don't think he has the character or the temperament to hold the highest position in this country.”
McCain has yet to respond.
“I'm certainly not pulling out,” Trump told ABC. “I'm leading and I'm leading in many states.  … And I will win the Hispanic vote.”
Trump also said he received a standing ovation after the event Saturday in Ames, Iowa, at which he made the comments and that “nobody was offended.”
“This whole thing was brought up by a lot of the people that are competing against me currently that aren't even registering in the polls,” he said.
Trump also repeated earlier criticism about McCain failing to use his elected position of power to improve the trouble Department of Veterans Affairs so that veterans could get better health care without the exceedingly long waits.
“It's a scandal. And John McCain has done nothing,” he said, before waving off criticism from veterans’ groups, saying, “Maybe they don't speak to the same vets that I speak to.”",0.99999785915989614,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.0024103057862803309, u'mexico': 0.79257544800631929, u'abortion': 0.029326613143461161, u'immigration': 0.0078531817146813721, u'trade': 0.048299163435923671, u'campaign_finance': 0.0034447436772031483, u'other': 0.0010844447428369312, u'china': 0.0052133801788454542, u'military': 0.011090821395716891, u'terrorism': 0.027267805781706501, u'economy': 0.0066459305034308148, u'health': 0.0084608687974176127, u'women': 0.056327292836177031}"
Marco Rubio Swings Through New Hampshire,nyt,"NASHUA, N.H. —  On his first day on the campaign trail as a declared 2016 presidential candidate, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, embraced New Hampshire’s appetite for retail politics on Friday, offering himself up as both teacher and student, eager to learn but comfortable and full of quips.

Greeting students at Manchester Community College, he joked that he felt at home because he teaches a political science class at Florida International University.

“And everyone likes to take it,” he said, “because, since they’re voters, everyone gets an A.”

Mr. Rubio, who had returned to Washington after declaring his candidacy in Miami on Monday, spent Friday performing all the basic rituals this early voting state requires: meeting with potential voters in small groups (at the community college and a house party), knocking on doors (in support of a Republican candidate for the state’s House of Representatives) and headlining a major dinner (at the First in the Nation Republican Leadership Summit, a two-day candidate forum where all of his likely rivals are also appearing).

Speaking at the dinner here Friday evening, Mr. Rubio earned two standing ovations — once at the end of his speech, and again after taking questions — and seemed to enthuse, if not electrify, the crowd as he covered topics ranging from his personal story to a harsh rebuke of President Obama’s foreign policy.

“This is about the future of America and its very identity,” he said, describing the stakes of the 2016 election.

Though it is not part of his stump speech, the issue of the Common Core educational standards — which could pose a challenge for former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, who, unlike many conservatives, supports them — came up at each of Mr. Rubio’s events.

“I’m very cautious about the federal government’s role in establishing curriculum standards,” Mr. Rubio told the college class, answering a question. “The federal government always ends up turning a carrot into a stick, right?”

Later, at the house party, Mr. Rubio responded to another question on the subject with a bolder suggestion: “If I was president of the United States, I would not have a Department of Education, perhaps at all,” he said. “We don’t need a national school board.”

Mr. Rubio also told the gathered crowd of several dozen a tough truth: He doesn’t love New England sports teams.

When a 9-year-old boy, lofted on an adult’s shoulders, shyly asked if Mr. Rubio was a Boston Red Sox fan, he tried at first to be diplomatic: “How ’bout this? I’m not a Yankees fan,” he said, to cheers and some good-natured boos. “I guess I’m a Miami Marlins fan,” he added. “But you have nothing to worry about.”

At the community college Friday morning, Mr. Rubio called for a mixed approach to higher education, with more vocational training and options for students to combine online courses, community college classes and what he called “brick and mortar” credits.

“We have only one way of providing higher education in America, and that is, we tell everybody, ‘You either go to a traditional college or you go nowhere,’ ” he told the gathered students. “That isn’t working.”

Student debt, he told the class, can be crippling. “That’s something I’m very sensitive to, because I actually owed over $100,000 after I finished my education,” he said. “And I never would have paid it off had it not been for a book I wrote.”

“Which,” he added, with a smile, “you can get in paperback.”

When one student, clad in a gray hooded sweatshirt and black sweatpants, prefaced his question by apologizing for how he was dressed, Mr. Rubio, in a suit with a crisp white shirt, parried, “I want to apologize for how I’m dressed.”

To another, a senior in the welding program, Mr. Rubio said that, as a society, “we have to stop stigmatizing” blue-collar jobs.

“At some point, I don’t know when it happened, but we started telling people that if you have to work with your hands, it’s somehow demeaning — but if you wear a suit and tie to work, it’s a great job, even if you’re making a quarter of the amount and borrowed a bunch of money to get that degree,” he said. “I bet you most people don’t realize how much welding can pay.”

Mr. Rubio still has a bit to learn about welding, though. Donning protective plastic glasses, the senator marveled at the equipment as he toured the college’s welding wing.

“That’s going through it like butter,” he said.

“It hasn’t even touched it yet,” said Chris Scales, 32, a student and a Coast Guard veteran, who was demonstrating a machine.

Before he left, Mr. Rubio shook Mr. Scales’s hand, which was nearly entirely black with grease. “I’ll give him credit,” Mr. Scales said. “He shook my dirty hand.”

And in many ways, that was sort of the point: “I want to get dirty,” Mr. Rubio said with a smile, before heading on to the next machine. “But not too dirty.”",0.85709186886780664,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.03375891586175888, u'mexico': 0.010851742604902964, u'abortion': 0.014277848332107481, u'immigration': 0.10674374681431645, u'trade': 0.020103345962843883, u'campaign_finance': 0.059265354288515676, u'other': 0.002707529950242339, u'china': 0.064996757535063024, u'military': 0.013028485846184407, u'terrorism': 0.22748034243179754, u'economy': 0.37172865301832125, u'health': 0.0063572548854876464, u'women': 0.068700022468458549}"
"What Is the Cost of Grace in Charleston? Obama, Bonhoeffer, and America's Soul",huffpo,"History PhD Student, Duke University.
Last week, Obama gave a moving eulogy  at the College of Charleston in Charleston South Carolina for the  Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church's  slain pastor Clementa Pinckney. Commentators have praised the speech for its deft navigation of religion and politics  as Obama himself has linked the tragedy to specific calls for gun regulation.
In his message, Obama became not only President and honorary parishioner, but preacher, placing demands on a still nominally Christian nation to rely on grace in order to live up to its unofficial spiritual creeds. Yes, Obama's speech laid out his spiritual vision for the country's racial conversation, but  how does his conception of grace fit in Christian tradition? What risks and opportunities might this vision present for communities that wish to engage in direct political action?
The word ""grace"" appears a full thirty-five times in Obama's eulogy. Obama gave  specific prescriptions for how to earn ""national"" grace. He argued that removing the Confederate flag, a ""reminder of systemic oppression,"" would ""express God's grace.""  He went further still, affirming that national grace also requires resolving other areas of ""blindness"" such as poor education in minority communities, employment bias, gun violence, police training, and criminal justice reform.
Such a politicized definition of grace may grate on Christians, like Rick Santorum and Jeb Bush, who wish for ""theology and morality"" to be separated from systemic social issues. Nevertheless, the concept of grace as a catalyst for political conscience finds resonance in the witness of one of the Twentieth Century's most compelling martyrs, German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer*. Educated in Tübingen  University, in 1930 he became a lecturer in systematic theology at Berlin University. He also visited the United States, where he especially grew to appreciate the America's Black Church tradition during his time in Harlem.  He returned to Germany in 1939 to become one of the main leaders of the Confessional Church, an organization of religious groups opposed to the regime. He also  joined the famous 1944 plot  to assassinate Adolf Hitler and attempt to find a settlement with the Allies. 

Bonhoeffer wrote in his book, Cost of Discipleship, of ""cheap"" and ""costly"" grace.  ""Cheap grace"" Bonhoeffer wrote, ""is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline, Communion without confession, absolution without personal confession...grace without Jesus Christ, living and incarnate (44-45).""
Costly grace on the other hand was ""the Kingly rule of Christ...the gospel which must be sought again and again, the gift which must be asked for, the door at which a man must knock.""
Like Bonhoeffer's ""costly grace"", Obama's grace implies divine and human intervention in the political and social sphere. Obama started the ""grace"" section of the speech describing the Emmanuel's role in the Underground Railroad and the Civil Rights Movement as a place of ""inviolable dignity"" for African-American activist. He continued on to describe the slaying of Pinckney, a pastor and state legislator, by a racist who was clear in his racist motivations. Obama, to claps and shouts of agreement from the audience, recounted how the killing did not spur the killer's hoped-for racial conflict based on the American ""original sin"" of slavery , but rather, national action and unity:
Oh, but God works in mysterious ways.  (Applause.)  God has different ideas.  (Applause.)  
[The alleged killer] didn't know he was being used by God.  [He] could not see the grace surrounding Reverend Pinckney and that Bible study group -- the light of love that shone as they opened the church doors and invited a stranger to join in their prayer circle... As a nation, out of this terrible tragedy, God has visited grace upon us, for he has allowed us to see where we've been blind.  (Applause.)  He has given us the chance, where we've been lost, to find our best selves.  (Applause.)  We may not have earned it, this grace, with our rancor and complacency, and short-sightedness and fear of each other -- but we got it all the same.  He gave it to us anyway.  He's once more given us grace.  But it is up to us now to make the most of it, to receive it with gratitude, and to prove ourselves worthy of this gift.
While Obama's grace is, like Bonhoeffer's, politically radical, it's also conceptually broad, almost universal. Bonhoeffer's grace was deeply orthodox. He believed that ""costly grace"" could cost a man his physical life  in order to gain Christ. He  ridiculed ""grace as a doctrine, a principle, a system (p.43).""
[Grace] is costly because it condemns sin, and grace because it justifies the sinner. Above all, it is costly because it cost God the life of his Son (p.45).
During the 1930s and 1940s, Bonhoeffer called for a political resistance, the ""other Germany"" (p.27) that would preserve Western civilization against what he saw a the false idol: The racist fascism of National Socialism which had put blood divisions above the dignity of the human person. As Hitler grew more powerful, Bonhoeffer raised the stakes for his spiritual comrades, exhorting ""He who severs himself from the Confessional Church severs himself from the Grace of God (p.31)."" 
Obama's call to action-filled grace undoubtedly echoes Bonhoeffer's,  but the latter's emphasis on martyrdom and orthodoxy also presents potential points of conflict between Obama's administration and Christians of conscience. The sincerest of his opponents may just as easily (many times correctly) invoke the idea of a ""costly"" grace, a political martyrdom of religious conscience, in defense of  exclusively heterosexual marriage, or protecting a fetus. These are issues where Obama is, frankly, at odds with Christian tradition (although not always the majority of Americans).
That caution aside, remembering Bonhoeffer's example, supporters and opponents of Obama must at least recognize that the president was not hijacking or politicizing Christianity (which always had political implications) in his speech from the pulpit. Rather, he was participating in the religion's constant revival by seizing on the universal Church's social message as a legitimate rallying cry against indifference. 
Whatever our differences, Christian Americans should lend our ears, if not to Obama's call to our natures' better angels, at least to God's call for universal self-sacrifice and self-reflection on the whole range of pressing moral issues facing America.

Jeb Bush stumbles into debate night,cnn," (CNN)After stumbling this week, Jeb Bush heads into Thursday's debate facing a key question: Is he ready to run for president in an era when every gaffe can go viral?
Bush's latest challenge came Tuesday when the former Florida governor attempted to slam Planned Parenthood. But he appeared to veer off track when he said, ""I'm not sure we need half a billion dollars for women's health issues,"" referring to the amount of money the federal government pays largely for low-income women's health services. 
Bush later said he ""misspoke,"" but the line gave an easy opening to Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, who immediately pounced to portray him as insensitive to the needs of women.
The fumble followed an uncomfortable moment Monday at a forum in New Hampshire when Bush struggled to answer a question about his family's political legacy -- an issue that has repeatedly tripped him up during his campaign. 
Six things to watch at Thursday's GOP debate
Bush allies argue that these moments amount to blips that will soon be forgotten and say that by staying the course, he's showing an even-handed steadiness that could help him secure the nomination.
Still, the incidents underscore how Bush, the powerhouse politician who was once thought to be the man who could clear the GOP presidential field, is struggling to find his footing in a race that's been upended by Donald Trump's surge in the polls.
Perhaps more importantly, the missteps raise questions about whether Bush is ready to wage the type of disciplined, savvy campaign required in the modern political era to win the White House.
""It speaks to the changes in campaigns since the last time he ran for office. It used to be you make a comment like that; by evening you put out your statement, and the statement ends up in the same story. That whole thing on women's health issues swept around the world before the campaign retracted it,"" said Katie Packer, a former adviser to Mitt Romney who specializes in helping candidates hone their message to Republican and independent women. ""The speed at which things travel is probably new to him. You learn that when you're running, especially in the presidential cycle. All of this serves to make him look a little out of touch."" 
When a candidate stumbles the first time, as Bush did earlier this year when pressed on his brother's invasion of Iraq, Packer said, some voters gauging his electability might have given him a pass -- thinking he simply wasn't prepared for that particular question. ""But if they keep not getting these answers sharp; it starts to look like you're just not sharp"" as a candidate, she said.  
While Packer said Bush won't ever be able to ""totally clean that (Planned Parenthood comment) up, he's going to have to come out very strongly in advocating what his position is on women's health and what the federal government's role is in that."" 

Some of the candidate's close allies are concerned that he has a tendency to come off as dismissive, particularly in group forums where he doesn't like the question. They hope he can keep that sort of demeanor in check, as it generally does not go over well with voters. On the policy front, he has been preparing intensively for weeks -- working to get his complex policy positions boiled down into 30 second and 60 second bites. 
Still, many allies said he's simply playing the long game.
""Presidential politics isn't very different from professional football -- quarterbacks are going to throw interceptions, and sometimes those interceptions might fall at the feet of the quarterback. And Jeb Bush just threw one,"" said Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist who advised George W. Bush and John McCain. ""He has to understand the demographic challenges facing the Republican Party and little things like that make it difficult to win the game.""
""That being said, the proportionality of the reporting on this issue is completely overblown,"" Schmidt added. 
Bush has done all the right things, advisers said, by standing up to his critics on difficult issues such as immigration and the Common Core education standards and paying attention to the arcane but vital elements of a winning campaign -- such as ensuring ballot access. 
Bush and Christie vow to double economic growth
Bush has made countless phone calls to activists and influencers in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada — while simultaneously building his support slowly and steadily with a tireless campaign schedule. And then there's his treasury: the fact that he stockpiled more than $100 million through his campaign and pro-Bush political action committees that will allow him to stay in the race long after other candidates run out of money.
Ultimately, he's embracing his image as the boring candidate and eschewing the theatrics of his fellow Republicans, who have done everything from taking a chainsaw to the tax code to putting their cell phone in a blender to get attention. 
Longtime Bush-watchers such as Susan MacManus, political science professor at the University of South Florida, said the former Florida governor should not be underestimated.
""He is not a 'for-the-moment' person; he is more calculating and always looking long term,"" MacManus said. ""He is trying to be the statesman and anticipating that Trump will wear thin. He's just really trying to stay the course right now, which compared to the others, he's doing pretty well with.""

Voters ""are not really honed in right now and making decisions,"" MacManus said. ""People in Florida,"" for example, ""don't care a whit about politics right now."" 
Because of that, many longtime political observers say there is an advantage for Bush, and other strong candidates such as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.  
Veteran strategist Charlie Black said Bush's position is a comfortable place to be right now because ""the race hasn't really started. It starts with these debates."" 
For all of Bush's discipline and his mastery of the issues, he has yet to show he can channel the seething anger among Republicans like Trump. 
Jeb Bush: 'Bill Clinton is not my step-brother, OK?'
But from Bush's perspective, ""if you look at infrastructure, organization and money -- he's the front-runner. And he's got a lot of appeal as people get to know him,"" which is the opportunity that the debates could offer, Black said. 
""I think he's the best campaigner in the family; he's completely knowledgeable about policy and he can answer questions without hesitation, and personality-wise, he's just a little more engaging and smooth than his brother or his father.
By contrast, Black predicted that the debates will be the arena where Trump begins to fade ""as voters learn more about his positions and lack thereof.""
""My guess is that Trump will play it straight here, abide by the rules, but he'll still be bombastic and not get into details,"" Black said, ""and if he does that for four straight debates, by then, people will figure him out.""
For Bush, the onus Thursday night will be to show voters that he is the calm, steady hand -- the one, as Hillary Clinton might put it, who you wanted answering the phone at 3 a.m. in the middle of a world crisis.
Longtime Democratic strategist Bill Carrick said even with all the anger festering in the Republican Party right now, that group of voters is not quite big enough to ensure victory. The quieter, more statesman-like candidates are ultimately due for a serious look from voters, he said.
""In these multi-candidate debates early on, there is something to be said for staying out of traffic: because, you know, a lot of accidents happen in traffic,"" Carrick said.
The silver lining for more understated candidates such as Bush, Carrick said, is that Trump's presence will ensure a blockbuster audience for this week's debates -- including the independents and moderate Democrats that Bush would like to appeal to in order to ensure his path to the nomination.
While Trump may entertain, Carrick said:  ""There is a point at which people start looking for a president. And Republicans want to win.""

Donald Trump: I'm worth $10 billion,cnn," (CNN)Donald Trump -- to quote the businessman himself -- seems to be a ""very rich"" man.
His campaign announced Tuesday that the Republican presidential candidate's net worth is in excess of $10 billion, and that his income in 2014 was $362 million.
The campaign sent out a release to press Tuesday afternoon, but the financial disclosure does not appear to be posted on the Federal Election Commission website yet.
For Trump, who has never held public office, his financial disclosure would offer the most comprehensive public look yet into his massive wealth.
The amount of cash Trump has on hand will be particularly significant, showing how much money Trump has at his disposal to potentially put towards his own campaign.
His campaign previously released a summary of Trump's finances as of June 2014. It put Trump's net assets at $9.2 billion, and with approximately $500,000 million in liabilities, the businessman's net worth was stated as $8.7 billion.
Trump's White House campaign, now just a month in, has been a costly affair.
His controversial comments that some people illegally crossing into the United States from Mexico are ""rapists"" and ""criminals"" have drawn widespread backlash. Numerous corporations including Macy's and NBC subsequently announced that they were severing business ties with Trump.
Macy's said earlier this month that it is phasing out the Trump-brand menswear line. And with NBC, there's more than one business venture at risk: Trump was the host of the popular reality TV show ""The Apprentice,"" and the network also decided it would no longer broadcast the Miss USA pageant, which Trump partly owns.
Trump's business deals with the city of New York have also come under scrutiny: Mayor Bill de Blasio said he is reviewing the real estate mogul's contracts with the city, including for a recently opened Trump golf course in the Bronx.
But Trump has downplayed whatever financial hit he's taken so far.
""Here's the good news. I'm very rich,"" Trump told CNN's Anderson Cooper earlier this month. ""The money you're talking about is a lot but it's peanuts for me.""  
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's campaign and a pro-Bush super PAC announced raising more than $114 million.

Trump camp says it has fired infamous strategist Roger Stone,fox,"







							mboxCreate('FoxNews-Politics-Autoplay-Videos-In-Articles');
						
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has fired high-profile political adviser Roger Stone, a campaign spokesperson said Saturday.
“Roger wanted to use the campaign for his own personal publicity,” the spokesman told FoxNews.com. “He has had a number of articles about him recently, and Mr. Trump wants to keep the focus of the campaign on how to Make America Great Again.""
To be sure, Stone has attracted his share of publicity as a behind-the-scenes guy, starting soon after he began working on the Committee to Re-elect the President, the successful 1972 fundraising effort for Richard Nixon’s second term.
And Stone's connection to Trump, particularly his rise from TV celebrity and New York real estate tycoon to the top of the 2016 Republican presidential field, has unsurprising become to subject of several recent news stories.
Stone’s departure was first reported early Saturday by The Washington Post. However, Stone said several hours later that he quit the campaign on Friday night, citing in part Trump’s “provocative” battles with the news media, politicians and others.
“Your initial and still underlying message - is a solid conservative message” Stone writes in a letter he has made public. “In fact, it catapulted you instantly into a commanding lead in the race. …  Unfortunately, the current controversies involving personalities and provocative media fights have reached such a high volume that it has distracted attention from your platform and overwhelmed your core message. With this current direction of the candidacy, I no longer can remain involved in your campaign.”

Stone also worked on a Ronald Reagan presidential campaign.
He is considered skilled in opposition research and so-called political “dirty tricks.” He reportedly has a tattoo of Nixon on his back and has written or co-written at least two book including “The Man Who Killed Kennedy: The Case Against LBJ,” published in 2013.
Stone also reportedly was once a lobbyist for Trump.",0.9991854767335473,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.017567060308758965, u'mexico': 0.079719577846894707, u'abortion': 0.0075560427051809109, u'immigration': 0.27818758655891629, u'trade': 0.026933883143785569, u'campaign_finance': 0.044152524828097908, u'other': 0.0022315392416218699, u'china': 0.034955148046919571, u'military': 0.0076952844426988456, u'terrorism': 0.040282372224017877, u'economy': 0.35009042397021023, u'health': 0.0059943980769464212, u'women': 0.10463415860595082}"

The first Republican-sanctioned presidential debate earlier this month offered some telling signs about conservatives’ general attitude toward education reform. In response to the first and only question put to the forum on the issue, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush made clear that education must be about local control and academic expectations that set students up to succeed.
“I’m for higher standards, measured in an intellectually honest way,” Bush said. “I don’t believe the federal government should be involved in the creation of standards, directly or indirectly.” Rubio articulated the same sentiment, adding, “[Reform] should happen at the state and local level. That is where educational policy belongs.”
Those are principles any conservative voter can support. They’re also the foundation of the Common Core State Standards. And while the term “Common Core” may still needle some critics who would like to return to the old model of education -- even though we know it wasn’t working -- the conversation finally seems to be moving past semantics to focus on rigorous, comparable college- and career-ready education standards.
That may be because after two national elections in which opponents avowed the Common Core would be a litmus test for conservatives, voters demonstrated they support higher classroom expectations. Or it may be that the standards are showing early success in states like Kentucky and Tennessee, which have achieved steady, sizeable gains after implementing the tougher standards.
Whatever the case, most leaders are looking past the activists that still use the Common Core as a rallying cry and embracing the need for education standards that adequately prepare our students. This year no state legislatures passed legislation to repeal their Common Core standards, despite nearly 50 bills nationwide aimed at doing so. Instead, three states -- Louisiana, Tennessee and New Jersey -- launched reviews to hone and build on the standards further. And this is exactly what they were designed to do.
Considering the turmoil stirred by opponents less than a year ago, that’s pretty impressive – and a real indication that the framework laid by the Common Core is here to stay, even as states mold it and make it their own. That’s what we did in Arizona when I was governor. We reviewed and tweaked the standards to make sure they met our students’ needs, and we rebranded them to put on Arizona’s stamp ownership.
The next step toward improving student performance will come this fall when states release results from the first year of tests aligned to higher standards. This, too, is an area where Republicans should be able to agree. School accountability has long been a cause championed by conservatives, and these new assessments will better ensure schools are meeting their responsibility of helping students achieve higher levels.
Yet, there will no doubt be opposition, likely from the same naysayers fighting to impede the transition to rigorous education standards. They will argue scores are lower, a sure sign that the tests are too hard or designed to set students up to fail. Not only does that line of reasoning mischaracterize the data, it ignores the purpose of raising expectations in our classrooms and suggests that somehow our kids can’t handle being held to a high level. I fundamentally disagree.
The assessments that were given for the first time in most states this spring represent a necessary step to provide parents and teachers with better information about how well students are really doing. For too long we haven’t had that. An analysis by an education advocacy group earlier this year found most states systematically inflated proficiency rates – more than half to 30 points or more than the true rate identified by the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, which is considered the definitive yardstick.
Achieve, the organization responsible for the report, aptly labeled these discrepancies the “Honesty Gap.” Not only were states telling parents their child was on track to move on to higher level material when, in fact, they might not be, this reality was masking performance issues, giving teachers no way of identifying and addressing them.
New high-quality assessments rolled out by states this spring are tougher. Unlike old bubble tests, they require students demonstrate their understanding of a subject. As a result, fewer students will likely obtain top scores. That doesn’t mean our kids are any less smart, or our teachers any less capable. It simply means we are raising the bar to the level students need to succeed in a competitive environment. As we do so, students – with support from educators – will start to meet and exceed those expectations.
Implementation of higher education standards has been a difficult task, but one that is succeeding thanks to the hard work of educators and policymakers with the courage to stand firm in their conviction. Implementation of meaningful student assessments will be challenging as well. But it is a necessary step to ensure our students are empowered to meet their full potential.

"In South Carolina, Sanders Discusses Race, Courts Black Voters",npr,"
Sen. Bernie Sanders drew big crowds again this weekend, but they may not be the right kind of crowd if he hopes to win South Carolina's primary. The Independent senator from Vermont is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, and he'll need black voters to win in the early-voting state. 

This is an issue that cuts across the board. It impacts every race. And together we are gonna end the shame of having the highest childhood poverty rate of any major country.


Bernie Sanders


More than 3,000 people filled a convention center in North Charleston for the rally, which was postponed after the murders of nine people at a historically black church in June. Referring to the shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Sanders told supporters that racism is still a reality in the United States. ""I am not just talking about the sickness of a man who could walk into a Bible study class in Charleston, pray with people in that room and then take out a gun and kill nine people,"" Sanders said. Sanders said he's also talking about what he describes as ""institutional racism"" in the criminal justice system. The murders at the church known as Mother Emanuel took place not long after the shooting of Walter Scott, a black man who was killed by a white police officer in April in neighboring North Charleston. Officer Michael Slager was charged with murder after a video surfaced of him shooting Scott several times from behind. Sanders held his rally in North Charleston, and recited a litany of names of African-Americans killed in police custody, including Scott. He also sought to connect issues he's long campaigned on — such as raising the minimum wage and addressing child poverty — with racial justice. 

 
It's All Politics 
 Bernie Sanders And The Size And Wisdom Of Crowds






""This is an issue that cuts across the board. It impacts every race,"" he said. ""And together we are gonna end the shame of having the highest childhood poverty rate of any major country."" In the past, African-Americans have made up more than half of Democratic primary voters in South Carolina. Joan Bryan of Charleston is in that majority. She says she's still making up her mind about how to vote, but she agrees with Sanders. ""The young people are overburdened with debt. They can't get an education. So many of our kids aren't even qualified to get jobs in South Carolina. We've got so many young people, African-Americans in prison,"" Bryan said. ""He touched on all the major points that are important to me."" Bryan liked what she was hearing, but the problem for Sanders is that he was making his case to mostly white crowds — even in North Charleston, where African-Americans outnumber whites. Scott Huffmon, a political scientist at Winthrop University, says Sanders will need to step up his outreach to black voters. Huffmon says it was important symbolically for Sanders to come to North Charleston. ""I absolutely think that this was an effort to let African-American voters in South Carolina know that he's not just the choice of liberal whites; he is the choice that he thinks African-American voters in South Carolina would want as well,"" Huffmon said. Sanders has been highlighting racial issues in his speeches, partly in response to criticism from black activists. ""Black Lives Matter"" protesters have disrupted some of his campaign events, in an effort to draw attention to what they describe as racism in the criminal justice system. Sanders also hired a young black woman, Symone Sanders, as his national press secretary. She says she'd like to see more African-Americans at events – but it's still early. ""We'll be back to South Carolina. And I think when we come back we will be seeing bigger and more diverse crowds, definitely,"" she said. For now, Bernie Sanders is meeting with community leaders, pastors and activists in South Carolina. In North Charleston, he met with members of Charleston's Black Lives Matter group. They attended the rally but did not try to shut it down.

Republicans Face Off In First GOP Debate Of 2016 Election,huffpo,"Republicans vying for the White House will take the stage against some of their opponents Thursday night in the first GOP debate of the 2016 race.
The 10 highest-polling candidates of the field will debate at 9 p.m. ET. The other seven candidates for the GOP nomination will take part in a smaller debate at 5 p.m. ET.
The debate, taking place in Cleveland, Ohio, will air on Fox News.

PowerPost: Opinion: Republicans are in Big Trouble,washpo,"The Outrage Machine is a weekly opinion column by voices from the left and right on Washington. Want to write for us? Contact us at powerpost@washpost.com If elections are about the future, then the GOP is in big trouble. The historic Supreme Court decision allowing gay marriage in all 50 states, the aftermath of the Charleston tragedy, and the public’s reaction to a racist rant by a GOP presidential candidate display a country ready to leap forward to a future of fairness where the Constitution protects the equal rights of all citizens.     That future includes the right to marry the person you love regardless of gender, one where government sanctioned symbols of violence and hate give way to constructive conversations about race, and where repulsive racist comments uttered by a buffoon-like GOP contender no longer get a pass from businesses and the public. Sign up for The Daily 202, The Washington Post’s new political tipsheet But the backwards reactions from GOP candidates as these events played out underscore the stark contrast between where the country wants to go and where the Republicans seem to be stuck. Most voters want to know how their public officials will lead the country forward, not how they will take it back in time. If the GOP doesn’t figure out how to navigate current trends, the party’s chances of winning the White House in 2016 are indeed slim. After the Supreme Court decision allowing same-sex marriage in every state, all of the Republican presidential candidates spoke against it. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) urged public officials to ignore the ruling and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee told Americans to resist it. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker called for a Constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman. This is not a winning general election strategy when almost two-thirds of the country supports the court’s decision. After Charleston, we also saw Republicans reluctant to acknowledge the tragic shooting of nine African-Americans at a historic AME church was shown to be motivated by racism. Ex-Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum first said the incident was an attack on religious liberty. He and other GOP candidates refused to support the Confederate flag being removed from public grounds, saying it should be an issue left up to the states. South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham had a speedy evolution from not thinking removal of the flag was necessary, to standing next to South Carolina Gov. Nicki Haley just four days later, calling for the flag to come down.  Sen. Graham, Gov. Haley, and the South Carolina congressional delegation knew defense of the flag was a dangerous position after it was shown the killer was motivated by racism. And they knew they had to act. Read more PowerPost Now, we are in the midst of the exploding controversy over Donald Trump’s repulsive remarks about Mexican immigrants. The businessman and reality TV star declared Mexican immigrants were “rapists” and criminals, and managed to insult a whole country, one of our most important trading partners, and 54 million Latinos who call the United States home.  Instead of apologizing, Trump has doubled down.  Latinos are rightly outraged and are flexing their substantial economic muscle. With buying power of more than $1.5 trillion, rising political power, and 800,000 turning 18 every year, Latinos finally broke through not just politically, but economically. Latin artists, then Univision, NBC Universal, Macy’s, and most recently, NASCAR, the PGA, and renowned Spanish Chef Jose Andres (who was slated to open a flagship restaurant in Trump’s multi-million dollar new hotel development in Washington, D.C.) have all broken ties with the outlandish Trump, understanding that sticking with him would have huge long-term economic costs. Remarkably, it took more than two weeks and growing public pressure for any of the GOP 2016 contenders to say anything. And not one was forceful and unequivocal from the beginning. In fact, asterik candidate George Pataki was the one who woke Republicans from their stupor and got them to finally condemn Trump -– who has surged to second place and higher in some polls of the GOP race.  I am still surprised that Jeb Bush, whose wife is from Mexico and whose kids are Mexican-American, did not seem all that bothered by Trump’s racist rant, tepidly calling it “wrong” when first forced to respond.  Hillary Clinton was the only major candidate who spoke out early and forcefully against those atrocious comments.  The Republican Party is already in a deep hole with Latinos because of its dismal track record on immigration, its hate-filled rhetoric surrounding the immigration debate, and the GOP lawsuit against President Obama’s executive action on immigration — which 89 percent  of Latinos support.  The last two GOP presidential nominees — Arizona Sen. John McCain and Mitt Romney — received 31 percent and 27 percent of the Latino vote, respectively. In order to win, a GOP candidate needs at least 40 percent of Latinos. The Trump episode will exact an unaffordable political cost on Republicans, making it impossible to reach the needed threshold. Republicans’ long-term survival in national elections is in jeopardy because of their actions and reactions of the past few weeks. They help cement an already ingrained and particularly pernicious perception of a party that is intolerant, out–of-touch, unwelcoming and increasingly anti-immigrant, anti-Latino, anti-gay, and resistant to a more inclusive, fair and equal country for all Americans. Without a broader appeal to the country’s changing, diverse communities, there is no viable path for Republicans toward a Casa Blanca win in 2016 and beyond.

ONE EMAIL FROM OBLIVION: HILLARY’S BIG BET ON SECRET SERVER
With the revelation that presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton “wiped clean” any trace of tens of thousands of emails from her time as secretary of state, the 2016 presidential campaign enters a new phase. With a move as audacious as any in the evidence destruction game, Clinton has set her candidacy dangling. Clinton told reporters that the more than 30,000 emails she ordered deleted would have exonerated her, but she destroyed them in the interest of her and her family’s privacy. By her reasoning, there is nothing related to emails with foreign powers who donated money to her family foundation. No directions to staffers about dealing with political controversies. No emails to her political network and friends about government business. Nothing official or of a foreign-policy nature. At all. Just yoga lessons and bridal bouquets. And if that’s the case, she has nothing to worry about.

[Fox News: “Senate Republicans are renewing efforts to learn why Huma Abedin, a top assistant to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, was allowed to keep working at the agency under a special, part-time status while also being employed at a politically-connected consulting firm.]

But if there are things that Clinton wants to keep from congressional investigators, she had better hope that her deletion crew bleached every corner of the digital world. Because if even a pixel of something Clinton should have handed over is unearthed in her domain or in a musty folder in someone else’s email system, Clinton would be a political goner. Her bold move to destroy emails even after being asked for them by the government would leave her in major-league trouble in the middle of her second presidential run. And Clinton has placed herself in the digital shark cage. If there’s anything amiss, she’d better hope that her IT guys are the very best on the business.

[A ‘reset,’ you might even say - NYT: “[Clinton] told a representative of a group of prominent Jewish leaders on Sunday that she wanted to put the relationship between the United States and Israel back on ‘constructive footing,’ the representative said.”]

2016 DEMOCRATIC POWER INDEX: O’MALLEY SHOWS MUSCLE
Presidency ‘not a crown’ - WaPo: Former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley took a swipe at likely 2016 contenders Hillary Rodham Clinton and Jeb Bush on Sunday, saying that ‘the presidency of the United States is not some crown to be passed between two families.’  Appearing on ABC’s ‘This Week,’ O’Malley, who is weighing a possible run against Clinton for the Democratic nomination, called the presidency ‘an awesome and sacred trust to be earned and exercised on behalf of the American people.’ O’Malley — who at times has been reluctant to take on Clinton directly — declined to say whether he thought the former secretary of state would stand up to Wall Street and other special interests. ‘I don’t know where she stands,’ he told host George Stephanopoulos. ‘Will she represent a break with the failed policies of the past? Well, I don’t know.’”

“I think that our country always benefits from new leadership and new perspectives.” –Former Gov. Martin O’Malley, D-Md., on ABC’s “This Week”

On eve of Schiavo anniversary, Jeb takes light touch on defining moment - WSJ: “Casting himself as the “most conservative governor in Florida’s history,” Jeb Bush ticks off a record in office that includes tax cuts, vetoes on spending, private-school vouchers and fewer state employees. But the likely 2016 presidential candidate rarely, if ever, trumpets one of his most enduring conservative credentials: his yearslong effort to save Terri Schiavo, a severely brain-damaged woman whose husband wanted to remove life support despite her parents’ objections. Mr. Bush isn’t planning to attend a charity fundraiser, hosted by her family, on Tuesday marking the 10th anniversary of Ms. Schiavo’s death.”

[Bush begins his West Coast swing today with a $25,000-per-couple reception and discussion at The Pacific Club.]

Meet Tonette Walker - The Hill: “A Scott Walker presidential campaign may end up being one of the easier things Tonette Walker has had to endure. The Wisconsin first lady has experienced poverty, becoming a young widow and losing other close family members, the lonely period of cynicism and despair that followed, a whirlwind romance to the much younger future governor, and death threats from a nasty labor fight. Those that know the Walker family describe Tonette as ‘tournament-tested’ and ‘unflappable,’ and say the political and personal travails she has faced will leave her well-equipped to deal with the rigors of national campaign and the next-level close-up she’ll get. ‘She’s been through a lot,’ said Wisconsin GOP lobbyist Brandon Scholz. ‘His campaigns have never been easy, and they’ve been through campaign after campaign after campaign. She’s ready.’ Walker allies say Tonette is more than just a figurehead, she’s a member of her husband’s inner political circle…”

Cruz lifts off, but limits emerge - Bloomberg: “Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush continues to lead the pack of Republican presidential hopefuls, but one candidate is making moves. Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the only GOP hopeful to formally announced his candidacy thus far, has shot up in the rankings in a new CBS News poll. Thirty-seven percent of those surveyed said that they would consider voting for Cruz in March, up 14 points from when the same question was asked a month ago. By comparison, 51 percent said they would vote for Bush, just two percent higher than did in February. Still, while Cruz is enjoyed a one-month bump, the conservative Texan continues show serious weakness among Republican voters. Twenty-two percent of those surveyed said they could not vote for Cruz, one point higher than in February's poll. Twenty-seven percent of those polled said they would not vote for Bush in March, while 26 percent said the same in February.” 

“In the presidential race in 2016, there may be other candidates who choose to throw rocks my direction.  I’m not going to engage in the personal mudslinging, in the negative attacks on people's character.” –Presidential Candidate Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on CNN’s “State of the Union”

Save the date: Rubio ready for Miami kick off - Miami Herald: Marco Rubio has reserved the Freedom Tower in downtown Miami for an undisclosed event April 13, which appears to be a potential, if not likely, spot for Florida’s junior senator to announce his candidacy for president. A Rubio adviser stressed nothing has been nailed down for any kind of announcement, but the timing makes sense: Likely presidential candidate Rand Paul is expected to make things official April 7, followed by a five-day, five-state announcement tour, so Rubio presumably would not want to share the spotlight during that period.”

[Watch Fox: Rubio will appear today on “The Five” in the 5 p.m. ET hour.]

Can Rand lead a GOP youth surge? - National Journal: “When Sen. Rand Paul makes his first visit to Iowa as an official presidential candidate next month, he will head to the campus of the University of Iowa. The location, one of the state's biggest liberal strongholds, seems unusual for a Republican, but Paul is headed there in the hopes of appealing to a different constituency. As Paul prepares to formally enter the 2016 arena, younger conservatives are emerging as a backbone of his campaign strategy: a source not only of volunteers and energy but votes. A youth-fueled campaign, his team hopes, will also help brand him as a fresh face for the future of the Republican Party. From campaigning at universities (by the end of his coming trip, Paul will have hit both of the Iowa's biggest college towns already in 2015) to using Snapchat and doing interviews with MTV, Paul is focusing more on the next generation of Republicans than any of his GOP rivals.”

Fiorina: Chances of a run ‘higher than 90 percent’ - Reuters: “Former Hewlett-Packard Chief Executive Carly Fiorina said on Sunday the chances she would run for the U.S. presidency in 2016 were ‘higher than 90 percent’ and that she would announce her plans in late April to early May. Fiorina, speaking on ‘Fox News Sunday,’ said she could not yet announce the bid because she was working to establish her team and put together what she described as ‘the right support’ and financial resources.”

“Hillary Clinton lacks a track record of accomplishment. She is not candid, which suggests her character is flawed. And I think now in e-mail gate, we not only have a situation where she is clearly not being candid. I mean, her saying all those e-mails she erased were just her and Bill chatting is a little bit like Richard Nixon saying those erased moments on the tape were he and Pat talking.” –Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina on “Fox News Sunday” Watch here.

At a time when the United State Secret Service hasn’t been receiving much in the way good press, today provides a reminder of the conspicuous success of the agency charged with protecting the president. On this day in 1981, President Ronald Reagan, Press Secretary Jim Brady, a Secret Service agent and a D.C. police officer were shot by lone gunman John Hinckley Jr. at a Washington curbside, all would survive. The 34-year stretch is a distinct departure from the norm for most of the 20th century, when attempted shootings were relatively commonplace. You can read the pulse-pounding account from the agent who saved Reagan.

PENCE STANDS TALL ON NEW LAW
Indiana Gov. Mike Pence says legislation he signed last week is about “empowering people to confront government overreach” and “not about discrimination” as detractors claim. Recent furor in the mainstream media over the Religious Freedom Restoration Act may seem to hold peril for Pence, a potential 2016 contender, but in political terms standing up for individual rights against government intrusion is not a bad place for the Republican to be. “We’re not going to change the law,” Pence told ABC News, though he said he would look at a bill to clarify the law’s intent. The measure prohibits Indiana laws that “substantially burden” a person’s ability to follow his or her religious beliefs.

[Fox News: “The definition of ‘person’ includes religious institutions, businesses and associations, which is being interpreted as allowing a cake maker, for example, to legally refuse an order for a wedding cake for a gay couple.”]

What’s really in a RFRA? - The Federalist’s Gabriel Malor observes: “This law, known as a Religious Freedom Restoration Act or RFRA (pronounced ‘riff-ra’), tracks the language of the 1993 federal RFRA signed into law by President Clinton after a 97-3 vote in the Senate. But you would not necessarily know how innocuous it is from news media coverage. According to what you might hear in the news, this is an anti-gay law that is ‘almost universally loathed,’ and which a White House official suggested would ‘legitimize discrimination.’ Indiana’s RFRA has none of these characteristics.”

“There’s a lot of people across this country who, you're looking at ObamaCare and the Hobby Lobby decision, looking at other cases, who feel that their religious liberty is being infringed upon and, and The Religious Freedom Restoration Act at the federal level and all the states now, including Indiana, who have it, are simply about addressing that.

POWER PLAY: BLACKBURN FIGHTS NEW INTERNET REGS
Hello, Internet! So who is in charge of you? The Obama administration is pushing through a plan to regulate the Internet like it does telephones, with rules for fees, requirements for carriers and new fees. Could that also mean the government would have control over the content? Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn has taken up the charge to fight the move. The Tennessee Republican joins Chris Stirewalt to discuss what’s at stake for the consumer and the legislative steps she’s taking to stop the FCC. WATCH HERE.

DON’T YOU WISH OUR CAMPAIGNS WERE 38 DAYS LONG?
Sky News: “David Cameron said in five years he had put Britain ‘back on her feet again’ as he formally fired the starting gun on the election race after a meeting with the Queen. Speaking on the steps of Number 10 after returning from Buckingham Palace where he asked the Queen to dissolve Parliament, Mr Cameron said voters face a ""stark choice"" between him and Ed Miliband. With 38 days to go until the election, the Conservatives would offer strong leadership and a country that was safe and secure but Mr Miliband would offer a country mired in ‘economic chaos’”

‘I JUST DECIDED IT WOULD LOOK BETTER WITHOUT THE WEENIE’
AP: “The small southern Utah town of Hurricane might become a little quieter after a statue of a copper bull lost its most prominent private feature this weekend. The sculpture holds a high perch above the sign for Barista's restaurant, and owner Stephen Ward said he woke up Friday and decided the bull would look better without the oversized genitalia that caused uproar among the neighbors. Hurricane residents disturbed by the noticeable, cone-shaped feature had asked the city council to revoke Barista's business license. … ‘I told them I am not removing the penis for you or because of your complaints. I don't like you. I'm doing it for me,’ Ward said. ‘I just decided it would look better without the weenie. And oh my God! It's beautiful.’”

Trump: 'The questions to me were not nice',politico,"On Media
By DYLAN BYERS
8/7/15 12:45 AM EDT
CLEVELAND — Donald Trump says he didn’t get a fair shake.
Speaking in the spin room behind the debate stage, Trump said the questions he received from the moderators Thursday night “were far tougher” than those asked of the other candidates.
“The questions to me were not nice,” Trump said. “I didn’t think they were appropriate.”
Trump especially took issue with Megyn Kelly, the Fox News host who began her first question to Trump by listing the derogatory remarks he’s made about women he doesn’t like.
“I think Megyn behaved very nasty to me,” he said.
Asked if he was going to call Roger Ailes, the Fox News chairman and CEO, to complain about it, he said, “No.”
Trump weathered the incident by making light of the matter while arguing that the United States suffers from “being politically correct.” But his treatment by Kelly and her co-moderators was clearly an issue for him.
“All I know is everybody came up to me and said, ‘You had the toughest questions,’” he said.
Despite his complaints, Trump said he enjoyed the debate.
“I had a really great time,” he said. “I thought it was a fantastic debate.”

Yeah right! Sarcasm poses problem for computer algorithms in U.S. election,reuters,"SAN FRANCISCO When the U.S. Supreme Court upheld same-sex weddings in the same week that South Carolina debated keeping a controversial Civil War battle flag, Twitter user @xTomatoez posted “Gay marriage and the Confederate flag going down everywhere. Tough week for your redneck uncle on Facebook.” 
The poster had no idea his tweet was one of many scrutinized by an analytics firm, whose algorithm took his mocking message seriously and decided it was negative toward gay marriage. 
In the race for the White House in 2016, election campaigns rely on such research to help them tailor advertising and other outreach to particular groups of voters. A candidate's ability to micro-target likely voters with ads on issues they care about is crucial in a modern American political campaign.
Understanding how voters talk about issues on Facebook and Twitter is key to this effort. But increasingly, data gatherers find themselves tripped up by basic social media conventions like sarcasm and mockery. (Graphic: reut.rs/1Dh9fgF)
“They are by far the biggest stumbling blocks to trying to understand true sentiment in social media,” said Michael Meyers, managing partner of TargetPoint Consulting in Alexandria, Virginia. His firm, like many, is trying to tweak algorithms in-house now before the campaign season kicks into high gear.  
Consider phrases like “sure it is,” “boo-hoo,” or “I’m shocked.” Given the proper context, most people can accurately size up their sincerity. But not a computer algorithm.
The campaign season is too young for there to be any reliable data yet on the value of analyzing tweets and Facebook posts. Still, data firms say the analyses will be one important resource, along with polling and voter records, to help campaigns spend money more efficiently.
A voter whose online posts indicate unwavering and exclusive support for Republican White House contender Jeb Bush, for example, shouldn't get online advertising for his rival Marco Rubio. 

""STAY CLASSY""
Using an inaccurate data point generated by sarcasm hurts models and eats up data scientists’ time as they try to figure out where they went wrong and build fixes.
Sometimes, the fault lies in certain word combinations as HaystaqDNA chief executive Ken Strasma, who built software models to target voters for both Barack Obama's presidential campaigns, recently found out.  
Haystaq, a predictive analysis firm, examined Tweets containing the expression “classy” and found 72 percent of them used it in a positive way. But when used near the name of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, around three quarters of tweets citing ""classy"" were negative.
Haystaq carried out the Trump exercise to teach its computers how a word could transform to its opposite meaning when used with a particular additional word. 
As part of its fine-tuning process, the firm also checked for the combination ""Trump"" and ""stay classy,"" an iconic phrase from the 2004 hit movie Anchorman that almost always aims to mock. Every one of those tweets was negative, showing the added firepower of certain expressions. Haystaq has adjusted its algorithms to compensate.
At Two.42.solutions, chief technology officer Mohammad Hamid had to teach his computers that when the normally neutral term “hair” is mentioned in a tweet about the well-coiffed Trump, that’s usually sarcastic. 
He pointed to a June tweet from filmmaker Albert Brooks: “Donald Trump announces this morning that he will run for president. His hair will announce on Friday.”

FLIPPANT TWITTER
Another word pairing that Hamid said often indicates sarcasm in an otherwise neutral or positive tweet: “Hillary,” meaning Democratic contender Hillary Clinton, and “Benghazi,” the Libyan city where a U.S. diplomatic mission was attacked in 2012 while she was secretary of state.
In April, for example, one tweeter posted that he had received an email saying Clinton was running for president. ""Now the email is gone and I can't find it. #Benghazi,"" he tweeted, in an apparent nod to the strongly held belief by some conservatives that Clinton orchestrated a cover-up over the Benghazi attack and withheld information that should have been made public, a claim she and others have dismissed as a conspiracy theory.Sarcasm clues can also come from the identity of the tweeter, Hamid said. For example, a seemingly pro-Republican tweet or Facebook post coming from someone who follows mostly Democrats would trigger an alert that the evaluation of the tweet might not be accurate. 
Almost all analysts caution against putting too much stock in social media, particularly Twitter given that only one fifth of U.S. adults use it, according to the Pew Research Center. But those that do tend to strike a sarcastic tone. 
“There’s something about that 140 characters (limit) that encourages people to be more flippant,” Meyers of TargetPoint said.  
In the case of the tweet from @xTomatoez, human backstops at Two.42 caught the misclassification of a message that made fun of traditional values more than it decried gay marriage. 
The algorithm marked the tweet for review by human eyes because it contained what researchers call a double negative, or two negative words in one tweet, an automatic red flag indicating possible accuracy challenges. In this case, the telltale words were “tough” and “redneck,” said researcher Abby Vandenbosch.
“Why would anyone want to analyze my tweets?” asked the poster, also known as Eddie Adlman, when a reporter contacted him. When told he was too mocking for classification by machine, he responded with a complicated emoticon for “shrug.”
Enough to confuse many humans, and perhaps an algorithm or two as well.

   Like many Democrats, including the current president, Hillary Clinton has had difficulty maintaining a consistent position on international trade.   As President Obama seeks fast-track authority for a 12-country Pacific trade deal and Congress inches toward giving it to him, Clinton is hedging on a deal she once strongly backed.   ""She will be watching closely to see what is being done to crack down on currency manipulation, improve labor rights, protect the environment and health, promote transparency and open new opportunities for our small businesses to export overseas,"" an aide said in a statement Friday. Additionally, any trade deal would need to pass two tests for Clinton to support it, the campaign said â (1) Protect U.S. workers and raise wages and (2) strengthen national security.   Yet, previously as Secretary of State, Clinton called the Trans-Pacific Partnership the ""gold standard in trade agreements."" In her second memoir, Hard Choices, released in 2014, Clinton lauded the deal, saying it ""would link markets throughout Asia and the Americas, lowering trade barriers while raising standards on labor, the environment, and intellectual property."" She even said it was ""important for American workers, who would benefit from competing on a more level playing field."" She also called it ""a strategic initiative that would strengthen the position of the United States in Asia.""   That kind of apparent contradiction is especially glaring during the rollout of her second presidential campaign when she has been trying to pacify the liberal base with talk of constitutional amendments to get undisclosed money out of politics and a launch video that noted how ""the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top.""   It also highlights Clinton's complicated history with trade. Her husband brokered and passed the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, in 1993. The move irked labor unions, which are key to organizational efforts in Democratic campaigns. As first lady, in 1996, Clinton trumpeted NAFTA as ""proving its worth.""   She went to Davos, Switzerland, two years later, where she spoke at the World Economic Forum, and thanked businesses for lobbying for it. She also criticized them for not making a stronger push to give her husband fast-track authority to negotiate trade deals and limit congressional power to alter those deals. That's something being debated once again, as President Obama seeks a similar authority when it comes to TPP.   As Clinton campaigned for a U.S. Senate seat in New York, where Upstate manufacturing jobs had been lost, she backed away from strong support for NAFTA. She called it ""flawed,"" adding that it needed to be fixed and noting, ""[W]e didn't get everything we should have got out of it.""   As a senator, she voted in favor of free-trade agreements with Singapore, Chile, Australia, Morocco and Oman. She also voiced support for deals with Jordan and Peru. But she also voted against the Central American Free Trade Agreement, or CAFTA.

   When running for president in 2007 and 2008, she spoke strongly against potential agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea. Her positions on Colombia and South Korea changed, however, when she became secretary of state under President Obama, who ironically ran to Clinton's left in 2008 on trade.   In 2007, for example, Clinton called the South Korea deal ""inherently unfair."" Yet, four years later in Seoul, South Korea, as secretary of state, she said getting a South Korea deal done was a ""priority for me, for President Obama and for the entire administration. We are determined to get it done, and I believe we will.""   In April 2008, before the Pennsylvania primary, where she was trying to woo white-working class men, she said of a Colombia deal that she ""will do everything I can to urge the Congress to reject the Colombia Free Trade Agreement.""   But again, as secretary of state, she changed her tune.   ""We think it's strongly in the interests of both Colombia and the United States,"" Clinton said two years later. ""And I return very invigorated ... to begin a very intensive effort to try to obtain the votes to get the Free Trade Agreement finally ratified.""   Here is a timeline of Clinton, in her own words, votes and events related to trade:   1993: NAFTA passes, takes effect Jan. 1, 1994.   1996: ""I think everybody is in favor of free and fair trade. I think NAFTA is proving its worth."" (3/6/96, Clinton in New York at the Nicole Miller company at an event for the UNITE union.)   1998 (in Davos at the World Economic Forum):      SCHWAB: ""In the same context, the fast-track trade legislation is very much at the top of the priorities of your husbands administration. What can you say also to the business community here to give the active and effective support for this legislative measure?""   CLINTON: ""Well, I would probably just echo what I already said, at the risk of being repetitive. There was a very effective business effort in the United States on behalf of NAFTA. There was a very limited and ineffective effort on behalf of fast track. I don't know all the reasons for that. Some of them suggested, but I have no basis for any first-hand knowledge or any analysis that I find convincing. The bottom line is, however, that no one in Congress felt any particular pressure, or demand, by any business interest about giving the President the authority that other presidents have had to negotiate trade agreements.   Now again, I have to conclude that either American business doesn't care about opening markets around the world â but I find that very hard to believe â or they feel that their involvement in politics is something that they wish to minimize or steer clear of and don't want to become participants in any effort to pass such legislation, or some other reason that I have yet to understand. But the effect was the same. For whatever reason, the fact that the American business community made a very limited effort on behalf of the fast track, left the field completely clear to the rather unusual alliance between the right of the Republican party, which is isolationist, anti-American engagement, quite critical and not supportive of the United Nations, IMF or any multilateral group, and the left of the Democratic party that believes that trade authority, and trade agreements are not in the interests of American workers. So that alliance carried the day. Now when the President comes back to the Congress with a request for fast track authority I hope that American business voices will be heard.""   ""Having said that, I would add that there does need to be sensitivity to worker and environmental concerns in trade agreements going forward in the future. Certainly if they are going to be agreements that are negotiated with the United States government and require the consent of the United States Congress. So I think that there may be some good reason for business to engage early with labor and with political leadership in Congress and the Administration to try to hammer out a consensus about the kind of fast track authority and the sort of agreements that we want our President to be negotiating. But certainly that will not happen in the absence of some very stated and obvious business concern."" (2/2/98, World Economic Forum remarks, Davos, Switzerland)      2000: ""What happened to NAFTA I think was we inherited an agreement that we didn't get everything we should have got out of it in my opinion. I think the NAFTA agreement was flawed. The problem is we have to go back and figure out how we are going to fix that."" (3/26/00, Before Working Families Party, per Clinton 2008 campaign.)   2003:""Creating a free trade zone in North America â the largest free trade zone in the world â would expand U.S. exports, create jobs and ensure that our economy was reaping the benefits, not the burdens, of globalization. Although unpopular with labor unions, expanding trade opportunities was an important administration goal."" (Living History by Hillary Clinton. Clinton was arguing that the Clinton administration could do both health care and NAFTA at once, but Bill Clinton and his advisers did not think so.)   ""Senator Dole was genuinely interested in health care reform but wanted to run for president in 1996. He couldn't hand incumbent Bill Clinton any more legislative victories, particularly after Bill's successes on the budget, the Brady bill and NAFTA."" (Living History by Hillary Clinton)   Voted in favor of Singapore and Chilean free-trade agreement. (7/31/2003)   2004:""I think on balance NAFTA has been good for New York and America, but I also think that there are a number of areas where we're not dealt with in an upfront way in dealing with our friend to the north, Canada, which seems to be able to come up with a number of rationales for keeping New York agricultural products out of Canada."" (1/5/2004 teleconference.)   Voted in favor of Australian free-trade agreement. (7/15/2004)   ""I look at each agreement in its totality and measure the impact of each agreement on the New Yorkers that I am privileged to represent."" (Clinton said of her vote for the agreement.)   Voted in favor of Morocco free-trade agreement. (7/21/2004)   2005:Voted against CAFTA. (7/1/2005)   2006:Voted in favor of Oman free-trade agreement. (6/29/2006)   2007:""NAFTA was inherited by the Clinton Administration. I believe in the general principles it represented, but what we have learned is that we have to drive a tougher bargain. Our market is the market that everybody wants to be in. We should quit giving it away so willy-nilly. I believe we need tougher enforcement of the trade agreements we already have. You look at the trade enforcement record between the Clinton Administration and the Bush Administration, the Clinton Administration brought more trade enforcement actions in one year than the Bush Administration brought in six years. For me, trade is who we are. We're traders. We want to be involved in the global economy, but not be played for suckers."" (Time interview, 2/1/07)   ""While I value the strong relationship the United States enjoys with South Korea, I believe that this agreement is inherently unfair. It will hurt the U.S. auto industry, increase our trade deficit, cost us good middle-class jobs and make America less competitive."" (Clinton before AFL-CIO confederation, 6/9/07)   ""I support the trade agreement with Peru. It has very strong labor and environmental protections. This agreement makes meaningful progress on advancing workers' rights, and also levels the playing field for American workers. Most Peruvian goods already enter the U.S. duty free, but our exports to Peru have been subject to tariffs. However, I will oppose the pending trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama. The South Korean agreement does not create a level playing field for American carmakers. I am very concerned about the history of violence against trade unionists in Colombia. And as long as the head of Panama's National Assembly is a fugitive from justice in America, I cannot support that agreement. Accordingly, I will oppose the trade agreements with these countries."" (Clinton campaign statement, 11/8/2007) (Though she voiced support for the Peru deal, she did not vote on it. There was a Democratic primary debate the day it was voted on.)   ""Look, NAFTA did not do what many had hoped, and so we do need to take a look at it and we do need to figure out how we're going to have trade relations that are smart, that give the American worker and the American consumer rights around the world. ... NAFTA was a mistake to the extent that it did not deliver on what we had hoped it would, and that's why I call for a trade timeout when I am president. I'm going to evaluate every trade agreement. ... we need the International Labor Organization and other mechanisms that will be there to enforce labor rights and environmental rights, and that's what I intend to do as president."" (11/15/2007 CNN debate)   2008:""NAFTA was negotiated more than 14 years ago, and Hillary believes it has not lived up to its promises."" (Clinton campaign web site)   Clinton also called for a ""new trade 'prosecutor'"": ""She will appoint a trade enforcement officer and double the enforcement staff at USTR. The current staff is too small to monitor and enforce the increasingly complex trade agreements."" (Clinton campaign web site)   ""You know, I have been a critic of NAFTA from the very beginning. I didn't have a public position on it, because I was part of the administration, but when I started running for the Senate, I have been a critic. I've said it was flawed. ... you don't have all the record because you can go back and look at what I've said consistently. And I haven't just said things; I have actually voted to toughen trade agreements, to try to put more teeth into our enforcement mechanisms. And I will continue to do so. ... I'm confident that as president, when I say we will opt out unless we renegotiate, we will be able to renegotiate."" (2/26/2008 NBC debate)   ""As I have said for months, I oppose the deal. I have spoken out against the deal, I will vote against the deal, and I will do everything I can to urge the Congress to reject the Colombia Free Trade Agreement."" (4/8/08, before the Communications Workers of America. Her husband was in favor of it, her campaign had to distance her from his position, and her senior strategist Mark Penn was demoted because of ties to Colombia through his communications firm.)   2010:""First, let me underscore President Obama's and my commitment to the Free Trade Agreement. We are going to continue to work to obtain the votes in the Congress to be able to pass it. We think it's strongly in the interests of both Colombia and the United States. And I return very invigorated ... to begin a very intensive effort to try to obtain the votes to get the Free Trade Agreement finally ratified."" (6/11/10, RCN Television. She also flew her husband in for dinner in Bogota with key players. He's always been in favor; his foundation has taken money from people with business interests there, as previously reported and written about in the a forthcoming book by Peter Schweizer.)   2011:""Getting this done together sends a powerful message that America and Korea are partners for the long-term and that America is fully embracing its role as a Pacific power. ... I want to state as strongly as I can how committed the Obama Administration is to passing the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement this year. ... This is a priority for me, for President Obama and for the entire administration. We are determined to get it done, and I believe we will."" (4/16/11, Clinton in Seoul, South Korea, to business group)   2012:""We need to keep upping our game both bilaterally and with partners across the region through agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP. ... This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment."" (11/15/12, Clinton in Australia)   2014:""One of our most important tools for engaging with Vietnam was a proposed new trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which would link markets throughout Asia and the Americas, lowering trade barriers while raising standards on labor, the environment, and intellectual property. ... It was also important for American workers, who would benefit from competing on a more level playing field. And it was a strategic initiative that would strengthen the position of the United States in Asia."" (Hard Choices by Hillary Clinton)   2015:""Hillary Clinton believes that any new trade measure has to pass two tests. First, it should put us in a position to protect American workers, raise wages and create more good jobs at home. Second, it must also strengthen our national security. We should be willing to walk away from any outcome that falls short of these tests. The goal is greater prosperity and security for American families, not trade for trade's sake.""

"Tea Party affiliate FreedomWorks refocuses, changes to stay relevant in 2016",fox,"

					FreedomWorks, often considered the ideological brains behind the 2010 Tea Party wave, is trying to reinvent itself for the 2016 elections and beyond, even borrowing from the progressive playbook.   
Chief Executive Officer Adam Brandon said Friday the group is refocusing its strategy -- from expanding its digital outreach and getting more involved in such torch-bearing issues as civil asset forfeitures and mandatory-sentencing reform to providing more financial support for conservative Capitol Hill lawmakers so they can keep challenging the Washington establishment. 
“As the battle moves, we need to be able to participate in different ways,” Brandon said recently from the group’s Washington headquarters. 
He and others say the Republican Party’s most conservative wing, particularly in the House, is under increasing pressure to go along with leadership or risk losing re-election money. 
“I want to make it easy for you to win but not have to worry about K Street backing,” Brandon said. 
Tea Party-backed Rep. Thomas Massie, elected in 2012, suspects he’s in that category.
 
The Kentucky Republican had little problem raising enough money from business interests and others to win reelection last year, reporting $46,000 from tobacco, trucking, health care and other industries in just the first quarter of 2013. 
He since voted against returning Ohio Rep. John Boehner as House speaker and he broke with GOP leaders when they avoided a standoff with President Obama over immigration reform. 
Now, in the first quarter of 2015, Massie has collected just $1,000 from political action committees, or PACs, which funnel contributions to candidates from business, labor or ideological interests. 
He and other conservative caucus members bluntly say the reason business contributions have fallen is that GOP leaders are retaliating. 
""Those who don't go along to get along aren't going to get as many PAC checks,"" said Massie, making an allegation that Republican leadership flatly denies. 
FreedomWorks was found in 2004 with the assistance of former GOP House Majority Leader Dick Armey as a conservative advocacy group that helped in campaigns and trained and mobilized volunteers. 
However, the group didn’t come into real prominence until it helped organize the 2009 Tax Day protest and other Tea Party-type rallies that led to Republicans taking over the House in the 2010 midterms. 
The other significant strategy change for Freedom Works is recent months is the group’s efforts to get “early money” to candidates -- much like Emily’s List has done with pro-choice female Democrats to encourage top talent to run and to attract more donors. 
“If you jump, they’ll be plenty of water in the pool for you,” Brandon said of the strategy. 
He and others thinks Emily’s List is now among the most influence PACs in politics.    
This is not first time that FreedomWorks has announced a shift in direction since helping lead the anti-tax revolts and backing enough candidates touting that message to the help Republicans in the 2010 wave election. 
As the victories piled up on election night, Brandon vowed to Slate.com that his group would now start holding newly-elected candidates to their less-government, less-taxes promises. 
The entire Tea Party movement, in fact, has been under pressure to change over the years, amid arguments that related groups have repeatedly backed candidates incapable of winning general elections -- particularly in 2012 when GOP Senate candidates Todd Aiken, Missouri, and Richard Mourdock, Indiana, made controversial remarks about rape that cost them their races and hurt the Republican Party’s bid to take control of the Senate. 
Brandon says FreedomWorks is pleased with the 2014 election results -- helping such Tea Party-endorsed candidates as Republican Ben Sasse win a Senate seat in Nebraska and creating competitive House races in such places as Washington state, where Republican and ex-NFL star Clint Didier lost by just 2,000 votes. 
Still, a Tea Party-backed candidate lost in essentially every 2014 Senate primary in which a Democrat could have won the general election, including those in Georgia, Kentucky and North Carolina, and failed to unseat 77-year-old Mississippi Sen. Thad Cochran, consider among the most vulnerable of 2014 incumbents. 
FreedomWorks has had to form a “hard dollar” PAC, to raise the so-called early money. 
Brandon said having to form nonprofits, PACs and Super PAC has been a time-consuming legal challenge, but with the new FreedomWorks PAC his group now has all of the tools while maintaining its core values. 
“If you’re running (again) for dog catcher, our question is still ‘Did you cut the budget and catch more dogs,’ ” he said. 
Joe Desilets, managing partner at the D.C.-based political consulting firm 21st & Main, says an ongoing concern is the proliferation of PACs being started by “any former candidate, campaign staffer, activist or consultant with access to an email or donor list” because they are overwhelming donors and their email in-boxes 
“The enthusiasm and desire to get involved and have an impact on behalf of conservative candidates is great,” he said. “But it hurts the established and effective conservative organizations that all of these new groups want to emulate.” 
Desilets also said groups that want to be effective in 2016 indeed must craft a more robust digital strategy that includes online ad buys and mobile campaigns, considering roughly 75 percent of Americans now use smartphones, with the percentage even higher among such key demographics as millennials, Hispanics and single women. 
Brandon says FreedomWorks is focusing on just two or three 2016 Senate races and 10 to 15 House races. 
The group has been eyeing Arizona GOP Rep. Matt Salmon to challenge incumbent Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain and Florida GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis for the Senate seat being vacated by 2016 Republican presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio. 
DeSantis earlier this month officially announced his Senate candidacy, and Salmon has yet to say anything about a potential Senate bid.

A GOP Approach to Tackling Climate Change,politico,"AP Photo.

I’m a Republican, and I want to champion Republican answers to a challenge we aren’t yet known for embracing.

But first, as a happy — if worried — conservative and a lifelong entrepreneur, I’m ready for the Obama administration to pack its bags. I believe in school choice, tort reform, balanced budgets and small government. I believe we need a health care policy that doesn’t cost businesses like mine millions of dollars. I support a free enterprise system unshackled from bad regulation and big labor unions — which were the right thing for American workers in 1890.
For all those reasons and more, I’m a committed GOP donor, having contributed to campaigns and super PACs supporting Mitch McConnell, Jeb Bush and Rob Portman, to name a few. But I also believe that my party needs a fresh approach on one of the most important issues of our age.
Energy policy should be a powerful tool in the coming Republican resurgence, but for too long we’ve ceded the issue to the Democrats. It’s time to develop a conservative national energy agenda that grows the economy, reduces our dependence on foreign oil, protects jobs over lizards and reduces greenhouse gas emissions that are warming our planet.
In my conversations with fellow Republican donors and friends, it’s this last point — reducing emissions — that often produces puzzled looks and awkward silences. Our party’s dialogue about the issue has generated a lot of heat but not much light. I think this is largely due to a few things. First, the left has put forward Big Government, command-and-control climate solutions that scare any true conservative. Second, many liberals have been in denial about the progress the U.S. has already made: Thanks to energy efficiency gains and the shale gas revolution, our country’s greenhouse gas emissions are lower than they were in 1995. This should be something we celebrate.
However, the latest government data show that our national carbon emissions are once again on the rise. And I, along with many Republicans — at least 61 percent in a recent survey — believe that without a significant reduction in those emissions, global warming will soon be a very serious problem for our planet. This view is especially high among millennials and Hispanic-Americans, groups where our Republican presidential candidate will need to make inroads to win in 2016. Even major oil companies like ExxonMobil, Chevron and Shell, which would likely take a financial hit if consumers cut their carbon emissions, are on board with the scientific concurrence on emissions and warming.
I want to capitalize on this momentum, so I’ve committed $175 million of my personal funds through a new charitable foundation and a separate political action fund. The foundation will engage in targeted advocacy at both the state and national levels, make the public case through cutting-edge media platforms and give grants for innovative, conservative policy work. The political action fund will champion Republican candidates and legislation that support market-based solutions for clean energy and climate issues.
If you’d told me 15 years ago that this would be my cause, I would have laughed. I grew up the son of a real estate developer who loved the outdoors but disliked “crazy environmentalists,” and I followed suit. But over time — after poring over the research and talking to scores of scientists like the climate experts at MIT and NASA, all of whom now believe we need urgent action — I concluded that this is one of the biggest risks and opportunities of our lifetimes.
Some have compared me to Democrat Tom Steyer, which makes me chuckle and cringe. He and I may read the same scientific findings, but that’s about it. Steyer and his allies have largely focused on defeating Republicans. I’m interested in encouraging, defending and supporting Republicans. That’s why I recently gave $500,000 to support Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire in her reelection bid. We need strong Republican leaders like Ayotte who are forward-thinking, recognize the risk of climate change and believe America can accelerate its inevitable transition to clean energy without harming the economy.
As a conservative, I strongly believe it’s time to stop fighting about the climate problem and begin fighting about the solutions. If conservatives fail to put forward our own agenda, climate change policy will likely go the way of health care — the Democrats owned the answers, and we ended up with Obamacare. On carbon pollution, a similar dynamic is already happening; exhibit A is the Environmental Protection Agency’s new 111(d) rule. It mandates that states must reduce carbon emissions — by an EPA-decreed amount — from their existing power plants. The agency is requiring each state to develop its own compliance plan or face a federally imposed one. It’s a top-down, regulate-and-mandate solution rather than an economywide, market-based system.
We need — and I believe we’re developing — better answers, genuinely conservative answers that do exist in the realm of proven fact, technological finding and smart forecasting.
First, we need to prevent and reform regulations that obstruct the promise and development of distributed solar power, especially on rooftops. This form of electricity generation could eventually help the world drastically reduce emissions. And for millions of consumers, it could soon be the ultimate in energy freedom — if we prevent the massive monopoly utilities and their fellow incumbents in the political class from strangling it with overregulation. “Net metering” is a policy that, among other things, allows consumers to sell the excess energy generated by their rooftop solar panels. Utility companies in places like Arizona and Florida, where solar power presents a real alternative to the conventional grid, are spending millions lobbying lawmakers to kneecap it.
Second, conservatives should encourage and fund innovation and research and development in both the private and public sectors. We are a land of inventors and optimists whose technologists have met big challenges with breakthrough solutions time and time again. Elon Musk, one of America’s current great inventors, announced in April that his company is launching a new home battery that could eventually redefine how Americans consume electricity and provide the necessary storage for distributed solar energy. We must celebrate private-sector achievements like these and bolster them by fully funding basic public-sector R&D.
Third, conservatives should embrace and promote energy efficiency in their own lives and businesses. Personal responsibility is a bedrock principle of conservatism, after all. Public policy can be a force for good in this regard. The recently enacted Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015, carried by Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), is an example of the kind of common-sense, bipartisan policies that Republicans should develop and champion.
Unshackling distributed solar and net metering from regulation. Funding and encouraging basic R&D. Promoting personal responsibility and energy efficiency. These are three good starting points for building a conservative agenda to tackle emissions.
People too often forget today that the Republican Party has long been the voice of smart environmental policy. Teddy Roosevelt, our original conservationist, protected our national treasures for future generations. Richard M. Nixon signed the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts. Ronald Reagan forged an international agreement to phase out ozone-depleting chemicals. George H.W. Bush enacted a trading program that lowered sulfur dioxide, the primary ingredient in acid rain, by 80 percent.
A candidate who embraces these past successes and articulates a market-friendly vision for addressing climate change could shift the environmental debate in a direction that favors Republicans — and free markets.
There is no shortage of policy initiatives to consider. The best ones involve entrepreneurial innovation, lower taxes and less bureaucracy.
Republican primary voters currently have more than 16 declared and potential 2016 candidates to choose from. More than one will smartly break away from the pack by embracing free-market solutions to our extraordinary opportunities in energy. It’s good policy and good politics. Moreover, I believe it will fuel a revitalized GOP — and that’s something this nation badly needs.

Newly Released Emails Show Obama Aides Knew Of Hillary Clinton's Private Email As Early As 2009,huffpo,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Senior Obama administration officials knew as early as 2009 that Hillary Rodham Clinton was using a private email address for her government correspondence.
White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel requested Clinton's email address on Sept. 5, 2009, according to one of some 3,000 pages of correspondence released by the State Department on Tuesday evening. His request came three months after top Obama strategist David Axelrod corresponded with Clinton, now a Democratic presidential contender, at her private address.
But it's unclear whether the officials realized Clinton was running her email from a server located in her Chappaqua, New York, home — a potential security risk and violation of administration policy.
Clinton's emails have become a major issue in her early presidential campaign, as Republicans accuse her of using a private account rather than the standard government address to avoid public scrutiny of her correspondence. As the controversy has continued, Clinton has seen ratings of her character and trustworthiness drop in polling.
The newly released emails show Clinton sent or received at least 12 messages in 2009 on her private email server that were later classified ""confidential"" by the U.S. government. Those emails were censored because officials said they contained activities relating to the intelligence community, or had discussed the production and dissemination of U.S. intelligence information.
At least two dozen emails were also marked ""sensitive but unclassified"" at the time they were written, including a December 2009 message from top Clinton aide Huma Abedin about an explosion in Baghdad that killed 90.
In April 2009, Clinton's chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, sent a preview of a ""sensitive but unclassified"" memo to Hillary Clinton's private email address concerning the State Department's preparation for the upcoming Summit of the Americas at the Port of Spain in Trinidad and Tobago.
Though Clinton has said her home system included ""numerous safeguards,"" it's not clear if it used encryption software to communicate securely with government email services. That would have protected her communications from the prying eyes of foreign spies or hackers. When nearly 900 pages of her emails were released in May, Clinton said the information in those messages — also classified by the FBI before being released — ""was handled appropriately.""
Still, the roughly 3,000 pages of Clinton's correspondence from 2009, her first year as the nation's top diplomat, newly released Tuesday by the agency leave little doubt that the Obama administration was aware that Clinton was using a personal address.
""The Secretary and Rahm are speaking, and she just asked him to email her — can you send me her address please?"" Amanda Anderson, Emanuel's assistant, wrote.
Abedin passed along the request to Clinton. ""Rahm's assistant is asking for your email address. U want me to give him?""
Less than a minute later, Clinton replied that Abedin should send along the address.
Axelrod wrote Clinton in June 2009 to express his condolences about an elbow fracture she suffered after slipping on her way to a White House meeting and call her ""an all-star player.""
Clinton replied: ""Thank you for your too kind words which were a greatly welcome addition to my healing and rehab. My word of advice is to watch where you step and stay grounded!""
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said last spring that President Barack Obama emailed with Clinton at her private account, though he was ""not aware of the details"" of her system.
The White House counsel's office was not aware at the time Hillary Rodham Clinton was secretary of state that she relied solely on personal email and only found out as part of the congressional investigation into the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, attacks, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Once the State Department turned over some of her messages in connection with the Benghazi investigation after she left office, making it apparent she had not followed government guidance, the White House counsel's office asked the department to ensure that her email records were properly archived, according to the person, who spoke on a condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak on the record.
The emails, covering March through December 2009, were posted online as part of a court mandate that the agency release batches of Clinton's private correspondence from her time as secretary of state every 30 days starting June 30.
Separately, the State Department on Tuesday provided more than 3,600 pages of documents to the Republican-led House committee investigating the deadly 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, including emails of Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations at the time, and former Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Jake Sullivan.
The regular releases of Clinton's correspondence all but guarantee a slow drip of revelations from the emails throughout her primary campaign, complicating her efforts to put the issue to rest. The goal is for the department to publicly unveil 55,000 pages of her emails by Jan. 29, 2016 — just three days before Iowa caucus-goers will cast the first votes in the Democratic primary contest. Clinton has said she wants the department to release the emails as soon as possible.
Clinton turned her emails over to the State Department last year, nearly two years after leaving the Obama administration. She has said she got rid of about 30,000 emails she deemed exclusively personal. Only she and perhaps a small circle of advisers know the content of the discarded communications.
Much of the correspondence reflects the mundane logistics of high-level public service, scheduling secure lines for calls, commenting on memos and dealing with travel logistics.
In one email with the subject ""Don't laugh!!"" Clinton asked her longtime aide, Capricia Marshall, about carpets in China.
""Can you contact your protocol friend in China and ask him if I could get photos of the carpets of the rooms I met in w POTUS during the recent trip?"" Clinton wrote. ""I loved their designs and the way they appeared carved. Any chance we can get this?""

HUFFPOLLSTER: Cruz Faces An Uphill Primary Battle,huffpo,"Ted Cruz faces an uphill battle given resistance from party elites and an exceptionally extreme ideology. Americans are opposed to changes to Medicare and Medicaid that Republicans want to make. And a survey -- hopefully conducted in the evening -- confirms most Americans aren't morning people. This is HuffPollster for Tuesday, March 24, 2015.
INVISIBLE PRIMARY LOOKS BAD FOR CRUZ - Nate Cohn: ""Political scientists argue that the single most important determinant of the outcome of the nomination is support from party elites: those operatives who can staff a winning campaign; the donors who fund it; the elected officials and interest group leaders who bestow the credibility necessary to persuade voters and affect media coverage. The candidate with the most support from party elites doesn’t always win the nomination, but support from elites is probably a prerequisite for victory. 'A candidate without substantial party support has never won the nomination,' said John Zaller, a political-science professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and one of four authors of 'The Party Decides,' an influential work on the role of parties in the nominating process. Mr. Cruz has done nothing to endear himself to the elites....In April 2013, he was identified as 'The Most Hated Man in the Senate' by Foreign Policy magazine'....If you did a web search for 'Senators Hate Ted Cruz' on Sunday, that Foreign Policy article wouldn’t have even come up on the first Google page. It was supplanted by titles like 'Why Senate Republicans Hate Ted Cruz,' 'GOP Still Despises Ted Cruz,' [and] 'Everybody Hates Ted Cruz'...Mr. Cruz is not an outsider, grass-roots version of President Obama in 2008. [Cruz] is unacceptable to many conservative officials, operatives, interest group leaders and pundits. If they don’t take him seriously, voters won’t either."" [NYT]
Too ideologically extreme? - Harry Enten: ""Cruz is likely far too extreme ideologically to win the nomination. The Republican party has a habit of nominating relatively moderate candidates (see John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012)....A Cruz nomination wouldn’t just break this streak; it would throw it off a 100-floor balcony and drop a piano on it. Cruz is more conservative than every recent nominee, every other candidate who mounted a serious bid in 2012 and every plausible candidate running or potentially running in 2016. Let’s look at three ideological measures: DW-Nominate common-space scores (which are based on a candidate’s voting record in Congress), fundraising ratings (based on who donates to a candidate), and OnTheIssues.org scores (based on public statements made by the candidate). As my colleague Nate Silver has previously noted, these measures aren’t perfect, but together, they give you a fairly good idea of where a candidate stands. Cruz is the first or second most conservative candidate on all three scales for former nominees and all the candidates running in the 2016 campaign."" [538]

Still unknown to half of Americans... - Jim Geraghty: ""Earlier this month, Gallup polled 1,522 adults about their opinions of various political figures. Asked their opinion about Ted Cruz, 22 percent answered favorable, 28 percent unfavorable, 37 percent said they had never heard of him, and 13 percent said they were undecided. In other words, half of all adults don’t have an opinion on him yet."" [NRO]
...But with Tea Party appeal - Anthony Salvanto: ""In our Feb [CBS News] poll most Reps didn’t know enough about Cruz to say whether they’d consider him or not. Those who did split: Yes 23% - No 21%... those who’d consider voting for Cruz were 3 times as likely to be Tea Party supporters as those who would not consider him."" [@SalvantoCBS here and here]
AMERICANS OPPOSE CHANGES TO MEDICARE AND MEDICAID IN GOP BUDGET Peter Moore: ""Americans tend to oppose proposed overhauling Medicare and Medicaid, but they also tend to think it's more important to balance the budget than to protect services. YouGov's latest research shows that Americans tend to oppose rather than support the Republican budget plan to significantly alter how the federal government provides health insurance for over-65s and the poor. Only 19% of Americans support replacing the current Medicare system of federal health insurance for over-65s with federal subsidies to buy private health insurance...Opposition to proposed changes to Medicare are largely the same regardless of political party...Despite widespread opposition to changes that could quickly cut federal spending, when asked in principle whether it is more important to balance the budget or protect government services, most Americans (56%) say that it's more important to balance the budget, while only 29% say that it's more important to maintain the same level of government services."" [YouGov]

WE GET UP EARLY, SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO - Meg Lazovick: ""Edison Research got a unique opportunity to study the morning routines of Americans recently. In a study commissioned by the Country Radio Seminar, entitled 'Wake Me Up,' we performed an exhaustive national survey of adults 18 to 54 – conducted entirely on weekdays – where our respondents told us all about their behaviors in the morning and attitudes about mornings....And here’s our first finding in the 'Wake Me Up' series: A majority of people do not consider themselves 'a morning person.'""

"Sanders adviser teases his own 2016 run, vows he would resign after passing single law",fox,"

Lawrence Lessig, a campaign adviser for Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders, is threatening a White House run of his own. 
But the Harvard Law School professor is making an unusual vow, even by Sanders standards: if elected, he'd pass a single voting reform law and resign the same day. 
""Here's the idea we're going to test -- a referendum president, a candidate who runs for president making a single promise,"" Lessig says in a video announcing his plans. ""Once that reform is passed, this president would step down. ... The candidate is the referendum."" 
Lessig, who wants to be that ""referendum president,"" is specifically concerned with elections and campaign finance. His sole objective would be to pass what he calls The Citizen Equality Act of 2017. After that, he says, he would step down from office and let the vice president take over. 
“At the core of our democracy, there is a basic inequality,” he said in the campaign video. “Not the inequality of wealth, though that is a problem, or the inequality of speech, though some think that a problem too, but the inequality of citizens.”
Lessig isn’t technically running yet though he put out a statement touting his plans. He has set up an exploratory committee to assess a potential run, but says if he can raise $1 million by Labor Day, he will enter the Democratic race. 

So far he has raised $175,000. 
The Sanders campaign did not respond to a request for comment. 
Lessig’s reform proposal is a combination of elements from other election reform bills. It has three goals: making voting easier, changing congressional district rules, and overhauling campaign finance. Among the law’s proposals are moving elections to a national holiday, ending gerrymandering, and funding campaigns through small-dollar citizen vouchers and matching funds.  
That proposal is currently in outline form. If the campaign does launch, Lessig says he will “crowdsource a process to complete the details.” 
Some have pointed out that Lessig’s platform strongly resembles Sanders’. According to Lessig, though, he’s the only Democrat talking seriously about a major overhaul.
“Yet though every major candidate in the Democratic primary for president has acknowledged this corruption, so far every one of them just puts it to one side,” he said in the video. ",0.51495231343644532,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.0096906173508018896, u'mexico': 0.033905363574387941, u'abortion': 0.016887338080738116, u'immigration': 0.0080573487147559669, u'trade': 0.0085879662646277614, u'campaign_finance': 0.79816760901588524, u'other': 0.0017821443303419899, u'china': 0.011055292712162695, u'military': 0.0032005644768728146, u'terrorism': 0.016254144422064278, u'economy': 0.073878995807199713, u'health': 0.0048467458991854288, u'women': 0.013685869350976286}"
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker officially enters 2016 presidential race,cnn," (CNN)Scott Walker, the political phenomenon who rose to national fame by taking on unions in one of the most blue-collar states, tweeted Monday morning confirming that he'll seek the Republican nomination for president, just hours ahead of his in-person announcement.
""I'm in. I'm running for president because Americans deserve a leader who will fight and win for them,"" Walker tweeted, signing the message with his initials ""SW,"" indicating it was written by him and not his staff. 
Walker also put out a video Monday morning, outlining his political history and why he thinks he would be the best candidate to be president. 
His Monday afternoon event in Waukesha, Wisconsin, will be a remarkable political milestone for the 47-year-old second-term governor, who vaulted from the obscurity of the Milwaukee County executive to the top tier of a presidential campaign, thanks in large part to a historic gubernatorial recall effort that nearly ended his career in 2012.
In his first foray into a presidential campaign, Walker -- one of the most recognizable and polarizing governors in the country -- has emerged as a potentially formidable opponent to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Recent polling has shown Walker as one of the major contenders in the presidential race, competing closely with Bush and other prominent Republicans both nationally and in the early presidential states.
Although Walker waited to launch his White House bid until the end of the legislative session in his home state, he has been laying down the groundwork for a national campaign for months. The union-busting governor has been courting donors, traveling overseas and boosting his national profile by publicly tussling with President Barack Obama on issues like the nuclear deal with Iran.
The next several months will be a critical test for Walker. After his campaign announcement, the governor will crisscross the country, presenting himself to voters in Nevada, South Carolina, New Hampshire and Iowa.

A few months after taking office in 2011, Walker signed a measure to curb collective bargaining rights for most public employees in the state, framing it as an effort to take on the ""big government special interests"" and give power back to Wisconsin taxpayers.
The move triggered fierce backlash from labor unions and their progressive allies, sparking massive protests at the state capitol in Madison.
Conservatives in Wisconsin and around the country came to Walker's defense, helping the governor withstand a recall effort in 2012. Walker went on to win re-election by six points in 2014, his third statewide victory in four years.
It is that recall experience, more than any other, that has helped lay the groundwork for Walker's presidential bid. At the time, Walker said his recall victory proved that ""voters really do want leaders who stand up and make the tough decisions.""
That is a message that Walker has promoted in recent months while exploring a presidential campaign, calling on the Republican Party to look for ""fresh leadership"" and someone with ""big, bold ideas and the courage to act on it.""
Veteran GOP strategist Kevin Madden, who served as a senior adviser to Mitt Romney's presidential campaign in 2012, says Walker's union-busting efforts helped him to burnish his conservative credentials by demonstrating his ability to taken on ""the national [Democratic]establishment"" and beat them on three consecutive occasions.

Beyond his record as governor, Walker's Midwestern roots will be an invaluable asset in the GOP nominating fight -- Wisconsin voters haven't picked a Republican for president since 1984.
Walker is poised to make the case that his candidacy could put other Great Lakes states on the electoral map that have been out of reach for Republicans in recent cycles, including Michigan and Pennsylvania, which haven't voted for the GOP nominee since 1988.
""The path for a Republican to win the presidency comes through the Midwest,"" Walker told a crowd in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in April. ""It comes from Iowa and Wisconsin and Michigan and Ohio and we're even going to include Pennsylvania because they're part of the Big Ten,"" he added.
Walker also has a personal narrative that could enable him to appeal to low-income voters, a group Republicans lost overwhelmingly in 2008 and 2012, with the struggles in the latter campaign fueled in part by Mitt Romney's ""47 percent"" comments.
Walker is the son of a Baptist minister and an Eagle Scout, who attended Marquette University for three years before dropping out to take a job with the Red Cross. Walker has taken to citing his humble beginnings during recent appearances, setting up a contrast between his background and that of one of his key 2016 rivals -- Bush.
""I realize unlike some out there I didn't inherit fame or fortune from my family,"" Walker said during a speech to a Christian broadcasters convention in February. ""I got a bunch of things that were a whole lot better than that. I got from my parents and my grandparents the belief that if you work hard and you play by the rules, here in America you can do and be anything you want.""

Walker  has already experienced challenges that come with being thrust into the national spotlight in the months leading up to his campaign's official launch.
Unlike some of his peers in the Republican field like Bush, who lived through the White House campaigns of his father and brother, or former 2012 presidential candidates Rick Perry or Rick Santorum, Walker is facing head-on for the first time the reality of just how much scrutiny comes with a presidential campaign.
And it's shown.
Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Walker raised eyebrows when he seemed to compare the task of fighting ISIS to taking on thousands of protesters in his state.
Earlier
 that month, a trip to London resulted in a slew of unflattering headlines when Walker, despite his best efforts to avoid making news during the overseas trip, punted on a question about the theory of evolution.
In March, several news outlets, including CNN, reported that at a private gathering in New Hampshire, Walker had endorsed a pathway for citizenship for undocumented immigrants. This would have marked a notable reversal for Walker who had staked out a more conservative position on the divisive issue, and pundits were quick to suggest that the governor had flip flopped.
Joe McQuaid, publisher of the New Hampshire Union Leader whose office is a must-visit early state stop for presidential candidates, remarked at the time that the controversy surrounding Walker's reported immigration remarks showed that this is the governor's ""first time outside of Wisconsin.""
""It is a guy in his first presidential campaign trying to get himself grounded and see where he needs to be nuanced,"" McQuaid said in a recent interview. ""He hasn't dealt with these issues on a regular basis.""

Walker could give Bush a run for his money.
Over the past few months, the governor has made aggressive overtures to wealthy financiers and prominent Republican donors, presenting himself as a conservative alternative to others in the field.
Bush's extensive fundraising network, founded on decades-old family friendships, will be difficult to compete with. But in the earliest stages of the campaign, Walker's political action committee, Our American Revival, has boasted impressive commitments and donations from prominent donors and bundlers in fundraising epicenters like New York, California and Texas.
And it's not just deep-pocketed donors that Walker is banking on.
The recall fight that made the governor a national figure could be a boon for his fundraising efforts among small-dollar donors.
Walker raised more than $30 million for the recall campaign, which helped him grow his donor to list to some 300,000 supporters. Walker and his supporters say they're eager to win over a new generation of donors.
""Our donor is not the tried and true Republican donor in New York City that's given to everybody since Reagan, Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of the investment firm SkyBridge Capital who is raising money for Walker, told CNN earlier this month. ""We don't have the mercenary donor that's paying for past political favors.""

"Luxury Public Golf Course, Run by Trump, Opens on Former Bronx Dump",nyt,"After decades of debate, false starts and cost overruns, luxury golf finally arrived in the Bronx on Wednesday, as the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point opened in the shadow of the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge.

Forty years ago, as swaths of the South Bronx blazed, such a news bulletin might have been an April Fool’s joke. But while the public links made its debut on April 1, the 18-hole course marked a milestone for urban fans of golf and the end of a long struggle for the city’s Department of Parks and Recreation.

The parks department already oversees more than a dozen other municipal golf courses, including four in the Bronx. But the new golf course in Ferry Point Park, in the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx, the first built in the city since 1964, represents a departure, elevating municipal golf to a new level of sophistication — and expense.

Greens fees are about three times what they are at the city’s other courses; a city resident will pay $169 to play on weekends, while a nonresident will pay $215. Electric golf carts are outfitted with GPS, allowing golfers, among other things, to order a chicken sandwich and a Bronx Pale Ale while they are playing.

Perhaps paradoxically for such a high-end experience, the 7,400-yard golf course, which received a push forward when the company led by Donald J. Trump won the bid to run it, is built on a former landfill that closed in 1963. Scores of vents jut up from the links to release methane gas. The course is framed by housing projects and other modest buildings on one side.

But out on the links, golfers are immersed in another world. While the greens were still dormant and therefore lacking in color, they nonetheless present a hilly tableau, offering vistas of the Manhattan skyline and the glittering East River around every corner.

On Wednesday, despite temperatures in the 40s, more than 30 foursomes were out on the links, which were designed by Jack Nicklaus and John Sanford in the Scottish style — without trees. (The landscape was in part dictated by the limitations of a former landfill.)

Among the players was the Bronx borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr., who insisted that his score was off the record. “I’m out here on Day 1, letting people know that we have a world-class, P.G.A. links-style golf course right here in the boogie-down Bronx,” he said right before making a crisp drive that elicited whistles from onlookers.

“That was on the record!” he shouted. Half of the course’s 100 employees are Bronx residents.

Higher greens fees do not seem to have scared off potential players. In mid-March, the course started taking reservations for April. “Within 15 minutes all the prime time slots had sold out for every weekend,” said Ronald C. Lieberman, an executive vice president of the Trump Organization.

The development of the course was plagued by problems, including the discovery of toxic substances in the soil. A deal with a developer, Ferry Point Partners, to build the course fell apart in 2006.

The city then built the 192-acre course itself, using city contractors, but costs eventually ballooned to $127 million, and critics questioned the need for an upscale golf course in a borough where a third of residents live below the poverty line. The Trump Organization was chosen in 2010 to operate the course after several earlier attempts to find an operator failed.

The company will soon start construction on a permanent, $10 million clubhouse, which it will finance. In the meantime, a temporary clubhouse has a pro shop and an outdoor grill under a yellow-and-white striped awning.

Both Mr. Trump and city officials hope to eventually lure a professional tournament. “Hopefully, we’ll have majors and P.G.A. championships and Ryder Cups,” Mr. Trump said in a phone interview.

There will be an official opening ceremony in May, with Mr. Trump, Mr. Nicklaus, the parks commissioner, Mitchell J. Silver, and others. By then the grass should be bright green. In keeping with the recent weather, opening day was so chilly that play was delayed by two hours.

“The first person teed off at 10,” said Anthony D. Macari, director of concession architecture and development for the parks department. “It was a little late because of the frost.”",0.96458728002032657,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.026822252851998154, u'mexico': 0.085848426082800217, u'abortion': 0.012731857046362371, u'immigration': 0.4139399103366791, u'trade': 0.078245365929452138, u'campaign_finance': 0.072565193381782453, u'other': 0.15028379185216992, u'china': 0.016253393946928592, u'military': 0.013643837806122189, u'terrorism': 0.0180286291112682, u'economy': 0.078574973199910525, u'health': 0.024178001321799852, u'women': 0.0088843671327264711}"
