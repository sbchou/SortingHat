"Nigerian troops rescue 25 kids, women from Boko Haram, destroy more camps in forest stronghold",fox,"			
			 LAGOS, Nigeria –  The military says Nigerian troops have rescued 25 more children and women from Boko Haram as they continued to attack and destroy the extremists' camps in a forest stronghold. 
Army spokesman Col. Sani Usman says many militants were killed in firefights Wednesday morning that also cost the life of one soldier. He says five troops were wounded. 
About 700 children and women have been saved in the past week as soldiers supported by air raids have deployed on foot into the Sambisa Forest, the last stronghold of Nigeria's home-grown Islamic extremists. 
It is unclear if those rescued include some of the schoolgirls kidnapped a year ago from Chibok town. Some 219 remain missing.",0.065664642732486844,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.011521451257631189, u'mexico': 0.016444629991633264, u'abortion': 0.021708819515355641, u'immigration': 0.034290743944370108, u'trade': 0.01524089251707072, u'campaign_finance': 0.015868203988607169, u'other': 0.27617164694036994, u'china': 0.023607612288984295, u'military': 0.052548942848999018, u'terrorism': 0.17865753106905607, u'economy': 0.014106050361156829, u'health': 0.018201606520824972, u'women': 0.32163186875594069}"
Drunk Zamboni Driver Sentenced Over .314 BAC In North Dakota,huffpo,"A man in Fargo, North Dakota, will spend at least a week for drunken Zamboni driving.
Zamboni driver Steven James Anderson, 27, was convicted Tuesday for an incident on New Year's Eve where he allegedly drove an ice resurfacing machine while under the influence of alcohol, Valley Live News reports.
A judge sentenced Anderson to nine days in jail, with credit for one day served. Anderson will also have to pay a $1,500 fine, go through a chemical dependency evaluation, and participation in the state's 24/7 sobriety program, according to FoxSports.com.
Witnesses said Anderson was driving erratically on the ice between periods and crashed into the boards a few times. A TV journalist at the game testified in court he saw Anderson yell at the sound operator to ""crank it up"" during an AC/DC song, the Duluth News Tribune reports.
A school principal called police during the game. A test at the time of Anderson's arrest showed his blood alcohol content was .314, almost four times the legal limit. 
Anderson's attorney, Lindsey Haugen, argued that her client wasn't guilty because the law isn't clear about whether a Zamboni is a vehicle. Municipal Court Judge Stephen Dawson said the state law does include such vehicles, CBS News reports.
Anderson apologized to the court about the incident and said he has been sober since the arrest.
""I just want to get it over with,"" he said, according to the Associated Press.

How the Pentagon got its way in Iran deal,politico,"
IRAN DEAL

Restrictions on advanced military weapons sales to Iran will remain in place for five to eight years.

The Pentagon exerted key influence over one major sticking point in the final hours of the nuclear negotiations with Iran, according to current and former U.S. officials and diplomats: when to relax the international embargo on advanced military weapons to the Islamic Republic.
As the talks entered the final stages, U.S. negotiators were under enormous pressure — from Russia and China, as well as some European allies — to immediately lift the United Nations embargo that was put in place in 2010 as punishment for Iran’s nuclear weapons development, they said. Iranian diplomats, meanwhile, were insisting on immediate relief in exchange for forgoing the nation’s nuclear ambitions.

But while economic sanctions will be lifted and billions of dollars in assets unfrozen under the deal reached Tuesday, the restrictions on conventional arms sales will remain in place for five years — and for ballistic missile technologies, which worry the U.S. military commanders the most, for eight years.

That came as a surprise to many. And it was seen as a major win for the U.S. military establishment, which had argued both publicly and behind the scenes that allowing Iran to rearm quickly — before any confidence could be built that it was living up to the terms of the nuclear pact — was a dangerous prospect given Tehran’s recent record of destabilizing military behavior in the region.
“I expected to see something short term and not very strong,” said Thomas Pickering, who has served as ambassador to the United Nations, Russia, India, Israel and Jordan and remains a close adviser to the State Department. “Five and eight years are better than zero. For the rest of the world the pressure was for zero.”
In the final days of the talks, the U.S. military’s point of view was made clear to U.S. and international negotiators, both in public and through closed-door meetings and briefings, POLITICO has learned.
Just days before the deal was inked in Vienna, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey told a Senate committee that “we should under no circumstances relieve pressure on Iran relative to ballistic missile capabilities and arms trafficking.” His boss, Defense Secretary Ash Carter, similarly told the Senate Armed Services Committee that “we want them to continue to be isolated as a military and limited in terms of the kinds of equipment and material they are able to procure.”
Referring to Iran’s efforts to build long-range missiles, Carter added: “The reason that we want to stop Iran from having an ICBM program is that ‘I’ in ICBM stands for intercontinental, which means having the capability of flying from Iran to the United States.”
The breathing room on the issue could help defuse at least some of the concerns about the overall pact raised by many Republicans in Congress and some Democrats who fear an emboldened Iran, which remains a major supporter of terrorist groups across the Middle East and is fomenting the civil wars in both Syria and Yemen.
The Pentagon’s forceful position, which was out of character during months of negotiation in which it mostly remained silent on the details, was matched by calls in Congress on the eve of the deal not to let Iran rebuild militarily.

“If you lift the arms embargo, not only do they get more resources and money to support terrorism, but then there would not be an arms embargo and they would have more opportunity to purchase arms from countries like Russia,” Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), a member of the Armed Services Committee, told reporters Monday. “As the largest state sponsor of terrorism, it would be irresponsible.”
“Carter and Dempsey were very clear last week in the Senate Armed Services Committee for good reason,” she added.
Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) expressed similar concerns about the short-term implications of an Iran able to purchase arms from Russia or China.
“The last thing we need to do is give Iran the ability to have the wherewithal to have arms going throughout the region,” he said. “What is lost here is that if we lift the arms embargo, then Russians freely can sell the S-300 to them.”
The Pentagon has been extremely vocal about the potential for Iran to advance its ballistic missile program and procure conventional arms such as as fighter aircraft and anti-missile systems from Russia that it fears could upend the balance of power in the region.
In April, it criticized the announcement by Russia that it was taking steps to sell Iran the S-300 surface-to-air missile system.
Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Armed Services panel, remained unbowed by the news that any relaxing of the international arms embargo would not go into effect for years — and only if Iran is living up to its end of the bargain.
“The result, I fear, is that this agreement will strengthen Iran’s ability to acquire conventional weapons and ballistic missiles, while retaining an industrial scale nuclear program, without any basic change to its malign activities in the Middle East,” the Arizona Republican said in a statement Tuesday.
But a number of close observers said the language in the agreement dealing with the arms embargo will go a long way to keep Iran’s military ambitions in check — at least for now. And it will help ensure that Saudi Arabia, Israel and other U.S. allies in the region that are buying American arms in record numbers maintain a significant edge.
“We ought to be able to judge Iran’s behavior in the region and beyond and if there are reasons to put back on the [arms] embargo,” Pickering said.
“I am surprised the Iranians agreed to it,” said Ben Moores, a defense analyst at IHS Janes, a international security consulting firm in Britain.

Moores recently completed a study of what it would take Iran, which is widely viewed as having a relatively weak military, to rebuild its arsenal after years of both U.N. sanctions and efforts by the U.S. and its allies to deprive the regime of advanced technologies as punishment for supporting terrorist groups like the Lebanese Hezbollah and Palestinian Hamas.
“Iran in total weapons procurement last year, spent $550 million,” he said. “If you look at Saudi Arabia’s defense imports, they were $7 billion last year. UAE imported $4 billion. Oman was $1 billion, which is twice as much as the Iranian total.”
“The Iranian military capability is very weak,” Moores added. “They have no real air force. Their navy is weak, relatively speaking. Their ground forces lack command and control and communications capability.”
In his view even the ballistic ballistic missile program is “inflated.”
He estimates it would cost Tehran $40 billion for a military “refresh.”
But the short-term the agreement is likely to mean more arms sales to U.S. allies in the region as a hedge.
“If there is an arms race it will be one-sided,” said William Hartung, an expert on the international arms trade at the Center for International Policy in Washington. “The Saudi and the Israelis will be increasing their margins” vis-a-vis the Iranian military.
“The Iranians are just patching up stuff that they got under the Shah, some from during the Iran-Iraq war,” according to Hartung. “It is why they have pursued this asymmetric strategy of arming Hezbollah and Hamas.”

Is It Brave or Insane to Choose to Divorce?,huffpo,"A comedienne, writer, & ex- MTV personality, Laura's work has been featured in the New York Times, Huffington Post, and more.
This is the thought that goes through my head sometimes, fifteen months after separating from my ex-husband (our divorce is still not official).
""Am I brave for moving forward with him, with the divorce? Or am I insane?""
Originally when we separated, a year or more seemed so far away. I thought for sure I would feel better -- for good. I didn't predict how tough it would be. I didn't predict how sharing our child would still, fifteen months later, suck. Yes, suck. Splitting our daughter's time in half has been tremendously difficult. When she is gone, it's like I'm in the black & white scenes from the ""Wizard of Oz"": twisters, an evil neighbor, and the dreariness of a flat Kansas plain about to erupt in a storm. All the color goes out of my life to some extent, and the house is eerily quiet.
To believe that I am good enough to be loved and not a failure, even though the marriage failed.
To have faith that this too shall pass, and for good-- not just for a few days or weeks.
Fifteen months down the line, I didn't think dating would be so difficult. I didn't think I would be so naive about how all these dating sites, apps, and random real-life run-ins with the opposite sex would be so complicated or simply void of substance. That I would be so hesitant and unsure.
Sometimes, I feel as if I am a teenager again: unsure of myself, unsure of what to do, and emotional at most turns.
I begin to wonder if I made the right choice. It wasn't me who decided to divorce. We decided together. There were times I asked if we were doing the right thing. Times I asked if we could make this work. If we could try again.
I often think that even though I was thirty when I married that I was still immature when it came to relationships. Now, I am not immature. Now I have a whole other perspective on love than when I met my ex-husband.
And it makes me wonder if love really does exist in the way poets and musicians describe it, or if it's all just a mirage or temporary state of particular hormones.
We decided to divorce and there I was, a woman dependent financially on a man, trying to get back into work full-time after motherhood and college, and we went forward with this.
Was I crazy? Or was I brave?
The answer is both.
The answer is in order to be brave, in order to find the love I want and the life I want, I had to be crazy enough and brave enough.
Yes. Divorce is hard. If you think it's going to be easy or that the grass is green on the other side, think twice.
Yes, it is hard moving on. Yes, it is hard sharing my daughter. Yes, it is hard being broke.
But here is where the color kicks on:
Fifteen months later, I am working up a storm and building a career and bringing in an income for myself. I am still broke, but I am paying bills. I am making a mark and cutting ground.
Fifteen months later, yes I have been picky, but I have not let anyone into my child's circle. I have protected her.
Fifteen months later, I have lost my home and found another. I have begun to start over completely, 150%.
Fifteen months later, I am still here writing, and still here hoping for the life I want, for the love I want.
So while I may have been crazy to have agreed to walk away from the only love of my life, I was brave to want more. I was brave to say I deserved someone who loved me for me, instead of hunkering down in my misery and loneliness and praying for it to end.
No, instead I took the wheel and decided to go out into the world to find someone who loves me as is, and not how he wants me to be. Insanity would have been staying with someone who didn't accept me for who I was. Insanity would have been trying to squeeze myself into a box to be someone else so I didn't have to be alone.
I decided to live an authentic life, and yes, it is hard and sad sometimes and I am truly scared on what is to come, but I did it.
And I guess that makes me brave.",0.075414820517280948,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.020187819809326796, u'mexico': 0.0097669159836803882, u'abortion': 0.018951297706453072, u'immigration': 0.010889261717083451, u'trade': 0.0061037505647631987, u'campaign_finance': 0.0044225161568607957, u'other': 0.86828406730107177, u'china': 0.0085461756785040685, u'military': 0.0062261385603134094, u'terrorism': 0.014024769265188732, u'economy': 0.010875395939884618, u'health': 0.011855764168433978, u'women': 0.0098661271484357087}"
"Mariners' Taylor Homers, Triples in Loss to Dodgers",nyt,"GLENDALE, Ariz. —  Chris Taylor helped his chances at becoming the Seattle Mariners' starting shortstop with a home run and triple Friday in a 7-4 loss to a Los Angeles Dodgers split squad.

Taylor is competing for the job with Brad Miller.

Taylor, who made his major league debut last July, tripled off Dodgers starter David Huff and later homered.

""I just have to stay aggressive and continue to stick with what's working,"" Taylor said.

Howie Kendrick doubled in the second off Seattle starter Erasmo Ramirez and later scored.

Nonroster first baseman O'Koyea Dickson hit his second homer in four at-bats for the Dodgers.

Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said he is impressed with Dickson's power and thinks he has a chance to contend for the job as the backup to starter Adrian Gonzalez.

""The ball really comes off his bat,"" Mattingly said. ""But power is power. What we want to see is some versatility in the infield.""

""He's one of the young guys on this roster who makes these games fun to watch, especially in the late innings. You want to see these guys push the envelope a little bit and create some competition,"" he said.

STANDING IN

Zack Greinke threw to live hitters for the first time Friday, making 36 pitches on the back fields at Camelback Ranch. Greinke, who had a lubricating injection into his right elbow about two weeks ago, reported no problems. He is scheduled to make his first start on March 11 against the Cubs.

""I'm just building up arm strength and trying to get comfortable with hitters in the box,"" he said.

Greinke, the Dodgers' No. 2 starter, faced nine batters.

""I wasn't great, but they're not in midseason form either, so you don't get a 100 percent accurate read,"" Greinke said. ""But it's better than facing nothing. It's just about working on pitches now. Then, you try to get more outs later on.""

STARTING TIME

Mariners: Pitcher Edgar Olmos is back on the roster. The Rangers had claimed Olmos on Feb. 24 after the Mariners waived him. However, Major League Baseball voided the claim because of an injury to his left shoulder. Olmos went 3-3 with three saves and a 4.06 ERA in Double-A and Triple-A last season. He took infielder Ji-Man Choi's spot on the 40-man roster.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Mariners: LHP James Paxton worked through his first bullpen session Friday morning. Paxton hurt both forearms in a fall in agility drills early in camp. He threw 30 pitches without any pain. Over 13 starts last season, he was 6-4 with a 3.04 ERA.

UP NEXT

Mariners: Hisahi Iwakuma, 15-9 with a 3.16 ERA last year, gets the start Saturday against the Arizona Diamondbacks in Peoria, Ariz.

Dodgers: Mike Bolsinger gets his first start this spring Saturday against Cleveland.

5 Keys to Real Happiness From 5 Must-Read Books,huffpo,"Author of “Peace” and ""The Dragon Adventure""
Fairytales feed our minds with the enchanted thoughts about finding a situation where our wishes are fulfilled and we live ""happily ever after."" Contrary to this belief, happiness is not something to go out and find.  Happiness is made (with focus and effort) from within. Following the guidance of researchers and masters in wellbeing we can extract these key points: 
1. Accept the unfamiliar. 
If you only find value in what you know well and ignore or dislike everything unfamiliar, you may be passing up on life's diamonds.  Open yourself up to learning new perspectives. ""Novelty, or exposing ourselves to new ideas and experiences, promotes the growth of new connections among existing neurons,"" Daniel J. Siegel explains in Mindsight. Siegel explains how the brain and personality forms and transforms as we incorporate new behaviors. Openness to a new practice such as meditation that focuses on balance and fulfillment can not only give you a new experience, but can change your personality to becoming a harmonious, happy person.
As Bob Dylan puts it, ""He not busy being born is busy dying."" Life is growth and linked to happiness through the joy of expanding our abilities. For example, learning a new specialty, language or other ability brings greater pleasure than limiting yourself to continuing to only do what you know. Like a coal miner who knows and depends on the value of coal, if he is open to find something ""not coal"" he may find a diamond.
Open up and expand yourself towards happiness.
2. Activate your intuition. 
Not everything is figured out rationally. In fact, sometimes we can use logic to disclaim truth. (Think of the rational belief people once had that the world is flat and had an edge to fall off. Thankfully, someone had an intuition that opened up new territories. ) 
For those of us that have been so schooled to only trust knowledge that comes from books or backed by scientific studies, we could access meaningful wisdom by listening to intuition. ""The intuitive way of perceiving has always put me in touch with the effortless, truly joyful nature of life and showed me how, when we approach our experiences with childlike innocence and awe, miracles abound,"" delights Penny Peirce, intuitive development trainer in the introduction of her book, The Intuitive Way.
Learning the wisdom you have inside can begin filling you with joy.
3. Mindfully sort through information.
We are constantly bombarded with information. Deciding what we take in either moves us toward happiness of derails us into depression.  Be conscious of the underlying direction of the information that you take in from the books you read, shows you watch and conversations that you participate in. Ask yourself, ""Is the message here moving me towards hopefulness and compassion or hopelessness, fear and anger?""
Hope and compassion encourages us to connect into viable support systems with others, allowing for greater possibilities in collaboration. ""Mindfulness can also be described as compassion, because it is an empathetic awareness,"" as explained in the book, Mindfulness by Mark Williams, John Teasdale, Zindel Segal and Jon Kabat-Zinn. The authors, professors and researchers in psychology and medicine, explain that depression is overcome by empathetic awareness.  When we create bonds of caring with others, those bonds build our secure sense of self. 
Stories, real or fiction, that describe love and caring stimulate our internal position to the mindful compassionate state of being. Choose to expose yourself to the friends, news, shows, books and other media that convey hopeful accounts.
4. Use language carefully.
What we say forms our thinking and eventually our actions.  For those who speak different languages, you know that a different way of thinking accommodates the tongue. 
In the English language we experience words that call for harmony from Martin Luther King Jr, words that inspire courage from Winston Churchill and words that evoke passion from William Shakespeare.  In our personal lives, we recall encouraging words of a parent, teacher or coach that carry us through challenges. We probably recall how a criticism was phrased in a supportive way or in a style that crushed us. 
Recognize the positives of your qualities. All qualities have a plus side and aspects that can irritate others.  Instead of focusing on wanting to change your qualities, change the way you use your qualities. Appreciating yourself facilitates your ability to love, respect and value others as well.
""Everything, even your success issues and your circumstances, boils down to whether you are in an internal state of fear or an internal state of love,"" Alexander Loyd clarifies in his recently released book, Beyond Willpower: The Secret Principle to Achieve Success in Life, Love and Happiness. Compassionate acceptance of yourself with love frees you to make choices towards fulfillment and happiness.  The small choices we make based on love or fear accumulate to the life we build. Therefore love yourself.
AND as you appreciate who you are, do the same for others.  We are mirrors to one another.",0.11133794196567699,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.067212231482512555, u'mexico': 0.049522457039793778, u'abortion': 0.025196675000388163, u'immigration': 0.065676199707941973, u'trade': 0.03193797845513946, u'campaign_finance': 0.022017252635286207, u'other': 0.47588041493768934, u'china': 0.043042157159841783, u'military': 0.030901011107972352, u'terrorism': 0.049006633953131665, u'economy': 0.031870167694307311, u'health': 0.034413383740916605, u'women': 0.073323437085078991}"
"Pujols, Calhoun Hit HRs in Angels' 5-3 Win Over White Sox",nyt,"ANAHEIM, Calif. —  Kole Calhoun and Albert Pujols homered in the first inning against John Danks, and the Los Angeles Angels held on to beat the Chicago White Sox 5-3 on Tuesday night.

Garrett Richards (12-9) was charged with three runs — two earned — and eight hits in seven-plus innings with four strikeouts and no walks. The right-hander retired Melky Cabrera on double-play grounders his first two times up, then struck him out in the sixth with the potential tying run at the plate.

Richards threw 25 of his 95 pitches in the sixth inning, when the White Sox closed to 4-2 with a two-out RBI double by Jose Abreu. But the Angels got a run-scoring infield hit in the seventh from Shane Victorino.

Richards left in the eighth after giving up two singles. Adam Eaton drove in a run with a fielder's choice grounder against Joe Smith, but Huston Street pitched a perfect ninth for his 29th save in 33 chances.

Danks (6-10) was charged with five runs — four earned — and five hits in seven innings, increasing his ERA to 4.61.

Danks, who held the Angels to one run through 7 1-3 innings in a no-decision at Chicago six days earlier, found himself trailing 3-0 after just 12 pitches.

The left-hander hit Victorino with his third delivery, then gave up Calhoun's career-high 18th homer on his next pitch and surrendered Pujols' 33rd homer and 553rd of his career one out later. Until Tuesday, no one on the Angels' active roster had ever homered against Danks.

Pujols tied Mike Trout for the team lead in home runs. They are trying to become the first set of teammates with at least 40 homers each since Jim Thome and Jermaine Dye of the 2006 White Sox.

The Angels added an unearned run in the fourth when Johnny Giavotella doubled with two outs and scored on a two-base throwing error by third baseman Tyler Saladino after Saladino backhanded Carlos Perez's grounder near the bag.

Kaleb Cowart, the Angels' No.1 draft pick in 2010, made his major league debut at third base and was 0 for 3. His contract was purchased from Triple-A Salt Lake earlier Tuesday when third baseman Conor Gillaspie was designated for assignment.

Cowart was the fifth player to start at third for manager Mike Scioscia since David Freese went on the disabled list on July 23 because of a fractured right index finger. Cowart began the season with Class-A Inland Empire before he was promoted to Triple-A on June 11.

“The Great Inka Road” details the empire’s amazing thoroughfare,washpo,"   The Inca used khipu like this one to record census reports and other data. (Ernest Amoroso/National Museum of the American Indian)  Without wheels or iron tools, the Inca built a vast empire in South America that lasted about 100 years, beginning in 1438. A network of more than 24,000 miles of roads formed the backbone of this civilization. Those roads are the focus of a new exhibit opening Friday at the National Museum of the American Indian, “The Great Inka Road: Engineering an Empire.” (“Inka” is the spelling used in Quechua, a native language still spoken by Inca descendants.) “It’s astounding that the Inca were able to engineer a road system that didn’t wash away despite the incredible amount of rainfall and the earthquakes in that part of the world,” says Amy Van Allen, Inka Road project manager. Modern engineers study how the Inca channeled water away from roadways and buildings, says Dan Davis, who’s in charge of the exhibit’s interactive elements. “A lot of people think of native tribes or ancient people as more primitive, but the Inca were so far ahead of their time,” he says. “We are only catching up to their ideas of sustainability today.” Informed by the foundations that still stand in the Inca capital of Cusco, archaeologists and architects made a 3-D model of the city as it looked at the height of the empire. Exhibit visitors can explore ancient Cusco using a huge touch-screen table. Either click around the map for a walking tour, or take control of a condor to get a bird’s-eye view. Augmenting the interactive exhibits are artifacts from the museum’s collection, including a khipu — an intricate record-keeping system consisting of knotted ropes. Inca bureaucrats used these to keep tabs on supplies, livestock and the number of people in various municipalities. After all, this was a 12 million-person empire that operated smoothly without currency or stores. Nearly everything was managed by the central government, Van Allen says. “You need powerful administrative tools to keep all these people working and fed,” Van Allen says. That feat may particularly interest locals, Davis says. “D.C. bureaucrats might see this and appreciate they don’t have to deal with kipus,” Davis says.

10 Bizarre And Hilarious Moments In The British Election Campaign,huffpo,"British voters on Thursday will participate in the closest national election in decades, ending months of political campaigning that at times veered into the absurd.
The two main parties, Labour and Conservative, remain neck-and-neck in the polls. If neither wins a majority of seats in Parliament, they will need to gain the support of smaller parties, which range from Scottish nationalists to vehement Eurosceptics, to form a government. 
There are serious issues at stake in the election. The Conservatives have promised a referendum on whether to stay in the European Union. The future of the union between England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland -- the countries in the United Kingdom -- is under intense debate after last year’s unsuccessful Scottish independence referendum.
Yet, the election campaign has not been short of comic moments. The party leaders -- including Labour's Ed Miliband and Conservative leader and current Prime Minister David Cameron -- have been heaped with ridicule, and sometimes thoroughly earned it, in the build-up to the 2015 election.
— Stefan Rousseau (@StefanRousseau) April 8, 2015


— ITV News (@itvnews) April 16, 2015
The prime minister accidentally called the election 'career defining,' instead of 'country defining,' at a campaign event in Yorkshire.

He was regularly compared to cartoon character Wallace from ""Wallace & Gromit."" He was incessantly teased for making gaffes, being clumsy and looking weird.
Then, something strange happened. Miliband grew a huge female fan base, which recast him as a nerd-chic hero and lovable underdog, and #Milifandom was born. (Unfortunately for Miliband, the teenager who started the craze is not old enough to vote, and her parents support the Conservatives.)

Gonzalez pitches O's past Blue Jays for series win,fox,"			
			 Baltimore, MD (SportsNetwork.com) - Miguel Gonzalez threw 7 2/3 strong innings and Rey Navarro hit his first major league home run, leading the Baltimore Orioles to a 6-1 win over the Toronto Blue Jays on Wednesday night.
The Orioles took two of three from the Blue Jays in their first series back in Baltimore since last month's riots. 
Gonzalez (4-2) retired 13 batters in a row during one stretch and improved to 7-2 all-time against the Blue Jays. He allowed just three hits, three walks and one unearned run while striking out five. 
Toronto isn't the only division foe the 30-year-old right-hander has fared well against. He's 20-11 against the AL East in his career. 
""He doesn't just have one way to get you out,"" said Orioles manager Buck Showalter. ""He's going to go to other things."" 
Navarro, who was called up Tuesday to replace injured second baseman Ryan Flaherty, homered in his eighth major league game and 24th plate appearance. 
The 25-year-old infielder sent Brett Cecil's second pitch in the eighth inning -- an 88 mph fastball -- over the left-field wall. 
Caleb Joseph knocked in two runs and Alejandro De Aza and Jimmy Paredes fueled the top of the Baltimore lineup with two hits and one RBI apiece. 
Toronto starter Aaron Sanchez (3-3) took the loss, his first in four starts, after giving up five runs, seven hits and four walks in 5 2/3 innings. 
A five-run second inning for the Orioles started with back-to-back walks by Chris Davis and J.J. Hardy. The runs scored on doubles by Joseph, Manny Machado and De Aza -- Joseph plated two -- and a single by Paredes. 
Machado helped Gonzalez get out of a jam in the next inning when he fielded a grounder at third base and dove to tag out Ezequiel Carrera as he scrambled back to the bag. 
Sanchez was pulled after issuing two-out walks to De Aza and Paredes in the sixth. Liam Hendricks hit Adam Jones with his second pitch but escaped the bases-loaded jam when Chris Davis flied out. 
Gonzalez retired 13 batters in a row before issuing a leadoff walk to Kevin Pillar in the eighth. Ryan Goins followed with a single and Gonzalez was lifted with two runners on base after a passed ball scored Toronto's only run. 
Darren O'Day replaced him and retired Jose Bautista on a ground ball with his first pitch.

IMF official says 'premature' to speak of Chinese crisis,reuters,"RIMINI, Italy China's economic slowdown and a sharp fall in its stock market herald not a crisis but a ""necessary"" adjustment for the world's second biggest economy, a senior International Monetary Fund official said on Saturday.
Fresh evidence of easing growth in China hammered global stock markets on Friday, driving Wall Street to its steepest one-day drop in nearly four years.
""Monetary policies have been very expansive in recent years and an adjustment is necessary,"" said Carlo Cottarelli, an IMF executive director representing countries such as Italy and Greece on its board.
""It's totally premature to speak of a crisis in China,"" he told a press conference.
He reiterated an IMF forecast for a 6.8 percent expansion in the Chinese economy this year, below the 7.4 percent growth achieved in 2014.
""China's real economy is slowing but it's perfectly natural that this should happen ... What happened in recent days is a shock on financial markets which is natural,"" he added.
China's stock markets have fallen more than 30 percent since mid-year. Following a slew of poor economic data, Beijing devalued the yuan in a surprise move last week.
Cottarelli said the IMF would discuss in coming months with Chinese authorities their decision to weaken the currency. 
China is eager for the yuan to join the IMF's Special Drawing Rights basket of currencies. But the fund is considering extending the current SDR basket by nine months until September 30, 2016.  
Turning to Greece, which is heading to an early election in September, Cottarelli said the IMF would decide in two or three months whether to join the latest international rescue efforts.
The IMF deems Greece's debt unsustainable and has called for debt relief as a condition to participate in a third bailout.
""The debt sustainability assessment will take place after the launch of the program (agreed with creditors) in two or three months. The IMF will then be able to evaluate whether to intervene,"" he said.

Amanda Knox Acquitted of 2007 Murder by Italy’s Highest Court,nyt,"ROME — Italy’s highest court acquitted Amanda Knox and her Italian former boyfriend of murder on Friday, throwing out all charges and ending a long-running courtroom drama over the killing of a British student in 2007.

The ruling in favor of Ms. Knox, a 27-year-old former exchange student from Seattle, was a shock in Italy, where the convictions had been expected to be upheld in the death of the British student, Meredith Kercher.

It was the second time that the court, known as the Supreme Court of Cassation, had vacated an appellate court ruling in a case that has been tabloid fodder for years on both sides of the Atlantic.

Gasps went up among spectators in the Rome courtroom, where after 10 hours of deliberation, the presiding judge, Gennaro Marasca, announced the decision. The reasoning behind the decision is to be made public within 90 days.

Supporters of Ms. Knox and her co-defendant, Raffaele Sollecito, reacted with joy. “It’s Over!,” an advocacy group said via its Twitter account, @Justice4Knox.

Neither Ms. Knox nor Mr. Sollecito was present in the courtroom on Friday. Ms. Knox has been living in the United States since her original conviction was overturned in October 2011, and had said she would not return to Italy. Mr. Sollecito attended the case’s two days of hearings before the court, but chose to await the verdict elsewhere.

Ms. Knox and her family issued statements through her lawyer expressing deep thanks for the court’s ruling.

“I am tremendously relieved and grateful for the decision of the Supreme Court of Italy,” Ms. Knox said. “The knowledge of my innocence has given me strength in the darkest times of this ordeal. And throughout this ordeal, I have received invaluable support from family, friends, and strangers. To them, I say: Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your kindness has sustained me. I only wish that I could thank each and every one of you in person.”

In a separate statement, her family said: “We want to express our profound gratitude to all of those who have supported Amanda and our family. Countless people – from world-renowned DNA experts, to former FBI agents, to everyday citizens committed to justice – have spoken about her innocence.”

Ms. Kercher was found dead on the morning of Nov. 2, 2007, lying on the floor of her bedroom in Perugia, a university town in central Italy that is popular with foreigners.

Ms. Knox and Mr. Sollecito were arrested a few days later, and spent four years in custody before their original convictions were overturned.

Rudy Guede, a Perugia resident born in the Ivory Coast, was convicted of murder in a separate trial in connection with Ms. Kercher’s death. Defense lawyers for Ms. Knox and Mr. Sollecito had always argued that Mr. Guede committed the crime on his own.",0.021089050873146751,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.053376440001737427, u'mexico': 0.017910431332638782, u'abortion': 0.017418657107625232, u'immigration': 0.1263127475971236, u'trade': 0.027448471691190784, u'campaign_finance': 0.05762203867701856, u'other': 0.53754815490891239, u'china': 0.030719544487136454, u'military': 0.015647304483450739, u'terrorism': 0.023872011778636161, u'economy': 0.013374239204385708, u'health': 0.068242595460500002, u'women': 0.010507363269644049}"
"Critic’s Notebook: Without Joan Rivers, ‘Fashion Police’ Is Falling Apart",nyt,"Ever since Joan Rivers died in September, “Fashion Police” — the E! show devoted to poking holes in celebrity pageantry that she had hosted since its inception — has been collapsing in plain view.

The show returned for red-carpet season in January with Kathy Griffin in Ms. Rivers’s chair, and the chipper stylist Brad Goreski as a new panelist, joining Kelly Osbourne and Giuliana Rancic, who’ve been gabbing on the show since its beginning.

From the outset, the new blend was slightly toxic. Ms. Griffin is a little more ribald than Ms. Rivers, who tended toward the scabrous. Often, when Ms. Griffin would say something inappropriate, the looks of shock on the panelists’ faces seemed authentic.

But it’s Ms. Rancic who caused the loudest dust-up. During an Oscars wrap-up last month, she said of Zendaya, a young black starlet who’d worn elaborate braids on the red carpet: “I feel like she smells like patchouli oil. Or weed.” Ms. Osbourne quickly distanced herself from the racially insensitive comment, and soon after parted ways with the show. Ms. Rancic apologized for the remark. Then, last week, after filming just seven episodes, Ms. Griffin announced her departure, suggesting in a statement that the show promoted unattainable body image ideas.

These departures, though, are only part of the quandary facing “Fashion Police,” which has been a regular presence on E! since 2010.

At its best, “Fashion Police” was a rare thing: a high-profile home for criticism on television, an “At the Movies” for celebrities and clothes. In the show’s most recent iteration, Mr. Goreski — who has come a long way from being Rachel Zoe’s besieged assistant on “The Rachel Zoe Project” — was a reliable source of historical information and insider perspective, and the disagreements, though sometimes crass, were at least about the merits of design.

The primary goal of “Fashion Police” isn’t reasoned debate, though — it’s the triggering of endorphins that come with celeb-skewering and schadenfreude. It addresses the complementary desires of E! viewers to see stars at their brightest — the network hosts elaborate red-carpet shows for the Oscars, the Grammys, the Emmys and the Golden Globes — and then to see them taken down a peg. In a way, “Fashion Police” is a child of the Perez Hilton era of celebrity trashing, and a reflection of its mainstreaming.

But E! is nothing without its celebrities — more so than the tabloids, it relies on their good will. (“Fashion Police” is also the name of a regular back-of-the-book feature in US Weekly in which photos of unfortunately dressed celebs are used as verbal dartboards for hack comedians, but US Weekly is less reliant on getting A-list celebrities to consent to interviews than E! is.)

That makes “Fashion Police” part of an untenable setup that one day reveres celebrities on the red carpet and the next day marches them onto a gangplank and pushes them into the water.

As the show’s primary host, Ms. Rivers was acidic, incredulous, and often spiritually foul beyond reason. “Call FEMA — this is a disaster,” she said of one of Christina Hendricks’s dress, adding for a final flourish, “She needs a milking stool.” On the same show, she critiqued a Versace number worn by January Jones that appeared to be lifting at the front: “This woman obviously has a yeast infection and the doctor said to her, ‘Aerate it.’ ”

Ms. Rivers, who’d articulated pain through meanness for much of her career, provided a sort of cover for the show. This was light work for her, the casual dismantling of celebrity preening. She was constitutionally impolite long before “Fashion Police”; the show provided her a platform. But without Ms. Rivers as ballast, the recent episodes felt slightly unhinged, a collection of lightweights punching upward when they weren’t busy fawning.

E! is, only notionally, a news organization; it’s better known, and more effective, as a haven for celebrity reality TV like “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” and realty shows that capture the ugliness in striving for fame and beauty, like “#RichKids of Beverly Hills” and “Botched.”

But in so much as news matters to E!, it is through the mouth of Ms. Rancic, the anchor and managing editor of “E! News.” In the E! family, Ms. Rancic is second in importance to only Ryan Seacrest, who hosts the network’s red carpet programming on award show nights, and who is an executive producer of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” and its many offspring.

If Mr. Seacrest does not renew his contract, Ms. Rancic will have even more of the network’s authority on her shoulders. Perhaps not surprisingly, E! recently extended her contract through April of next year.

But is Ms. Rancic a newswoman or a fashion critic? She underscored the problem in a recent episode of “Fashion Police,” referring to her “Amal Clooney moment,” in which she praised Ms. Clooney’s look on the red carpet at the Golden Globes, then tore her to shreds the next day on “Fashion Police.” For Ms. Rancic to simultaneously hold both roles — red carpet glad-hander and morning-after assassin, friend and foe — is a debacle waiting to happen. Last week, The Daily News reported that E! was considering canceling the show after the recent upheavals. An E! spokeswoman said Sunday that the show would return with Ms. Rancic and Mr. Goreski as co-hosts.

The troubles on “Fashion Police” are just one part of an emerging reassessment of E!’s role as a magnifying glass of celebrity beauty. During the most recent award season, a handful of stars at the Screen Actors Guild Awards refused to submit to E!’s Mani Cam — a clever and gauche contraption in which female stars were asked to parade their hands, showing their manicures and jewelry (and in one case, an extended middle finger); it was removed for subsequent red carpets.

So the backlash has begun, not just against the vacuity of red carpet coverage, but against E!’s role in promulgating it. That shouldn’t necessarily doom “Fashion Police” — its banter is lively, and it dares to suggest that there is something other than glamour on the red carpet. As day-after water cooler conversation, following the instant reactions on Twitter, it has merit. But conjoining celebrity love and hate is a tricky task, and even trickier business — maybe they’re better as next-door neighbors, not roommates.",0.0011297289234629899,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.0096310252340219386, u'mexico': 0.028296863771286485, u'abortion': 0.017985137932723761, u'immigration': 0.0053416830642681679, u'trade': 0.069196048614318634, u'campaign_finance': 0.0085667763227245414, u'other': 0.70580615967714322, u'china': 0.021060961223099729, u'military': 0.010415916902112542, u'terrorism': 0.024237451830347079, u'economy': 0.043978176567597387, u'health': 0.0154568576950258, u'women': 0.040026941165330884}"
U.S. Economy Expands 2.3% in Second Quarter,wsj,"WASHINGTON—The U.S. economy accelerated modestly in the second quarter after a slow start to 2015, but growth this year is still less than last year’s tepid first half and is well below the overall pace of the recovery.
Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the economy, grew at a 2.3% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said Thursday. 
Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast 2.7% growth.
The Commerce Department also said the economy grew at a 0.6% rate in the first quarter, an upward revision from a previously reported 0.2% contraction.
The latest figures repeat a common pattern in recent years: a slump at the start of the year, followed by a bounce back in the spring and summer. That has worked out to mediocre growth over the past six years, with no sustained breakout for the economy since the end of the recession in 2009.
Newly revised data show the expansion was weaker than previously thought. From 2012 through 2014, GDP increased at an average annual rate of 2%, according to three years of revised figures Commerce released Thursday, a 0.3 percentage-point downgrade from prior estimates.
So far this year, GDP has grown at an average annual rate of 1.5%, compared with 1.9% in the same period a year earlier. 
Unlike last year, when much of the first-quarter weakness was blamed on unusually harsh winter weather, this year’s slower growth reflected a range of factors, including a stronger dollar, sluggish business investment and lackluster consumer spending. Thursday’s report showed some of those pressures may be starting to ease.
An upturn in exports, stronger consumer spending, slowing imports and stronger state and local government spending helped drive economic growth in the second quarter. 
The rising dollar has pushed up the cost of American-made goods for customers overseas, while foreign products are cheaper in the U.S. In the second quarter, exports rose at a 5.3% rate, compared with a 6% drop in the first quarter. Imports, which subtract from GDP, rose 3.5%, versus a 7.1% increase in the first three months of the year.
Thursday’s report also showed consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic output, rose 2.9% in the second quarter, compared with a 2.1% increase in the first three months of the year.
Overall consumer spending has been choppy, suggesting some Americans remain cautious about opening their wallets despite strong job gains this spring and accelerating wages.
There also are signs consumers may be starting to spend some of the windfall they received from months of lower gasoline prices. The saving rate fell in the second quarter, to 4.8% from 5.2%, while Americans spent more on long-lasting products, including cars. 
Government spending also rose 0.8% in the second quarter, compared with a 0.1% decline in the first quarter, due entirely to an increase in state and local municipal spending.
Thursday’s report also showed the housing market provided a boost to the economy in the second quarter, amid signs of strong activity during the spring selling season. Residential investment advanced at a solid 6.5% pace. However, that gain comes after two quarters of at least 10% growth. 
Business spending, another key driver of the economy, remained soft in the second quarter and actually dragged down the overall GDP number for the first time since the third quarter of 2012. Nonresidential fixed investment—reflecting spending on software, research and development, equipment and structures—retreated at a 0.6% rate, compared with a 1.6% growth rate in the first quarter. The numbers could be a sign businesses remain wary despite stronger consumer spending, steady job gains and an improving housing market. 
The change in inventories had little effect on the overall figure, subtracting just 0.08 percentage point from the overall advance. 
Excluding the effect of company restocking, underlying demand in the economy picked up in the second quarter. Real final sales of domestic product, a measure that excludes changes to inventories, increased at a 2.4% pace, compared with a 0.2% decline in the first quarter.
Many economists have said they expect growth to pick up in the second half of the year, but some forecasts are muted. Ahead of Thursday’s GDP release, for example, Macroeconomic Advisers was predicting a 2.7% pace in the third quarter. 
That would do little to help overall growth break out of its pattern of roughly 2% growth through much of the expansion. Federal Reserve staff forecast the economy to grow just 1.55% in 2015, according to projections prepared for the Fed’s June policy meeting that were inadvertently posted to the central bank’s website last week.
Fed officials upgraded their assessment of the economy Wednesday following a two-day policy meeting. In a statement, officials pointed to solid job gains and diminished labor market slack, suggesting they are closer to raising interest rates from near zero.
There are signs in Thursday’s report that inflation is firming. The price index for personal consumption expenditures—the Fed’s preferred measure for inflation—rose at a 2.2% pace in the second quarter. Core prices, which exclude food and energy costs, rose 1.8%.

Respond to the Column That Was Actually Written,huffpo,"Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University
The comments on my last column, ""Scalia Gets It Pretty Much Right,"" are numerous and largely hostile. The substantive points at issue are discussed at length in the comments and I won't be revisiting them. Instead I want to talk briefly about some of the assumptions -- both explicit and implicit -- informing the strictures my critics offer. Here are some of them:
I am against same-sex marriage. I am for polygamy. I'm against polygamy. I bring up polygamy because I regard it as one of the disastrous consequences the Obergefell decision might lead to. I think that there is some equivalence between the same-sex marriage issue and the issue of conscientious objection. I am for limiting conscientious objector status to members of a traditional religion centered on a supreme being. My jurisprudential views coincide with Justice Scalia's. I am a far-right conservative.
As it happens, all of these assumptions are false. Having said that, I'm not going to tell you what I actually believe about any of these disputed matters or reveal my partisan affiliation. I'm not going to do that because my point in writing the column -- this one and most others I write -- is not to come down on one side or the other of a controversial question, but to analyze the arguments made by one or more of the parties to the controversy. After reading my analysis, you will not have the slightest idea of where I stand, although, if I've done my job, you will have a very good idea of what I think about the logic and coherence of the arguments I discuss.
The fact that I severely criticize one of those arguments cannot be taken as evidence that I am against the position it claims to validate. I could well agree with that position, even embrace it heartily, but think that this line of argument fails to support it or even undermines it. And, conversely, I could easily praise an argument (qua argument) offered to buttress a position I dislike or even despise. To make the point as plainly as possible, my views on gay marriage or polygamy -- and, again, you're not going to hear about them -- are independent of my views on the cogency of what has been said by the polemicists in the field. I'm not one of those polemicists. All I am saying is that Scalia's characterization of the Obergefell majority as being weak on law and strong on inspirational cheer-leading is correct; and given the reasoning that is front and center in Kennedy's opinion, there is no bar to legalizing polygamy.
In saying that, I have not committed myself to agreeing with any of Scalia's other opinions. One poster asked if I would say that Scalia's opinion in Heller, the gun control case, contained even a thin veneer of law. He assumed that if I was with Scalia here, in Obergefell, then I must be with him there. But I am on record saying that his reasoning in Heller was tortured and owed more to a strained parsing of dictionary entries than to the law or legal evidence. I am neither of the 'If Scalia says it, it must be wrong' school (to which many readers of the column seem to belong) nor the 'If Scalia says it, it must be right' school. To belong to either school would be to forsake analysis for ideology.
It comes down to what you want from a columnist. If what you want are opinions, you're not going to get them from me. I'm doing something else. And while it is perfectly okay to be uninterested in that something else and stop reading, it is not okay to respond to a column I did not write.",0.056134861037847615,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.21847568152812274, u'mexico': 0.0071108246183062855, u'abortion': 0.0085632890309739421, u'immigration': 0.02991231714165888, u'trade': 0.0059587337076303301, u'campaign_finance': 0.005503789826144012, u'other': 0.67677656015157184, u'china': 0.0063590289852645653, u'military': 0.0032270459874359564, u'terrorism': 0.016935738530960719, u'economy': 0.0066958354383402727, u'health': 0.010858593084335283, u'women': 0.0036225619692552991}"

Obama to Press His Case on Iran Deal,wsj,"WASHINGTON—President  Barack Obama plans to make his sharpest sales pitch yet in favor of the Iran nuclear deal that the U.S. and other world powers reached three weeks ago, with a lengthy speech on Wednesday outlining his argument in detail for Americans.
The president will speak at American University in Washington as the battle heats up between the White House and opponents of the deal, including Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu, to win over lawmakers on Capitol Hill who are expected to vote on the agreement next month.
The deal negotiated between Iran and a six-nation negotiating bloc strictly limits Tehran’s nuclear activity for at least a decade in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.
A core component of Mr. Obama’s argument on Wednesday will be to frame lawmakers’ decision on the Iran deal as the most consequential congressional vote since the 2002 Iraq war authorization.
“He will point out that the same people who supported war in Iraq are opposing diplomacy with Iran, and that it would be an historic mistake to squander this opportunity—removing constraints on the Iranian program, unraveling the sanctions regime, and damaging American credibility,” a White House official said.‎
Mr. Obama met Tuesday at the White House with representatives of Jewish-American organizations to press his case for backing the deal. Mr. Netanyahu addressed the same representatives from Jewish Federations of North America on Tuesday, urging them to oppose it.
Also on Tuesday, Republican leaders in the House and Senate signaled they would move forward in September with resolutions to reject the Iran deal. At the same time, a series of new pronouncements from Democrats cut both in favor of the agreement and against it.
Capital Journal is WSJ.com’s home for politics, policy and national security news.
Rep. Ted Deutch (D., Fla.), who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he doesn’t support the deal because of the roughly $100 billion Iran would receive in sanctions relief under its terms.
“Too many issues I have long raised as essential to any nuclear deal with Iran are not adequately addressed in this agreement,” Mr. Deutch said in a statement.But a handful of Senate Democrats, including Bill Nelson, also of Florida, said they would support the measure.
Under legislation Congress passed in May, lawmakers can choose to vote on a resolution of approval or disapproval—or not vote at all. Assuming both the House and Senate pass resolutions of disapproval, and the White House vetoes it, the president would need to win over just over one-third of lawmakers in either chamber to avoid having Congress sink the deal.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Mr. Obama is confident enough Democrats support the deal in the House to sustain a presidential veto, and the president is expected to be able to sustain a veto in the Senate.
Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, expected to be the next Democratic leader in the Senate, has remained undecided on the Iran deal going into Congress’s August recess. “I’m not going to let pressure or politics or party influence my decision, and then when I think my questions have been answered I’ll let people know how I feel and why,” Mr. Schumer said.
The White House is essentially resigned to the president’s having to use his veto power to implement his signature foreign policy initiative.
Indeed House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said Tuesday the chamber would vote in September on a resolution from House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R., Calif.) to reject the deal. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said the Senate would “in all likelihood” also vote on a resolution of disapproval on the deal.
Mr. Netanyahu, in a webcast speech, condemned the agreement on Tuesday as fatally flawed. He also accused the White House—as the White House has accused him—of distorting the facts of the accord. In particular Mr. Netanyahu took issue with the White House’s assertion that opponents of the deal are advocating war, which Mr. Obama has cast as the only alternative to his diplomatic outreach to Iran.
“This is a very dangerous deal, and it threatens all of us,” Mr. Netanyahu said, adding: “The claim that we oppose this deal because we want war is not just false, it’s outrageous.”
Mr. Netanyahu brushed aside public support that Gulf Arab states have offered for the deal, surmising that they will now pursue their own nuclear programs.
“The countries in the region threatened by Iran have already made clear that they will work to develop atomic bombs of their own,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “So the deal that was supposed to end nuclear proliferation will actually trigger nuclear proliferation.”

What’s on TV Wednesday,nyt,"3:30 P.M. (HBO2) THE CONSTANT GARDENER (2005) In this political thriller directed by Fernando Meirelles and adapted from the John le Carré novel, Ralph Fiennes portrays Justin Quayle, a British diplomat (and diligent caretaker of his plants), and Rachel Weisz is Tessa, his wife, whom he meets during a lecture on foreign policy when she angrily challenges Britain’s participation in the Iraq war. Throughout most of the movie Tessa is shown in flashbacks; she has been murdered in the Kenyan wilderness, where she traveled with a Belgian doctor of African ancestry (Hubert Koundé) to help fight poverty and disease. Danny Huston plays Justin’s colleague, and Bill Nighy is a villain in this tale about the evils lurking in multinational corporations and the Western governments that enable them. “It may be best to take the cloak-and-dagger elements of ‘The Constant Gardener,’ and the vision of justice with which it concludes, as metaphors, symbolic crystallizations of a reality too complex and diffuse to be dramatized by more empirical means,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Justin Quayle, then, is an allegorical figure, an emblem of timid virtue roused to heroic action by the discovery of his own complicity with evil.”

Though Gil wakes up each morning in the present, he spends his nights consorting with F. Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston), Salvador Dalí (Adrien Brody) and a beguiling beauty (Marion Cotillard), delighting in the glamour described as “a moveable feast” by Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll). The film, for which Mr. Allen won an Oscar for best original screenplay, “is marvelously romantic, even though — or precisely because — it acknowledges the disappointment that shadows every genuine expression of romanticism,” A. O. Scott wrote in The Times.

If those tests are clear, Nestle could return its noodles to India's shelves, lawyers involved in the case said.
Nestle withdrew the noodles from Indian stores in June after the worst packaged food scare in a decade, but the company has consistently disputed regulators' findings, saying its own tests proved the noodles are safe.    
Lawyers acting for the food safety regulator said they would now appeal to the Supreme Court within six weeks.
Separately, the government earlier this week filed a lawsuit against Nestle's Indian unit, seeing $99 million in damages on behalf of consumers, citing unfair trade practices and the sale of defective goods.

Documents challenge Clinton claim no classified intel on personal emails,fox,"

						Secretary of State Hillary Clinton used her personal email account to handle high level negotiations in 2011 for a no-fly zone to help topple Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi, according to a series of emails obtained by Fox News, challenging her claim the private server did not hold classified information. 
The emails, linked here, conflict with Clinton's statement that she did not put national security at risk by using a personal account. 
""I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material,""  Clinton, now a candidate for president, told reporters in March. ""I'm certainly well-aware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material."" 
That claim was hard to test because emails released by the State Department are heavily blacked out. But an email chain from March 23, 2011 -- with virtually no redactions -- shows a message for senior administration staff including then Deputy National Security Adviser Denis McDonough, then-Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs William Burns, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, Michele Flournoy among others.  It goes point by point, explaining what Turkey, France and Britain will likely accept in the deal. 
""I think the information in the email is clearly classified. If I were engaged in the negotiation on that subject reporting back to Washington, my reporting cable would be classified,""  former UN Ambassador and Fox News contributor John Bolton said after reading the un-redacted emails. 
""They're dealing with the possible U.S. military operation, sensitive negotiations among NATO partners, talking about U.S. objectives and political arrangements and possible objections to the deal from key partners so all of these at secretary of state level is extraordinarily sensitive.""
 
The email chain also contains exchanges with Clinton aide Jake Sullivan who writes ""I will forward you (Clinton) the Turkish proposal momentarily.""  Clinton responds ""I'm worried that FR (France) and/or the UK know about the Turks idea and want to derail it."" 
As the negotiations for a no-fly zone continue, Sullivan notifies Clinton that then-deputy chief of mission Christopher Stevens, who was later killed in the 2012 Benghazi attack, was moving into eastern Libya. 
""At that time of course, the country was in chaos, so the situation was very dangerous. His mission was quite sensitive to link up to the opposition,""  Bolton said.  ""And just having that information floating around …would obviously expose Stevens and others to great peril."" 
While the first email in the chain is marked ""UNCLASSIFIED,"" based on his experience as ambassador to the UN, Bolton said he suspects a lot of intelligence was pushed out as unclassified to accommodate her separate, private system. 
""It's not simply the effect on Secretary Clinton's own email. It's pervasive throughout the higher levels of the department, which simply magnifies the risk."" Bolton added.Catherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C.

Oil Drops to Six-Year Lows,wsj,"Oil prices fell to a fresh six-year low Wednesday after data showed a surprise increase in U.S. stockpiles, adding to a massive glut of crude around the globe.
Light, sweet crude for September delivery dropped $1.27, or 3%, to $41.35 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The September contract expires Thursday and the more actively traded October contract was down $1.27, or 3%, at $41.85 a barrel. U.S. oil fell as low as $41.18 a barrel, the lowest intraday price since March 4, 2009.
Brent, the global benchmark, fell 94 cents, or 1.9%, to $47.87 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe.
More than half of the losses for the day came in just 15 minutes after the U.S. Energy Information Administration released its official data on oil stockpiles. It showed crude stocks rose by 2.6 million barrels last week compared with analysts’ expectations for a 1.1 million-barrel fall.
That “got everybody by surprise,” said Scott Shelton, broker at  ICAP

 PLC. “I don’t see anything good in this report.”
The oil-and-gas boom from U.S. shale production has helped flood the market and sink oil prices by about 60% from their 2014 highs. Daily production did fall during the week ended Aug. 14, but by only 0.5%, according to EIA.
At 9.3 million barrels a day, U.S. output is on track to be the highest since 1972. Global exporters have also ramped up production to compete with U.S. shale, a trend continuing in full force. Imports grew by 6.1% for the week to 7.6 million barrels a day, EIA said. That gives credence to recent reports showing Saudi Arabia has increased its exports by 430,000 barrels a day, Mr. Shelton said.
Oversupply is estimated to be between 500,000 and three million barrels a day world-wide, and many market observers now expect that to linger for longer than what was once commonly anticipated.
The latest data has only confirmed that fear and exacerbated a selloff that has put oil in a bear market for the summer, said Dean Hazelcorn, trader at the brokerage Coquest Inc. in Dallas.
“The market’s been given zero reason to buy,” he added.
Domestic crude inventories rose to 456.2 million barrels last week, up from 453.6 million barrels last week, the EIA said. The EIA’s weekly production figures are based on a statistical model, not reported production.
“While a renewed decline in drilling activity might provide some support for prices, at best they are only likely to grind a little higher over the next few years,” analysts at Capital Economics said in a note to clients.
Gasoline stockpiles fell by 2.7 million barrels. Analysts had expected gasoline supplies to fall by 1.4 million barrels. Gasoline futures extended losses to 3.4% to $1.5906 a gallon.
Diesel supplies rose by 594,000 barrels, less than the 1.2-million-barrel increase that analysts had expected. Diesel futures extended losses to 1.7% to $1.5328 a gallon.

"Uncommon form of heart attack likely runs in family, study finds",fox,"			
			 
						
						
							
						
					
						
					NEW YORK –  Although oncologists increasingly distinguish breast, lung, and other cancers by their molecular drivers, cardiologists have lagged behind in efforts to do something similar for heart disease.

A study published on Monday could help remedy that: Researchers have found evidence of a genetic basis for an enigmatic kind of heart attack that preferentially strikes young women.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT

The discovery could help cardiology embrace ""precision medicine,"" in which illnesses that seem alike turn out to differ in their underlying mechanisms. Just as breast cancers driven by one mutation need different chemotherapy than those driven by another, many heart attacks likely have different causes and so need different treatment.

""The key to precision medicine will be splitting instead of lumping diseases together,"" said cardiologist Joseph Loscalzo of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. ""If we subcategorize patients, we should get better responses to therapy"" than with one-size-fits-all approaches.

In the new study, in JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers at the Mayo Clinic combed a registry of patients who had suffered spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), in which one layer of a coronary artery splits off from another like cheap laminate. Blood seeps out between the arterial layers, starving the heart of oxygen and causing chest pain.

If not treated quickly, it can cause heart attack and sometimes death.

Once considered rare, SCAD in fact causes up to one-third of heart attacks in women under 50. But it frequently goes unrecognized.

That is a problem because treatment for common heart attack - clearing arterial blockages - can worsen SCAD. Some 30 percent to 40 percent of SCADs should be left to heal on their own, said Mayo's Dr. Sharonne Hayes, who led the study.

She and colleagues identified five pairs of relatives, including first cousins, with SCAD. It is the first evidence that at least some SCAD is genetic, a step toward identifying the relevant DNA.

One of the cousins was about to undergo a procedure to clear what doctors assumed was a blocked artery. A physician suddenly realized that her symptoms and profile resembled another young woman: She died when the blockage-clearing procedure fatally injured her SCAD-damaged artery. The procedure was canceled and the cousin recovered on her own.

Doctors should be aware, Hayes said, that women without standard risk factors for heart attack, such as elevated cholesterol, but with a female relative who had a heart attack before age 50 may be at risk for SCAD.",0.021609213187438959,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.0054070629151492886, u'mexico': 0.014857438169519607, u'abortion': 0.019223327227092083, u'immigration': 0.015051593855594932, u'trade': 0.012854371187518907, u'campaign_finance': 0.0084702907715004851, u'other': 0.40766665300644461, u'china': 0.018786039715486296, u'military': 0.01115062070155309, u'terrorism': 0.019928539109512724, u'economy': 0.010471567616783226, u'health': 0.012087269693828335, u'women': 0.44404522603001617}"
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker officially enters 2016 presidential race,cnn," (CNN)Scott Walker, the political phenomenon who rose to national fame by taking on unions in one of the most blue-collar states, tweeted Monday morning confirming that he'll seek the Republican nomination for president, just hours ahead of his in-person announcement.
""I'm in. I'm running for president because Americans deserve a leader who will fight and win for them,"" Walker tweeted, signing the message with his initials ""SW,"" indicating it was written by him and not his staff. 
Walker also put out a video Monday morning, outlining his political history and why he thinks he would be the best candidate to be president. 
His Monday afternoon event in Waukesha, Wisconsin, will be a remarkable political milestone for the 47-year-old second-term governor, who vaulted from the obscurity of the Milwaukee County executive to the top tier of a presidential campaign, thanks in large part to a historic gubernatorial recall effort that nearly ended his career in 2012.
In his first foray into a presidential campaign, Walker -- one of the most recognizable and polarizing governors in the country -- has emerged as a potentially formidable opponent to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Recent polling has shown Walker as one of the major contenders in the presidential race, competing closely with Bush and other prominent Republicans both nationally and in the early presidential states.
Although Walker waited to launch his White House bid until the end of the legislative session in his home state, he has been laying down the groundwork for a national campaign for months. The union-busting governor has been courting donors, traveling overseas and boosting his national profile by publicly tussling with President Barack Obama on issues like the nuclear deal with Iran.
The next several months will be a critical test for Walker. After his campaign announcement, the governor will crisscross the country, presenting himself to voters in Nevada, South Carolina, New Hampshire and Iowa.

A few months after taking office in 2011, Walker signed a measure to curb collective bargaining rights for most public employees in the state, framing it as an effort to take on the ""big government special interests"" and give power back to Wisconsin taxpayers.
The move triggered fierce backlash from labor unions and their progressive allies, sparking massive protests at the state capitol in Madison.
Conservatives in Wisconsin and around the country came to Walker's defense, helping the governor withstand a recall effort in 2012. Walker went on to win re-election by six points in 2014, his third statewide victory in four years.
It is that recall experience, more than any other, that has helped lay the groundwork for Walker's presidential bid. At the time, Walker said his recall victory proved that ""voters really do want leaders who stand up and make the tough decisions.""
That is a message that Walker has promoted in recent months while exploring a presidential campaign, calling on the Republican Party to look for ""fresh leadership"" and someone with ""big, bold ideas and the courage to act on it.""
Veteran GOP strategist Kevin Madden, who served as a senior adviser to Mitt Romney's presidential campaign in 2012, says Walker's union-busting efforts helped him to burnish his conservative credentials by demonstrating his ability to taken on ""the national [Democratic]establishment"" and beat them on three consecutive occasions.

Beyond his record as governor, Walker's Midwestern roots will be an invaluable asset in the GOP nominating fight -- Wisconsin voters haven't picked a Republican for president since 1984.
Walker is poised to make the case that his candidacy could put other Great Lakes states on the electoral map that have been out of reach for Republicans in recent cycles, including Michigan and Pennsylvania, which haven't voted for the GOP nominee since 1988.
""The path for a Republican to win the presidency comes through the Midwest,"" Walker told a crowd in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in April. ""It comes from Iowa and Wisconsin and Michigan and Ohio and we're even going to include Pennsylvania because they're part of the Big Ten,"" he added.
Walker also has a personal narrative that could enable him to appeal to low-income voters, a group Republicans lost overwhelmingly in 2008 and 2012, with the struggles in the latter campaign fueled in part by Mitt Romney's ""47 percent"" comments.
Walker is the son of a Baptist minister and an Eagle Scout, who attended Marquette University for three years before dropping out to take a job with the Red Cross. Walker has taken to citing his humble beginnings during recent appearances, setting up a contrast between his background and that of one of his key 2016 rivals -- Bush.
""I realize unlike some out there I didn't inherit fame or fortune from my family,"" Walker said during a speech to a Christian broadcasters convention in February. ""I got a bunch of things that were a whole lot better than that. I got from my parents and my grandparents the belief that if you work hard and you play by the rules, here in America you can do and be anything you want.""

Walker  has already experienced challenges that come with being thrust into the national spotlight in the months leading up to his campaign's official launch.
Unlike some of his peers in the Republican field like Bush, who lived through the White House campaigns of his father and brother, or former 2012 presidential candidates Rick Perry or Rick Santorum, Walker is facing head-on for the first time the reality of just how much scrutiny comes with a presidential campaign.
And it's shown.
Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Walker raised eyebrows when he seemed to compare the task of fighting ISIS to taking on thousands of protesters in his state.
Earlier
 that month, a trip to London resulted in a slew of unflattering headlines when Walker, despite his best efforts to avoid making news during the overseas trip, punted on a question about the theory of evolution.
In March, several news outlets, including CNN, reported that at a private gathering in New Hampshire, Walker had endorsed a pathway for citizenship for undocumented immigrants. This would have marked a notable reversal for Walker who had staked out a more conservative position on the divisive issue, and pundits were quick to suggest that the governor had flip flopped.
Joe McQuaid, publisher of the New Hampshire Union Leader whose office is a must-visit early state stop for presidential candidates, remarked at the time that the controversy surrounding Walker's reported immigration remarks showed that this is the governor's ""first time outside of Wisconsin.""
""It is a guy in his first presidential campaign trying to get himself grounded and see where he needs to be nuanced,"" McQuaid said in a recent interview. ""He hasn't dealt with these issues on a regular basis.""

Walker could give Bush a run for his money.
Over the past few months, the governor has made aggressive overtures to wealthy financiers and prominent Republican donors, presenting himself as a conservative alternative to others in the field.
Bush's extensive fundraising network, founded on decades-old family friendships, will be difficult to compete with. But in the earliest stages of the campaign, Walker's political action committee, Our American Revival, has boasted impressive commitments and donations from prominent donors and bundlers in fundraising epicenters like New York, California and Texas.
And it's not just deep-pocketed donors that Walker is banking on.
The recall fight that made the governor a national figure could be a boon for his fundraising efforts among small-dollar donors.
Walker raised more than $30 million for the recall campaign, which helped him grow his donor to list to some 300,000 supporters. Walker and his supporters say they're eager to win over a new generation of donors.
""Our donor is not the tried and true Republican donor in New York City that's given to everybody since Reagan, Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of the investment firm SkyBridge Capital who is raising money for Walker, told CNN earlier this month. ""We don't have the mercenary donor that's paying for past political favors.""

Ex-'Real Housewives of Orange County' star Lydia McLaughlin: Reality TV is bad for families,fox,"			
			 
							
							
								   					
							
						
						NEW YORK –  Former ""Real Housewives of Orange County"" star Lydia McLaughlin left the world of reality television for the sake of her family. Her new book, ""Beyond Orange County"" discusses the downsides of putting her personal life on camera, and how her ‘Housewives’ friendships were fleeting post fame.

FOX411: You said you decided to leave the show but some insiders said it was not your choice. You were never asked back. What is the real deal?
Lydia McLaughlin: Well, I was asked to come back. I just decided not to. I don’t know why that would be controversial or anything like that. I guess people can’t believe that someone would walk away from it but I definitely was asked to come back, and it was a really hard decision for me.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT

FOX411: What was the reason you left the show?
McLaughlin: Filming got harder and harder. Then, on the reunion show just seeing Brianna and Vicki because I am so close with my mom so I obviously really related to a mother/daughter on TV as entertainment but it’s still a real relationship, and they got into a big battle in the middle of the reunion, and they were just fighting. I remember thinking, 'Why am I here? I don’t have to be here right now.' So I felt inside the Lord telling me to get up and leave. So, I just got up and I walked out of the shot.

FOX411: Are you still in touch with any of your former cast members?
McLaughlin: I am. Gretchen (Rossi) and Alexis (Bellino) both read my book and came to my party for my party. So, I’m still good friends with the two of them but pretty much once I said I wasn’t going to do the show the text messages from all the other girls were gone. I was friends with them because I was a housewife and when I didn’t have that any more I think I wasn’t worthy to be their friend.

FOX411: Do you think it is possible to have fame, family and fame altogether?
McLaughlin: I do. I think it’s possible. I think right now I have that. I definitely get recognized so I’m famous, and I love my family. I just had a baby so I have three little boys. There is a balance with that. The more famous that you get the harder that can become. For me, I did have to choose at a certain point and who knows may be in two years I’ll be a housewife again. Who knows? But right now it’s just not for me.

FOX411: Do you know Kim Richards? 
McLaughlin: I’m friends with her sister Kyle. Watching the reunion I had to turn it off. It’s one thing as entertainment but once you’ve been on it you know that it’s real and seeing that there’s so much drama in that relationship that it was hard for me to watch it. These people become your friends. They’re not just people you see on TV they are people that are a part of your life so it’s not entertainment it’s real drama. It’s hard to be around and stomach. I wish Kim the best and hope that she can read my book, and may be find the Lord. 

FOX411: Do you have any thoughts on Richards' recent arrest?
McLaughlin: I just feel bad for her and her family. May be she needs to take a step away from the cameras because I think that would be good for her because honestly it’s so much pressure, and I can’t imagine if you’re dealing with an addiction or anything like that she needs to take care of herself. I’m hope she can choose that over fame.Diana Falzone is a FoxNews.com reporter. You can follow her on Twitter @dianafalzone.

				KATHMANDU, Nepal –  Despite dire need by millions, earthquake-hit Nepal on Sunday was forced to close its only international airport to big airplanes flying in relief supplies and aid workers because the only runway can't handle the strain of the stream of large aircraft flying in to help. 
Medium and small-size jets will still be allowed to land, officials said. 
It is only the latest complication in global efforts to aid people suffering in the wake of the April 25 quake, the impoverished country's biggest and most destructive in eight decades. 
People in Nepal — both in remote villages and the capital, Kathmandu — have complained about not seeing any rescue workers or international aid and about a lack of temporary shelters, with many sleeping out in the open because of fears of aftershocks bringing down their damaged homes. 
Birendra Shrestha, the manager of Tribhuwan International Airport, located on the outskirts of Kathmandu, said bigger planes were banned because the runway was deteriorating. The runway was built to handle only medium-size jetliners and not the large military and cargo planes that have been flying to the airport since the magnitude-7.8 earthquake struck, he said. 
The last week has seen a steady procession of big jets trying to fly in goods and relief workers, as well as a swarm of journalists, but the small airport has parking slots for only nine jets and only one runway.
 
There have been reports of cracks on the runway and other problems at the only international airport in Nepal and the only one capable of handling jetliners. 
One week after the quake, aid has been slow in reaching those who need it most. In many places, it has not come at all. 
U.N. humanitarian officials said Saturday that they were increasingly worried about the spread of disease. They said more helicopters were needed to reach isolated mountain villages that were hard to access even before the quake. 
The true extent of the damage from the earthquake is still unknown as reports keep filtering in from remote areas, some of which remain entirely cut off. The U.N. says the quake affected 8.1 million people — more than a quarter of Nepal's 28 million people. 
The government said Sunday that the quake had killed 7,040 people. Laxi Dhakal, a Home Ministry official, said hopes of finding survivors had faded dramatically. ""Unless they were caught in an air pocket, there is not much possibility,"" he said. 
Nepal has been shaken by more than 70 aftershocks following the quake, and its people remain on edge. One brief aftershock Saturday afternoon shook the only paved road in the village of Pauwathok. Residents screamed and began to run, then stopped when the tremor eased. 
The small village is located in the district of Sindupalchok, where more deaths have been recorded than anywhere else in Nepal — 2,560, compared to 1,622 in Kathmandu. The U.N. says up to 90 percent of the houses in Sindupalchok have been destroyed.",0.042502913575575944,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.0083168613040973532, u'mexico': 0.082451265670933749, u'abortion': 0.012397477202811811, u'immigration': 0.012848112130566858, u'trade': 0.051432232441979864, u'campaign_finance': 0.010191099849864467, u'other': 0.62420721921581124, u'china': 0.063046944895490786, u'military': 0.035118982624157011, u'terrorism': 0.034769183483833836, u'economy': 0.019775017792282752, u'health': 0.020037254218751285, u'women': 0.025408349169419139}"

John Ondrasik of Five For Fighting has kindly fielded zany questions from ""this guy"" (I'm pointing to myself while simultaneously finishing this sentence) for a few months now as part A-Sides' 5 for Fighting with Five for Fighting, and it's been a joy.  No ""high sticking"" from this talented musician, each Q&A is fun and as pleasant as a summer breeze. So as you read this while sitting in your bathtub filled with Calgon, take in all of the words this man says. Like his music, his answers are moving, and chart-topping. The latter analogy didn't work. Anyway, read on! It's 5 for Fighting: May Edition.
Nickelback take a lot of crap, but let's face it they're no punchline. They're as rock as rock gets, and have had legs in a fish business (you know because fish have no legs... neither did Lt. Dan), and they've sold more records (multi-platinum baby!) than any artist could dream of. I caught up with bassist Mike Kroger and chatted about the band, its 60-plus mega-headlining tour of North America, and the impressive array of opening acts they have on tap for the tour including Pop Evil and Lifehouse.  Before we jump right into the interview, think about it this way: Nickelback are on their No Fixed Address  tour for five-plus more months - having kicked it all off on Valentine's Day. That's insane. I can't even commit to five minutes of my time. Secondly, to paint a proverbial picture - ""look at this photograph"" if you will - the band's eighth studio album crushed it - spawning the hit ""Edge Of A Revolution,"" and the mega-fantastic ""What Are You Waiting For?"" Sense a theme? Mega. This band is mega so suck it haters.

   As a young U.S. Army soldier during World War II, Rollins Edwards knew better than to refuse an assignment.   When officers led him and a dozen others into a wooden gas chamber and locked the door, he didn't complain. None of them did. Then, a mixture of mustard gas and a similar agent called lewisite was piped inside.   ""It felt like you were on fire,"" recalls Edwards, now 93 years old. ""Guys started screaming and hollering and trying to break out. And then some of the guys fainted. And finally they opened the door and let us out, and the guys were just, they were in bad shape.""   
            About This Investigation
      
                  
                        This is Part 1 of a two-part investigation on mustard gas testing conducted by the U.S. military during World War II. The second story in this report will examine the failures by the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide benefits to those injured by military mustard gas experiments.
         
         

      
      

   
   

   Edwards was one of 60,000 enlisted men enrolled in a once-secret government program — formally declassified in 1993 — to test mustard gas and other chemical agents on American troops. But there was a specific reason he was chosen: Edwards is African-American.   ""They said we were being tested to see what effect these gases would have on black skins,"" Edwards says.   An NPR investigation has found evidence that Edwards' experience was not unique. While the Pentagon admitted decades ago that it used American troops as test subjects in experiments with mustard gas, until now, officials have never spoken about the tests that grouped subjects by race.   For the first time, NPR tracked down some of the men used in the race-based experiments. And it wasn't just African-Americans. Japanese-Americans were used as test subjects, serving as proxies for the enemy so scientists could explore how mustard gas and other chemicals might affect Japanese troops. Puerto Rican soldiers were also singled out.

   White enlisted men were used as scientific control groups. Their reactions were used to establish what was ""normal,"" and then compared to the minority troops.   All of the World War II experiments with mustard gas were done in secret and weren't recorded on the subjects' official military records. Most do not have proof of what they went through. They received no follow-up health care or monitoring of any kind. And they were sworn to secrecy about the tests under threat of dishonorable discharge and military prison time, leaving some unable to receive adequate medical treatment for their injuries, because they couldn't tell doctors what happened to them.   Army Col. Steve Warren, director of press operations at the Pentagon, acknowledged NPR's findings and was quick to put distance between today's military and the World War II experiments.   ""The first thing to be very clear about is that the Department of Defense does not conduct chemical weapons testing any longer,"" he says. ""And I think we have probably come as far as any institution in America on race. ... So I think particularly for us in uniform, to hear and see something like this, it's stark. It's even a little bit jarring.""   NPR shared the findings of this investigation with Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., a member of the Congressional Black Caucus who sits on a House subcommittee for veterans affairs. She points to similarities between these tests and the Tuskegee syphilis experiments, where U.S. government scientists withheld treatment from black sharecroppers in Alabama to observe the disease's progression.   ""I'm angry. I'm very sad,"" Lee says. ""I guess I shouldn't be shocked when you look at the syphilis studies and all the other very terrible experiments that have taken place as it relates to African-Americans and people of color. But I guess I'm still shocked that, here we go again.""

   Lee says the U.S. government needs to recognize the men who were used as test subjects while it can still reach some, who are now in their 80s and 90s.   ""We owe them a huge debt, first of all. And I'm not sure how you repay such a debt,"" she says.   Mustard gas damages DNA within seconds of making contact. It causes painful skin blisters and burns, and it can lead to serious, and sometimes life-threatening illnesses including leukemia, skin cancer, emphysema and asthma.   In 1991, federal officials for the first time admitted that the military conducted mustard gas experiments on enlisted men during World War II.   According to declassified records and reports published soon after, three types of experiments were done: Patch tests, where liquid mustard gas was applied directly onto test subjects' skin; field tests, where subjects were exposed to gas outdoors in simulated combat settings; and chamber tests, where men were locked inside gas chambers while mustard gas was piped inside.   Even once the program was declassified, however, the race-based experiments remained largely a secret until a researcher in Canada disclosed some of the details in 2008. Susan Smith, a medical historian at the University of Alberta in Canada, published an article in The Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics.

   In it, she suggested that black and Puerto Rican troops were tested in search of an ""ideal chemical soldier."" If they were more resistant, they could be used on the front lines while white soldiers stayed back, protected from the gas.   The article received little media attention at the time, and the Department of Defense didn't respond.   Despite months of federal records requests, NPR still hasn't been given access to hundreds of pages of documents related to the experiments, which could provide confirmation of the motivations behind them. Much of what we know about the experiments has been provided by the remaining living test subjects.   Juan Lopez Negron, who's Puerto Rican, says he was involved in experiments known as the San Jose Project.   Military documents show more than 100 experiments took place on the Panamanian island, chosen for its climate, which is similar to islands in the Pacific. Its main function, according to military documents obtained by NPR, was to gather data on ""the behavior of lethal chemical agents.""   Lopez Negron, now 95 years old, says he and other test subjects were sent out to the jungle and bombarded with mustard gas sprayed from U.S. military planes flying overhead.   ""We had uniforms on to protect ourselves, but the animals didn't,"" he says. ""There were rabbits. They all died.""   Lopez Negron says he and the other soldiers were burned and felt sick almost immediately.   ""I spent three weeks in the hospital with a bad fever. Almost all of us got sick,"" he says.   Edwards says that crawling through fields saturated with mustard gas day after day as a young soldier took a toll on his body.   
            
                  
    


    
        
            Rollins Edwards, who lives in Summerville, S.C., shows one of his many scars from exposure to mustard gas in World War II military experiments.

For years, he carried around a jar full of the flakes to try to convince people of what happened to him.

   ""It took all the skin off your hands. Your hands just rotted,"" he says. He never refused or questioned the experiments as they were occurring. Defiance was unthinkable, he says, especially for black soldiers.   ""You do what they tell you to do and you ask no questions,"" he says.   Edwards constantly scratches at the skin on his arms and legs, which still break out in rashes in the places he was burned by chemical weapons more than 70 years ago.   During outbreaks, his skin falls off in flakes that pile up on the floor. For years, he carried around a jar full of the flakes to try to convince people of what he went through.   But while Edwards wanted people to know what happened to him, others — like Louis Bessho — didn't like to talk about it.   His son, David Bessho, first learned about his father's participation as a teenager. One evening, sitting in the living room, David Bessho asked his dad about an Army commendation hanging on the wall. David Bessho, who's now retired from the Army, says the award stood out from several others displayed beside it.   ""Generally, they're just kind of generic about doing a good job,"" he says. ""But this one was a bit unusual.""   The commendation, presented by the Office of the Army's Chief of the Chemical Warfare Service, says: ""These men participated beyond the call of duty by subjecting themselves to pain, discomfort, and possible permanent injury for the advancement of research in protection of our armed forces.""   Attached was a long list of names. Where Louis Bessho's name appears on Page 10, the list begins to take on a curious similarity. Names like Tanamachi, Kawasaki, Higashi, Sasaki. More than three dozen Japanese-American names in a row.   ""They were interested in seeing if chemical weapons would have the same effect on Japanese as they did on white people,"" Bessho says his father told him that evening. ""I guess they were contemplating having to use them on the Japanese.""

   Documents that were released by the Department of Defense in the 1990s show the military developed at least one secret plan to use mustard gas offensively against the Japanese. The plan, which was approved by the Army's highest chemical warfare officer, could have ""easily kill[ed] 5 million people.""   Japanese-American, African-American and Puerto Rican troops were confined to segregated units during World War II. They were considered less capable than their white counterparts, and most were assigned jobs accordingly, such as cooking and driving dump trucks.   Susan Matsumoto says her husband, Tom, who died in 2004 of pneumonia, told his wife that he was OK with the testing because he felt it would help ""prove he was a good United States citizen.""   Matsumoto remembers FBI agents coming to her family's home during the war, forcing them to burn their Japanese books and music to prove their loyalty to the U.S. Later, they were sent to live at an internment camp in Arkansas.   Matsumoto says her husband faced similar scrutiny in the military, but despite that, he was a proud American.   ""He always loved his country,"" Matsumoto says. ""He said, 'Where else can you find this kind of place where you have all this freedom?'

UK court orders arrest of Nicaraguans for non-payment of ADM rice,reuters,"* More than 6,500 tonnes of rice in dispute
* Court imposes jail terms of up to 18 months
By David Brough
LONDON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - London's High Court has issued an
arrest order against the owner and a senior officer of a
Nicaraguan grains business for failing to pay millions of
dollars owed to commodities house Archer Daniels Midland 
for rice imports, ADM and court papers said.
The case highlights a trend in which falling commodity
prices have led to an increase in requests through courts for
worldwide asset-freezing orders against companies that have not
met the terms of their sales contracts.
Some lawyers in London say applying for such orders from the
English High Court has become more common as commodities
companies, among others, use this mechanism as a key weapon in a
creditor's armoury against defaulting counterparties.
A dozen worldwide freezing order and contempt cases have
been heard by the London High Court over the last couple of
years, these lawyers say.
In the ADM case, over 6,500 metric tonnes of U.S.-origin
rice was shipped to the importer, Corcosa - Corporacion
Comercializadora de Granos Basicos, in 2011 and 2012, under six
sale contracts in dispute.
Each of those contracts is governed by English law and
subject to arbitration by London-based GAFTA - the Grain and
Feed Trade Association.
ADM spokeswoman Jackie Anderson said, ""On July 21, ADM and
its subsidiary ADM Rice, Inc. obtained sanctions from the UK
High Court in London against a Nicaraguan company named
Corporación Comercializadora de Granos Básicos (""Corcosa""); its
owner and president, Enrique Jose Delgadillo Aguirre; and Mr.
Delgadillo's daughter and the executive director of the company,
Vanessa Auxiliadora Delgadillo Sacasa.""
The court imposed prison sentences of up to 18 months on
Enrique and Vanessa Delgadillo after it found they had
disregarded its orders, Anderson said.
The move followed a 2014 arbitration award in which the
GAFTA Tribunal in London determined that Corcosa and the
Delgadillos had misappropriated $2.5 million in rice shipped to
Nicaragua by ADM, lawyers close to the case said.
Court papers seen by Reuters confirmed the sanctions against
Enrique and Vanessa Delgadillo.
A source close to ADM said Corcosa had not engaged with the
court so no defence was filed. Reuters could not independently
confirm this.
Reuters visited Corcosa's registered address in Managua but
was unable to locate the family. Attempts by Reuters to contact
lawyers for Corcosa and Enrique and Vanessa Delgadillo were
unsuccessful.
Nicaragua's Chamber of Commerce said its files on the
company had not been updated for two years, and that it did not
know whether Corcosa remained in business.
Previously, Corcosa had paid for rice it received from ADM.
ADM is studying options for executing the arrest warrants in
Britain, the United States or other countries, and for seizing
assets belonging to Corcosa or the Delgadillo family, Anderson
said.
Christopher Swart of Holman Fenwick Willan, ADM's lawyers,
called the case ""another example of the English courts'
willingness to engage in international disputes where a link to
this jurisdiction can be established"".

Why Working Mothers Need Resilience,huffpo,"Author. Speaker. Mentor. Philanthropist.CEO & Founder of Sue Davey International, Mastermind Success Coaching, Brainy Child Education
Have you ever had one of those days that start off ok, but before long, the wheels fall off? A client, a colleague or your boss all need your time urgently, your computer crashes, and then your kid's school calls to tell you there's been an accident and you need to come right away. In rising panic and extreme frustration, you rush out, only to end up in a massive traffic jam caused by a downed tree. You can relate to the unlucky, fallen tree.
Resilience is a key component to success and effective performance, as I explain in my upcoming book Reboot Your Mind: Seven Steps to Success for Mumpreneurs and Working Mothers. Resilience is also the key to personal growth and development. As much as we like predictability -- it gives us a sense of control -- the fact is that life doesn't always run smoothly. For example, you expect your children to develop in the usual stages, but they can still get sick, get upset with a friend, have a brush with a teacher, etc. Similarly, you can get sick, get upset with a client at work or have a brush with a colleague. All of this could happen on the same day. The healthiest mindset is to recognize and accept this and NOT be fazed by that dynamic.
We don't live in a fixed state -- all aspects of our lives are subject to constant change. The ability to deal with that change is critical. If you're not mindful of the realities of change, when it comes you are going to be overwhelmed and stressed. And in an online study of more than 6,000 women I recently conducted (1), that's exactly what I found the majority of working mothers complaining about.
As a working mother, you need to be ready for anything. This may sound like hard work -- and it can be, at times. However, the latest neuroscience suggests challenge and hard work are actually good for you. One study showed that monkeys who had to work very hard to find food demonstrated much greater brain development than monkeys who were simply given the food. Sure, there are days when you wish you didn't feel like a hungry monkey in an experiment, but well... some days are like that. And while it may seem like a pain at the time, making a few extra neural connections is worth the hassle. Doing this consistently is likely to significantly preserve your brain function, as well as develop your adaptability.
Adapting to the unexpected is also critical because our worlds have grown so much through technology, exponentially increasing the risk of a surprise. For example, 50 years ago if an elderly parent needed something, you might not know until they caught you at home on the phone or a letter arrived in the mail a few days later. Now they can text you instantaneously. Everyone can reach you all the time, if you let them. In a more complex world, decisions need to be made about priorities for focus and attention, a useful lesson induced by the need to be adaptive and resilient.
Developing and demonstrating resilience is also a great lesson for your kids.  They will grow up in an even faster changing world, so learning to adapt is even more critical for their success.
If you're a working mother, you know that ""this happens""... or something like that. When the unexpected strikes, breathe to control your emotions, which in turn will allow you to develop a plan to tackle the immediate issues. And if you have time, recognize the fact that adapting to the unexpected and the difficult will make you -- and your brain -- stronger.
I share my top success strategies, especially for working mothers, in great detail in my upcoming book Reboot Your Mind: 7 Steps to Success for Mumpreneurs and Working Mothers, which will be coming out later in 2015. I hope you'll subscribe to this blog to read more helpful tips and learn when the book comes out.

Japan's REIT market gets the 'death cross',reuters,"GRAPHIC: Japan REIT Index: link.reuters.com/qyj25w
By Tomo Uetake
TOKYO, July 13 (Reuters) - A ""death cross"" has formed over
Japanese real estate investment trusts (REITs) for the first
time in Shinzo Abe's 2 1/2-year reign as prime minister,
fuelling speculation a bear market is imminent and equities are
about to get hit.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange's REIT index plunged to an
eight-month low last week, causing its 20-day moving average to
fall below the 200-day moving average and creating the so-called
death cross on technical charts. Large sell orders, most likely
from Japanese investors, were the main culprit behind the fall,
a trader said.
The REIT index has lost as much as 10 percent this month,
and has surrendered all its gains since the central bank
surprised markets with additional stimulus in late October. The
stimulus included a tripling of the Bank of Japan's purchases of
REITs.
The REIT decline suggests an increasingly cautious outlook
for Japan's property market, where real estate values have risen
but rents have not. That spells potential trouble for Abe's
economic policies, which aim to reflate the world's
second-biggest economy through asset price appreciation.
""When REITs fall, stocks often tend to follow them. So it is
not a good sign for stocks as well,"" said Hiroshi Ono, manager
of equity investment at Sumitomo Insurance. Indeed, in 2007, the
REIT index peaked out two months before a separate high in the
Nikkei 225 share average. In 2013, a peak in REITs
arrived about two months before a mini-collapse in the broader
equities market in May.

Straight speed: JGR's engines have other teams playing catch-up,fox,"



SPARTA, KY - JULY 10: Team owner Richard Childress, right, talks with grandson Austin Dillon, driver of the #3 DOW Styrofoam Chevrolet, in the garage area during practice for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Quaker State 400 Presented by Advance Auto Parts at Kentucky Speedway on July 10, 2015 in Sparta, Kentucky. (Photo by Todd Warshaw/Getty Images)


After Saturday's Irwin Tools Night Race at Bristol Motor Speedway, we only have two more races -- Darlington and Richmond -- and then the 2015 NASCAR Chase for the Sprint Cup field is set.
There are teams out there who are desperately trying to get that elusive win, while there are other teams simply trying to hang on in the points and make the field via that route. 
Obviously the Joe Gibbs Racingcars right now are the class of the field.
When I talk to people like Jeff Gordon, Clint Bowyer or Kasey Kahne, they talk about speed. I think everybody is trying to figure out how to make their engines better. What I'm seeing is that no one right now is able to run down the straight-away with those Gibbs cars. 
Obviously Toyota had a slow start to the 2015 season and it was back in the spring that everyone in the garage area, including the Toyota folks themselves, were wondering what was wrong. Obviously they have done their homework and since May to the present, they have really come on like gangbusters. 
They now have plenty of power off the corners. They are able to maintain speed in the corners and their straightaway speeds are blistering. No matter how you look at it, the key component is horsepower. Toyota has it and I think everyone else is playing catch-up. 
Don't get me wrong, we aren't talking about a lot. It might only be 5 miles per hour or 6 mph we are talking about. But with these tapered spacers for 2015 in these engines, those kinds of numbers are huge in the long run that is an entire race. 
So if I'm Hendrick Motorsports, Team Penske, Stewart-Haas, Richard Childress Racing, etc., I'm trying to figure out what we need to do to pick up a little more power between now and when the Chase starts in Chicago the third weekend of September so that we can run door handle-to-door handle with these guys.

6 Ways to Make Men Notice You Online,huffpo,"Chief Love Officer of Delightful.com

Ladies, are you searching for love online and coming up short? Look, men are visual creatures, and they want to see what kind of woman you are inside and out before they date you. Or maybe your inbox is full of emails, but they're not from the right men. Trust me when I tell you that posting the right kind of profile photos can help you find Prince Charming instead of Prince Alarming. With that in mind, here a few things to remember while you're deciding which photos to post:
1. Nothing older than a year, please! He's got to recognize you on that first date based on the photos you've posted of yourself online, so if you change your hairstyle often or recently switched from glasses to contacts, make sure your photos look like you do today. Love the way you looked at your cousin Sonya's wedding last year, but lost a few pounds since then? Great! Go take a new one (it's OK to put that same outfit on again, even if it's a bridesmaid's dress. Your cousin Sonya said you'd wear it again, didn't she?). 
2. You're the star of this show, so leave group photos off of your profile. Look, as soon as he meets your family and all your wonderful friends, he'll know how much everyone else loves you. Do you want to risk him crushing on your sister or coworker while you two are on your first date? Don't worry about him seeing that you're busy all the time and have lots of friends - he should only have eyes for you. No woman wants to be worried about her competition from the jump, so don't take his mind off your beautiful eyes and gorgeous smile. 
3. No bathroom selfies. I shouldn't have to tell you this, but if you're new to online dating, you may not have seen all these shirtless men taking selfies in the gym, their own bathrooms or anywhere else they can find a mirror. If it's upsetting to you, guess what? Men aren't excited to see it, either. Don't have any good recent photos to post? Have a girls' night in, put out some good food and drinks, then have your friends take turns photographing you. Let them do your hair, your makeup, pick out your clothes - with friends, even a chore like this can be fun! Be sure to get some full-body shots as well as clear photos of your face; men care about the whole package, and the right man will love every single inch of you from head to toe. 
4. Variety adds spice to your photos and keeps your profile looking fresh. If you follow tip #3 above, change outfits and settings to show what you love and who you are to any potential date. Love to cook? Take photos in your kitchen, pouring a glass of wine or picking herbs in your garden. Can't imagine life without your dogs? Have a friend follow you to the dog park for some candid shots with you and your four-legged family. Just make sure that the photos you post show you at your best doing things that you enjoy and wearing flattering clothes. And smile!
5. Switch out your photos every couple of weeks. If you've ever run across somebody's photo only to click through and see that you've actually checked this person out before, then you know why changing them up often matters. You may catch someone's eye that passed you up before, and that man could be THE man you've been waiting for - what have you got to lose? Besides, the more active you are online, the more attention you're going to get. It's just a fact. Yeah, you've got that pic where your eye makeup and smile are both really popping - rotate it in and out with a couple of other photos of yourself that you love, and you're good to go. 
6. Absolutely no photos of you with another man, ever! Note that I'm saying ""man"" and not ""boy,"" because of course you can post pics of you and your adorable nephew hunting Easter eggs or taking him Trick-or-Treating in his costume. I'm talking about photos of you sitting on your ex's lap at the beach or with your cousin's arm around you at the family reunion. Yeah, you can say that it's your brother you're hugging in your profile, but do you want to risk men skimming just your pics and assuming the worst? Men don't like to see someone hugged up on you, even if you haven't ""officially"" started dating yet.  Help him keep his eyes firmly on the prize - which is you.

Upon dealing with similar questions as his fellow Floridian, a normally smooth Sen. Marco Rubio stumbled all over his words. Former New York Gov. George Pataki and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina have raised some eyeballs by calling for a substantial increase in ground troops to combat ISIS.  
The reality is that controversial and unpopular wars continue to shape politics long after the conflicts are over. Nobody knows this more than the Democratic Party.
During the first part of the 20th century, President Woodrow Wilson led the nation through the brutal battles of World War I, a complex war that ended with a bitter partisan conflict within the United States over the creation of the League of Nations. The debate pitted Senate Republicans against the commander in chief. Wilson had promised a war to end all wars, but the messy outcome didn't give many people confidence this would be the case. 
For the next two decades, U.S. presidents, including Democrat Franklin Roosevelt, had to govern under the shadow of that war. The political pressure from both parties against any kind of overseas intervention remained intense, one of the biggest obstacles that Roosevelt had to overcome as the threats from Germany and Japan mounted. It also took some time for Democrats to win back progressives in the fold since so many were profoundly disillusioned with Wilson's domestic wartime  record, such as the suppression of civil liberties.
Politics: GOP grapples with ground troops in Iraq
Although the decisive and triumphal victory of the United States and its allies in World War II in the defeat of Germany and Japan seemed to cement the credentials of the Democratic Party on national security, that consensus didn't last long in the world of politics. Democrats saw their political advantage on national security fade quickly as a result of the stalemate in Korea. Republicans used the issue of Korea, combined with the fall of China to communism in 1949, as a battering ram against the Democrats on foreign policy. 
In the 1952 elections, Democrat Adlai Stevenson watched as Republican Dwight Eisenhower won the White House and Republicans took control of Congress with national security being a central theme. In one of his last public speeches before the election, Eisenhower, a military hero, simply stated: ""I shall go to Korea."" The Korean War, he said, was a ""symbol -- a telling symbol -- of the foreign policy of our nation. It has been a sign -- a warning sign -- of the way the administration has conducted our world affairs."" 
There was an entire generation of Democrats scarred by this election, including Sen. Lyndon Johnson, and they would spend much of their time doing everything to avoid falling victim to the attack of being weak on defense.
Those fears helped to push Democrats into a deep commitment to the war in Vietnam, which killed 58,000 members of the U.S. military.  And the unsuccessful outcome of the war in Vietnam was damaging for Democrats for decades to come. 
While liberals within the party believed that the war had been a poor decision and was evidence that military force was often the wrong solution, right-wing conservatives offered a different interpretation. Republicans claimed that Democrats had failed to unleash the nation's full bombing arsenal and had ""cut and run"" in 1973, allowing South Vietnam to fall to communism. 
Republicans used Vietnam as a talking point to build support for a huge military buildup in the 1980s. President Ronald Reagan spoke about Vietnam as a ""noble cause."" He charged that Jimmy Carter had learned the wrong lesson from the war. It was not the case that the United States should avoid using military power but, rather, the nation needed not to be ""afraid"" to ""win."" Democratic presidential candidates always struggled to respond to these charges.
Republicans had some controversial military legacies of their own to reckon with before 9/11. Richard Nixon's brutal and secretive bombing campaign against communist forces in South Asia raised ongoing questions when Republicans were in power about their willingness to circumvent Congress and the public in conducting their policies. 
Reagan's war in Central America exploded in controversy when the Iran-Contra investigation revealed that National  Security Council officials had violated legislative prohibitions against assisting the Nicaraguan Contras and that the president, despite his rhetoric, had sold arms to Iran. When President George H.W. Bush decided he would not send in U.S. forces to take out Saddam Hussein in Operation Desert Storm and when he refused to send U.S. troops to intervene in a number of major humanitarian crises, Democrats such as Bill Clinton accused the GOP of being too timid in using military force. 
Iraq was more problematic politically for the Republicans than any of these precedents. The war opened up the same kind of struggle within the GOP that Democrats had long faced. It has forced Republican politicians to take a stance on whether President George W. Bush committed troops to a war that was both costly and unnecessary. 
It has raised the question of whether regime change was the right way to fight the war on terrorism. It has brought up the issue of whether their party used false intelligence or manipulated information about Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction to build support for a military operation. It has forced Republicans to defend their record on fighting the post-9/11 threat.
In addition, the war has never really ended. On Sunday, U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter offered extremely critical comments about the Iraqi military, describing the fall of Ramadi to ISIS as a sign that the defenders were unwilling to fight.
The battle against ISIS is partly an extension of the processes unleashed by regime change in Iraq and some of the failures to think through the best options for reconstructing a stable government regime to replace Hussein. The fact that the war goes on, even in limited fashion, will continue to push this to the top of the agenda. 
Even though Republicans were in control in Washington when the Iraq War began, it drew backing from Democrats, including their strongest 2016 contender, Hillary Clinton. And the issue of what to do about ISIS means Clinton will have to deal with the Iraq War issue as her candidacy moves ahead.
If history is a guide, which it is, Iraq won't go away anytime soon. Republican candidates will have to wrestle with the legacy of that war for many years to come. The fact that Iraq remains a big issue is not surprising. What is surprising is the fact that so many candidates in the GOP don't seem prepared to put forward their responses. Iraq will remain one of the defining issues in party politics for decades to come.

   (Spoiler alert: Details from the new seasons of several shows follow below.)   HBO's hit fantasy drama Game of Thrones ended last year with the most shocking death of the season: Tywin Lannister's.   Lannister, the most influential power broker in the fictional, medieval-style continent of Westeros, was killed by his son, the tortured alcoholic dwarf Tyrion.   When the show returns with a new episode Sunday night, Tyrion is on the run. The man who is helping him, a scheming spymaster named Varys, wants Tyrion's help.   But Tyrion isn't having it.   ""[I'm] done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me,"" sighs Tyrion, lifting a goblet of wine.   ""You have many admirable qualities,"" Varys counters. ""Self-pity is not one of them. You have your father's instincts for politics. And you have compassion.""   ""Compassion?"" Tyrion sneers. """"I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.""

   ""I never said you were perfect,"" Varys answers.   This is more than a perfect moment between two great characters. It's an example of the well-crafted TV shows HBO often airs to dominate high-quality programming on Sunday nights.   HBO's hit mob drama The Sopranos turned Sundays into a night for quality TV back in 1999, training fans of serious television to expect landmark shows in that time slot.   The strategy made sense. Unveiling a powerful show at the week's start gives fans lots of time to tell friends and workmates around the watercooler about episodes that HBO may air many more times in days to come.   And come Sunday, HBO will debut three shows that might just be the best lineup of quality programs this spring.   Game of Thrones kicks it off with a debut expected to be among the channel's biggest premieres of the year. It unveils a season in which Tywin's death emboldens his enemies, leaving his calculating, grief-stricken daughter Cersei scrambling for power.   In one scene, she castigates her other brother, Jaime, for helping the dwarf escape.   ""Our father is dead, and that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath,"" says Cersei, standing over her father's corpse at his funeral. ""Tyrion may be a monster, but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake; with stupidity.""   What follows is kinda like House of Cards with swords, dragons and religious zealots. No wonder HBO scheduled the start of its stand-alone HBO Now streaming service to coincide with the beginning of the show's fifth season.

   Also returning Sunday: a show that may be the most underrated political satire now on TV — Veep, starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus.   This season, her hapless Vice President Selina Meyer becomes an even more dysfunctional commander-in-chief.   And while shaking hands with applauding legislators before addressing a joint session of Congress, she reveals what politicians might actually be saying during that long walk to the podium.   ""I'm going to get that Philip Roth book back to you,"" she tells one admirer. ""God, I can't even hear myself! Am I talking? It's hard for me to hear me!""   Think House of Cards meets The Three Stooges ... or, maybe just one stooge.   It's easy to mistake this show for a workplace comedy, as Meyer's knuckleheaded staff stumbles into misadventures that make her look like a genius.   But even as Meyer gains the presidency, her struggle to navigate congressional politics — and a mysteriously blank teleprompter — help constitute the perfect parody of Washington.   Sandwiched between Game of Thrones and Veep on HBO Sunday nights is Silicon Valley, a pitch-perfect satire of tech culture from the creator of Office Space and Beavis and Butt-head.   And let's not forget John Oliver's late-night news comedy, Last Week Tonight, which last Sunday aired an interview with NSA leaker Edward Snowden that produced this moment.   ""How much do you miss America?"" Oliver asks Snowden, in an interview conducted in Russia.   ""You know, my country is something that travels with me ..."" Snowden begins, only to have the host cut him off.   ""Well that's already a way too complicated answer,"" Oliver says. ""The answer is: I miss it a lot. It's the greatest country in the world.""   A satirist with smarts, Oliver delivered an interview both Meet the Press and Saturday Night Live could have been proud of.   HBO's competitors, especially at the broadcast networks, will note it is easier to stack up a night of great original shows when you have only a few evenings to fill with programming. And the extra charge for HBO means consumers are paying a significant price for the quality they enjoy.   Still, Sunday's debut of Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley and Veep brings the best lineup on television this spring — helping ensure Sunday's status as ground zero for TV's new golden age.

"‘Mission: Impossible’ takes in $56 million, a sign of demand for sequels",washpo," Tom Cruise’s fifth “Mission: Impossible” film soared in its first weekend, with $56 million in ticket sales, one of the highest-grossing openings this year. Universal has brought in a combined $3 billion globally from “Jurassic World” and “Furious 7,” just two of many hits this year for the comeback studio. And these films may not even compare to the expected monster release of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” in December. This is the year of the big-screen revival, with major and familiar film franchises driving record audiences back into theaters. Like never before, moviegoers are seeing a return of films and beloved characters such as Ethan Hunt of the 19-year-old series “Mission: Impossible,” Han Solo of “Star Wars,” Katniss Everdeen of the “Hunger Games” series, and James Bond, who is now in his 53rd year of action. And so far, U.S. and global audiences are eating up Hollywood’s slate of sequels. For all the hand-wringing over low ticket sales in 2014, the U.S. box office is up 12.5 percent this summer compared with last year, according to data research firm Rentrak. Moviegoing in China is exploding, with the opening of 12 to 13 screens every day; overall ticket sales were up 46 percent in July over the last year. For every blockbuster in the United States, the movies are making far more overseas — sometimes double. Disney’s “Avengers: Age of Ultron” is ranked second in U.S. ticket sales this year, with $457 million, and it made double that amount overseas — a total of nearly $1.4 billion in global ticket sales. It has been harder for some comedies and dramas to capture global audiences. Romantic comedies, in particular, don’t necessarily translate to local cultures. That’s why Hollywood is betting that its long-running movie franchises, comic book series and action adventures will draw the biggest audiences. Four years since the fourth installment in the “Mission: Impossible” franchise was made, “Mission: ­Impossible — Rogue Nation” brought back 53-year-old Cruise to star in a plot to uncover a sophisticated network of rogue agents known as the Syndicate. The movie registered the second-highest opening for the franchise, just behind “Mission: Impossible II,” which made $57 million in its 2000 opening, according to Rentrak. The latest installment “obliterates all expectations and generates a truly impressive $56 million debut. Cruise was on a marketing mission in the past couple of weeks and was truly a tireless advocate for the movie, showing up virtually everywhere to get the word out, and the results are impressive,” said Paul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst at Rentrak. “Mockingjay 2,” the fourth in the “Hunger Games” franchise by Lionsgate, will be released in November and is expected to make more than $800 million globally. Here are some other facts about franchises that might ­surprise you (data from Fandango, Rentrak and BoxOfficeMojo.com):  1. Most prolific. Since super-agent Bond first hit the screen in 1963 with “Dr. No,” there have been a total of 24 Bond movies, with seven actors having essayed the role. The 25th will be released in November, with Daniel Craig playing 007. Tied for second place are the sequels for “Friday the 13th,” Marvel comics-based movies, and “Star Trek” (which has 12 films to its credit).  2. Highest-grossing. The Walt Disney Co. purchase of Marvel Entertainment in 2009 has reaped billions in returns. With a constant churn of 12 films, including “The Avengers” “Captain America” and “Guardians of the Galaxy,” the franchise has brought a total $3.6 billion in U.S. ticket sales and $8.8 billion in global sales. And that’s not even counting revenue from DVDs, digital and cable TV rights, and merchandising.  3. Highest average return. Per movie, the “Avengers” films brought the highest returns, with more than $500 million in U.S. ticket sales for each of the two films under the Marvel tent pole. But showing its unique opportunity to bring in females of all ages into theaters, the three “Hunger Games” movies out so far averaged $390 million in U.S. revenue per film.

What does Italy do with its immense artistic heritage?,cnn,"Silvia Marchetti is a Rome-based freelance reporter and writer. She covers finance, economics, travel and culture for a wide range of media. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.
 (CNN)Italians have a saying: ""Too much of something cripples it.""
We're overcrowded with so many frescoed churches, medieval castles and Roman ruins that we simply don't know what to do with them, let alone care for a proper upkeep.  
We've turned blind to their value and beauty.
There are nearly 5,000 ""gems"" scattered across the country, ranging from museums to archaeological areas and monuments.
Italy boasts the highest number of UNESCO World Heritage sites in the world -- 50, several of which risk crumbling to the ground due to neglect and lack of public resources.
And there are another 42,000 that are at the mercy of mudslides, floods and natural calamities.
The UNESCO-listed Basilica of Assisi, where St. Frances' tomb lies, is just the last of a series of national shames. Its frescoed walls by Renaissance masters including Giotto risk falling down and are badly in need of a restyle. In a desperate move the monks have launched a crowdfunding project to raise 500,000 euros. We're talking of one of the biggest pilgrimage sites in the world -- not to mention its artistic value. 
I remember once an American colleague asking me: ""But what does Italy do with its immense cultural heritage""? 
Good question. 
If other nations had half as much of what we boast, they'd make a much better job with it. Paradoxically, if we had just the Coliseum or Venice it would be easier.
But we don't and trouble is Italy doesn't know how to exploit this treasure. 
Take the British Museum's successful exhibition on Pompeii in 2013: we have the real site in our backyard but the British made the best of it worldwide while the real Pompeii was -- and still is -- making global headlines just because of its frequent collapses.
Or, worse, Italy couldn't care less to promote its assets.
As a travel writer I have the misfortune of dealing with tourist offices almost on a daily basis and it's a battle: many are reluctant to give information and have no good photos of places. I find myself almost begging them, when it should be the other way round. 
The true but sad thing is that restyling in Italy is mainly thanks to private funds and sponsors. Crowdfunding has already saved Bologna's San Luca Portico. The Coliseum is getting a makeover thanks to shoe brand Todd's, while a few visionary businessmen are rescuing crumbling villages by turning them into luxury resorts. 
Yet it's not just a matter of scarce public resources or austerity-driven measures. 
It's also about not having a sense of artistic and cultural attachment, the care to cherish a country's valuable monuments. And that's because Italians have always lacked a sense of national belonging: Italy, despite its millenary history, is one of the world's most modern states, unified in 1861. 
Patriot Massimo D'Azeglio once said: ""Now that we've made Italy, we need to make Italians.""
Tough job indeed, and we're still a long way to go. There's also wide-spread approach that tends to limit restyling in general. 
Heritage authorities are in love with the Romantic ideal ""of decadent ruins"": better leave the monument or site as it is, even allow it to rot, rather than recover it and ""destroy its original beauty.""
Each time new subway works bring to light an unknown Roman theatre or necropoli, it all freezes - the public works and the artistic upkeep. 
Preservation is equal to negligence and oblivion.  
But that's a blind approach. There's so much Italy could do with what it has, that it could live off tourism.  Symbola Foundation estimates that culture and art, if well exploited, could generate a turnover of 214 billion euros a year, amounting to 15.3% of GDP.
Another thorny issue is having a cheap culture. 
Entrance tickets to the Coliseum, Italy's top site that each year lures more than 6 million tourists, cost a maximum of 12 euros. Matera's rock crypts are 5 euros. Not to mention churches featuring Michelangelo's works, which are free to enter.
The first time I visited Westminster Abbey in London, and St. Patrick's church in Dublin, I was shocked to find out I had to pay to get in. And it was quite expensive, too. 
One could argue that Italy does well to open for free the Lord's doors, but probably in some ""critical"" cases a minimum cost to enter wouldn't hurt. 
The country's mindset needs to change, too. 
Monuments and works of art are not dead, but living things that deserve to be sexed-up once in a while. If we don't have enough space to showcase all of them or the money for their maintenance, why not give them over to other countries to run? Or sell them to rich businessmen?
Similar options make state authorities' hair stand on end: they stress art belongs to the Italian people and should remain in public hands -- even if it's inaccessible and unenjoyable.
Yet is it better to have a public ruin or a private, thriving multimedia museum?
The Uffizi Galleries' secret cellars are stacked with 2,500 forgotten masterpieces, which could be leased out to privates. Curators fear the artworks could get damaged if moved. But cobwebs and dust can do no harm, right? 
Our sunny piazzas, bridges and frescoed castles should be regularly rented out for lavish ceremonies and weddings of billionaires couples or for major company events that would bring millions of euros to cities' coffers. 
And who cares if for one single evening residents are unable to park their car in front of their palazzo?
There are also 6,000 abandoned medieval ""ghost towns"" that could be recovered or sold to revamp local economy. 
The state should also speed up the process of putting up for auction hundreds of artistic sites and historical buildings to privates and international investors who get to run them for 50 years. 
Since the project launch in 2012 so far just two restyles have worked out, one being a Renaissance villa in Florence turned into a deluxe spa resort. 
Fine, Rome wasn't built in a day. But it could crumble in an hour.

Baltimore Police Promise Full Investigation Into Man's Death After Arrest,npr,"
      Officials in Baltimore, Md., say they will thoroughly investigate the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man who died after he was arrested by Baltimore Police more than a week ago.   The case has added fuel to the national debate about use of force by police. In Baltimore, demonstrators have taken to the streets demanding answers and an end to what they called police brutality against black men.   Today, Deputy Police Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez and Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake held a press conference to offer a few details that resulted in a lot more questions.   As CNN reports, both officials said they were still trying to figure what exactly happened in the incident. Two things, however, are clear: Gray was chased by police and then handcuffed and, while talking and conscious, he was put into a police vehicle.   That part of the narrative is corroborated by cellphone video taken by a person on the street:   
  
    
  
  
    
  

   An autopsy showed that Gray suffered no wounds but a spinal cord injury killed him. As The Baltimore Sun reports, officers insist that Gray was arrested without the use of force and that he suffered a ""medical emergency"" during transport.   CNN reports:      ""'What we don't know, and what we need to get to, is how that injury occurred,' Rodriguez said.   ""The Baltimore Police Department is investigating the death, and has asked for calm as the process unfolds. But many in the community, including the city's mayor, are angry.   ""'This is a very, very tense time for Baltimore City, and I understand the community's frustration. I understand it because I'm frustrated. I'm angry that we are here again â that we have had to tell another mother that their child is dead,' Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake told reporters. 'I'm frustrated not only that we're here, but we don't have all of the answers.'""      The New York Times reports that another issue in question here is whether police took too long to call for medical help.   The Times reports:      ""The police commissioner, Anthony Batts, said officers had been slow to recognize that Mr. Gray needed medical attention. Even before being placed into a police van, a scene that was captured on videos taken by bystanders, Mr. Gray had said he needed his inhaler, according to the police, which he did not have with him.   ""'We should have probably asked for paramedics' sooner, the commissioner said.   ""Mr. Rodriguez said that when Mr. Gray was put into the van, he was talking and breathing, and 'acting irately,' according to the van driver, but that when he was taken out about 40 minutes later, he could not talk or breathe. The videos appear to show officers dragging Mr. Gray to the van, raising questions about whether he had already suffered the spinal injury. Mr. Rodriguez conceded that investigators do not know whether it occurred on the ride to the police station, or before.""
