Former President Bill Clinton and his daughter Chelsea Clinton will be headlining the four-day, 1,000-invitee gathering of the global business and political elite.\nBut the event comes as Vice President Joe Biden weighs his own entry into the presidential race against Clinton, setting Obama and the White House up for months of divided loyalties in a presidential race.\nAt least for next week, Obama will avoid looking like he\u2019s putting his thumb on the scale \u2014though the White House says the only thing driving the decision was an otherwise busy schedule.\n\n\n\n            By \nAnnie Karni\n\n\u201cGiven Pope Francis\u2019s trip, the State Visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping, and the convening of the United Nations General Assembly this week, an appearance at the Clinton Global Initiative was just not something we could fold into the president's schedule this year,\u201d said White House spokesman Eric Schultz. \u201cAs the president has said in his previous appearances at CGI, he deeply values the critical work done by the Foundation around the world.\"\nSecretary of State John Kerry and Biden are also expected to be in New York for parts of next week, but neither will be attending, either. The highest ranking member of the administration scheduled to attend is Megan Smith, the chief technology officer.\nLast year at CGI, Obama took time out of his speech to heap praise on Clinton, then on the verge of making a decision about getting into the 2016 race.\n\u201cI think one of the best decisions I ever made as president was to ask Hillary Clinton to serve as our nation\u2019s Secretary of State,\u201d Obama said, speaking to the audience at the Sheraton in Midtown Manhattan last year, and joking, \u201cshe has the post-administration glow right now. She looks much more rested.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The president's decision comes as his vice president is weighing whether to run against Clinton, his former secretary of state.", "title": "Obama to skip Clinton summit", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/obama-skips-clinton-global-initiative-new-york-213944", "topics": ["abortion", "economy"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Jack Shafer", "Kenneth P.
