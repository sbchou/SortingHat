Donald Trump, in contrast, spoke for 18 minutes and 47 seconds.\nAfter the debate, Walker complained that he could barely get a word in edgewise, though he managed to interject five times. \u201cShort of tackling someone I don\u2019t know what more I could have done,\u201d he said. \u201cI aggressively interrupted Jake Tapper a bunch of times along the way, and short of an absolute brawl I don\u2019t know what more one can do. We jumped in, and for us its quality and not quantity.\u201d\n\nTHE POLITICO CAUCUS\n\n            By \n                    Katie Glueck\n\nBut the \"quality\" didn't draw much coverage, either: CNN's website played up the fireworks between Trump and Carly Fiorina and produced a highlight reel of the clashes between Trump and Jeb Bush.\nThe Walker camp was not happy: Press Secretary AshLee Strong retweeted Phil Kerpen, a free market policy analyst and syndicated columnist, who tweeted a picture of the errant graphic and wrote, \u201cWow, after stiffing @ScottWalker, @CNN leaves him off their chart like he wasn't even there.\"\n\"Gov. Walker had a lot to say last night, you could tell by the way he interjected to get his Wisconsin record and his plans into the debate. Unfortunately CNN had an agenda last night and it showed,\" said Kirsten Kukowski, Walker's communications director.\nHis campaign nonetheless released a series of statements praising his performance as leading the debate conversation.\n\u201cHe delivered a flawless performance, winning the debate by aggressively outlining his plans to wreak havoc on the status quo in Washington and reminding people of his unmatched record of leadership and achievement in Wisconsin,\u201d Campaign Manager Rick Wiley said in a statement Thursday night. \u201cHe put Donald Trump in his place early on, and the billionaire never recovered.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Walker camp complains: 'CNN had an agenda last night'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/scott-walker-cnn-agenda-213789", "topics": ["personality", "abortion"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Lauren Gardner", "David Kendall", "Kevin Robillard", "Rick Wilson", "Hadas Gold", "Eric Wolff", "Donald Trump", "Tim Starks", "Ted Cruz", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "Kirsten Kukowski", "Ben White", "Chris Christie", "Jenny Hopkinson", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Mike Huckabee", "Theodoric Meyer", "Josh Gerstein", "Annie Karni", "James Panichi", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Scott Walker", "Jeff Flake", "Katie Glueck", "Nick Gass", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Toby Eckert", "Jeb Bush", "Seung Min Kim", "Rick Wiley", "Nancy Pelosi", "Jeremy Herb", "Todd S.
