I mean, here you have all these high-faluting scientists and they're saying it was this gigantic explosion and everything came into perfect order. Now these are the same scientists that go around touting the second law of thermodynamics, which is entropy, which says that things move toward a state of disorganization.\n\"So now you're gonna have this big explosion and everything becomes perfectly organized and when you ask them about it they say, 'well we can explain this, based on probability theory because if there's enough big explosions, over a long period of time, billions and billions of years, one of them will be the perfect explosion,\" continued Carson. \"So I say what you're telling me is if I blow a hurricane through a junkyard enough times over billions and billions of years, eventually after one of those hurricanes there will be a 747 fully loaded and ready to fly.\" \nCarson added that he believed the big bang was \"even more ridiculous\" because there is order to the universe.\n\"Well, I mean, it's even more ridiculous than that cause our solar system, not to mention the universe outside of that is extraordinarily well organized, to the point where we can predict 70 years away when a comet is coming,\" he said. \"Now that type of organization to just come out of an explosion? I mean, you want to talk about fairy tales, that is amazing.\" \nLater, Carson said he personally believed Charles Darwin's theory of evolution was encouraged by the devil.\n\"I personally believe that this theory that Darwin came up with was something that was encouraged by the adversary, and it has become what is scientifically, politically correct,\" said Carson.\n\"Amazingly, there are a significant number of scientists who do not believe it but they're afraid to say anything,\" Carson added, saying he would be writing a book, \"The Organ of Species\" shows how the organs of the body refute evolution. \nCarson, whose views on creation have caused controversy in the past, is outspoken about his beliefs. He even once famously debated leading atheist Richard Dawkins. \nWatch the two videos below:\n\nView Video \u203a\n\nView Video \u203a\n\nView Entire List \u203a", "title": "Ben Carson: Big Bang A Fairy Tale, Theory Of Evolution Encouraged By The Devil", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/ben-carson-big-bang-a-fairy-tale-theory-of-evolution-encoura", "topics": ["other", "economy"], "people": ["Ben Carson", "Charles Darwin"], "orgs": [], "authors": [{"author_id": 6682, "fullname": "andrew kaczynski", "primary_org": "buzzfeed"}], "date_written": "2015-09-22 16:14:42", "org": "buzzfeed", "article_id": "7695901d7b244f907ae307ad2017c062", "date_access": "2015-09-22 16:41:57.330132"}
