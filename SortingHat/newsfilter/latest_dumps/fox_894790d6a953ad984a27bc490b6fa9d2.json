Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), running for the GOP presidential nomination, announced last week he wants to force a government shutdown in October if Planned Parenthood is not cut off from government funds.  And he is pressuring Senate Republican leaders to make it happen.  In a conference call with evangelical ministers, he explained that top Senate Republicans, along with Democrats, are happy to have an \u201cempty show vote\u201d on ending funding for Planned Parenthood. Cruz wants to tie defunding Planned Parenthood to the pending government spending bill for the upcoming fiscal year.  \u201cWe can expect President Obama and many of the congressional Democrats to cry loudly that if Congress uses its authority, Congress will be quote \u2018shutting down the government,\u2019 \u201d the senator told the ministers. \u201cThat, of course, is nonsense.\u201d  Cruz is using strong opposition to abortion to attract evangelicals, a high percentage of GOP primary voters in early-voting Iowa and throughout the South. And he has lots of company across the other candidates \u2014 17 total \u2014 running for the Republican nomination.  But is shutting down the government over funding for Planned Parenthood a political winner?  Hillary Clinton, the leading Democrat for 2016, thinks it is a winner for her. Last week she called the GOP push against abortion \u201cextreme,\u201d adding: \u201cWe expect that from some of the terrorist groups.\u201d  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has made it clear he thinks the drive to shut down the government is a loser for congressional Republicans.  When Republicans tried that tactic in the past, he said, the public got upset at the shutdown and not \u201cthe underlying issue that is being protested.\u201d  Earlier this month, Senate Republicans tried to pull federal dollars from Planned Parenthood with a plan to give the same dollars to \u201cother eligible entities to provide women\u2019s health care services.\u201d Senate Democrats easily blocked the bill.  It also led to some embarrassment. A Congressional Budget Office report on the bill found that if the GOP denies money to help women avoid unwanted pregnancies, the result could be \u201cexpected to lead to additional births, increasing federal spending.\u201d  In the face of the questionable political payoff, Republican candidates remain pulled to the issue by the regular release of undercover videos filmed by anti-abortion-rights the Center for Medical Progress. The secret tapes, edited for effect, show Planned Parenthood in blunt, often unsettling conversation about collecting fetal tissue for medical research after it has been donated by women who choose to have abortions.  The tapes have stirred outrage on right-wing social media and radio. The critical test for GOP candidates at the moment is their position on whether Congress should cut off federal funding for Planned Parenthood.  Carly Fiorina, the only woman running for the GOP nomination, agrees with Cruz: \u201cThey should close the government down,\u201d she said.  Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, another presidential hopeful, last week joined the chorus by saying: \u201cI, for one, don\u2019t think Planned Parenthood ought to get a penny \u2026 they\u2019re not actually doing women\u2019s health issues.\u201d  That comment left Bush stumbling because government reports and newspaper fact-checkers have found that most of Planned Parenthood\u2019s services \u2014 97 percent, to be precise \u2014 involve treatment for sexual disease, contraception and cancer screenings.  Bush has not signed off on shutting down the government. But other GOP candidates appear to be siding with Cruz.  Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor who is relying heavily on the evangelical vote in his bid for the nomination, wants to use the Constitution\u2019s Equal Rights Amendment to say that a \u201cbaby inside the mother\u2019s womb is a person at the moment of conception.\u201d  Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker took Republican opposition to abortion to new heights during the recent Fox News Channel debate. Both said they oppose all abortion, even in cases of rape, incest and when the mother\u2019s life is at risk.  \u201cWould you really let a mother die, rather than have an abortion,\u201d asked my colleague, Megyn Kelly, who was one of the moderators. Walker responded there are \u201calternatives\u201d to keeping the mother alive without abortion, without saying what options exist.  Walker and Rubio, if either wins the nomination, would be the party\u2019s first nominee to ever oppose abortion in every case. Mitt Romney, John McCain, George W. Bush and even Ronald Reagan all supported abortion in cases involving rape, incest and the mother\u2019s life.  Dr. Ben Carson, the only black candidate for the GOP nomination, injected race into the discussion when he claimed that Planned Parenthood has \u201cmost of their clinics in black neighborhoods\u201d in an effort to \u201ccontrol that population.\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker gave Carson a poor score for truth-telling, finding evidence \u201cthat a relatively small percentage of clinics are in black-majority neighborhoods.\u201d  This frenzy among GOP candidates over Planned Parenthood is firing up a small but significant percentage of the party\u2019s base. Recent polls show 26 percent of Americans oppose federal funding for Planned Parenthood.  But a Reuters/Ipsos poll this month showed that even with the passion stirred by the videos, 69 percent of Americans back federal money being used for \u201cprenatal services\u201d and 54 percent support federal funding for Planned Parenthood.  Those numbers point to long-term damage for the party\u2019s brand. The GOP is already at a disadvantage with women, who gave President Obama a 10-percentage-point victory over Romney in 2012.  Recall Democratic strategist Ann Lewis\u2019s famous comment about the gender gap in national politics: \u201cIt is like the Grand Canyon. It is deep, it is wide and it is beautiful.\u201d \n\nJuan Williams is a co-host of FNC's \"The Five,\" where he is one of seven rotating Fox personalities.\n\n\n\n+ FollowFoxNewsOpinion on Facebook\n\n", "byline": "", "description": "Is shutting down the government over funding for Planned Parenthood a political winner?", "title": "Could Planned Parenthood funding fight sink the GOP?", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/W1L4HgmWUHI/could-planned-parenthood-funding-fight-break-up-gop.html", "topics": ["abortion"], "people": ["Mitt Romney", "Ann Lewis", "Juan Williams", "Eric Gay", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Ronald Reagan", "Senate Republicans", "Marco Rubio", "Mike Huckabee", "Megyn Kelly", "George W.
