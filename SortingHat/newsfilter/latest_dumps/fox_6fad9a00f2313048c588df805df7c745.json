The pundits are heaping so much praise on Carly that she\u2019s being portrayed as wiping the floor with everyone else and practically ready to move into the Oval Office.\nTake this Mediaite headline: \u201cCarly Fiorina Owns CNN Marathon Debate; Now Best Bet to Win Presidency.\u201d\nI don\u2019t begrudge Fiorina any of this positive press. The former Hewlett-Packard CEO began this race all but written off by the pundits. Even after she won Fox\u2019s early-evening debate and was rising in the polls, she had to make a stink to get herself on CNN\u2019s prime-time stage. Fiorina told me in a recent interview that she viewed the media chatter about her actually running for VP as sexist.\nMy point is that the chattering class tends to exaggerate both victories and setbacks, and this has an impact on public opinion. Fiorina was at 4 percent in national polls heading into Wednesday\u2019s debate, and she herself said half the country didn\u2019t know about her presidential bid. She has yet to deal with the intense scrutiny inflicted on front-runners. She is riding high, but still has plenty of work to do.\n\nBy the same token, many of the pundits who have never been Trump fans painted him as having a pretty bad night. There was a lot of this-is-the-beginning-of-the-end talk. And here\u2019s why that is way overstated.\nThe entire strategy of moderator Jake Tapper and his colleagues was to poke and prod and push the candidates into taking on each other\u2014but mainly Trump. The billionaire was constantly getting whacked from all sides. Yet he withstood it for three long and sweaty hours without committing a significant gaffe. In some ways, the pi\u00f1ata treatment only underscored his status as the front-runner.\nTrue, it wasn\u2019t a great moment for The Donald to call Fiorina a \u201cbeautiful woman,\u201d this after she sternly derided his \u201clook at that face\u201d comment to a Rolling Stone reporter. And Trump didn\u2019t roll out new policies or details on the issues. But that\u2019s never been his style and hasn\u2019t impeded his climb to the top of the polls. So reports of his political demise are greatly exaggerated.\nMedia people are masters at reading too much into one event. Scott Walker had another lackluster outing, and the Washington Post says his donors are pressing him to shake up his struggling campaign. We\u2019ll see.\nBen Carson, who went into the Reagan Library debate as the No. 2 candidate, was not well-suited to the free-for-all format. He told me on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMedia Buzz\u201d that he wouldn\u2019t throw punches in this campaign, and he declined repeated invitations from Tapper to tackle Trump. And as one candidate after another forced his way into the conversation, Carson mostly hung back, disappearing for long stretches. We\u2019ll have to see whether that undermines the surgeon\u2019s appeal, which the pundits don\u2019t fully understand.\nChris Christie and Marco Rubio both had strong moments on the stage. But does that help lift them out of their single-digit status? The truth is that no one knows.\nWith 23 million viewers, just shy of Fox\u2019s Cleveland debate, the CNN was a prime opportunity for candidates swamped by the Trump tsunami.\nThose three hours may have made Carly Fiorina a star\u2014but the breathless media need to remember that the campaign is a long slog.\nClick for more Media Buzz\nmedia-buzz\n\nMedia Buzz, hosted by Howard Kurtz, airs on Sundays at 11AM and 5PM ET on Fox News Channel.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this show\n\n\n\n", "byline": "", "description": "In a polarized political world that defies consensus, there is virtual unanimity on one point: Carly Fiorina won the CNN debate.", "title": "Carly\u2019s night: The media have a new (anti-Trump) heroine", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/7MJGud7V9FU/", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["Chris Christie", "Howard Kurtz", "Ben Carson", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Jake Tapper", "Carly Fiorina", "Scott Walker"], "orgs": ["Rolling Stone", "Reagan Library", "Oval Office"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-09-18 10:00:09", "org": "fox", "article_id": "6fad9a00f2313048c588df805df7c745", "date_access": "2015-09-18 10:40:14.220801"}
