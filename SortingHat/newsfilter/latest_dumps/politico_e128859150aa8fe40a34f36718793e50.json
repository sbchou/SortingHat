Candidates will also have one minute to respond to questions and 30-second rebuttals, if their name is invoked by another candidate. \nCNN anchor Jake Tapper, as moderator, will ask the majority of questions, supplemented by questions from CNN Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash and conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. \nRepresentatives for every invited candidate, except former New York Gov. George Pataki, were on the call. \nLast week CNN changed the criteria of their primetime debate, ensuring that any candidate who falls within the top 10 in the average of polls since the first debate would have a spot on stage. That change cleared the path for the likely inclusion of Carly Fiorina, who experienced a surge in polling after her strong performance in the earlier \u201chappy hour\u201d debate on Fox in earlier August. \n\nAlex Isenstadt is a reporter for Politico.\n\nHadas Gold is a reporter at\u00a0Politico.\n\n                                            By \nJohn Culhane\n\n\n                                            By \n                                                    Julian E.
