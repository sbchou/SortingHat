{"body": "WASHINGTON \u2014  The leader of the Federal Election Commission, the agency charged with regulating the way political money is raised and spent, says she has largely given up hope of reining in abuses in the 2016 presidential campaign, which could generate a record $10 billion in spending.\n\n\u201cThe likelihood of the laws being enforced is slim,\u201d Ann M. Ravel, the chairwoman, said in an interview. \u201cI never want to give up, but I\u2019m not under any illusions. People think the F.E.C. is dysfunctional. It\u2019s worse than dysfunctional.\u201d\n\nHer unusually frank assessment reflects a worsening stalemate among the agency\u2019s six commissioners. They are perpetually locked in 3-to-3 ties along party lines on key votes because of a fundamental disagreement over the mandate of the commission, which was created 40 years ago in response to the political corruption of Watergate.\n\nSome commissioners are barely on speaking terms, cross-aisle negotiations are infrequent, and with no consensus on which rules to enforce, the caseload against violators has plummeted.\n\nThe F.E.C.\u2019s paralysis comes at a particularly critical time because of the sea change brought about by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in 2010 in the Citizens United case, which freed corporations and unions to spend unlimited funds in support of political candidates. Billionaire donors and \u201csuper PACs\u201d are already gaining an outsize role in the 2016 campaign, and the lines have become increasingly stretched and blurred over what presidential candidates and political groups are allowed to do.\n\nWatchdog groups have gone to the F.E.C. with complaints that probable presidential candidates like Jeb Bush and Martin O\u2019Malley are skirting finance laws by raising millions without officially declaring that they are considering running.\n\nMs. Ravel, who led California\u2019s state ethics panel before her appointment as a Democratic member of the commission in 2013, said that when she became chairwoman in December, she was determined to \u201cbridge the partisan gap\u201d and see that the F.E.C. confronted such problems. But after five months, she said she had essentially abandoned efforts to work out agreements on what she saw as much-needed enforcement measures.\n\nNow, she said, she plans on concentrating on getting information out publicly, rather than continuing what she sees as a futile attempt to take action against major violations. She said she was resigned to the fact that \u201cthere is not going to be any real enforcement\u201d in the coming election.\n\n\u201cThe few rules that are left, people feel free to ignore,\u201d said Ellen L. Weintraub, a Democratic commissioner.\n\nRepublican members of the commission see no such crisis. They say they are comfortable with how things are working under the structure that gives each party three votes. No action at all, they say, is better than overly aggressive steps that could chill political speech.\n\n\u201cCongress set this place up to gridlock,\u201d Lee E. Goodman, a Republican commissioner, said in an interview. \u201cThis agency is functioning as Congress intended. The democracy isn\u2019t collapsing around us.\u201d\n\nExperts predict that the 2016 race could produce a record fund-raising haul of as much as $10 billion, with the growth fueled by well-financed outside groups. On their own, the conservative billionaires Charles G. and David H. Koch have promised to spend $889 million through their political network.\n\nWith the rise of the super PACs and the loosening of legal restrictions on corporate spending, campaigns and groups are turning to creative new methods of raising money. Writing in March in The Washington Post, Ms. Ravel charged that some candidates \u2014 she did not name names \u2014 appeared to have been amassing large war chests at fund-raisers this year without acknowledging that they were at least considering a presidential run, which would trigger campaign finance limits and disclosure.\n\nShe said it was \u201cabsurd\u201d to think that such politicians were not at least considering a White House run under federal law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Wild West out there in some ways,\u201d said Kate A. Belinski, a former lawyer at the commission who now works on campaign finance at a law firm. Candidates and political groups are increasingly willing to push the limits, she said, and the F.E.C.\u2019s inaction means that \u201cthere\u2019s very little threat of getting caught.\u201d\n\nSome disputes between the commissioners have gotten personal.\n\nA disagreement over how to treat online political ads, for instance, turned tense when Ms. Ravel received anonymous online threats over charges that she was trying to \u201cregulate\u201d the Internet. She angrily confronted Mr. Goodman, charging that he had unfairly \u201cfanned the flames\u201d against her by mischaracterizing her position in an interview he did on Fox News. But Mr. Goodman said he had no regrets about challenging her position, which he saw as opening the door to greater regulation of Internet activities.\n\nRelations between the two have been difficult ever since.\n\nLast fall, Ms. Ravel did join Republicans on the commission \u2014 and took some criticism from the left \u2014 in a 4-to-2 decision that eased rules growing out of the Citizens United decision and a related case. But she has had little success in persuading Republicans to vote with her on enforcement measures.\n\nShe said she was particularly frustrated that Republican commissioners would not support cases against four nonprofit groups \u2014 including Crossroads GPS, founded by Karl Rove \u2014 accused of improperly using their tax-exempt status for massive and well-financed political campaigns.\n\nA surge in this so-called \u201cdark money\u201d in politics \u2014 hundreds of millions of dollars raised by nonprofits, trade associations and other groups that can keep their donations secrets \u2014 has alarmed campaign-finance reformers who are pushing to make such funding public.\n\nBut Mr. Goodman said the problem was exaggerated. He and other Republicans defend their decisions to block many investigations, saying Democrats have pushed cases beyond what the law allows.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not interested in going after people unless the law is fairly clear, and we\u2019re not willing to take the law beyond where it\u2019s written,\u201d said Caroline C. Hunter, a Republican commissioner. Democrats view the law \u201cmore broadly,\u201d she said.\n\nThe commission has not always been so hamstrung. In 2006, it unanimously imposed major fines against high-profile groups \u2014 liberal and conservative \u2014 for breaking campaign finance laws two years earlier by misusing their tax-exempt status for political fund-raising and campaigning. The penalties put political groups on notice, and experts credited them with helping curb similar abuses in the 2008 campaign.\n\nThese days, the six commissioners hardly ever rule unanimously on major cases, or even on some of the most minor matters. Last month at an event commemorating the commission\u2019s 40th anniversary, even the ceremony proved controversial. Democrats and Republicans skirmished over where to hold it, whom to include and even whether to serve bagels or doughnuts. In a rare compromise, they ended up serving both.\n\nStanding in front of a montage of photos from the F.E.C.\u2019s history, Ms. Ravel told staff members and guests that there was a \u201ccrisis\u201d in public confidence, and she stressed the F.E.C\u2019s mandate for \u201cenforcing the law.\u201d But the ranking Republican, Matthew S. Petersen, made no mention of enforcement in his remarks a few minutes later, focusing instead on defending political speech under the First Amendment.\n\nAs guests mingled, Ms. Weintraub \u2014 the commission\u2019s longest-serving member at 12 years \u2014 lamented to a reporter that the days when the panel could work together on important issues were essentially over.\n\nShe pointed to a former Republican commissioner standing nearby \u2014 Bradley A. Smith, who left the agency in 2005 \u2014 and said she used to be able to work with commissioners like him even when they disagreed on ideology.\n\nLaughing, Mr. Smith assumed a fighting stance and yelled at Ms. Weintraub: \u201cLet\u2019s go right now, you speech-hating enemy of the First Amendment!\u201d\n\nA few feet away, Mr. Goodman was not laughing. As Ms. Weintraub condemned the F.E.C.\u2019s inertia, he whispered a point-by-point rebuttal to show that things were not as bad as she made them sound.\n\nWith the commission so often deadlocked, the major fines assessed by the commission dropped precipitously last year to $135,813 from $627,408 in 2013. But like most things at the F.E.C., commissioners differ over how to interpret those numbers.\n\nRepublicans say they believe the commission\u2019s efforts to work with political groups on training and compliance have kept campaigns within the legal lines and helped to bring down fines.\n\nThe drop in fines \u201ccould easily be read as a signal that people are following the law,\u201d said Ms. Hunter, the Republican commissioner.\n\nMs. Ravel scoffed at that explanation.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really going on,\u201d she said, \u201cis that the Republican commissioners don\u2019t want to enforce the law, except in the most obvious cases. The rules aren\u2019t being followed, and that\u2019s destructive to the political process.\u201d", "byline": "ERIC LICHTBLAU", "description": "There is a stalemate among the agency\u2019s six commissioners, who are perpetually locked in 3-to-3 ties along party lines because of a fundamental disagreement over the commission\u2019s mandate.", "title": "F.E.C.
