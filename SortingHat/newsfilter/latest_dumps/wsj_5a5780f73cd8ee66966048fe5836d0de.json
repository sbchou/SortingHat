{"body": "Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are tapping into the same dissatisfaction that helped Ross Perot capture 19% of the vote in 1992.\nMany of those dismissing Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy suggest that he appeals only to ill-informed voters looking for a thrill. But polls indicate that Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal is widespread, running well beyond the ultra-conservative wing of the GOP.\nAccording to the Monmouth University poll\u00a0released this week, 24% of likely New Hampshire Republican primary voters favor Mr. Trump, compared with 12% supporting Jeb Bush,\u00a0the only other candidate registering in double digits in this poll.\nBecause New Hampshire has an open primary, in which independents can also cast ballots, both Republicans and independent voters were surveyed. Mr. Trump does better among registered independents and new voters (29%) than among registered Republicans (21%).\nMr. Trump did well not only with very conservative voters but also with somewhat conservative voters and those who say they are moderate to liberal. He is leading among all age groups.\nI predicted when Mr. Trump announced his candidacy that he would resonate with voters\u00a0tired of double-speak and politics as usual. That goes for Republicans, independents, and Democrats.\nEconomic uncertainty and political dysfunction are fueling not only Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity but also are key to the momentum of Sen. Sanders. The Vermont Democrat has drawn thousands of people to rallies across the country.\nAs the Journal\u2019s Gerald F. Seib recently wrote, populist voters disgusted by political dysfunction and what they see as politicians serving only their wealthy contributors are intrigued by Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders.\nRepublican pollster Frank Luntz, who worked on Ross Perot\u2019s independent presidential campaign in 1992, told me recently that in focus groups around the country he hears people saying that Mr. Trump \u201ccaptures the public mood better than any other candidate.\u201d\nMr. Trump may be offensive and outrageous, Mr. Luntz said, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks about Mexican immigrants and Sen. John McCain\u2018s service record, but he is also saying things others are afraid or too polite to voice.\nAn additional factor in the Trump and Sanders popularity is that even before this campaign cycle started, swing voters around the country were tired of the same political faces. The NBC News/Marist poll in July found that 61% of respondents in Iowa and 55% in New Hampshire agreed with the sentiment that\u00a0enough Bushes and Clintons have run for the White House and it\u2019s time to give someone else a chance.\nMr. Trump\u2019s negatives among Republicans and Republican-leaning voters, at 40%, are close to his positive ratings, 51%, according to Gallup\u2019s most recent data. But as he travels the country wearing a baseball cap emblazoned \u201cMake America great again,\u201d Mr. Trump is shaking up the status quo\u2013and a sizeable share of voters like it.\nIf Mr. Trump ultimately decides to run as an independent, the impact on the election is unknowable.\nMany have suggested that such a candidacy would ensure a Democratic victory, pointing to the myth that Mr. Perot in 1992 drew most of his votes from George H.W. Bush. But a study pollster Stanley Greenberg did for the Democratic Leadership Council in 1993 dispelled that notion.\nSixty-three percent of Perot voters were ages 18 to 44, and more than two in three considered themselves Democrats or independents, he found. Only a quarter of the Perot voters were conservatives, and more than half self-described as moderate and 20% considered themselves liberal.\nIt\u2019s unclear where discontented voters intrigued by Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders will go if both men fail to capture their party\u2019s nomination and do not mount independent candidacies. They might gravitate toward other candidates. They might also just stay home on Election Day.\nLinda Killian is\u00a0executive director of\u00a0Independent Americans United\u00a0and\u00a0a senior scholar at the\u00a0Woodrow Wilson Center.\u00a0Her most recent book is \u201cThe Swing Vote: The Untapped Power of Independents.\u201d She is on Twitter:\u00a0@lindajkillian.\nALSO IN THINK TANK:\nIs Donald Trump\u2019s Campaign Ready for Prime Time?\nWhy Taking Donald Trump Seriously Could Unravel His Campaign\nBreaking Down the GOP Silence on Trump\u2019s Immigration Rhetoric\nHow Donald Trump\u2019s Candidacy Might Resonate With Voters.
