{"body": "Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin suggested to donors on Monday that he was pivoting to a message more directly attacking Washington to fend off a growing threat to his campaign from candidates who have never held elected office, such as Donald J. Trump.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re about as anti-Washington as you can get,\u201d Mr. Walker said on a conference call, noting that three popular candidates, Mr. Trump (whom he referred to only as \u201cthe front-runner\u201d), Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina have never served in office. \u201cPeople have had it with Washington.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cwe need to step it up and remind people that we didn\u2019t just take on the unions and Democrats, we had to take on my own party establishment.\u201d \n\nOn the call, Mr. Walker acknowledged criticisms that he lacked passion in the first debate, revealed that he was attempting to poach supporters of former Gov. Rick Perry and suggested he would draw contrasts to Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey on health care issues. \n\nBut Mr. Walker left little doubt that he is now chiefly focused on finding a way to arrest the growth of the outsider candidates who are building support.  \n\nAnswering a question from a supporter about how he would handle \u201cthe Trump factor,\u201d Mr. Walker boasted that he refused to criticize the real estate mogul for having said he gets his military advice from watching television news shows.\n\n\u201cInstead of going after Trump, we need to go after his voters,\u201d said Mr. Walker, adding that the way to address Mr. Trump\u2019s apparent appeal among voters angry at the political establishment is \u201cnot by knocking him, but saying that we too share that frustration.\u201d \n\nThe call lasted about 30 minutes and its contents were shared by a Republican contributor who listened in. \n\nMr. Walker\u2019s decision to shift to a message confronting his own party\u2019s leadership and his candid appraisal of Mr. Trump illustrates the quandary in which the governor now finds himself. After a strong start in Iowa, where he has led in polls most of this year, Mr. Walker now finds himself trailing not only Mr. Trump but also Mr. Carson there.  \n\nHis assessment also offers a window on what some Republicans believe is one of his weaknesses: a penchant for short-term tactics rather than an overarching strategy. Already this year, he has changed his positions on immigration and ethanol subsidies, while sounding a much tougher tone on same-sex marriage than he had as governor.  \n\nMr. Walker\u2019s new message was on display Monday, where on conservative talk radio and at an appearance at the Iowa state fair he took direct aim at Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader. \n\n\u201cThey told us during the last election that if we just elected a Republican Senate, the leadership out there would put a bill to repeal Obamacare on the desk of the president,\u201d Mr. Walker said at the fair. \u201cIt\u2019s August, we\u2019re still waiting for that measure.\u201d\n\nOn the call \u2014 which also featured Mr. Walker\u2019s campaign manager and a leading donor \u2014 the governor addressed his performance at a debate held earlier this month. \u201cPeople want to feel the passion,\u201d he said, referring to some of the feedback he had received. Responding to this critique, Mr. Walker told his supporters to Google the encounter he had with some protesters at the state fair Monday, where he told them he was not intimidated.\n\nAsked by a supporter what he would do to win over voters backing some of his Republican rivals, Mr. Walker noted the cash flow difficulties that have prompted Mr. Perry to stop paying his staff, and revealed that he \u201chad a good talk with an early supporter\u201d of the former Texas governor whose change in support \u201cwould be a huge pick up.\u201d He did not, however, identify the name of the Perry backer.\n\nAnd Mr. Walker noted, in the course of previewing his Tuesday health care speech, that he refused to expand Medicaid in Wisconsin with money offered by the Affordable Care Act. He noted that \u201ca couple of the other governors in this race went the opposite direction. \u201c", "byline": "JONATHAN MARTIN", "description": "Facing popular candidates who have never held office, Gov.
