But after a bruising 2012 cycle, in which its polls were farther off than most of its competitors, Gallup told POLITICO it isn't planning any polls for the presidential primary horse race this cycle. And, even following an internal probe into what went wrong last time around, Gallup won't commit to tracking the general election next year. It's a stunning move for an organization that built its reputation on predicting the winners of presidential elections.\" http://politi.co/1ZaS6Cw\n\u2014 \"Swing-state polls show vulnerabilities for Clinton, Trump,\" by POLITICO's Nick Gass: \"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are still on top among their respective parties' voters in three key swing states, but Vice President Joe Biden and Ben Carson fare better than the primary leaders in general election matchups, according to a trio of Quinnipiac University surveys in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania released Wednesday.\" http://politi.co/1KZoSyX\nFIRST IN SCORE \u2014 Vernon raises $253,000 in the third quarter: Democrat Monica Vernon, a Cedar Rapids city councilwoman trying to unseat GOP Rep. Rod Blum, raised $253,000 in the third quarter, her campaign will announce on Wednesday. The haul gives her $564,000 in cash on hand. Vernon is facing former state House Speaker Pat Murphy and Gary Kroeger, a former \"Saturday Night Live\" cast member, in the Democratic primary for the chance to face Blum, who's seen as one of the most vulnerable Republicans in House. Neither of her rivals has released third-quarter numbers yet.\nNAME RECOGNITION \u2014 A familiar name in New Hampshire is the only one known by most voters in gubernatorial race: A new WMUR poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire found a majority of the electorate knows just one of the candidates running to replace Gov. Maggie Hassan: GOP Executive Councilor Chris Sununu, who has already announced a bid. Twenty-six percent have favorable opinion of Sununu, whose father and grandfather served as governor, while 10 percent are neutral and 22 percent have a negative opinion. None of the Democrats surveyed \u2014 including Stefany Shaheen, Colin Van Ostern and Chris Pappas \u2014 are known by more than a third of the electorate. http://bit.ly/1McPC1c\nDays until the 2015 election: 27.

Kelly Ayotte's record on women's healthcare,\" NH1's Paul Steinhauser reports.\" The organization, One Nation, Thursday will launch a 17-day $1.4 million broadcast, cable, digital and radio ad campaign in the Granite State, ad buying sources told NH1 News on Tuesday. The ad campaign, dominated by a 10-day $1.2 million broadcast and cable buy (including WBIN-TV) was later confirmed to NH1 News by One Nation.\" The ads start running on Friday. http://bit.ly/1Ok8V8Y\nA STAID DEBATE \u2014 \"Familiar clashes as Conway and Bevin square off at Centre College,\" by The Lexington Herald-Leader's Sam Youngman in Danville, Ky.: Not much happened at the Kentucky gubernatorial debate on Tuesday night. \"While the candidates engaged in sharp exchanges over the state's pension crisis, the saga of Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis and the possibility of legalized gambling, the subjects of Kynect and Medicaid expansion somehow never came up.\" http://bit.ly/1KZ8Zsg\nCAMPAIGN INNOVATIONS \u2014 Stock photo company offers photos designed to avoid gaffes: In September, Jeb Bush's super PAC released a video ad to promote the former Florida governor's vision for America and juxtapose it with what they portrayed to be Donald Trump's negative view of the present. The only problem? The amber waves of grain were from England. Shutterstock, a stock photo service, is looking to capitalize on the gaffe. On Tuesday, the company released their \"Safe for IA and NH\" collection. The photos are all taken by Iowa- and New Hampshire-based photographers and were inspired by the Right to Rise stock footage goof, said Shutterstock curator Robyn Lange. http://politi.co/1FSfHBA\nPRESIDENTIAL SPEED READ \u2014 \"Cruz's big, bold map,\" by POLITICO's Katie Glueck: \"Ted Cruz has long contended that the GOP nomination fight will be a grueling, drawn-out affair that could stretch all the way to the convention. And he's taking out an insurance policy just in case. Cruz is working the most distant corners of the political map, courting Republicans in the farthest-flung U.S. territories in an attempt to meet the requirements of Republican National Committee rule No. 40 (b), an obscure provision that currently stipulates that in order to receive the nomination, a candidate must win majorities of delegates in eight states or territories.\" http://politi.co/1NmvR8M\n\u2014 \"Inside Hillary Clinton's debate prep,\" by POLITICO's Annie Karni: Hillary Clinton's strategy for taking on Bernie Sanders in the first Democratic debate next week \"is now expected to be two-pronged, according to campaign officials and people with knowledge of the debate preparations: She will attempt to embrace some of Sanders' ideals while dismissing his solutions, and simultaneously try for a third time to introduce herself to the American public and explain her rationale for running. ... She is also expected to hold her ground on any attacks that question her fight for progressive values, and hammer home the point that it's not about great rhetoric or speeches, it's about results and who can deliver them.\" http://politi.co/1NkRKFy\n\u2014 \"In a bid for progressives, Clinton starts to distance herself from Obama,\" by The Washington Post's Anne Gearan in Davenport, Iowa: \"Hillary Rodham Clinton is attempting to set herself apart by criticizing one Democrat in particular\" ahead of the first Democratic debate: President Obama. \"With direct comparisons and implicit criticism, Clinton is increasingly using the Obama White House \u2014 and the popular occupant who isn't running \u2014 to say what she would do differently in a Clinton White House ... The positioning marks a notable shift for Clinton, who has spent much of her campaign embracing Obama's broader agenda in hopes of harnessing the coalition of young and minority voters who helped propel him to two terms in the White House.\" http://wapo.st/1jNkQ3S\n\u2014 \"Democratic senators: Biden bid would be good for Clinton,\" by POLITICO's Seung Min Kim and Burgess Everett: \"Many of Joe Biden's former Senate colleagues are firmly in Hillary Clinton's camp \u2014 but they still say a Biden presidential bid could be good for Clinton and the party. The senators say the extra competition, on top of the surprisingly stiff challenge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, could sharpen Clinton on the campaign trail and ultimately make her a better general election candidate \u2014 even if it ends badly for the vice president, as many of them think it would.\" http://politi.co/1OkwwIg\n\u2014 A surprise appearance: Vice President Joe Biden popped up at a fundraiser for California Secretary of State Alex Padilla on Tuesday hosted by the Latino Victory Project, BuzzFeed News' Adrian Carrasquillo reports, giving him an opportunity to make inroads with a key group. http://bzfd.it/1hpLxtz\n\u2014 Hitting the trail: Mike Huckabee's wife, Janet, will campaign for her husband on Wednesday and Thursday in Iowa and on Friday and Saturday in central Florida, according to the Huckabee campaign.\nCODA \u2014 QUOTE OF THE DAY: \"I would not call it gracious.
