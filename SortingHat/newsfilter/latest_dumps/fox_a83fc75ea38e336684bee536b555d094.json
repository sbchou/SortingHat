But he\u2019ll surely be watching as the former secretary of state spars in person for the first time with her 2016 Democratic opponents.\nAnd those candidates have not been shy about casting Clinton as a calculating candidate swaying with the political winds.\nMost recently, Clinton has taken jabs from Democrats for coming out just last week against a major Pacific nation trade deal. In a taste of what awaits her on the debate stage, underdog rival Martin O\u2019Malley noted he opposed the deal eight months ago, and didn\u2019t just come out against it \u201con the eve of a debate \u2026 because polling told me to do it.\u201d\nA big question for Clinton on Tuesday night is whether she can shake that image and in doing so counter the \u2018draft Biden\u2019 push by showing she\u2019s not so vulnerable after all.\u00a0\nJoe Desilets, managing partner for the Republican-leaning 21st & Main strategy firm, said that Clinton must \u201creintroduce herself to her Democratic base and to the country at-large,\u201d if she\u2019s going to change the narrative.\n\nHe also said Clinton must \u201ccome out with the energy and warmth that has been missing from her campaign over the past several months\u201d and be careful about how she differentiates herself from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, alienating neither her base nor the party\u2019s progressive wing.\n\u201cThe goal is not to keep somebody out of the race but to find the best course possible to the nomination, based on the merits of the campaign and knowledge of the issues,\u201d said Democratic strategist and Fox News commentator David Mercer. \u201cWhat we\u2019ll see is the direct conversations (Clinton) has been having with voters in early-voting states getting onto the national stage.\u201d\nDespite political legacy and fundraising prowess in her corner, the Democratic presidential front-runner has grappled with an email scandal and a national voter mood clamoring for so-called outsider candidates. That mood has most helped Sanders, who continues to chip away at Clinton\u2019s numbers in the polls in the run-up to the CNN debate.\nJust over the last week, Clinton\u2019s support among Democratic voters dropped from 51 percent to 41 percent, while Sanders\u2019 increased from 24 percent to 28 percent, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll. Biden\u2019s ticked up from 16 percent to 20 percent in the survey.\nA recent WSJ/Marist poll showed Sanders leading Clinton in early-voting New Hampshire.\nClinton still has the organizational edge over candidates like Sanders and O\u2019Malley, a former Maryland governor. Jim Webb, a former Virginia senator, and Lincoln Chaffee, a former Rhode Island governor and senator, also will be on stage Tuesday night.\nBut Biden remains perhaps Clinton\u2019s biggest threat, as he continues to weigh a decision, apparently encouraged by Democratic supporters concerned Clinton cannot stop the slide.\nBiden, still grieving after his son Beau\u2019s death in May, originally had been expected to decide before October. But some political strategists think the fulcrum moment may be Clinton\u2019s performance in the debate, with five other sanctioned debates remaining.\u00a0\nThe vice president, who ran failed White House bids in 1998 and 2008, reportedly was having a \u201cfamily meeting\u201d over the holiday weekend in his home town of Wilmington, Del., to decide whether he\u2019ll enter the 2016 race.\n\u201cBiden is wise to sit back and wait,\u201d Kendra Stewart, a politics professor at the College of Charleston, in South Carolina,\u00a0said Monday. \u201cCandidates typically enter a race with a surge that later drops. He could enter late and ride that surge to the end.\u201d\nShe also said Clinton\u2019s biggest challenge will be to \u201cmeet and exceed expectations that she is the most knowledgeable person in the debate \u2026 and show the deepest understanding of what it takes to be president.\u201d\nRevelations this spring that Clinton, while secretary of state, used a private server and email for official business have hampered her campaign as she grapples with a stream of headlines about the related investigations.\nShe\u2019s tried to go on offense in recent days, though, claiming a prominent Republican\u2019s gaffe about the Benghazi committee proves congressional probes into her time as secretary of state are political.\nBut she still struggles to connect with voters, polls suggest. A new CBS News poll shows 61 percent of respondents said she is not \u201chonest and trustworthy,\u201d compared with 35 percent who said she is.\nEven President Obama acknowledged on CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday that \u201cmaybe she could have handled the original decision better and the disclosures more quickly.\u201d Obama still defended Clinton and said the controversy has been \u201cginned up.\u201d\nDespite the difficulties, Clinton remains the front-runner. She has an overall, double-digit lead over Sanders \u2013 and the rest of her primary rivals \u2013 nationally.\nBut her fundraising advantage is narrowing. Clinton so far this year has raised roughly $75 million, compared with Sanders\u2019 $15 million. However, Sander\u2019s third-quarter haul was $26 million, nearing Clinton\u2019s $28 million, according to the campaigns.\nAfter months of long-distance sparring, Clinton on Tuesday will likely face further questions about her sincerity from rivals pointing out her recent positions have put her more in line with Sanders and the party\u2019s liberal base. Her opposition to Obama\u2019s TPP trade deal spurred allegations of flip-flopping, since she backed the proposal while running the State Department. Clinton also now supports same-sex marriage, after opposing it as a New York senator and first lady.\n\u201cPeople will have to contrast my consistency and my willingness to stand up to Wall Street and corporations with the secretary,\u201d Sanders told NBC on Sunday, arguing he has never supported a U.S. trade deal and that he has been consistent on issues for 25 years.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "Hillary Clinton faces heavy pressure during the first Democratic presidential debate Tuesday to outperform primary rivals cutting into her lead and perhaps keep her biggest potential challenger on the sidelines.", "title": "Pressure on Clinton to keep rivals at bay -- and Biden on sidelines -- in 1st debate", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/1mj_o7DBaLY/", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "trade"], "people": ["Lincoln Chaffee", "Joe Desilets", "Martin O'Malley", "Beau Biden", "Hillary Clinton", "Kendra Stewart", "David Mercer", "Jim Webb", "Bernie Sanders"], "orgs": ["College of Charleston", "State Department", "TPP"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-10-12 22:10:40", "org": "fox", "article_id": "a83fc75ea38e336684bee536b555d094", "date_access": "2015-10-12 22:01:07.375178"}
