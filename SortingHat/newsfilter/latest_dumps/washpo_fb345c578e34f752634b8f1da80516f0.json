(Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  CLEAR LAKE, Iowa \u2013 Hillary Rodham Clinton was in political warrior mode as she addressed Democratic activists here Friday night, delivering a fiery, rip-roaring speech designed to help quiet concerns about her weaknesses as a presidential front-runner. Clinton took the burgeoning controversy over her private e-mail server head-on, saying probes into her correspondence as secretary of state as well as her handling of the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, are nothing short of a political witch hunt by her Republican opponents. \"It\u2019s not about Benghazi,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd you know what, it\u2019s not about e-mails or servers either. It\u2019s about politics.\u201d Clinton vowed to fight back aggressive, saying, \u201cI won\u2019t get down in the mud with them. I won\u2019t play politics with national security or dishonor the memory of those we lost. I won\u2019t pretend this is anything other than what it is: the same old partisan games we\u2019ve seen so many times before. I don\u2019t care how many super PACs and Republicans pile on. I\u2019ve been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life and I\u2019m not going to stop now.\u201d Clinton\u2019s remarks came at the Iowa Democratic Wing Ding, an event that drew four of the party\u2019s five presidential candidates (former senator Jim Webb of Virginia did not attend) to the historic Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley made impassioned, populist appeals that were received enthusiastically by the capacity crowd of 2,100 people. The response to former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chaffee was more muted, though he hit a number of progressive touchstones. Clinton, the evening\u2019s first speaker, set the tone with a barnburner. Weaving sarcastic humor into her tough talk, she went after her leading Republican opponents repeatedly and by name \u2013 businessman Donald Trump, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.). Clinton cast the entire GOP field as out-of-touch and out-of-date, saying their menu of policy proposals \u201cmay work in a Republican primary, but it sure doesn\u2019t work in a 21st century America.\u201d \u201cNow I know most of the attention these days is on a certain flamboyant front-runner,\u201d Clinton said, referencing businessman Donald Trump. \u201cBut don\u2019t let the circus distract you. If you look at their policies, most of the other candidates are just Trump without the pizzazz or the hair.\u201d Bringing up women\u2019s health issues, she said, \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s words are appalling, but so are the policies of other candidates. Senator Rubio brags about wanting to deny victims of rape and incest access to abortion. Governor Bush says $500 million is too much to spend on women\u2019s health. And they all want to defund Planned Parenthood.\u201d Clinton touted her support for President Obama\u2019s nuclear agreement with Iran, saying \u201cthere is simply no viable alternative\u201d to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. But otherwise, Clinton kept her focus on domestic policies and a sharp contrast with the Republicans. She included a nod to the African American protest movement that is playing an important role in shaping the Democratic primary race, declaring: \u201cYes, black lives matter.\u201d She opened her speech by making apparent light of the controversy surrounding her e-mails. Noting that she recently began a Snapchat account, Clinton quipped, \u201cI love it. Those messages disappear all by themselves.\u201d The audience responded with knowing laughter. The three other speakers made subtle contrasts with Clinton. Chafee, a former mayor, senator and governor, said, \u201cWhat I\u2019m most proud of in my decades of public service is I didn\u2019t have any scandals.\u201d Sanders, meanwhile, began his speech with an extended riff on big money in politics. He said he was determined not to have a super PAC supporting his campaign and that he wouldn\u2019t \u201cgo out hustling money from the wealthiest people in the country.\u201d He said his campaign has received contributions from 350,000 Americans and the average contribution was $31.20. Sanders laid out a liberal agenda \u2013 from combating climate change to breaking up big banks to economic policies that lift up working families. Sanders drew some of his loudest applause when he touched on issues on which he differs with Clinton. When Sanders said, \u201cNo Keystone pipeline,\u201d the crowd cheered. Clinton has not taken a position on extending the pipeline. And when Sanders noted that he voted against the war in Iraq \u2013 as a senator, Clinton voted for it, though she has since disavowed her vote \u2013 people in the crowd chanted, \u201cBernie! Bernie!\u201d O\u2019Malley followed Sanders on stage and touched many of the same progressive themes. He tried to distinguish himself from the other candidates by noting that he is the only one with 15 years of executive experience, having served as mayor of Baltimore before being governor. O\u2019Malley ticked through some of the highlights of his record in Maryland: raising the minimum wage, investing in public schools, passing tough gun-control laws, expanding voting rights, giving driver\u2019s licenses to undocumented immigrants. \u201cActions, not words,\u201d O\u2019Malley said, over and over again. He closed his remarks with an assault on Wall Street. \u201cIf the bank is too big to fail, too big to jail and too big to manage, then it\u2019s probably too damn big,\u201d he said. Though he has struggled to gain traction in the polls, O\u2019Malley was well received by the crowd. Yet in an illustration of the challenges for his candidacy, as he was speaking photographers trained their cameras not on the stage but on the audience, where Clinton had taken a seat to watch.", "byline": "", "description": "\"It\u2019s not about Benghazi,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd you know what, it\u2019s not about e-mails or servers either.
