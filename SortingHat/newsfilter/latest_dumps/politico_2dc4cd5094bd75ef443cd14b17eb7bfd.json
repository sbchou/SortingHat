So, you know, I think that is probably pretty clear from the ratings,\u201d Christie said on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d Thursday. \nChristie, who has said he went 20 questions in a row without being called on during last month's Fox News debate, had jokingly threatened to go \u201cnuclear\u201d if he wasn\u2019t thrown questions Wednesday night. \nMaking the rounds on the morning shows, Christie said he felt the second debate had gone well.\n\u201cThere\u2019s 11 good people. What you try to do is just use the time that you get as wisely as you can. I feel like, listen, when you\u2019re talking about other people\u2019s issues, the people of the United States problems, that is what they want to hear about,\u201d he said. \nHe also addressed his outburst when Donald Trump and Carly Fiorina were trading jabs about their business records. \n\u201cThe fact is, we don\u2019t want to hear about your careers,\u201d he said during the debate. \u201cYou\u2019re both successful people. Congratulations \u2026 Stop this childish back-and-forth between the two of you.\u201d\nGayle King pointed out that Christie himself has talked about his business record a lot.\n\u201cWhat they were doing getting into a kind of typical, personal food fight. In the first debate it was between Jeb and Donald Trump. Then yesterday, it was between Donald Trump and Carly Fiorina, and they were, you know, going tit for tat with each other,\u201d Christie said, \u201cThat adds nothing to people\u2019s knowledge about what kind of president you would be.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Christie: The 32 minutes without me talking were the most boring of the debate", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/chris-christie-2016-cnn-presidential-debate-not-called-on-213775", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Lauren Gardner", "Pope Francis", "Anna Palmer", "Hadas Gold", "Elvis Presley", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "Marc Caputo", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Chris Christie", "Connie Milstein", "Jenny Hopkinson", "Michelle Obama", "Brian Mahoney", "John Boehner", "Darius Tahir", "Annie Karni", "Donald Trump", "Toby Eckert", "Xi Jinping", "Katie Glueck", "Gayle King", "Jennifer Scholtes", "James Panichi", "Alex Isenstadt", "Jeremy Herb", "John Bresnahan", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Paul Ryan", "Kate Bennett", "Tim Starks", "Carly Fiorina", "Brianna Ehley", "Adam Sneed", "Adam Behsudi", "Todd S.
