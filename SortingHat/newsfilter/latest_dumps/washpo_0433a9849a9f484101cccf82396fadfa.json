Tuesday Aug. 25, 1998. (AP Photo/Charlie Krupa)  Putting a new spin on which candidate would you most like to have a beer with, the discount travel Web site Travelzoo has capitalized on the pre-GOP debate buzz with a truly thought-provoking survey. Members received an e-mail early Tuesday morning asking them to imagine vacationing with one of the presidential candidates. (Do we have to?) \u201cWith the first presidential debate just around the corner, we\u2019re curious \u2026,\u201d it began. Totally bipartisan, the choices are between five Democrats and five Republicans, which means Jim Webb and Joe Biden (who isn\u2019t even running \u2026 yet) got a spot in the survey where the likes of Rand Paul, Ben Carson and Marco Rubio were relegated to \u201cOther.\u201d Travelzoo wonders who, among Martin O\u2019Malley, Ted Cruz, Donald Trump, Jim Webb, Hillary Clinton, Mike Huckabee, Bernie Sanders, Jeb Bush, Joe Biden, Scott Walker, Other (please specify), its members would want to sit with on an airplane. And who they wouldn\u2019t want to sit with. It also asks which candidate would they want to road trip with, vacation in Europe with, snorkel with and have dinner with. A random respondent will win a $100 gift card. (Man, we just give out Loop T-shirts.) That a company would be marketing off a presidential primary debate this early underscores how the Trump factor has turned a once boring event for political junkies into must-see TV. Christie McConnell, Travelzoo\u2019s marketing director, told the Loop that their Manhattan offices are adjacent to the Trump Tower. So they can\u2019t escape all the media hoopla outside the building. Can\u2019t beat \u2019em? Join \u2019em. \u201cEverybody is going to be watching,\u201d McConnell said about Thursday night\u2019s event. We\u2019ll get the survey results Wednesday, but early indications, she said, show that Trump is taking the lead in most categories. We definitely vote for Trump to go snorkeling with.
