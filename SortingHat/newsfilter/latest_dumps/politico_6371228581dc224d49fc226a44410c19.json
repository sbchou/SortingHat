The lone woman in the field, Fiorina's standing in the polls has increased in the wake of a strong performance in the Aug. 6 undercard debate. But the former Hewlett-Packard CEO was in danger of being excluded from the next primetime debate because of the timeframe of the established polling criteria -- and CNN and the RNC were under increasing pressure to find a way to include her on the stage.\nUnder the changes revealed Tuesday, Fiorina would likely make the cut: CNN announced that it would allow any candidate who ranked in the top 10 between the last debate on Aug. 6 and Sept. 10 into the primetime debate.\nAccording to multiple campaign operatives who were on the Tuesday CNN call announcing the new rules, no campaign representatives voiced disagreement about the rules change but there were conflicting accounts as to whether that was because the floor for that call was not opened up to ask questions or whether campaign operatives on the call simply didn't pipe up. The discussion then turned to debate details such as the number of spin rooms and the amount of space available for supporters at the venue.\n\"They went through all the logistics but on the front end, and again they delayed the call, it was supposed to be at 1 and they moved it to 5,\" one top operative of a Republican campaign said of the Tuesday call. \"And they said 'we're going to read a statement from CNN and we will not be taking questions or comments about this statement and that's where they then read the statement about the rules change and there was no opportunity. They were not going to allow anyone to comment -- express pleasure, displeasure about that.\"\nCampaign operatives who were on both calls described the Wednesday RNC conference call as the latest in its series of alternating calls going over logistics about the next debate. Those calls happen every other week and had been scheduled in advance of Tuesday's news -- a reflection of the urgency and pressure organizers feel in making sure campaigns feel looped into debate planning. The call, which lasted about 10 minutes, was solely about logistical aspects of the next debate -- such as ticketing.\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\nRNC chief strategist and communications director Sean Spicer said Wednesday the line was open to participants on the call and nobody asked questions in response to the announcement. The discussion then quickly moved to Sept. 16 debate logistics.\n\"Throughout the call probably at least seven different people voiced at different times like 'hey, hold on a second,' or 'can you explain further, that's going to be a problem,'\" Spicer said, adding that after the announcement that \"there was a pause\" and \"all the lines were open\" but nobody asked questions on the announcement.\nEven so, some campaigns were frustrated by the timing of the two calls and questioned why there wasn't just one long call to go over logistics questions and also discuss the rules change.\n\"So why don't you just do this all at once?\" a chief strategist for a Republican presidential campaign on the call said. \"But my guess is they didn't want to make this announcement to everybody and then have a longer call where people could start airing their grievances.\"\nThe cable networks, Spicer explained, are given the option to either pick their own date to hold a call or to simply piggyback on the bi-weekly call. Going forward, he said, there could be one big call to go over debate criteria and also answer questions from both the RNC and the network cohosting the debate.\nKatie Glueck and Hadas Gold contributed to this report.\n\n                                            By \nNicholas Carr\n\n\n                                            By \nJeff Smith\n\n\n                                            By \nPhilip Gordon\n\n\n                                            By \nMichael Kazin\n\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "The RNC's multiple debate calls", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/2016-debates-gop-rnc-briefs-campaigns-213257", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Burgess Everett", "Sean Spicer", "Rachael Bade", "Hillary Clinton", "Helena Bottemiller Evich", "Hadas Gold", "Nicholas Carr", "Dylan Byers", "Cheryl Mills", "Patrick Murray", "Christine Sexton", "Richard Martyn", "Nahal Toosi", "Jules Johnston", "Annie Karni", "Josh Gerstein", "Katie Glueck", "Rand Paul", "Ben Schreckinger", "Isaac Dovere", "Jeb Bush", "Seung Min Kim", "Steve Ricchetti", "De Blasio", "Philip Gordon", "Alex Spence", "Eliza Collins", "Elizabeth Warren", "Sarah Wheaton", "Andrew Glass", "Carly Fiorina", "Jeff Smith", "Donald Trump", "Barbara Mikulski", "Melissa Mark", "Daniel Strauss", "Michael Kazin", "Alev Scott", "Rick Scott", "Rick Perry"], "orgs": ["AHCA", "Congress", "RNC", "Hispanic Council", "Commission", "HEALEY", "Republican National Committee", "Senate Foreign Relations Committee", "Gallup", "Planned Parenthood", "GOP"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30861, "fullname": "daniel strauss", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-09-02 19:46:26", "org": "politico", "article_id": "6371228581dc224d49fc226a44410c19", "date_access": "2015-09-02 18:50:10.998790"}
