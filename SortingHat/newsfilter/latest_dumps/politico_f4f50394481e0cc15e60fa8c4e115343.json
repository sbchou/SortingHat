Option B you have 0% chance of being President. Knowing Biden, which option do we think he chooses?\u201d\nHOWARD FINEMAN, \u201cBiden Said No Before. Why Run Now?\u201d: \u201cSo what happened to change Biden\u2019s mind? Based on several sources close to him ... here are the reasons: 1. Friends\u2019 encouragement ... 2. The Clintons ... [P]rivately, he looks down on what he regards as a political/money-making machine. He sees the Clintons as far more interested in cash and clout than in doing good. ... 3. Polls ... [T]he polls in early August show that he has at least a plausible path to relevance, if not victory. ...\n\u201c4. Media dynamics ... Clinton has terrible press relations; Joe Biden has held a genial, family-style summer picnic for reporters and their families for years. ... 5. Schedule Both parties agreed to push back the start of the caucus and primary season this cycle ... 6. The Irish: It\u2019s been a long time since the descendants of the Kennedys ran American politics, and Biden, in a way, is the last of the old breed. ... 7.

Many Democrats fret that she seems more impatient than hungry, more cautious than charismatic. They are increasingly concerned that ... there is no backup if something blows up \u2014 no Jimmy Garoppolo to step in while Brady is suspended for four games.\n\u201cPotent friends of America\u2019s lord of latte, [Starbucks chairman and CEO] Howard Schultz, have been pressing him to join the Democratic primary, thinking the time is right for someone who\u2019s not a political lifer. For the passionate 62-year-old \u2014 watching the circus from Seattle \u2014 it may be a tempting proposition. ...\n\u201cBiden is also talking to friends, family and donors about jumping in. The 72-year-old vice president has been having meetings at his Washington residence to explore the idea of taking on Hillary in Iowa and New Hampshire. ... It could be awkward for President Obama, who detoured from the usual route \u2014 supporting your vice president \u2014 and basically passed the torch to Hillary.\n\u201cSome in Obama\u2019s circle do not understand why he laid out the red carpet ... \u2018He has no idea how much the Clintons dislike him,\u2019 said one former top White House official. ... Since the funeral, Obama has often kept a hand on Biden\u2019s back, as if to give him strength.
