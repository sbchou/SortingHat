Jeb Bush in 2006. | Brian Smith/Corbis\nNearly every candidate in the overstuffed field of candidates is well off, but for six of them money has played a particularly significant role in their lives and in their campaigns.\nIt\u2019s not just Trump: The 2016 field is the richest ever, and it's not just because of one self-promoting billionaire.\n  The art of Trump\u2019s first deal by Michael Kruse and Josh Gerstein\n  Political connections fed Bush\u2019s pocketbook and his war chest by Eli Stokols\n  Fear of debt drove Clinton\u2019s dash for cash by Annie Karni and Isabelle Taft\n Sanders\u2019 rhetoric full of money, not his bank account by Michael Kruse\n Walker\u2019s salary sacrifice paid political dividends by Tarini Parti\n Book deals rewrote Rubio\u2019s story of financial woe by Marc Caputo and Manu Raju\nCONTRIBUTORS: Research for this project was done by Kristen East, Aaron Mak, Isabelle Taft, Christina Animashaun and Tarini Parti.\nJeb Bush stood before supporters in Tallahassee, the Florida capital over which he presided for eight years, and vowed in his first policy speech as a presidential candidate last June to halt the \u201crevolving door\u201d between Congress and K Street.\n\u201cWe need a president willing to challenge the whole culture in our nation\u2019s capital \u2014 and I mean to do it,\u201d Bush vowed at that June event.\nBut the promise was undercut both by the audience to which Bush spoke \u2014 which included numerous lobbyists from his days as governor \u2014 and by the intensity with which Bush replenished his personal bank accounts upon leaving office by cashing in on the connections he had made. When it came to Florida, at least, he wasn\u2019t the man who stopped the revolving door \u2014 he was a beneficiary.\nAfter two terms as governor, Bush left office in 2007 with a net worth of just $1.3 million \u2014 but within seven years, according to a POLITICO analysis of his financial disclosure forms, he had built it up to $24.89 million. His new wealth was driven by income from consulting work and a dozen board seats on the firms of people with significant business interests before the state while he was governor \u2014 including more than$12 million from firms that earned millions in fees when Bush redirected $350 million of Florida public workers' retirement funds into venture capital investments run by major donors to his brother and his campaigns. \nThe effort to build up Bush\u2019s bank account was a highly calculated affair \u2014 openly mentioned by his mother, Barbara, as far back as 2003 \u2014 to ensure that should this third Bush seek to enter national politics, he\u2019d have the ability to do so without worrying about his family finances.\n\nCongress\n\n            By \nBurgess Everett\n\n\u201cJeb Bush maximized the abuse of the revolving door,\u201d said Craig Holman, a Washington lobbyist with Public Citizen, a nonpartisan watchdog group. \u201cNot only did it enrich him, it allows him to be the number one fundraiser in the presidential field. This is a business relationship, going both ways.\u201d\nIndeed, Bush's political advocacy, personal income and campaign fundraising are interwoven to an extent unusual even among longtime politicians. Both his personal wealth and the giant $120 million fundraising behemoth he has built \u2014 more than twice that of his nearest competitor \u2014 draw heavily on people and business interests with which he interacted as governor.\nBush\u2019s approach to earning money \u2014 often utilizing business contacts made through his own or his family members\u2019 political careers \u2014 is shared by his three brothers, and the need to earn large amounts of money in the intervals between times in public office was drummed into his head by both of his parents.\nIn the 1980s, when Jeb was in his early 30s, with three young children, he contemplated a run for Congress. His father told him he wouldn\u2019t be able to live on a congressional salary; he needed to earn more money first. \u201cJeb was learning the family dictum that had been established by his grandfather,\u201d reported Peter and Rochelle Schweizer in their largely flattering family biography \u201cThe Bushes.\u201d \u201cRun for office only when you\u2019ve made enough for the family to be comfortable.\u201d\nAnd being comfortable, by Bush standards, meant achieving significant wealth. The same Schweizer biography sketches a scene in 2003, when Jeb\u2019s mother, Barbara, and aunt Nancy Ellis are paddling around the pool in Kennebunkport, Maine, discussing Jeb\u2019s presidential hopes: \u201c \u2018He\u2019s running out of money,\u2019 she [Barbara] said, indicating that she and Jeb had talked about the subject. \u2018He\u2019s not making any money as governor of Florida. And he needs to make some more money before does something like that.\u2019 \u201c\n\n2016\n\n            By \nBen Schreckinger\n\nIndeed, just three months after leaving the governor\u2019s office in the spring of 2007, Jeb joined the board of Tenet Healthcare, the medical services conglomerate that receives Florida\u2019s Medicare business. It was his first publicized business move after eight years as Florida\u2019s governor \u2014 and the first of many that enabled him to capitalize on his work in the public sector to replenish \u2014 and vastly exceed \u2014 the $2 million in wealth he had when he entered the governor's office.\nSince 2007, Bush has earned nearly $2.4 million from Tenet in cash fees and stock awards, according to the company's SEC filings.\nWhile Bush was on its board, Tenet lobbied Congress to pass Obamacare, estimated to deliver the company up to $100 million in new earnings. That could be a political liability for Bush in a competitive GOP primary to be decided by an electorate that loathes the president\u2019s landmark health care law. But it\u2019s already clear that his relationship with Tenet is paying dividends in another way: the company\u2019s employees gave a combined $100,000 to Right to Rise in the year\u2019s first two quarters. \nThat's still small change compared to the donations Bush has harvested from his association with William Oberndorf, a San Francisco venture capitalist and staunch supporter of education privatization, who gave $1,511,897 to Right to Rise this year. Their mutually beneficial relationship goes back to Bush\u2019s governorship, when the state of Florida spent heavily to implement a literacy curriculum created by a company called Voyager, which was started in Dallas by Randy Best, a major donor to George H.W. Bush\u2019s presidential campaign.\nOberndorf had invested in the company and served as chairman of its board; in 2011, he sold his stock in the company for $4.9 million. Since then, he has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Jeb Bush\u2019s Foundation for Excellence in Education.\nMeanwhile, after leaving office, Bush became a senior adviser to another of Best's education companies, earning $60,000 per year, plus stock.\nOn his financial disclosure form, Bush also discloses his work for Florida companies including Rayonier, a timber company that paid him $868,738 from 2008-14 for his service on its board; and Swisher Hygiene, a custodial supply company owned by former Miami Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga that paid Bush $186,325 (and much more in cash fees and stock awards) for five years of service on its board.\n\n                            Clockwise: The condominium in Coral Gables where Jeb Bush lives; Bush golfing with his brother, then-President George W. Bush, and his father, George H.W. Bush, in Kennenbunkport, Maine, 2001; and Bush and his wife, Columba. | GC3 Devleopment, Associated Press, Getty Images\nBush\u2019s history with Rayonier goes back to 1999. Soon after taking office, Bush persuaded the Connecticut-based company to relocate its headquarters to Jacksonville, Florida. Then, in 2001, he approved the state of Florida paying $4.6 million to Rayonier Inc. for the logging rights to a 6,000-acre piece of swampland near Jacksonville, part of an effort to preserve wetlands critical to conservation of the state\u2019s fragile coastline. A state audit later found the state paid too much for the property.\nAfter Bush left office and was appointed to the company\u2019s board, collecting $868,739 over six years, Rayonier continued to sell land to the state. During Bush's tenure on the board, the company urged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to reject a new accounting regulation that would have forced companies to more accurately report the value of their property to governments and to ensure that firms are paying required taxes. The company is also facing a 100-page class action lawsuit that stems from investors' complaints that the firm overstated its earnings when Bush was on its board.\nWith Bush now a candidate for president, Rayonier Foundation has contributed $50,000 to Right to Rise and the company\u2019s CEO, Lee Thomas, has himself written the super PAC a check for $1,000.\nOf all his private sector work since leaving office, Bush\u2019s tenure as an adviser to an international bank, the London-based Barclays, was far more lucrative \u2014 and it continues to yield significant dividends for his presidential bid.\n\n\n\n            By \nEliza Collins\n\nBush joined Barclays following the 2009 collapse of Lehman Brothers, the investment bank that first hired him as an adviser and was later purchased by Barclays. Both companies had taken over some of Florida\u2019s pension fund while Bush was governor. Steven Lessing, who\u2019d been a \u201cRanger\u201d for George W. Bush, an honorary title bestowed on bundlers who brought in more than $200,000 for his 2004 presidential reelection campaign, oversaw the firm\u2019s client relations at the time and utilized Bush to share his insights on government and business with Barclays\u2019 clients.\nBy all accounts, Jeb Bush worked assiduously on the firm\u2019s behalf; and he was compensated to the tune of $2 million a year, his campaign said in July when it released 33 years of tax returns and financial forms. Lessing, now a bundler for Bush\u2019s campaign, continues to work hard for Jeb. He\u2019s written a personal check to Right to Rise for $276,762 and secured more than $1 million in contributions from other donors, including 33 Barclays employees who each gave between $5,000 and $25,000 to Right to Rise.\n\u201cThis is a product of what appears to be good planning by Jeb Bush,\u201d said Public Citizen\u2019s Holman. \u201cHe developed relationships with the business community while he was serving as governor and then took very lucrative positions after leaving office and no doubt was planning on running for president. I suspect these businesses understood that, which is why they gave him these plum positions \u2014 they were interested in developing relationships with someone who can help your company once they become president.\u201d\nSome of Bush\u2019s connections were subtle, and reflected the extent to which his political views, the interests of his supporters, and his personal finances were intertwined. For example, in 2009, two years after his second term ended, Bush publicly pushed for an increase in electric rates, arguing that a reliable energy grid demanded it.\n\u201cWith power, the cash registers open and close,\u201d Bush began an op-ed, published in the Tallahassee Democrat.\nAs a former governor, his opinion carried weight. But he didn\u2019t disclose in the piece that Armando Olivera, the chief executive of the prime beneficiary, Florida Power and Light at the time of the proposed rate hike, was an investor in BH Global Aviation, the offshore private equity fund Bush set up in November 2014 that has raised more than $60 million, mostly from foreign investors, that has reportedly invested in a Chinese aviation company. By incorporating the fund in the United Kingdom, Bush and his investors are able to sidestep U.S. taxes and regulations. \nAnd the parent company of Florida Power and Light, NextEra Energy, is now the largest corporate donor to Bush\u2019s Right to Rise super PAC, contributing $1,025,000. (The company\u2019s current CEO, James Robo, has also contributed $2,700 to Bush\u2019s campaign.)\nBut delicately leveraging personal relationships from a life in public office to make money in the private sector and fund future campaigns is hardly a phenomenon unique to Bush; and his associates don\u2019t see anything wrong with it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of unfair to accuse Jeb of working the system,\u201d said Brian Ballard, a Tallahassee lobbyist who is supporting Bush\u2019s campaign. \u201cHe had every opportunity in the world to make tens of millions of dollars as a former governor and I know he walked away from many opportunities to make easy money.\n\u201cHe served on boards of many Florida corporations that he believed in. They hired him because they respected his intellect, his business acumen and his deep knowledge of the intersection of politics and government.\u201d\nBush's campaign points to his unusual levels of transparency to show that he welcomed scrutiny of his financial dealings and had nothing to hide.\n\"While governor, he did not engage in any discussions regarding his return to the private sector and did nothing to give preferred treatment to any company,\" said Kristy Campbell, a spokesperson for Bush's campaign. \"Gov. Bush's strong record of leadership and integrity is evidenced in the 280,000 emails he has made available via jebemails.com .... Gov. Bush has also recently released 33 years of tax returns so voters could see for themselves exactly how he earned a living over the past three decades and how much of that he has paid in taxes. Any insinuation Gov. Bush did anything inappropriate is absurd.\"\nNonetheless, in an election cycle that has seen anti-establishment candidates like Donald Trump and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders harness a deep resentment of what many Americans view as a corrupt political class, the mere appearance of insider dealing is a vulnerability opponents plan to exploit.\n\u201cMoney helps. I\u2019m playing by the rules of the game, the way it\u2019s laid out,\u201d Bush told POLITICO\u2019s Mike Allen this summer at a conference of Koch brothers donors in Southern California. \u201cAnd if people don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s just tough luck.\u201d\nTrump, who currently leads the polls of the GOP primary field, has contrasted his willingness to spend his own fortune on the race with Bush\u2019s reliance on a giant war chest from others. Self-funding, says Trump, gives him political independence.\nSpeaking in Iowa before touring the state fair in August, Trump said he knows the donors who are giving money to Bush and Hillary Clinton: \u201cThese are not people who are doing it because they like the color of his hair, believe me. These are highly sophisticated killers; and when they give $5 million or $2 million or $1 million to Jeb, they have him just like a puppet. He\u2019ll do whatever they want.\u201d\nBush allies, however, point to his transparency \u2014 he released 33 years of tax returns and 280,000 emails from his time in office \u2014 as evidence that he knows he\u2019s done nothing wrong.\nMoreover, the understanding that even greater scrutiny will be applied should Bush wind up winning the White House would diminish the likelihood of the candidate\u2019s biggest benefactors benefitting further in a third Bush administration.\n\u201cThe worst thing that\u2019ll happen for these companies is that he gets elected,\u201d Ballard said. \u201cThey\u2019ll never get anything from the White House because every reporter in Washington would say, \u2018You got that because Jeb was on your board.\u2019 And he\u2019s smart enough to know that.\u201d\nEli Stokols is a national politics reporter.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Firms that boosted his net worth after leaving office helped his record campaign fundraising.", "title": "Political connections fed Bush\u2019s pocketbook and his war chest", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/jeb-bush-candidate-wealth-2016-213315", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "personality"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Sara Solovitch", "Burgess Everett", "Jesse Rifkin", "Henry C.
