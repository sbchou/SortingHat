Fallon for The Washington Post)  DANA POINT, Calif. -- Charles Koch steers one of the biggest private corporations in the United States and leads a network of conservative groups that serves as a major force in American politics. But the billionaire industrialist dismisses the idea that he commands great influence. \u201cThere are so many things I would change!\u201d Koch told The Washington Post Monday in an exclusive interview. \u201cIf I had all this power, why aren\u2019t they getting changed? This is ludicrous.\u201d During a wide-ranging conversation in his suite at the seaside resort where Koch and other wealthy donors gathered this weekend, he weighed in on the White House race, money in politics and climate change. Here are some of the highlights of our conversation: Q: I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t ask you about the 2016 presidential race. A: Last count, there are 126 Republicans running. Who are my three favorites? I don\u2019t know, because I don\u2019t know most of them. Q: Do you have a favorite at this point? A: No. Q: Do you have a couple you think most highly of? A: Well, we\u2019ve named five that we think have some combination of probability of winning the nomination and of having the most issues that we agree on. [Earlier this year, Koch told USA Today that he and his brother David were considering Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida.] We don\u2019t agree with any of them on all the issues. [Charles Koch\u2019s focus on \u2018injustices\u2019 is fueled by an unlikely partnership] Q: How important is it to you to see a Republican in the White House? A: It depends on the Republican. I am not a Republican. I consider myself a classical liberal. I believe in certain principles and I am looking for candidates who are advancing those principles. The trajectory of this country is not positive and particularly for the disadvantaged, as we see what\u2019s happening. The gains in productivity have dropped, the gains in income for the middle class and the least advantaged have slowed, at best. So what I\u2019m looking at is policies that will change that. And so generally what happens, over time, the growth of government and the intrusiveness in people\u2019s lives has been almost identical in Republican and Democratic administrations. I like a lot of the Republican rhetoric better than the Democrats\u2019. But when they\u2019re in office, it\u2019s pretty much the same thing. It\u2019s serving their supporters, it\u2019s corporate welfare, it\u2019s cronyism which is so destructive, particularly to the disadvantaged. I think the Democrats are taking us down the road to serfdom at 100 miles an hour, and I think the Republicans are taking us at 70 miles an hour. If we can have a candidate like Calvin Coolidge that would reverse that trajectory, or like [former prime minister William] Gladstone did in Great Britain, man, I would shout it to the world. But I haven\u2019t seen that yet. Q: The network you helped create is now arguably one of the most powerful forces in American politics -- A: Gosh, I hope you\u2019re right. I haven\u2019t seen that as much. People like to overstate the case. [Billionaire Koch brothers\u2019 network takes cue from Obama\u2019s playbook] Q: What do you say to those who believe you have too much influence? A: Wow, believe me, if I had too much, a lot of things would change. Just like the very things we\u2019ve been talking about -- this trend toward a two-tiered society and the trajectory we\u2019re on that\u2019s taking us there and criminal justice. There are over 1,000 low-income occupations that in some communities, you\u2019ve got to get a license. Florist: what, you\u2019re going to stick your finger? Bartender: he\u2019s going to\u00a0make your drink too strong? I mean, this is nonsense! Q: How is it fair that people who have more money have more of a voice in politics? Isn\u2019t that an imbalance? A: Well, voice, what does that mean? I mean, the government is largely influenced by people who advocate corporate welfare and advocate these policies that create this two-tiered society \u2026 So I mean, a voice, yeah, we get more press. You all are interested in what we say. But are we really having an influence? I mean, I would get rid of all the corporate welfare. We fight against all of it. We make a lot of money out all this corporate welfare because we can\u2019t do anything about it. If you aren\u2019t allowed to export natural gas -- we are the biggest industrial user of natural gas. We use 4 percent of the industrial consumption of natural gas. And if it was allowed to fully export, the price of natural gas would go up, our costs would go up \u2026 But I believe unless we do that, we\u2019re not going to preserve our free society. Q: How concerned are you about the administration\u2019s new emissions policy? A: I\u2019m very concerned because the poorest Americans use three time the energy as the percentage of their income as the average American does. This is going to disproportionately hurt the poor. It may make the whole electric grid unstable, depending on how it is enforced. And it does nothing for the climate. Even the U.N. and EPA studies show that. Q: Are you worried about climate change? A: Well, I mean I believe it\u2019s been warming some. There\u2019s a big debate on that, because it depends on whether you use satellite measurements, balloon, or you use ground ones that have been adjusted. But there has been warming. The CO2 goes up, the CO2 has probably contributed to that. But they say it\u2019s going to be catastrophic. There is no evidence to that. They have these models that show it, but the models don\u2019t work \u2026 To be scientific, it has to be testable and refutable. And so I mean, it has elements of science in it, and then of conjecture, ideology and politics. So do we want to create a catastrophe today in the economy because of some speculation based on models that don\u2019t work? Those are my questions. But believe me, I spent my whole life studying science and the philosophy of science, and our whole company is committed to science. We have all sorts of scientific developments. But I want it to be real science, not politicized science. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Charles Koch on the 2016 race, climate change and whether he has too much power", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/04/charles-koch-on-the-2016-race-climate-change-and-whether-he-has-too-much-power/", "topics": ["economy"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Charles Koch", "Calvin Coolidge", "Jeb Bush", "Patrick T.
