{"body": "Joe Biden dominated the 2016 conversation on social media this weekend.  Here\u2019s what talk of Biden potentially entering the presidential contest looks like in the media echo chamber. You can see that mentions of him on Saturday far eclipsed any day in the previous two weeks and started as Maureen Dowd\u2019s column entered the bloodstream.     Just to provide some perspective, here\u2019s the total mentions of Biden alongside those of Jeb during the last two weeks of July. There were nearly five times as many mentions of the former Florida governor as there were of the sitting vice president, according to our analytics partners at Zignal Labs.     But, over this weekend, there was more media interest in Biden than Bush. Reports that he was \u201cactively exploring a presidential run\u201d are what sparked the intense chatter:     But Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer weighed in with a reality check, tweeting Sunday: \u201cHere\u2019s an uncomfortable reality, 90% of the people being quoted today as \u2018Sources Close to Biden,\u2019 know nothing about the VP\u2019s thinking.\u201d\n   Sen. Marco Rubio this spring (Reuters/Gary Cameron)  DANA POINT, Calif.\u2013 Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) pronounced\u00a0himself \u201cdeeply\u201d concerned about racial profiling Sunday but then said that he is not sure Congress can do much about it. Fielding questions during the Koch network donor summit at a luxury resort on the Pacific Ocean, the Republican presidential candidate was asked about the spate of African American deaths at the hands of law enforcement, from Texas to Ohio and Missouri.   \u201cI don\u2019t think we as a society can ignore that in many communities across this country the relationship between local law enforcement and the African American community is at an all-time low,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bottom line is you have millions of Americans, particularly young African-American males, who feel like police departments target them on a regular basis.\u201d  After saying he has \u201ctremendous respect\u201d for law enforcement, Rubio volunteered that he personally knows people \u201cwho have told me they have been stopped, in any given year, 10 to 12 times.\u201d  \u201cAnd they believe they are being targeted because of their race,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is deeply concerning.\u201d   But Rubio had no federal prescription to treat this dire diagnosis.    \u201cI don\u2019t know if there is a law we can pass in Congress to change that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do think it is incumbent upon local communities to improve the relationship between law enforcement and the community that they are there to serve and protect.\u201d   \u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "\n\nRight to Rise, the super PAC supporting\u00a0GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush, raised\u00a0about\u00a0$811,000 from lobbyists and lobby firms,\u00a0mostly from Washington and Florida,\u00a0during the first half of 2015.
