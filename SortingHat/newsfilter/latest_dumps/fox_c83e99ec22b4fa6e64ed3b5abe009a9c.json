He's since defended his comments, while also fighting back against any suggestion in the media that he wants to use drones to target actual border crossers.\u00a0\nCarson said in an interview on Sunday that the caves \u201ccan be eliminated\u201d as \u201cone of a number of possibilities\u201d toward stopping the flow of illegal immigration.\nHowever, he also told CNN, \u201cIn no way did I suggest that drones be used to kill people. \u2026 And I said to the media at the time, \u2018Some of you are going to say Carson wants to use drones to kill people on the border.\u2019 How ridiculous.\u201d\nOn Monday, Carson communications director Doug Watts told FoxNews.com Carson was convinced after his border visit last week that a network of smuggler tunnels could be eradicated and acknowledged that the candidate has vowed to \u201cdo whatever it takes to protect the American people.\u201d\nBut Watts also repeatedly said Carson, a retired pediatric neurosurgeon, has never intended to use drones against people.\n\n\u201cAfter hearing what he heard, seeing what he saw, [Carson] believes that the American people will stand behind what he said,\u201d Watts told FoxNews.com. \u201cWe have a security crisis on the border. This is not about illegal immigrants. We\u2019re at war with hardened criminals, drug smugglers and human traffickers.\u201d\u00a0\nTo be sure, Trump, who is now leading the GOP field, has forced essentially all 17 major GOP candidates to take a position on difficult illegal immigration issues, and Carson is no exception.\u00a0\nThe billionaire businessman began his candidacy in June by vowing to build a wall along the southern border. And most recently, he suggested the country\u2019s longstanding birthright citizenship policies are open to legal challenge -- effectively pushing the GOP field further to the right on the issue.\nCarson spoke at a rally in Phoenix on Tuesday and gave two interviews on Wednesday during his visit to Arizona\u2019s border with Mexico that included talks with sheriff officers and a helicopter tour of the region.\n\u201cI\u2019d get rid of [smugglers'] hideouts,\u201d Carson said Wednesday, as part of a larger plan that includes surveillance drones, the U.S. military, more border agents and a more formidable border wall to stop the flow of illegal immigrants.", "byline": "", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson is going a step beyond rival Donald Trump in his hard-line proposals to curb illegal immigration, suggesting drone strikes along the southern border.", "title": "Carson flanks Trump, floats drones for border wars", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/BzzWVmyrxzw/", "topics": ["immigration", "mexico"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Ben Carson", "Doug Watts"], "orgs": ["GOP"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-08-25 08:30:58", "org": "fox", "article_id": "c83e99ec22b4fa6e64ed3b5abe009a9c", "date_access": "2015-08-25 05:20:03.425029"}
