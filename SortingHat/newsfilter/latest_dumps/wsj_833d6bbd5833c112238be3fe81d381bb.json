{"body": "To say Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails have been getting some attention is like saying Donald Trump has taken a bit of a liking to Twitter.\nWhile there have been few big revelations\u00a0in the thousands of pages of messages released\u00a0by the State Department, the emails have more often provided a glimpse\u00a0into the more-mundane day-to-day work activities of Mrs. Clinton while secretary of state. Broken printers, scheduling issues, lost phone numbers and offhand cultural references figure into the email trail. The emails also highlight some generational quirks \u2014 and we took a closer look at how these may play to different audiences.\nSo,\u00a0what would a typical Gen Xer, Millennial or Baby Boomers think of Ms. Clinton\u2019s emails? For some lighter analysis, here\u2019s a generational review, with commentary from all three.\n* * *\nShe needs a paper copy:\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u2019s emailed requests to staffers to print articles and emails are too numerous to count. When she\u2019d been featured on the cover of\u00a0Newsweek,\u00a0Ms. Clinton decided to forego the digital copy of the article in favor of waiting and seeing \u201cit \u2018in the flesh\u2019 so to speak.\u201d\nMillennial:\u00a0Having a paper copy of something is so 2000.\nGen Xer:\u00a0Eh. I can see it. Print is still cool, for the scrapbook and the wall.\nBoomer:\u00a0I\u2019m with Hillary on this.\n* * *\nThe fax machine drives her nuts:\u00a0Fax trouble comes up now and again. Like in this exchange, where Mrs. Clinton is trying to figure out how to make it work properly, and whether she needs to hang up the line. \u201cI thought it was supposed to be off hook to work?\u201d Aide Huma Abedin responds: \u201cYes but hang up one more time. So they can reestablish the line.\u201d Mrs Clinton: \u201d I did.\u201d The response: \u201cJust pick up phone and hang it up. And leave it hung up.\u201d\nMillennial: Just take a picture on your phone and message it, duh.Gen Xer:\u00a0Faxes are the worst. \u00a0Boomer:\u00a0Better than telex. Remember those?\n* * *\nShe needs help using\u00a0the radio:\u00a0Having lost her radio signal and unable to Google the answer, Hillary Clinton emailed several State Department employees for help finding a NPR station on Long Island.\nMillennial:\u00a0Radio? Podcasts are where it\u2019s at.\nGen Xer:\u00a0 Showing some techie enterprise, but not sure why \u201cSeek\u201d wouldn\u2019t do the trick. Either the station\u2019s there or it isn\u2019t.\nBoomer:\u00a0I\u2019m with Hillary on this.\n* * *\nShe uses out of date acronyms:\u00a0After the Affordable Care Act cleared the House and headed to the president\u2019s desk for his signature, Mrs. Clinton sent a celebratory note to Rahm Emanuel, then the White House chief of staff. \u201cThx for being such a stubborn SOB,\u201d Mrs. Clinton wrote. \u00a0In another email to chief of staff Cheryl Mills, Ms. Clinton asked her to decipher some slang, also a bit dated: \u201cAnd BTW what does \u2018fubar\u2019 mean?\u201d\nMillennial:\u00a0TBH,\u00a0SMHGen Xer:\u00a0SOB is before our day, but FUBAR made us chuckle.\u00a0Boomer:\u00a0This totally makes sense.\n* * *\nShe makes references to old Broadway musicals: Here, she emails Sen. Barbara Mikulski, \u201cOh, Barb, we got trouble w a capital \u2018T\u2019 in River City,\u201d a reference to\u00a0\u201cThe Music Man,\u201d from 1957.\nMillennial:\u00a0This sounded like trouble when we walked in.\u00a0\nGen Xer:\u00a0We did this musical in school. And the Simpsons did a version of it, called \u201cMarge vs. the Monorail.\u201d\nBoomer:\u00a0Ah, takes me back.\n* * *\nShe doesn\u2019t know her phone number:\u00a0In an incident that sounds more like fiction than fact: the White House operator didn\u2019t believe she \u00a0Hillary Clinton was who she said she was and requested her direct office line. \u201cI told him I had no idea what my direct office # was since I didn\u2019t call myself,\u201d Ms. Clinton said.\nMillennial:\u00a0Who calls anyone anymore?\nGen Xer:\u00a0Who knows their phone number these days?\nBoomer:\u00a0Who doesn\u2019t know their own phone number?\nMore\nSearch Hillary Clinton\u2019s Emails\n______________________________________________________\n2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll Standings\n\n\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops. \r\n\nCapital Journal Daybreak Newsletter: Sign up to get the latest on politics, policy and defense delivered to your inbox every morning.\r\nFor the latest Washington news, follow @wsjpolitics\r\nFor outside analysis, follow @wsjthinktank", "byline": "", "description": "To say Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails have been getting some attention is like saying Donald Trump has taken a bit of a liking to Twitter.\n\nWhile there have been few big revelations in the thousands of pages of messages released by the State Department, the emails have more often provided a glimpse into the more-mundane day-to-day work activities of Mrs. Clinton while secretary of state.
