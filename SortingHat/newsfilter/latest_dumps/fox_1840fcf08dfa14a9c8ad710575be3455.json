It\u2019s just that if there\u2019s anyone who has completely misjudged this campaign cycle, it\u2019s political insiders.\nAnd media insiders. Who are sometimes indistinguishable, since they often appear on the same shows.\n\nTogether, they mocked and minimized Donald Trump as a sideshow. Among the worst offenders is the Huffington Post, which still refuses to end its little stunt of putting Trump stories in the entertainment section, with one writer calling him a \u201cfringe candidate\u201d (who happens to be the Republican presidential front-runner).\nAs Trump soared, the insiders soon shifted their stance to one of bemusement: Well, he\u2019s hot now, but he\u2019ll burn himself out. Always happens. We\u2019ve seen that movie.\nAnd now that Trump is drawing 40,000 people to an Alabama rally and beating Jeb and Marco in their home state of Florida? Well, say the insiders, thoughtfully stroking their chins, he\u2019s tapped into a deep vein of anger. We have to figure out how to connect with that anger, and we\u2019ll be fine.\nThat\u2019s progress, I guess, but they\u2019re still kind of clueless. Conservatives in particular are furious that Trump, with his ideologically checkered background, is whipping their candidates, at least for now.\nSo Politico surveyed its insider \u201ccaucus\u201d in Iowa and New Hampshire and found that seven in 10 Republicans say they\u2019re heard more than enough about Trump\u2019s immigration plan. The insiders are identified in tiny type at the bottom of the piece but granted anonymity so they can provide juicy quotes.\nSaid one Iowa Republican: \u201cHe\u2019s solidly put an anchor around the neck of our party, and we\u2019ll sink because of it.\u201d\n\u201cEnough already,\u201d vented another Iowa Republican, who like all participants was granted anonymity in order to speak freely. \u201cThis kind of garbage only appeals to the hard core \u2026 while alienating the soft middle that we must win in order to take the presidency.\u201d  Now this isn\u2019t to say that Trump hasn\u2019t complicated life for the Republican Party. By calling for an end to birthright citizenship, along with mass deportation of 11 million illegal immigrants (before many are let back in), he has put the issue front and center for a party whose last nominee lost the Hispanic vote by 44 points.\nBut he\u2019s got candidates like Jeb Bush now using the term \u201canchor babies\u201d and others saying their policy is like Trump\u2019s. That doesn\u2019t sound like the impact of a fringe candidate.\nOn the other hand, Scott Walker told CNBC\u2019s John Harwood that he doesn\u2019t have a position on birthright citizenship. Or is it that the candidate who described himself in the same interview as \u201cunintimidated\u201d doesn\u2019t want to say?\nWhat the insiders don\u2019t get is that Trump\u2019s bombastic style, and occasionally over-the-top pronouncements, tap into a rejection of the whole failed, gridlocked, special-interest-driven system. And that\u2019s in part why his street talk is important.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the people running for office are real,\u201d Trump told Time, which features him posing with an eagle. \u201cThey have to throw a lot of consultants away and be themselves. I think it is one of the things that has helped me.\u201d\nAfter two months of embarrassment, the insiders\u2014both media and political\u2014are finally starting to understand that Trump is on to something. It took three New York Times reporters to produce a front-pager yesterday with the headline \"Why Donald Trump Won't Fold\"--which was obvious to some of us right from the start:\n\"The breadth of Mr. Trump\u2019s coalition is surprising at a time of religious, ideological and geographic divisions in the Republican Party. It suggests he has the potential to outdo the flash-in-the-pan candidacies that roiled the last few Republican nominating contests.\"\nJournalists are having to \u201cDeal With It,\u201d as Time\u2019s cover says. That doesn\u2019t mean The Donald can defy gravity forever, but he has exposed the insiders as living in a highly insular bubble.\nClick for more Media Buzz.\nmedia-buzz\n\nMedia Buzz, hosted by Howard Kurtz, airs on Sundays at 11AM and 5PM ET on Fox News Channel.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this show\n\n\n\n", "byline": "", "description": "The Politico headline practically jumps off the screen:\u00a0", "title": "The \u2018Insiders\u2019 are freaking out about Trump, and that\u2019s too bad", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/M7GcMYERX0g/", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Howard Kurtz", "Jeb Bush", "Scott Walker", "John Harwood"], "orgs": ["These Insiders", "Republican Party", "CNBC"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-08-24 10:00:27", "org": "fox", "article_id": "1840fcf08dfa14a9c8ad710575be3455", "date_access": "2015-08-24 10:00:05.815257"}
