{"body": "CONCORD, N.H. \u2013 It took a New Hampshire farmer to show that Senator Bernie Sanders could land a political punch squarely on Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\nMr. Sanders, who has foresworn personal attacks on Mrs. Clinton as they compete for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, stuck to high-minded rhetoric during the first 30 minutes of a campaign event here on Wednesday. After taking a question about ending discrimination against gay and transgender Americans in the military \u2014 which he said he would do \u2014 another audience member, Jeanny Aldrich from Chesterfield, N.H., stood and said, \u201cI have a much bigger question for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be just the party that takes away from Hillary \u2013 I want to kick her butt,\u201d said Ms. Aldrich, a longtime Democrat who owns a produce and livestock farm.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t we ask Hillary to give up her spot and give it to you?\u201d she added to sustained applause from the room of about 125 people at New England College.\n\nMr. Sanders barely suppressed a grin.\n\n\u201cI could be wrong, but I suspect she would disagree with you,\u201d he said.\n\nThen he pivoted and used the moment to make clear that he won\u2019t simply play patty-cake with Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic nomination. He said eh would fight her on the issues instead.\n\n\u201cI have voted against every major trade agreement since I have been in office,\u201d said Mr. Sanders, who became Vermont\u2019s congressman in 1990 and has been a United States senator since 2007. Referring to his opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal now before Congress, he offered his toughest words yet about Mrs. Clinton by name:\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton can be for the trade agreement \u2014 the president is. She can be against the trade agreement \u2014 I am, Elizabeth Warren is, many of us are. I just don\u2019t know how you don\u2019t have an opinion on this enormously important issue, which is her view.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders, in invoking Ms. Warren, the Massachusetts senator and a fellow progressive, was seeking to align liberal forces in opposition to Mrs. Clinton over the trade deal. Mrs. Clinton praised the pact in the past but, as a presidential candidate, has raised concerns about it.\n\nMs. Aldrich said afterward that she believed Mrs. Clinton would represent elite and wealthy interests as president. \u201cWe need a candidate who understands the struggles of average people, and that\u2019s not Hillary,\u201d said Ms. Aldrich, who supported John Edwards and then Barack Obama over Mrs. Clinton in the 2008 Democratic nomination fight.\n\nSenator Sanders held his first major campaign rally on Tuesday in his hometown of Burlington, Vt., and is on a political swing through New Hampshire \u2013 which holds the first presidential primary in 2016 \u2013 before heading to Iowa on Thursday.\n", "byline": "PATRICK HEALY", "description": "It took a New Hampshire farmer to show that Senator Bernie Sanders could land a political punch squarely on Hillary Rodham Clinton.", "title": "First Draft: Bernie Sanders Attacks Hillary Clinton Directly on Trade Deal", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/05/27/bernie-sanders-attacks-hillary-clinton-directly-on-trade-deal/", "topics": ["trade"], "people": ["Hillary Clinton", "Jeanny Aldrich", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Barack Obama", "Elizabeth Warren", "John Edwards", "Bernie Sanders"], "orgs": ["Congress"], "authors": [{"author_id": 586, "fullname": "patrick healy", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-05-27 20:09:32", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "eadcfdd5889e11d305828e6bab91684c", "date_access": "2015-05-27 19:24:18.369345"}
