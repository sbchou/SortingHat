It\u2019s the first video in a series of installments of a faux campaign the organization plans to carry on through Election Day. One video will be released every month.\n\u201cOther candidates may beat around the bush (or Clinton \u2014 whatever you\u2019re into), but I\u2019m here to keep things honest: I owe my entire political career to special interests and lobbyists, and if elected, I\u2019ll spend my presidency paying them back while screwing over the American people,\u201d he says in his announcement. \u201cLike most politicians, I\u2019ll exploit a broken system and sell you out to keep my campaign funded \u2014 but at least I\u2019ll sell you out to your face.\u201d\nThe video \u2014 which features \u201cHonest Gil,\u201d played by actor Frank L. Ridley, doing classic campaign-style things while being unusually candid about his motives \u2014 has already garnered 1 million views through various websites, according to represent.us.\n\u201cI may not be qualified to be president, but a dramatic camera angle can make me look like a president,\u201d Gil says on the video as a montage of him talking with people and pointing into the distance plays. \u201cA president with the conviction to nod, the courage to point and the experience to cram buzzwords into everything I \u2014 jobs.\u201d \nGil \u201cran\u201d in Kentucky senator's race against Mitch McConnell and Alison Lundergan Grimes in 2014, with a similar campaign. \nSince the video was released on Sunday, his \u201ccampaign\u201d has raised more than $25,000 for Represent.us \u2014 halfway toward the goal the group had set to accomplish over 50 days. \n\u201cIt\u2019s really to shine a light on how American politics really work and I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s resonating so much,\u201d Represent.us director Josh Silver told POLITICO. \u201cIn some ways, it's similar to the way Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are resonating with primary voters ... they\u2019re both calling out the corrupt, money-driven political system and it's resonating with voters.\u201d \nGil\u2019s campaign ads are just one of the ways Represent.us will reach out to Americans. They\u2019ll also send Ridley \u2014 who has appeared in \u201cOrange is The New Black\u201d and \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d \u2014 to the New Hampshire primaries \u201cto do some antics,\u201d according to Silver.\n\u201cThe issue of money and politics is the most critical domestic political crisis of our time. It\u2019s because money is blocking progress on nearly every issue in government,\u201d Silver said. \u201cRegardless of whether you care about liberal or conservative issues, it\u2019s not the best ideas that are progressing, it is those with the deepest pockets.\u201d \nRepresent.us wants to get states to add anti-corruption ballot measures. The most promising so far is \u201cThe South Dakota Government Accountability and Anti-Corruption Act,\u201d which is \"a proposal to prevent political bribery, improve transparency, and increase enforcement of South Dakota\u2019s ethics laws.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Parody candidate raises $25,000 for anti-corruption campaign", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/gil-fulbright-parody-campaign-ad-anti-corruption-213939", "topics": ["abortion", "personality"], "people": ["Gil Fulbright", "Burgess Everett", "Jack Shafer", "Kenneth P.
