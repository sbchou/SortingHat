{"body": "   Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) speaks at the Freedom Summit in Des Moines in late January. (AP)  Congress returns to Washington after the Independence Day break with a slate of hefty items on the to-do list. But at least one leading social conservative wants to ensure that lawmakers spend a few minutes discussing the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision to legalize same-sex marriage. Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) says he is working on introducing a nonbinding resolution of disapproval against the high court\u2019s ruling. \u201cWe should bring it to the floor and have a debate and let people register their positions,\u201d he said in an interview Monday afternoon. The vote might also be a way to get the growing number of Republican presidential candidates to weigh in on the matter. King says that, so far, he has heard \u201ca good number of tepid responses from our presidential candidates on this.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s important to let the public know where they stand,\u201d he said. Every major Republican presidential candidate said they disagree with the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, but several, including former Florida governor Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), have said that they will respect the court\u2019s ruling. It\u2019s unclear whether Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and his leadership team would ever allow a vote. But given that virtually all GOP lawmakers have expressed disagreement with the court ruling, it might be a vote worth holding. King admitted that previous nonbinding resolutions passed after similar court rulings \u201cdidn\u2019t change anything \u2014 it just sent a message.\u201d But he said holding a vote on the resolution is important to let the nine justices know that members of another branch of government are yet again upset with one of their rulings. \u201cIf the state legislatures were to pass laws that established same-sex marriage in the states and if they established reciprocity from the other states, that would be the voice of the public making this decision,\u201d King said. \u201cWhat I reject is an activist court with no basis for this decision transforming the greatest civilization we\u2019ve ever seen by a 5-to-4 decision.\u201d King also said that Justices Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg should have recused themselves from the case because they had previously officiated at same-sex weddings. If they had recused themselves, \u201cit would have been a 4-to-3 decision the other way,\u201d he said \u2013 suggesting that Chief Justice John Roberts or Justice Anthony Kennedy might have voted with conservative justices against legalizing same-sex marriage.", "byline": "", "description": "Congress returns to Washington after the Independence Day break with a slate of hefty items on the to-do list.
