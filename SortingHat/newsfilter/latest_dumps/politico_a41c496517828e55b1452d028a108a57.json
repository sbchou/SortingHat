{"body": "AP Photo\nBy Daniel Strauss\n7/29/15 1:54 PM EDT\nHillary Clinton plans to urge Congress to lift the U.S. embargo on Cuba during a speech on Friday at Florida International University in Miami.\nClinton, according to her presidential campaign, will say that Republican arguments in opposition to more engagement with Cuba represent the \u201cfailed policies of the past.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\nClinton\u2019s speech will come just a few days after Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) filed legislation to end restrictions that block American businesses from trading with Cuba and U.S. citizens from traveling there under some circumstances. And it comes a little more than a week after Cuba opened an embassy in Washington for the first time in decades.\nThe venue of Clinton\u2019s speech is noteworthy: It\u2019s the university where Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Clinton\u2019s would be Republican opponent, has a part-time teaching gig. Rubio is a fierce opponent of Obama\u2019s outreach to Cuba. Earlier this month, Rubio said he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d roll back Obama\u2019s Cuba policies if he were elected president.\nBy MICHAEL KRUSE\nBy MATT LATIMER\nBy DAVID MAKOVSKY\nBy BEN WOFFORD\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "She'll say Republican arguments represent the \"failed policies of the past.\"", "title": "Hillary Clinton to call for lifting Cuba embargo", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/hillary-clinton-urges-congress-lift-cuba-embargo-120776.html", "topics": ["economy", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Marco Rubio", "Tom Emmer", "Hillary Clinton", "Daniel Strauss"], "orgs": ["Florida International University", "Congress"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30861, "fullname": "daniel strauss", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-07-29 18:54:04", "org": "politico", "article_id": "a41c496517828e55b1452d028a108a57", "date_access": "2015-07-29 18:20:03.723457"}
