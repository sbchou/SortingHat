{"body": " RICHMOND \u2014 Just when it looked as if the Virginia Senate had slapped a 30-day expiration date on Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s pick for the state Supreme Court, Senate Democrats kept her appointment alive with a parliamentary maneuver. Sen. A. Donald McEachin (D-Henrico) called for a surprise adjournment of Monday\u2019s special session, which effectively extends Supreme Court Justice Jane Marum Roush\u2019s term \u2014 and puts a hold on redistricting efforts.    [Va. Senate falls short in effort to oust McAuliffe\u2019s Supreme Court pick]   \u201cI think Judge Roush is a fabulous jurist, there is no reason to remove a sitting Supreme Court justice. There was no reason articulated today other than mere political preferences and that\u2019s not what ought to happen to the court at any level,\u201d McEachin told reporters after the vote.  Last month McAuliffe (D) used his power to make interim judicial appointments when the legislature is not in session to install Roush, then a Fairfax circuit court judge, on the Supreme Court.  Once the legislature is back in session, lawmakers have always in the state\u2019s modern history elected a governor\u2019s interim pick to a full 12-year term. However, if they take no action, the interim judge\u2019s appointment expires 30 days after the start of the next special session, which happened to be Monday.  House and Senate Republicans vowed to install their preference, Court of Appeals Judge Ronnie D. Alston Jr., but on Monday a moderate Republican senator derailed that plan by voting against Alston\u2019s nomination. With that move, Sen. John C. Watkins (R-Powhatan) prevented Alston from taking the bench, but did nothing to stop Roush\u2019s appointment from expiring within 30 days. Enter McEachin. He made a motion to adjourn the entire session, which passed 21-20 with the help of Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s tie-breaking vote.  Roush\u2019s term will still expire within 30 days, but if he chooses to, McAuliffe can again nominate Roush to an interim appointment. With no special session scheduled until January, she would serve on the bench for about another six months. It\u2019s the governor\u2019s job to convene special sessions. The adjournment also pulled the plug on redistricting, which is the reason McAuliffe originally called the special session. Now McAuliffe could write a letter to a federal panel of judges asking them to redraw the lines that they had deemed unconstitutional. \u201cYou knew that before we got here,\u201d McEachin said. \u201cThere was no Republican plan... It seemed to me they were willing to go through an exercise at taxpayer expense. Fortunately a majority of the Senate decided that wasn\u2019t an exercise they wanted to engage in.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax) said Democrats had won, but not without costing taxpayers about $41,000 to bring everyone back to Richmond. \u201cWe had a successful day except it cost taxpayers money,\u201d he said.
