{"body": "Hillary Clinton, at a campaign appearance Thursday, spoke in blunt terms about race in America, saying the nation must confront \u201csystemic racism\u201d and twice invoking the activist cry \u201cblack lives matter.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s essential that we all stand up and say, loudly and clearly, that yes, black lives matter. And we all have a responsibility to face these hard truths about race and justice, honestly and directly,\u201d the former secretary of state and Democratic presidential candidate told a largely African-American audience during a panel discussion at Brookland Baptist Church, one of the most influential black congregations in South Carolina.\nMrs. Clinton enjoys strong support in the African-American community for her presidential bid, and black voters are a large part of the Democratic voter base in the early voting state of South Carolina. Her remarks appeared intended to press this advantage at a time when Sen. Bernie Sanders, her chief rival, has gained ground with some white voters in Iowa and New Hampshire.\nOn Thursday, Mrs. Clinton said the death of Sandra Bland, a young black woman who died in a Texas jail after a traffic stop, was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d and should force Americans to confront racial discrimination in the criminal justice system and elsewhere.\nShe seemed determined to make up for a gaffe in June, when following the murder of nine people in a Charleston, S.C., church, she told an audience in Missouri, \u201call lives matter.\u201d People in the \u201c#BlackLivesMatter\u201d movement see that as diminishing the racism and legacy of discrimination that black people in particular face.\nLast weekend, another candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, ran into similar trouble when he was interrupted by protesters at the liberal Netroots Nation conference. He replied, \u201cBlack lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter.\u201d He later apologized, saying he meant no disrespect.\nMr. Sanders, a Vermont independent, appeared to some to be dismissing the activists by saying, \u201cof course black lives matter.\u201d He went on to speak of the challenge chiefly in economic terms, saying racial inequity was the result of economic inequality.\nMrs. Clinton also addressed that question, as well. She appeared to be taking a subtle swipe at Mr. Sanders when she said that \u201ceconomic inequality is a symptom of racism. It\u2019s not the only reason for racism.\u201d Racism, she said, is \u201cin the fabric of how people think and how people act.\u201d\n\u201cWe have to admit this,\u201d she said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t try to gloss it over and think it will go away because we are going to try and be nicer to each other.\u201d\nYvonne Donald, 58, of nearby Irmo, S.C., who attended the event, said\u00a0she had been disturbed when she heard Mrs. Clinton say \u201call lives matter\u201d and liked her comments on Thursday. She said Mrs. Clinton\u2019s comments on race were \u201cvery pertinent and on task\u2026 I think she gets it.\u201d\n______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.
