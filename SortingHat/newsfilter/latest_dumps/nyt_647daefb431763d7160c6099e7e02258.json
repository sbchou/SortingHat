{"body": "The potential candidate Jeb Bush \u2014 who everyone knows is running \u2014 has not faced the fund-raising restrictions that election law imposes on those of his rivals who are officially declared candidates. He has accomplished this by seemingly pretending that he is not actually running for president.\n\nThe difficulty for the official watchdogs whose job is to police election law is that the precise words that Mr. Bush is saying \u2014 he is officially \u201ctesting the waters\u201d \u2014 stand at odds with the message that voters are hearing, which is that he\u2019s running and he wants their vote.\n\nSo instead of relying on lawyers to referee these distinctions, we could turn to economists \u2014 in particular, economists who could organize prediction markets in which all Americans can buy and sell a stock that pays $1 if Mr. Bush officially files paperwork as a candidate.\n\nA large body of research has documented that these sorts of markets yield very accurate forecasts. Even if they were imperfect, they would probably yield a truer indication than any amount of lawyerly parsing of Mr. Bush\u2019s public statements. The idea would be that if a contender\u2019s stock were trading above, say, 90 cents, then this should be taken as a sufficiently strong indication that he\u2019s planning to run for president, and he should be treated as a candidate.\n\nI asked my Upshot colleague Nate Cohn for his best guess as to the price that security would pay today. He reckons it would be around 99 cents. Few people would be willing to allow Mr. Cohn to be the nation\u2019s arbiter of who is and isn\u2019t a candidate, though. The idea instead is to crowdsource it, relying on the collective wisdom of millions of market participants distributed around the country.\n\nThe economic inspiration here is that markets are useful because when you\u2019re forced to put your money where your mouth is, you\u2019re likely to bet according to your best estimate of what will happen. And as people buy and sell a stock, the market price comes to reflect the information that millions of people have about the odds of a run by Mr. Bush. This market-based assessment would move the question of Mr. Bush\u2019s candidacy from fine-grained legal distinctions to one of whether the broader public thought that he was actually a candidate.\n\nOf course, one might be concerned about market manipulation. After all, if the stakes are this high, perhaps Mr. Bush\u2019s supporters might stand ready to sell enough of his stock to keep the price below 90 cents, thereby ensuring that he remains officially off the candidate list.\n\nBut this concern is overblown. We all know that Mr. Bush is running. And if someone is willing to sell you dollar bills for 89 cents, pretty much everyone in the country is going to be willing to buy. No group of campaign supporters has enough money to be able to keep selling dollar bills at a price of 89 cents, forever.\n\nCampaigns might also try to make mischief in these markets by bidding up the stock of their opponents. But paradoxically, this may create even more transparency. For instance, Mr. Bush\u2019s supporters could bid up the stock of Scott Walker, in an effort to ensure that Mr. Walker also faces the restrictions on fund-raising that apply to candidates. He would be a particularly attractive focus of such an operation, precisely because the Bush campaign sees him as a serious candidate.\n\nTheir bets would make their internal assessment public. Of course if Mr. Walker does in fact plan on running (hint: he does), this would be a setback to his campaign, but only because it would force him to meet the obligations that campaign laws are intended to impose on candidates. And if Mr. Walker is not running, then not only would Mr. Bush\u2019s supporters lose a lot of money, but they might also lose it to an informed Walker campaign happy to bet against them. Either way, there\u2019s no real harm done.\n\nAndrew Gelman, a professor of political science and statistics at Columbia, called this \u201ca clever idea,\u201d while adding that \u201cit also seems nuts.\u201d His concern was not that politicians would try to distort the market, but rather that the market would distort politicians, and he wouldn\u2019t put it past a \u201ctype of mercenary candidate to decide whether or not to run based on a desire to cash in on bets in the market.\u201d\n\nI tested out my idea with Eric Zitzewitz, an economics professor at Dartmouth College who has written extensively on prediction markets. (He is also a frequent academic collaborator of mine on these issues.) His main concern was about unintended consequences.\n\n\u201cI suppose a candidate might try to fool people into thinking they are genuinely on the fence,\u201d he said. Candidates \u201cmay try to appear ambivalent to outsiders but whisper in donors\u2019 ears that they are really running.\u201d But this is a case where the distributed intelligence of the market will ultimately win, and he concluded that it is \u201cprobably hard to keep that a secret for long, especially once F.E.C. reports show money being raised.\u201d After we batted the ideas back and forth a bit, he said that he had come around to liking the idea.\n\nOne argument that he raised concerns insider trading, which is prohibited in financial markets. But perhaps this is a case where insider trading should be encouraged. After all, if campaign insiders who know that their boss plans to run start buying his stock, their actions will push the price higher, leading the whole charade of \u201cconsidering their options\u201d to end even earlier.\n\nThe idea that markets yield reliable insights has taken a battering in the wake of the global financial crisis, where many bets thought to be valuable turned out to be worthless. But the case for prediction markets is not that they\u2019re perfect, but rather that they\u2019re less bad than the alternative. The current fiction that Mr. Bush is not running seems to be further from the truth than any mispricing I\u2019ve ever seen from a market, even one gripped by a collective mania.\n\nWhatever the law says, I\u2019m willing to call Mr. Bush a candidate.
