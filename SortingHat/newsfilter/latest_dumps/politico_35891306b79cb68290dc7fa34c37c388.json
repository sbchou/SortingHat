Rod Blum, setting up rematches of last year's Iowa 1st District race in both the primary and the general election. Murphy will face Monica Vernon, the Cedar Rapids city councilwoman whom he defeated last year, in the Democratic primary. But Vernon, who announced her candidacy months ago, has already consolidated some Democratic support around her, winning endorsements from Rep. Dave Loebsack, the state's only Democratic congressman, and from EMILY's List. Her campaign had $424,000 in cash on hand as of June 30.\n\u2014 Murphy told Campaign Pro on Thursday that was would \u201crun a much more aggressive campaign this time around,\u201d with a strong focus on fundraising now and new emphasis on voter turnout next year. He plans to build his campaign around economic issues, including raising the minimum wages, as well as protecting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and improving the Affordable Care Act. \u201cI\u2019ve got a proven record, and nobody else in the race can say that,\u201d he said, referring to his time in the state House.\nFIRST IN SCORE \u2014 Cole to speaker at fundraiser with RGA chairman: West Virginia state Senate President Bill Cole, a Republican who\u2019s running for governor, will appear alongside Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, the chairman of the Republican Governors Association at a fundraiser on Friday in Charleston, W.Va., for the West Virginia Republican Party. The fundraiser comes while Haslam will be in nearby White Sulfur Springs, W.Va., for the summer meeting of the National Governors Association at the Greenbrier \u2014 a resort owned, coincidentally, by billionaire Jim Justice, a Democratic candidate for governor.\nDays until the 2015 election: 102.

The influential and well-heeled business group is already eyeing several races, but the plans are still in their infancy and the targets have not yet been decided upon, according to more than a half-dozen Republican sources on K Street and Capitol Hill. The group\u2019s apparent new willingness to engage in hand-to-hand political combat to take out sitting Republicans would represent a major shift for the business community, which has largely shied away from targeting sitting lawmakers.\u201d http://politi.co/1VF0Kr6\nCASH HUSTLE \u2014 \u201cReid rakes in $1M from trial lawyers by invoking Koch brothers,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Anna Palmer and John Bresnahan: Trial lawyers must really hate Charles and David Koch. \u201cFor years, Harry Reid has railed against the Koch brothers as the worst example of the corrupting influence of special interest money in politics. But the Senate minority leader\u2019s crusade against the conservative barons recently yielded big bucks for his own party. Reid invoked the Republican megadonors during a July 12 fundraiser in Montreal for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. In the end, he raised more than $1 million from one special interest \u2014 trial lawyers \u2014 by criticizing another. Reid flew to the event in one lawyer\u2019s private jet.\u201d Of course he did. http://politi.co/1HM3hbQ\nCAREFULLY CONSIDERED VOTES \u2014 Bera votes for sanctuary cities bill, Curbelo doesn\u2019t: House Republicans overwhelmingly voted for a bill that would withhold federal law enforcement grants from cities with policies designed to protect illegal immigrants from deportation, while Democrats overwhelmingly voted against it. (The bill passed, 241 to 179.) But a handful of lawmakers facing potentially tough races next year voted the opposite of most other members of their party. Reps. Ami Bera (D-Calif.), Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) voted for the bill, while Reps. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) and Bob Dold (R-Ill.) voted against it. Here\u2019s the vote tally: http://1.usa.gov/1RWywIY.\nCONVENTION CASH \u2014 \u201cDNC to start accepting lobbying and PAC money for convention,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Gabriel Debenedetti: \u201cThe Democratic National Committee will start accepting money from lobbyists and political action committees for the 2016 convention in Philadelphia and for its various joint fundraising accounts with the party\u2019s primary candidates, the DNC told POLITICO on Thursday evening. The move \u2014 which comes as representatives of front-runner Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign have been negotiating with the DNC over their joint fundraising agreement \u2014 signals a significant shift for the group, which has not raised money from such sources since then-Sen. Barack Obama\u2019s first convention in 2008. But a number of Democrats have remained unsatisfied with the party\u2019s fundraising in 2012 ... and Clinton\u2019s camp has recently gained influence within the DNC.\u201d http://politi.co/1HMxesi\nPRESIDENTIAL SPEED READ \u2014 \u201cHow Donald Trump cashes in even when his name-brand properties fail,\u201d by The Washington Post\u2019s Tom Hamburger and Rosalind S. Helderman: Donald Trump has made \u201cmany millions of dollars\u201d on a golf resort that bears his name in Puerto Rico, even though the resort filed for bankruptcy last week. The reason: He never invested any money in it. \u201cAs he runs for president, Trump is promoting his success as a real estate mogul to argue that he has the proven skills to fix America\u2019s problems. He brags that he made his money \u201cthe old-fashioned way,\u201d building iconic properties such as Trump Tower in Manhattan and, soon, a luxury hotel in the Old Post Office Pavilion blocks from the White House. ... But as the Puerto Rico example illustrates, Trump has become increasingly reliant on a different business model \u2014 one in which he makes money by harnessing his celebrity brand rather than risking capital in real estate investments.\u201d http://wapo.st/1MqXjBp\n\u2014 \u201cCriminal inquiry sought in Clinton\u2019s use of email,\u201d by The New York Times\u2019 Michael S. Schmidt and Matt Apuzzo: \u201cTwo inspectors general have asked the Justice Department to open a criminal investigation into whether sensitive government information was mishandled in connection with the personal email account Hillary Rodham Clinton used as secretary of state, senior government officials said Thursday. The request follows an assessment in a June 29 memo by the inspectors general for the State Department and the intelligence agencies that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private account contained \u2018hundreds of potentially classified emails.\u2019 The memo was written to Patrick F. Kennedy, the under secretary of state for management.\u201d http://nyti.ms/1LzWOVo\n\u2014 Jeb Bush raised $500,000 in Chris Christie\u2019s backyard, Alex Isenstadt reports: Former Florida governor and Republican 2016 candidate Jeb Bush ventured into enemy territory on Thursday evening, pulling in a total of $500,000 at a pair of fundraisers held in New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s home state, according to a source familiar with the planning for the events. Bush held his first fundraiser at the Navesink Country Club in Middletown. The event was hosted by New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, attorney Larry Bathgate, and state Sen. Joe Kyrillos \u2014 influential figures who helped to fuel Christie\u2019s rise but have now deserted him. The second event of the evening, held at the Short Hills home of investment banker Bill Cohen, was hosted by investor David Tepper and former Ambassador Clifford Sobel.\nCODA \u2014 QUOTE OF THE DAY: \"It's really about Jim and his vision, not so much about us. We're now the backup singers of the Temptations.\" \u2014 Former Philadelphia mayoral candidate Anthony Williams, joining this year\u2019s entire Democratic primary field in endorsing Democratic nominee Jim Kenney. http://bit.ly/1GJBYLb\nBy JAMES KITFIELD\nBy FREDRIK DEBOER\nBy MICHAEL HIRSH\nBy JEFF GREENFIELD \n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "U.S. Chamber gets ready to take out incumbents.", "title": "Ashford tries to turn it around \u2014 U.S. Chamber gets ready to take out incumbents", "url": "http://www.politico.com/morningscore/0715/morningscore19289.html", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Matt Apuzzo", "Bill Haslam", "Tom Hamburger", "Kyrsten Sinema", "Elena Schneider", "Anna Palmer", "Michael S.
