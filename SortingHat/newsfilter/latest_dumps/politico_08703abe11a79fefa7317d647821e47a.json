She was comfortable, confident, and articulate,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary in the George W. Bush White House. \u201cBut a general election race against her will be based on what she's done and not done \u2014 not on what she says.\u201d \nWith the pressure on, Clinton easily swatted away the questions that have dogged her throughout her campaign \u2014 from her use of a personal email account during her tenure as secretary of state, to accusations that she\u2019s flip-flopped on key issues, to her past support for the Iraq war.\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\nShe stared down Bernie Sanders, the socialist firebrand who has drawn waves of enthusiasm from liberal activists and pulled ahead of her in New Hampshire, challenging him on his opposition to some forms of gun control. If anything, Sanders\u2019s most memorable line of the night came when he sprung to her defense over her email practices. \u201cEnough with the damn emails,\u201d he said to raucous applause, drawing a handshake from Clinton.\nBack-of-the-packers Martin O\u2019Malley, Lincoln Chafee, and Jim Webb, meanwhile, served mainly as curiosities.\nTo some Republicans, the former secretary of state\u2019s performance sparked flashbacks to 2008, when she exhibited a steely discipline that made her a formidable debater. \u201cShe was precisely what I expected,\u201d said Rick Wilson, a Florida-based Republican strategist. \u201cHyper-prepared, disciplined, constantly reinforcing her left flank.\u201d \nOthers conceded that she looked and sounded impressive. \u201cHillary Clinton was the only candidate on the stage this evening with the stature of a president,\u201d said Alex Castellanos, a longtime Republican media consultant. \u201cThat helps.\u201d\nAs they took in the GOP reaction, Democrats could barely contain their glee. \u201cRepublicans are crapping themselves tonight,\u201d Brad Woodhouse, the president of Correct the Record, a pro-Clinton group, tweeted.\nWhile Clinton\u2019s performance heartened Democrats who have grown increasingly concerned about her lackluster campaign, it does not spell the end of her problems. \nOver the coming weeks, she will face ongoing scrutiny into her tenure as secretary of state \u2014 including later this month, when she appears before the congressional panel investigating the Benghazi attacks.\nFew of Clinton\u2019s rivals, Republicans contend, were willing to challenge her in any serious way \u2014 something she won\u2019t be able to count on if she becomes the Democratic nominee. GOP groups used the debate to test-run attacks on the former secretary of state. America Rising, a Republican opposition research firm, pumped out waves of attacks on the Democratic front-runner, going after her email habits, her Wall Street ties, and her defense of President Obama.\n\n\n\n            By \nDaniel Strauss\n\n\u201cI think she won the debate tonight, but faced little true opposition in doing so and told us very little about what kind of general election candidate she might be when she's truly contested,\u201d said Bruce Haynes, a Republican operative who serves as president of the political consulting firm Purple Strategies.\nOthers blamed CNN. In the post-debate spin room, Sean Spicer, the Republican National Committee\u2019s chief strategist, grumbled that the moderators weren\u2019t forceful enough in pressing the Democratic front-runner on her view of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\u201cShe was let off the hook,\" he said.\nBut Clinton, some Republicans argued, might not have escaped the evening entirely unscathed. As Clinton swatted down her more liberal rivals, they noted, she was compelled to take stances that pushed her to the left \u2014 as when she voiced outspoken support of gun control legislation \u2014 that could hurt her later.\n\u201cShe certainly didn't cover the spread,\u201d said Kevin Madden, who served as a top official on Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign, \u201cand, in the process, stood and watched as her entire party got yanked far to the left.\u201d \n\u201cSmall picture: HRC survives debate one,\u201d tweeted Mike Murphy, a longtime Jeb Bush political adviser who is steering his super PAC. \u201cBig picture: Dems lurch left, creating GOP opportunity.\u201d He added later: \u201cHRC + the D\u2019s took some solid steps toward losing OH, VA, NC and FL in \u2019 tonight. I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\nSidestepping the questions surrounding her emails and her shifting policy positions might win her the night, others said, but wouldn\u2019t serve her well in the long run.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Hillary did anything to address the character issues dogging her campaign,\u201d said Eric Fehrnstrom, a former Mitt Romney aide. \u201cThere's a reason why Hillary's campaign has tried to keep a lid on the number of debates. It\u2019s because they know that people don\u2019t trust her, and that she doesn\u2019t come across as a real person. She loses every time her opponents appear on the same stage with her.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did Hillary add to what we know of her tonight? Nothing,\u201d said Castellanos. \u201cSay the same and you remain in the same place.\u201d \nHadas Gold contributed to this report.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Clinton impresses Republicans, but some see hints of weakness", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/democratic-debate-clinton-sanders-republicans-214776", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "trade"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Sean Spicer", "Ari Fleischer", "Matt Latimer", "Tom Steyer", "Hadas Gold", "Bruce Haynes", "Carla Marinucci", "Austin Wright", "Frank Luntz", "Charles Schwab", "Brian Mahoney", "Theodoric Meyer", "Nahal Toosi", "Caitlin Emma", "Darius Tahir", "Mike Murphy", "Victoria Guida", "Nick Gass", "Alex Castellanos", "Alex Isenstadt", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Martin O'Malley", "Isaac Dovere", "Toby Eckert", "Jeb Bush", "Jim Webb", "Jeremy Herb", "Marco Rubio", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Jeff Greenfield", "Eric Wolff", "Ivanka Trump", "Tim Starks", "Kevin Madden", "Brianna Ehley", "Tony Romm", "Mitt Romney", "Daniel Strauss", "Hillary Clinton", "Brad Woodhouse", "Ben White", "Eric Fehrnstrom", "Rick Wilson", "Glass Steagall", "Anna Palmer", "Bill Tomson", "Bernie Sanders", "Lincoln Chafee"], "orgs": ["DOJ", "CNBC", "Purple Strategies", "FEC", "PAC", "FTC", "Republican National Committee", "U.N.
