{"body": "AP Photo\nBy Eliza Collins\n7/13/15 5:51 PM EDT\nAs presidential candidates travel through early states to share their message, a man with bouquets of flowers keeps interrupting them.\nOn Monday, a bearded man interrupted both Jeb Bush and Rick Perry\u2019s campaign events by giving them bouquets of yellow daisies.\nStory Continued Below\nJeb Bush\u2019s communications team used the interruption as a campaigning opportunity \u2014 and posted a video of the event titled, \u201cGov. Jeb Bush Hugs and Says Prayer with Everyday American in Iowa\u201d on its YouTube page.\nThe video shows Bush talking about how to campaign, when he notices a familiar face in the audience.\n\u201cThis man was in New Hampshire with me twice last week,\u201d Bush says, pointing out someone off screen. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see ya buddy.\u201d\nThe man, who is wearing a suit and an Abraham Lincoln-style top hat, runs up to Bush and presents him with a bunch of flowers.\n\u201cHow many prayers am I going to have to do this time?\u201d Bush asks.\n\u201cYou offered 20 prayers last time,\u201d the man says.\n\u201cI did them,\u201d Bush confirms.\n\u201cThis just for your wife,\u201d the man says, then he asks for one prayer for peace in person.\nAlso on POLITICO\nADAM B. LERNER\n\u201cDear Lord, we do need a peaceful world, we need American leadership to make sure that there is peace all around the world. I worry about people that are, that are struggling in their lives, and a more peaceful world will allow them to rise up,\u201d Bush says.\nAs Bush prays, the man holds a daisy in his mouth. At the end of the prayer, Bush goes in for a handshake, but the man embraces him.\nAnother video posted Monday shows Perry getting interrupted by the same man during a question and answer session at a round table-style event in Iowa.\n\u201cLast time I saw you I offered you one flower for peace\u2026and you accepted it. This time I wondered if I could offer you 20 flowers for peace?\u201d the man \u2014 in this case without the top hat \u2014 says.\nPerry interrupts to say he remembers him from New Hampshire.\nAfter handing him the bouquet, the man asks for a peace prayer for each flower.\n\u201cGo over there,\u201d Perry says. \u201cI\u2019ll silently pray for you right now, brother. How about that?\u201d\nBy DOUG SOSNIK\nBy MICHAEL O'HANLON\nBy ALAN GREENBLATT\nBy MICHAEL KRUSE\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "A man with bouquets of flowers keeps interrupting presidential candidates.", "title": "'Flower man' interrupts Jeb Bush, Rick Perry in Iowa", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/flower-man-interrupts-jeb-bush-rick-perry-120051.html", "topics": ["personality", "economy"], "people": ["Jeb Bush", "Eliza Collins", "Rick Perry", "Abraham Lincoln"], "orgs": [], "authors": [{"author_id": 32625, "fullname": "eliza collins", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-07-13 22:51:38", "org": "politico", "article_id": "1cf06861120a026c8cb3b522850a5571", "date_access": "2015-07-14 02:20:03.468628"}
