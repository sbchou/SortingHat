{"body": "BOONE, Iowa \u2013 Donald Trump zeroed in Saturday on Republican rival Ben Carson, questioning whether he has the energy to be president, a line he has frequently used to taunt Jeb Bush. \"I don't think Ben has the energy,\" said Trump, before calling him a \"nice man\" and arguing that he is not cut out for negotiating with some foreign officials. The attack came as Carson, a retired surgeon running an outsider campaign like Trump, has surged into second place in many surveys, behind the brash real estate mogul. Trump, who campaigned here before heading to a tailgate party where a trio of other GOP hopefuls were also appearing, also criticized Carson for recently questioning his Christian faith. \"You don't hit a person on faith,\" said Trump. \"I don't know him. He knows nothing about me.\" But Trump commended Carson for apologizing to him. \u00a0 ", "byline": "", "description": "Attack came as retired surgeon surged into second place in many surveys.", "title": "Trump questions Ben Carson&#8217;s &#8216;energy&#8217; to be president", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/12/trump-questions-ben-carsons-energy-to-be-president/", "topics": ["personality", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Jeb Bush", "Ben Carson"], "orgs": ["GOP"], "authors": [{"author_id": 31429, "fullname": "sean sullivan", "primary_org": "washpo"}], "date_written": "2015-09-12 19:36:13", "org": "washpo", "article_id": "58520a6ba6effc03e17d30cf6f6c737c", "date_access": "2015-09-12 19:00:05.042600"}
