{"body": "By Eli Stokols\n8/4/15 5:47 PM EDT\nUpdated 8/4/15 6:02 PM EDT\nAP Photo\nAnother ill-advised ad-lib from Jeb Bush, another opportunity for Democrats.\nLooking to curry favor with evangelical conservatives at the outset of a competitive primary fight, Bush on Tuesday repeated his call to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood \u2014 and then he went even further, questioning the amount of government support for women\u2019s health programs generally.\nStory Continued Below\nAfter starting to acknowledge the importance of federal funding for some women\u2019s health programs, Bush stopped himself mid-sentence to qualify his remarks, asserting that he believes the current amount of funding is likely too much.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure we need half a billion dollars in funding for women\u2019s health programs,\u201d Bush said, before continuing with his point. \u201cIf you took dollar for dollar, there are many extraordinarily fine organizations, community health organizations that exist, federally sponsored community health organizations to provide quality care for women on a wide variety of health issues.\n\u201cBut abortion should not be funded by the government, any government in my mind,\u201d he concluded.\nAlso on POLITICO\nALEX WEPRIN\nBush, who told the audience that as governor he defunded Planned Parenthood in Florida, prefaced his comments by acknowledging that Democrats are likely to attack his comments \u2014 and the GOP\u2019s current fight against Planned Parenthood, which gained steam after the release of several controversial videos that allegedly show organization officials talking about the sale of fetal tissue and organs. \nIt didn\u2019t take long.\nLess than an hour after Bush wrapped up his appearance before more than 13,000 conservative Christians at a Southern Baptist conference in Nashville, Hillary Clinton tweeted directly at Bush: \u201cYou are absolutely, unequivocally wrong.\u201d\nThe Democratic National Committee quickly blasted out a press release blasting Bush\u2019s \u201cbackwards ideology.\u201d\nAs Bush knows, Democrats savaged the GOP\u2019s 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney, for his own calls during the primary to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\u201cA few more months of this and the GOP will be wishing for a candidate with the political skills of Mitt Romney,\u201d tweeted Dan Pfieffer, a former communications director for President Obama.\nRecognizing the magnitude of the blunder, Bush quickly posted an explanation of his remarks on his website.\n\u201cWith regards to women\u2019s health funding broadly, I believe there are countless community health centers, rural clinics, and other women\u2019s health organizations that need to be fully funded,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey provide critical services to all, but particularly low-income women who don\u2019t have the access they need.\n\u201cThe point I was making was that we must address the hard-to-fathom $500 million in federal funding that goes to Planned Parenthood \u2013 an organization that was callously participating in the unthinkable practice of selling fetal organs. Democrats and Republicans agree we absolutely must defund them and redirect those funds to other women\u2019s health organizations,\u201d Bush concluded. \nBut the video of his comments could be used to devastating effect in television ads against Bush next fall, should he become the Republican nominee.\nConsidered the Republican frontrunner based on his overwhelming financial advantage, Bush often tells voters that his unscripted campaign style and willingness to answer questions separates him from other candidates \u2014 and it does.\nAlso on POLITICO\nMATT DIXON\nBut Tuesday\u2019s comments mark the third occasion in recent weeks in which an inartfully phrased comment has sparked criticism from Democrats and put Bush on the defensive.\nLast month, Bush had to explain his statement that \u201cworkers need to work longer hours,\u201d after Democrats portrayed Bush as having said that workers are lazy; and he also had to walk back a comment about \u201cphasing out\u201d Medicare after it was unclear whether he was referring to the specific program or more generally to ballooning entitlements.\nJust as his struggles to answer a question about the Iraq war back in May caused concern for supporters that Bush hadn\u2019t shaken off the rust of nearly a decade away from politics, this series of minor gaffes may produce similar concerns just as Bush is set to take the stage for the first GOP debate in Cleveland on Thursday.\nAt the outset of his interview with Russell Moore, Bush laid out his belief that religious liberties can be protected without allowing discrimination toward same-sex couples \u2014 but the example he offered showed just how thin a line there may be between the two.\n\u201cIf someone walks into a flower shop and says I\u2019d like to buy some flowers and the owner of the flower shop says, \u2018No, you\u2019re gay, I\u2019m not going to sell to you,\u2019 that\u2019s discrimination,\u201d Bush said. \u201cBut if someone walks into a flower shop and says, \u2018You\u2019re the only florist around here that I believe can arrange the flowers for my wedding,\u2019 \u2014 a gay couple \u2014 you should not be compelled to participate in that wedding.\n\u201cPeople get that.\u201d\nMoore asked Bush about a range of topics, as he did with Marco Rubio, who appeared on stage ahead of Bush.\nOn the subject of homeland security, Bush subtly distanced himself from at least one element of his brother\u2019s controversial enhanced interrogation techniques, which Moore referred to as a \u201cmoral issue\u201d for a president.\n\u201cI think the law we have today is the proper one,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWater-boarding is no longer legal. I think we can, if we\u2019re engaged and we\u2019re fully engaged, we protect the homeland, we\u2019re engaged in the world, we can use techniques that can validate our values as a country.\u201d\nAlso on POLITICO\nDANIEL STRAUSS\nBush also looked to portray himself as a compassionate conservative, telling Moore that he believes racism still exists, albeit \u201ca quieter, more insidious form of it\u201d than during the civil rights battles of the 1960s; and, when asked how he would pray for and honor Hillary Clinton, he sought to separate political disagreements from the personal animosity that often underpins them.\n\u201cI pray for everybody in positions of leadership, for sure,\u201d Bush said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to recognize that people that you don\u2019t agree with aren\u2019t necessarily bad people; they just might be wrong. There should be a restoration of civility. There\u2019s no reason to demonize people.\u201d\nBush also made sure to respond to Moore\u2019s characterization of his father and Bill Clinton, two of five living former presidents, as \u201cbrothers.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a club of past presidents, there\u2019s a mutual respect there. I admire that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Bill Clinton is not my stepbrother, just to be clear.\u201d\nBy JACK SHAFER\nBy DANIEL J. MCGRAW\nBy TOM A.
