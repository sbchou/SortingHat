Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has been mounting a surprisingly competitive challenge: His campaign reported this week that he\u2019d raised almost as much as Clinton in the most recent fundraising quarter. Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden, a longtime union supporter, is weighing a presidential run. \nThe American Federation of Teachers \u2014 whose president is longtime Clinton ally Randi Weingarten \u2014 came out this summer in support of Clinton. That frustrated other unions and even some of AFT's own members who felt the union was fast-tracking amid a surge by Sanders what should be a more deliberate process.\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\nOn the campaign trail, and even before her bid, Clinton has been a strong supporter of early childhood education programs. At one of her first campaign stops she said she supports the concept of the Common Core standards. But on education, her campaign has largely focused on college affordability issues when addressing education. K-12 education in recent years has been a tricky issue for Democrats, dividing the party\u2019s historically allied teachers unions and so-called \u201creformers\u201d who back charter schools and other forms of school choice and using strong accountability measures such as test scores to evaluate teachers and schools. \nThe NEA sat out the contentious 2008 Democratic primary between Clinton and then-Sen. Barack Obama, only later endorsing Obama for the general election. Some union members later felt NEA had missed out on an opportunity to be big league power brokers.\nLater, NEA would clash with many of the Obama administration initiatives such as incentivizing states to adopt teacher evaluations systems tied in test scores. In 2014, the union went so far as to pass a resolution calling for the resignation of Education Secretary Arne Duncan. \nLast month, the NEA in New Hampshire also endorsed Clinton. But support for a Clinton endorsement within NEA\u2019s rank-and-file isn\u2019t widespread. Vermont\u2019s NEA chapter endorsed Sanders in June. NEA chapters in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Nebraska urged the national council to wait before acting. \n\u201cWe are concerned that an early recommendation does not allow members to be participants in a real debate around the issues that are still unfolding,\u201d said Nancy Fulton, the president of the NEA in Nebraska in a statement. \nOnly Clinton, Sanders and Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley were considered by the group because they opted to participate in the union\u2019s endorsement process.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "NEA's political arm recommends Clinton endorsement", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/neas-political-arm-endorses-clinton-214329", "topics": ["trade"], "people": ["Arne Duncan", "Harry Reid", "Kate Tummarello", "Kate Bennett", "Hadas Gold", "Natasha Korecki", "Tim Starks", "Steven Lee Myers", "Barack Obama", "Joe Biden", "Jenny Hopkinson", "Brian Mahoney", "Kimberly Hefling", "Theodoric Meyer", "Darius Tahir", "Alex Guillen", "Caitlin Emma", "Rich Lowry", "Nick Gass", "Jack Shafer", "Matt Wuerker", "Randi Weingarten", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Martin O'Malley", "Isaac Dovere", "Sander Levin", "Donald Trump", "John Bresnahan", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Toby Eckert", "Lauren French", "Josh Zeitz", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Brianna Ehley", "Jeremy Herb", "Daniel Strauss", "Ellen Pollock", "Hillary Clinton", "Ben Carson", "Ben White", "Victoria Guida", "Alex Byers", "Eric Wolff", "Bernie Sanders", "Allen Grunes"], "orgs": ["National Education Association", "Congress", "NAFTA", "Senate", "American Federation of Teachers", "NEA", "AFT", "KGB", "CWA", "ISIL", "U.N.", "Businessweek"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30861, "fullname": "daniel strauss", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-10-01 18:48:30", "org": "politico", "article_id": "a94af606304d9bed1238da681f4557c2", "date_access": "2015-10-01 18:00:15.684105"}
