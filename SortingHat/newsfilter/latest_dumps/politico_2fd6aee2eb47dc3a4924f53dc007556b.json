Facing pressure from anti-gambling legislators and allegations of insider trading, the two companies are setting down political roots across the country. Both FanDuel and DraftKings have hired lobbyists in a slew of state capitals, and FanDuel this week retained its first-ever lobbying firm in the Beltway.\u201d More for Pros here: http://politico.pro/1ZCtEtZ\nStory Continued Below\nTECH TALK SPARSE IN DEMOCRATIC DEBATE \u2014 If you didn\u2019t watch the first Democratic presidential debate last night, you didn\u2019t miss much \u2014 at least when it came to tech issues. The NSA's mass surveillance program came up and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d shut down such programs if elected. \u201cVirtually every telephone call in this country ends up in a file at the NSA. That is unacceptable to me,\u201d Sanders said. Meanwhile, front-runner Hillary Clinton said NSA leaker Edward Snowden shouldn\u2019t \u201cbe brought home without facing the music.\u201d \nAs expected, Clinton was asked about her private email server, but she found an unexpected champion in Sanders, her main rival, who yelled that \u201cthe American public is sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.\u201d Clinton laughed at his unexpected outburst, which came after she offered a spirited attack on the House investigative panel that has been examining the issue. \"It is a partisan vehicle, as admitted by the House Majority Leader, Mr. McCarthy, to drive down my poll numbers. Big surprise,\" Clinton said. \"This committee has spent $4.5 million of taxpayer money.\" More for Pros here: http://politico.pro/1VR3O67 \nBACK IN THE VALLEY: TALKING 2016 WITH REID HOFFMAN \u2014 Don\u2019t expect the LinkedIn co-founder to play as big a role in 2016 as he did supporting President Barack Obama\u2019s White House bids in 2008 and 2012. \u201cThus far, in practice, I haven\u2019t done anything yet,\u201d Hoffman said Tuesday at the Internet Association\u2019s annual conference, when asked about the election ahead of last night\u2019s debate. \u201cLikely, I am going to come out, depending on how you read the tea leaves, supporting Hillary.\u201d But, Hoffman said, it \u201chasn\u2019t yet been important for me to get involved,\u201d noting he wasn\u2019t sure how he would make a \u201cbig difference in the outcome,\u201d before adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me the presidential election of 2016 will be my key focus.\u201d\n\u2014 BUT KEEP AN EYE ON HIM ANYWAY: Hoffman has been a key financial supporter of FWD.us, after all, and he hinted on immigration he has \u201csomething I\u2019m working on but I can\u2019t announce it yet.\u201d\nGood Wednesday morning from San Francisco. We just wrapped up our time at IA\u2019s first-ever confab out in Menlo Park, where participants (yours truly excluded) took home swag bags with free Kindles inside. It\u2019s my last day on the West Coast, so if you\u2019ve got some time, say hello \u2014 and otherwise, keep those comments and tips coming: tromm@politico.com and @tonyromm. Find Adam back here Thursday.\nAND WHO WAS HERE LAST NIGHT? \u2014 Sen. Roger Wicker and Rep. Patrick McHenry stopped by an event that earlier had featured Reps. John Shimkus, Anna Eshoo and Zoe Lofgren. Who was not? Sen. John McCain, who was spotted at the conference hub, located at the Rosewood Sand Hill, but did not swing by the IA event.\nALPHABET'S SCHMIDT EXPLAINS CONCERNS ABOUT ENCRYPTION \u2014 Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, told the IA crowd that the NSA should not be given the keys to break encrypted communications because it would create serious cybersecurity risks that help the \u201cbad guys,\u201d according to sources in the room. Schmidt spoke at an off-the-record session during the conference. Sadly, he was neither asked about nor offered any opinions about two key issues facing the company: a European antitrust complaint and reports that the Federal Trade Commission is probing the company's Android mobile operating system. More, for Pros: http://politico.pro/1PsbvKT\nDRIVING D.C.: DISH, CONSUMER GROUPS LINE UP AGAINST CHARTER-TWC \u2014 Charter Communications' effort to acquire Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks got a little more challenging Tuesday, after DISH Network and a number of consumer groups were among the parties that formally asked the FCC to kill the deal. \u201cThe proposed transaction would be no better for the public interest than the one proposed between Comcast and Time Warner Cable,\u201d DISH wrote (http://bit.ly/1PeLTSI) in its petition to deny. Consumer groups, including Public Knowledge, Common Cause, Consumers Union and Open MIC, said in a combined filing (http://bit.ly/1jx9Yqz) that \u201cas proposed, this merger would harm consumers and competition, providing grounds for the Commission to block it on both competition law and public interest grounds.\"\n\u2014 Of course, plenty of parties have come out in favor of the deal (presumably some solicited by Charter, TWC or Bright House), as Charter will likely point out on Nov. 2, when responses to the petitions to deny are due. But as Comcast found out during its failed effort to acquire Time Warner Cable, the FCC listens closely to concerns of consumer groups and competitors. We\u2019re tracking.\nSPECTRUM BILL OUTLOOK GRIM THIS YEAR? \u2014 With a budget deadline looming overhead at the same time the House lacks a speaker, the prospects for a vote on new spectrum legislation don't look great. Rep. John Shimkus, on the sidelines of IA, agreed with the assessment but sounded an optimistic note about the road ahead. Once lawmakers \"can resolve our speaker battle ... we still have 10 months to move forward on policy,\u201d he told us. That said, Shimkus said he hadn\u2019t heard much about the speculation that spectrum might be tied, as a pay-for, to the highway bill.\nFTC ALSO HELPING OUT WITH VW EMISSIONS FLAP \u2014 As the EPA continues probing Volkswagen for software designed to subvert emissions standards, the FTC is getting in on the action. Chairwoman Edith Ramirez told your MT-er that her agency is \u201ccoordinating\u201d with those agencies \u2014 though she didn\u2019t offer specifics. The regulator comes at it from the perspective of algorithmic accountability, an item she raised during her fireside chat at IA earlier Tuesday. Companies \u201cneed to be more transparent about it and act responsibly in this area,\u201d she said.\nTHIS WEEK: TECH TO CHRISTEN NEW VALLEY PATENT HUB \u2014 USPTO Director Michelle Lee is headed out west later this week to officially open the agency\u2019s highly anticipated satellite office here in the Bay Area. The Silicon Valley Leadership Group is throwing a dinner and discussion to mark the occasion, which will feature Lee, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, Silicon Valley Bank CEO Greg Becker and others. Seated at each table will be \u201ca local inventor and a public official,\u201d SVLG says, \u201cto help spark conversation about innovation, the patent process and the impact this new office will have here.\u201d\n\u2014 AND, ICYMI, PATENT REPORT NEXT YEAR \u2014 FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said at the IA conference Tuesday that the agency\u2019s long-awaited study of so-called patent trolls is likely to drop next spring.\nFINANCIAL AID FOR CODING PROGRAMS, ONLINE COURSES: Students in programs like coding bootcamps and MOOCs would be eligible for federal financial aid and academic credit under a new Education Department pilot program unveiled today. \"We hope to equip students, particularly low-income students, with greater access to innovative educational programs in subjects with the flexibility that they may not otherwise have,\" Under Secretary Ted Mitchell said about the new program, called EQUIP, or Educational Quality through Innovative Partnerships. In 2015 alone, coding bootcamps are expected to generate 240 percent more graduates, or more than 16,000 people.\nMany of those graduates get jobs, no degree required. \"Employers at tech companies don't care,\" said Adam Enbar, CEO of Flatiron School (http://bit.ly/1ZBtl2E), which sends students off to software engineering jobs that pay an average starting salary of $74,000. Enbar said tuition for a three-month, full-time program at Flatiron can run about $15,000.\nHOW TO LOBBY IN 10 TWEETS OR LESS \u2014 It doesn't take all that much to get the attention of Congress, according to a new report (http://bit.ly/1La3Mhp) on social media out today from the Congressional Management Foundation. A survey of House and Senate staff found that about a third of aides say that that it takes fewer than 10 tweets, Facebook posts, or other online comments on a particular topic to attract their notice. When that number creeps to 30, another half of those aides say they'll give them scrutiny. Just 3 percent of staffers say their offices don't consider social media responses from their constituents, which helps explain the existence of the congressional Luddite Caucus.\nSPEED READ:\nFACEBOOK VS.

He closely covers the intersection of Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C., tracking how top tech and telecom companies lobby in the nation's capital \u2014 from the ways the industry donates to its regulators, to the sector\u2019s activities to shape state and federal debates on privacy, cybersecurity, net neutrality and more. Before arriving at POLITICO in 2010, Romm worked as a tech and general assignment blogger at The Hill, where he also covered healthcare reform, and he's previously published work at The Washington Post, Slate and Stateline.org. You can often find Romm on weekends screaming at any television on which the Philadelphia Eagles or Phillies are playing.\n\n                                            By \nJack Shafer\n\n\n                                            By \n                                                    Frederic Hof\n\n\n                                            By \n                                                    Dan Ephron\n\n\n                                            By \n                                                    Rich Lowry\n\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "LinkedIn\u2019s Hoffman on Hillary \u2014 The fate of spectrum reform this year? \u2014 FTC eyeing VW emissions incident", "title": "FanDuel, DraftKings begin lobbying blitz", "url": "http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-tech/2015/10/fanduel-draftkings-begin-lobbying-blitz-linkedins-hoffman-on-hillary-the-fate-of-spectrum-reform-this-year-ftc-eyeing-vw-emissions-incident-consumer-groups-reject-charter-twc-deal-210711", "topics": ["trade"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Zoe Lofgren", "Kyle Cheney", "Rachael Bade", "Roger Wicker", "Henry C.
