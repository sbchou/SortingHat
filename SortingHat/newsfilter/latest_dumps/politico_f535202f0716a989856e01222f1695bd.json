Japan's minister for the TPP, Akira Amari, said he did not know when ministers could meet again if a deal is not reached in Atlanta, where talks have already stretched into their eighth day.\nU.S. negotiators had hoped to win 12 years of market exclusivity for the new class of drugs made from living organisms, the same as under current U.S. law. They now appear willing to take somewhere between five and eight years of protection in the face of concerns from Australia and other countries about escalating health care costs. Longer protections delay the introduction of more affordable versions of the drugs, known as biosimilars.\nU.S. and Australian officials continued to exchange proposals on the drug protection issue in the hopes of finding a compromise the 12 countries could sell to their legislatures. \nCurrently, Mexico, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei provide zero years of exclusivity for biologics. Chile, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore provide five years and Japan and Canada provide eight. Developing countries are expected to be given additional time to implement any more stringent commitments. \nSenate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah has stood fast on his demand for strong protections for the new drugs. But many Democrats and health advocates protest the long timeframe would put important medications out of reach of many people in poorer nations. \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "U.S. officials optimistic they will close giant trade deal", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/trade-tpp-deal-optimism-214403", "topics": ["trade", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Bryan Bender", "Allie Grasgreen Ciaramella", "John King", "Manuel Noriega", "Akira Amari", "Rachael Bade", "Henry C.
