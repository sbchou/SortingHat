{"body": " The explanation that Carly Fiorina offered for her commanding performance on the Republican debate stage might sound like a counterintuitive one for a politician: It wasn\u2019t what she said, but how hard she listened. \u201cIt was a long debate and I\u2019ll tell you what, I had to do it on high heels,\u201d the former Hewlett Packard chief executive said Thursday morning on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cBut I was paying attention, I was paying very close attention every minute of that debate, because every minute counted for me.\u201d In a GOP presidential race that has been defined by the bombast of one political outsider from the business world, the composure of another one has turned out to be the most effective rejoinder. Fiorina had barely made it onto the stage; she earned her position there by virtue of her performance among the lower-tier candidates in an earlier debate \u2014 and the fact the CNN had agreed to change the qualifying rules to reflect her recent gains in the polls.    Donald Trump was put to the test Wednesday night in the second GOP debate, while Carly Fiorina emerged as the big winner of the night. From the debate stage to the media crush, go behind the scenes from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif. (Alice Li/The Washington Post)   But by the end of those three hours, pretty much everyone agreed that Fiorina, the only woman among the 11 GOP candidates, had won the evening.  [Wednesday\u2019s GOP debate transcript, annotated]   Her most memorable line came when she was asked to respond to frontrunner Donald Trump\u2019s insulting comments about her appearance. \u201cWould anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?\u201d Trump was quoted as saying in a recent interview with Rolling Stone. Rather than expressing umbrage of her own, Fiorina replied levelly: \u201cI think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.\u201d Listening is indeed an underrated, and underused, skill among politicians. But that\u2019s not the case with voters \u2014 a lesson, Fiorina has said, that she learned from a woman she met in a New York homeless shelter last spring.  In an April interview with journalist Nina Easton at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Fiorina recalled the woman telling her: \u201cKeep talking. We\u2019re listening.\u201d     Where the Republican presidential candidates stand on Kim Davis, Planned Parenthood and other big issues View Graphic     Where the Republican presidential candidates stand on Kim Davis, Planned Parenthood and other big issues   \u201cYou know, all these politicians up here, they\u2019re in their world and they\u2019re talking in their language,\u201d the woman said. \u201cExcept what they\u2019re talking about and what they\u2019re doing up there, it impacts those of us down here.\u201d It was, Fiorina said, \u201cas concise a definition of the disconnect that people feel between their lives and the political process as I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d As she listened to the other contenders Wednesday night, Fiorina said, she kept alert for openings. \u201cI had to take some opportunities as well,\u201d she said on MSNBC. She interjected a moment of high emotion, for instance, as her rivals were discussing the prospect of a government shutdown over funding for Planned Parenthood.  \u201cAs regards Planned Parenthood, anyone who has watched this videotape, I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes. Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain,\u201d Fiorina said.  [Fact-checking the debates]  That scene is described by a Planned Parenthood technician in the third episode of secretly recorded interviews by the Center for Medical Progress, an anti-abortion group. It is accompanied by video of a live fetus. \u201cCarly Fiorina did exactly what we want to see our pro-life allies in Congress do,\u201d Marjorie Dannenfelser, head of the Susan B. Anthony List, an organization that aims to elect anti-abortion candidates, wrote in a blog post. Fiorina also recycled some of her most crowd-pleasing lines from the speeches that she has been been giving on the campaign trail.  \u201cShe does not have a track record of accomplishment,\u201d Fiorina said of former secretary of state Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee. \u201cLike Mrs. Clinton, I, too, have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles around the globe. But unlike Mrs. Clinton, I know flying is an activity, not an accomplishment. Mrs. Clinton.\u201d \u201cIf you want to stump a Democrat,\u201d Fiorina added, \u201cask them to name a accomplishment of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s.\u201d To the degree that Americans know anything about Fiorina, it is in connection with her stormy tenure as the head of Hewlett Packard. After achieving acclaim for being the first woman to head one of the nation\u2019s 20 largest corporations, she was fired in 2005 after engineering the company\u2019s disastrous acquisition of Compaq. Fiorina also tried to acquaint the debate\u2019s huge audience with the more personal side of her biography, which includes the loss of a stepdaughter to addiction. \u201cI think that during that experience, as well as my battle with cancer, I learned that love and faith heal all, if given enough time,\u201d she said Thursday. \u201cI have had good times and bad in my life as all of us have. I have been tested by life.\u201d  What she most wanted voters to come away with, Fiorina said, was one clear idea: \u201c\u201cI hope what people saw last night is that I can win this job and I can do this job.\u201d   ", "byline": "", "description": "How the former CEO found her moments on a crowded debate stage and won the night.", "title": "Carly Fiorina and the underappreciated art of listening", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/carly-fiorina-and-the-underappreciated-art-of-listening/2015/09/17/1af4b92c-5d35-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html", "topics": ["abortion", "women"], "people": ["Marjorie Dannenfelser", "Kim Davis", "Hillary Clinton", "Alice Li", "Donald Trump", "Susan B.
