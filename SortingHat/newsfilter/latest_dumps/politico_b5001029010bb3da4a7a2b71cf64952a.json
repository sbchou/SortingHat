Or is the Internet getting dumber?\u201d): \u201cI am the only journalist peculiar enough to have chronicled since 1988 ... the effect of height on electoral success. ... This is my eighth article on the subject. ... When [Clinton] ran for president in 2008, she was only 5-foot-5. I got this official height report from the Clinton campaign [Now, many news organizations \u2013 and Google -- say she\u2019s 5-foot-7.] ...\n\u201cDonald Trump and Jeb Bush both say they are 6-3, but Trump ... may be exaggerating. At the CNN debate, Bush looked taller. Several candidates said they were 5-foot-11: Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie. ... Marco Rubio is 5-10; Carly Fiorina, 5-6 ... and Rand Paul, 5-8. ... Nearly all, though, look much taller than Clinton, and here is where I am obliged to say that no matter what the Google algorithms say, she may not actually have grown to 5-7.\n\u201cSuch elevation at her age is, my research tells me, quite unusual. Some people who have had the privilege of standing near her recently tell me she seems closer to the 5-foot-5 I reported eight years ago. I e-mailed Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill to check the 5-foot-7 reports. ...
