{"body": "   Republican presidential candidates, from left, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Scott Walker, Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and John Kasich take the stage for the first Republican presidential debate on Aug. 6 in Cleveland. (Andrew Harnik/AP)  It\u2019s been a rough summer for Republican candidates not named Donald Trump. They\u2019ve tried to make inroads, but they\u2019re swimming upstream against a powerful current. Trump, soaring high in the polls, seems indestructible. He\u2019s gaffe-proof. Any previous notion by the GOP\u00a0that it could sit back and let Trump self-implode seems foolish now. And yet attacks against his policy flip-flopping fall on deaf ears. [Jeb Bush attacks Donald Trump, calls him a long-term Democrat] One-time presumptive front-runner Jeb Bush, in the single digits in some polls, is trying out new punchlines against Trump. There were reports, since denied, that Scott Walker and Marco Rubio also wanted to lob some blows. But Trump is like Hydra, cut off one head and two more appear. Yet any fan of Nintendo\u2019s Super Mario Bros. will tell you there are tricks to overtake Bowser, the fireball-spitting, hammer-throwing creature you have to kill to win the game. (One Web site warns: \u201cRemember to stay near Bowser, but not too close, otherwise, you\u2019ll be vulnerable to all of his attacks.\u201d Sound advice.) So how to beat Trump? We think Loop fans can help the other Republicans find a strategy. With the next presidential debate less than a month away, we\u2019re asking you to come up with creative ways the remainder of the GOP field \u2014 clearly at a disadvantage \u2014 can take him on. Yes, it\u2019s time for an August Loop contest! We\u2019re off the next two weeks, so you have time to really mull this one.
