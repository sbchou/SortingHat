If politicians oppose gun safety measures, he continued, \u201cEven if they\u2019re great on other stuff, you\u2019ve got to vote against them.\u201d\nObama\u2019s ongoing call for action was in contrast to Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, who responded to a question on Friday about gun control.\n\n\n\n            By \nLauren French\n\n\u201cI had this challenge as governor,\u201d Bush said in South Carolina. \u201cLook, stuff happens, there's always a crisis. And the impulse is always to do something and it's necessarily the right thing to do.\u201d\n When a reporter read Bush\u2019s remarks to Obama, the president said, \u201cI don\u2019t even think I have to react to that one. I think the American people should hear that and make their own judgments based on the fact that every couple of months we have a mass shooting, and make them decide whether they consider that \u2018stuff happening.\u2019\u201d\nWhile Obama said he\u2019d directed his staff to look for more ways to take executive action and enforce existing laws, the president said he plans to use his bully pulpit on the issue for the rest of his presidency.\nPresident Obama's remarks on gun violence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to talk about this,\u201d Obama said, \u201cand I\u2019m going to politicize it.\u201d\nIntended or not, Obama\u2019s call for single-issue voting could have consequences in the race among Democrats to succeed him. Consistent support for gun control is one of the few areas where Hillary Clinton is positioned to the left of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Sanders, who comes from a rural state, was endorsed by the National Rifle Association during his first run for Congress, and he has voted against the Brady Bill and other gun control measures. \nSarah Wheaton is a White House reporter for Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m going to talk about this,\u201d Obama said, \u201cand I\u2019m going to politicize it.\u201d", "title": "Obama urges 'single issue' voting on guns", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/barack-obama-gun-control-laws-single-issue-voting-214392", "topics": ["economy", "personality"], "people": ["Allie Grasgreen Ciaramella", "Joe Pompeo", "Kim Davis", "Kenneth P.
