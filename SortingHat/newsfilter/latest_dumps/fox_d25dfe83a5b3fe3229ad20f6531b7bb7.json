In some instances, the cardholders' full names may also be among the captured data.\nTrump hotels caught up in the hack include those in the cities of Chicago, Honolulu, Las Vegas, Toronto, and Miami, with two premises in New York City hit.\nAn initial investigation has so far found no evidence of customer data being misused, the chain said, though as a precautionary measure it's offering affected customers 12 months of free identity-theft protection. In addition, it warned those who've engaged with the hotel's payment systems during the specified time period to check their credit and debit card account statements for signs of suspicious activity.\n\nRelated: 2014 was the biggest year for malware yet\nThis isn't the first case of a high-end hotel chain being hit by hackers, and very likely won't be the last. Earlier this year, luxury hotel outfit Mandarin Oriental was caught up in a similar kind of security breach that also involved compromised payment terminals.\nSuch point-of-sale systems have proved rich pickings for cybercriminals over the last 18 months or so. Remember the six-month Home Depot hack? Target, too, was hit in a high-profile incident at the end of 2013.\nIn many cases, the stolen data ends up being sold on illicit hacking forums, with buyers using it to purchase goods online or withdraw money from bank accounts.", "byline": "", "description": "The Trump hotel chain has confirmed a data security breach involving malware that the company says was on its payment systems for just over a year.", "title": "Trump hotel chain confirms year-long data hack", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2015/10/06/trump-hotel-chain-confirms-year-long-data-hack/", "topics": ["personality", "mexico", "other"], "people": ["Donald Trump"], "orgs": ["Trump International Hotel"], "authors": [{"author_id": 1377, "fullname": "trevor mogg", "primary_org": "fox"}], "date_written": "2015-10-06 11:45:38", "org": "fox", "article_id": "d25dfe83a5b3fe3229ad20f6531b7bb7", "date_access": "2015-10-06 13:30:41.337486"}
