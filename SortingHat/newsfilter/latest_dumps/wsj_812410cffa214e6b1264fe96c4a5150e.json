{"body": "Tired of plodding growth, stagnant wages and widening inequality, most Americans have little positive to say about the U.S. economy. With one notable exception. In a Gallup poll this summer, almost two-thirds expressed confidence in small businesses. That\u2019s three times as many as said the same about big business. Only the U.S. military ranks consistently as high.\nThe faith in small business runs deep but rests on an increasingly unsure foundation. Small firms have been slow to recover from the recession, and business deaths now outpace births for the first time since the Census Bureau began keeping records more than three decades ago. A July survey by the National Small Business Association showed that only 35% of owners are optimistic about the direction of the economy.\nThese warning signs should light a fire under Democrats and Republicans. The health of small local firms is one of the vital signs of democracy, a key indicator of community well-being.\nSmall businesses continue to create most new jobs and employ about half of the private workforce, according to data from the Small Business Administration. They are launchpads for innovation and opportunity. As chairman of McLarty Cos., a fourth-generation family-owned automotive firm that began as a single car dealership in Hope, Ark., I\u2019ve seen firsthand how small businesses can transform Main Street into an avenue to the American dream.\nThat avenue is now strewn with potholes and obstacles, including taxes and regulations. Despite the gilded image of startups like Uber and Airbnb, many new small firms struggle to find financing.  Wendy Guillies, president of the Kauffman Foundation, reported earlier this year that more than half of young companies that applied for credit were turned down. Her conclusion: \u201cAcross the board, the American economy appears to be getting less dynamic.\u201d\nWhere can we look for big thinking about small business? Neither the sweeping promises of economic populism, aimed largely at Wall Street, nor the antigovernment reflexes of some on the right, squarely address the problems of small business. But policies that help smaller firms compete, thrive and create good jobs are needed, and there are good ideas from both sides of the political aisle.\nTax reform is one such idea. Small businesses can\u2019t compete with large corporations that find creative ways to lower their taxes. The money they must spend to comply with the complicated tax code is a heavy burden. Addressing these points last month, Democratic presidential candidate  Hillary Clinton proposed a program of \u201ctax relief and simplification\u201d for entrepreneurs, and promised \u201cless red tape\u201d and \u201ceasier access to capital.\u201d\nMrs. Clinton has said that she wants to be \u201cthe small business president.\u201d She will not be alone on the campaign trail. Among Republicans, Gov.  John Kasich pushed this year to eliminate the income tax in Ohio on most small businesses.  Jeb Bush\u2019s supporters cite his record as governor when Florida was the nation\u2019s leader in small business creation.\nIn Congress, bipartisan efforts are seeking to curb some onerous regulations for small businesses. The Small Business Healthcare Relief Act is sponsored by Sens.  Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) and  Heidi Heitkamp (D., N.D.) and Reps.  Charles Boustany Jr. (R., La.) and  Mike Thompson (D., Calif.). It would protect firms with fewer than 50 employees that offer health reimbursement accounts being penalized under the Affordable Care Act for providing this cost-sharing option to employees.\nCongress and the White House also should rally bipartisan support for the expansion of vocational training and apprenticeships. In a recent survey by the National Federation of Independent Business, about half of small business owners seeking new employees said they had difficulty finding qualified applicants. Training costs for small businesses should be offset by tax breaks and other incentives.\nA thread running through these efforts is an opportunity to find common political cause, the antithesis of today\u2019s unfortunate division and distrust. After all, it takes cooperation to launch a small business. As the late Republican Congressman  Jack Kemp once said, \u201cYou can\u2019t create more employees without first creating more employers.\u201d And you can\u2019t sustain employers without a well-trained, fairly paid and engaged workforce.\nSmall business owners are clear about what they want from Washington. Asked in last month\u2019s National Small Business Association survey to rank their priorities for the administration and Congress, the top responses were simplify and cut taxes, reduce the national deficit, and \u201cend the partisan gridlock and work together.\u201d The message to the country\u2019s political leadership is clear: Lead, or get out of the way.\nMr. McLarty, former White House chief of staff and special envoy for the Americas under President  Bill Clinton, is chairman of McLarty Associates, an international strategic-advisory firm.", "byline": "", "description": "Small firms are economic drivers\u2014and need help.
