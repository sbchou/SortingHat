No one wants to know more than Speaker John Boehner.\nBoehner intends this week to set a date for the election to succeed him. But he doesn't know whether Ryan will run, and, if not, the Ohio Republican could be in a serious jam. \nStory Continued Below\nMany \u2014 including Boehner and his leadership team \u2014 believe the 45-year-old Ways and Means Committee chairman is the only viable candidate to be the next speaker. Yet if Ryan doesn't run, GOP lawmakers and senior aides doubt the election will be wrapped up by Oct. 30, when Boehner planned to leave Congress. Boehner, who has pledged to remain in place until a new speaker is chosen, could be forced to stay put and deal with thorny budget issues and raising the debt ceiling as a lame-duck speaker. His internal clout has been severely diminished, and he would likely have to cut deals with Democrats to get any measures passed while still holding onto the speaker's gavel. \nBoehner, who has a condominium in Florida and enjoys his golf, is itching to get out of the Capitol and wrap up his congressional career, allies say. But he has raised $300 million for House Republicans since 2009, spending hundreds of days a year on the road, and he isn't going to leave the party in the lurch. Boehner is willing to stay for some of November but does not expect to be in Congress come Thanksgiving, according to multiple aides with knowledge of his plans. The end of the year or the end of 2016? That's a pipe dream for Boehner loyalists.\n\n\n\n            By \nRachael Bade\n\nRyan isn't making this easy for anyone. Despite lobbying from Boehner, Mitt Romney and a parade of other GOP stalwarts, Ryan has not given any indication whether he'll run. Some lawmakers and aides say Ryan is leaning in favor; others say he won't do it. Ryan is holding his cards so closely to the vest it's difficult to tell where he'll end up. \n\"Members are frankly asking the same questions as you are, as the public is,\u201d said National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden of Oregon. \u201cThey want to know: 'Where is this going?' It's all on the pause button out of courtesy and respect for Paul Ryan.\u201d\nShould Boehner stay, several GOP leadership aides say they expect hard-line conservative Republicans to force floor votes to boot him from the speakership. Boehner is likely to get Democratic support \u2014 at least on a short-term basis \u2014 to keep him from being overthrown, as long as he is seeking to cut deals with the minority party. Democrats could have Boehner's back if he plays ball with them.\nFor now, Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are negotiating with the White House and Democratic leaders on a multi-stage legislative package that would fund the federal government through the rest of the year and lift the debt ceiling. The borrowing limit must be increased by Nov. 3, according to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. Boehner is looking to jam it through before the end of the month. Boehner doesn't have much room to run on the debt ceiling, where Democrats and President Barack Obama are resisting any negotiations. \nBut Boehner has some leverage on a broader budget deal, as Democrats and GOP defense hawks are looking to boost spending above the caps put in place by the 2011 Budget Control Act. Boehner is trying to parlay that demand for more spending into a broader agreement, which, at this point, seems far off.\n\n\n\n            By \nRachael Bade\n\nRyan, of course, could help Boehner to get this done. The Wisconsin Republican would have to bless any Boehner agreement, and that would bring howls of protest from the right. The opposition could endanger Ryan on the floor during a speaker vote, if he's indeed a candidate.\nThese questions about the party's future are gripping the House Republican Conference, from the Capitol leadership suites down to individual districts across the country. The public may not be obsessed over who the next speaker of the House will be, but their representatives are. And that's set off a furious round of speculation, positioning and posturing inside the leadership and rank-and-file. \nAnd it\u2019s led to an existential question inside the party: Can anyone else get the 218 votes needed to win?\nThere are astonishingly few answers at this point, more than three weeks after Boehner announced his resignation. At least a dozen Republicans \u2014 ranging from nearly unknown backbenchers to promising up-and-comers to veteran chairmen \u2014 are eyeing campaigns if Ryan declines.\nRyan\u2019s plan, according to sources close to him, is to take stock of the House landscape when he returns to Washington this week after the Columbus Day recess. If there\u2019s still a clamoring for him to run, Ryan will hear his colleagues out.\nIf Ryan passes, it will be a free-for-all, and senior GOP lawmakers and aides don't see any clear front-runner. The next speaker could end up being someone not even on the radar at this point.\nAt least a dozen Republicans have floated themselves, or been floated, for speaker. Hopefuls include members from practically every segment of the House Republican Conference. \n\nHistory Dept.\n\n            By \n                    Alan Greenblatt\n\nAn array of committee chairmen \u2014 including Rob Bishop and Jason Chaffetz of Utah; Jeff Miller of Florida; Texas Reps. Mike Conaway, Pete Sessions, Mike McCaul and Bill Flores; and John Kline of Minnesota \u2014 have been talked about as potential candidates. Freshman Rep. Ryan Zinke, a well-liked but little-known former Navy SEAL from Montana, says he\u2019s willing to serve, as does third-term Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, although to classify them as dark horses may be far too generous. \nKansas Rep. Mike Pompeo, a rare blend of West Point and Harvard Law, is making calls to gauge his support. Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn\u2019s allies see a future groundswell of support encouraging her to run, although there\u2019s little evidence of that at the moment. Florida Rep. Daniel Webster, who might not have a congressional district by November 2016, is still in the speaker race. Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole, a former chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, and Georgia Rep. Lynn Westmoreland have discussed the possibility of running with their colleagues if Ryan does not.\nTo become the speaker-designate for Republicans, a hopeful would have to win a majority of the 247 House Republicans, or 124 votes. If Ryan is not a factor, then the calculus inside the GOP Conference becomes nearly impossible to figure out. A candidate who survives the early round of ballots with a relatively small number of supporters could suddenly find himself or herself vaulted into the speaker's chair. A behind-the-scenes deal between competing factions \u2014 say, Boehner allies, the moderate Tuesday Group and defense hawks \u2014 could end up picking a winner. Yet that person would still have to win 218 votes on the floor with no help from Democrats.\n\"Nobody knows who would be in the race if Paul didn't run,\" Westmoreland said. \"If you got 12 people running, you [might need] 20 votes to make it to the second round.\" \nWestmoreland joked that multiple ballots could end up \"being a little shorter than the Korean War.\" That conflict lasted from 1950 to 1953.\nThe inability to find anyone initially who can get a majority may force some deal-making. When Boehner schedules the election will also be a factor. A protracted delay of several weeks could allow room for Republican coalition-building behind a preferred candidate.\n\n\n\n            By \nEliza Collins\n\nYet GOP insiders say they don\u2019t see anyone besides Ryan being able to change the difficult political dynamic inside the House Republican Conference. And there\u2019s no indication at this point that anyone other than the reluctant former vice presidential candidate can get the 218 votes on the floor needed to become the 54th speaker.\nWalden, who oversees the House GOP fundraising machine, doesn't think there will be long-term repercussions with donors or the Republican base unless the internal leadership turmoil drags out for several more weeks or longer.So much public attention is focused on the presidential race \u2014 congressional fundraising traditionally slows down between Thanksgiving and the holiday season \u2014 that Walden doesn't anticipate a huge spillover effect yet.\n\"I start to get a little concerned out in the future, when you start talking about January,\" Walden said. \"There's not too much that happens between now and January that we can't cover. ... But we still have time to get back in the saddle with January, February, March.\"\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "A melee is likely if Paul Ryan says no to speaker, and that may postpone John Boehner's departure from Congress.", "title": "Boehner faces treacherous path to the exits", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/ryan-boehner-and-what-it-all-means-214895", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "trade"], "people": ["Lauren Dezenski", "Allie Grasgreen Ciaramella", "Burgess Everett", "Mike Pompeo", "Paul Dallison", "John Kline", "Lauren Gardner", "Greg Walden", "Rachael Bade", "Grover Norquist", "Jeff Miller", "Carl Hulse", "Hadas Gold", "Angela Merkel", "Carla Marinucci", "Orrin Hatch", "Natasha Korecki", "Jack Lew", "Marsha Blackburn", "Ben Schreckinger", "Theodoric Meyer", "Brian Mahoney", "Jeremy Herb", "John Boehner", "Ryan Zinke", "Josh Gerstein", "Brianna Ehley", "Eliza Collins", "Lynn Westmoreland", "Shane Goldmacher", "Nick Gass", "Trey Gowdy", "Brett Norman", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Mike Kelly", "Matthew Karnitschnig", "Mike Conaway", "Andrew Glass", "Donald Trump", "John Bresnahan", "Bill Flores", "Pierre Briancon", "Barack Obama", "Paul Ryan", "Bernie Sanders", "David Pittman", "Tim Starks", "Tom Cole", "Rob Bishop", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Adam Sneed", "Adam Behsudi", "Brian Faler", "Doug Palmer", "Sarah Karlin", "Vince Chadwick", "Hillary Clinton", "Pete Sessions", "Mitt Romney", "Ben White", "Jake Sherman", "Daniel Webster", "Eric Wolff", "Jason Chaffetz", "Alan Greenblatt", "Chase Purdy"], "orgs": ["Washington And The World", "CIA", "House Benghazi Committee", "Fed", "Congress", "Senate", "NSA", "Budget Control Act", "One Nation", "Treasury", "Supreme Court", "Navy SEAL", "House Republicans", "National Republican Congressional Committee", "House Republican Conference", "House GOP", "Senate GOP", "TPP", "Umpqua Community College", "FBI", "GOP"], "authors": [{"author_id": 31592, "fullname": "gabriel debenedetti", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-10-19 10:17:50", "org": "politico", "article_id": "33def86ceb1cd4ec61c779c8963193ad", "date_access": "2015-10-19 17:30:11.032393"}
