But forensics experts still might be able to recover some information.\nThere have been reports that some of the emails that Clinton turned over included classified information. Clinton maintains that she neither sent nor received classified data, which suggests the missives might have been marked after the fact as classified or with some other top-secret classification.\nThe emails that Clinton gave to the State Department were on multiple storage devices.\u00a0 A Clinton lawyer turned over at least one thumb drive that reportedly included copies of the emails that his client has already given to the federal government. \u00a0\nClinton has maintained that she has done nothing wrong or illegal and says she will cooperate fully with the non-criminal investigations.\nHowever, polls show the controversy and frequents news headlines have hurt the front-running Clinton among potential voters, who are increasingly questioning her transparency and trustworthiness.", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "More evidence, questions arise about existence of second, private Clinton email server", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/22/more-evidence-questions-arise-about-existence-second-private-clinton-email/", "topics": ["women", "trade", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Hillary Clinton"], "orgs": ["Justice Department", "FBI", "State Department", "Platte River Networks", "The Washington Examiner"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-08-22 21:30:22", "org": "fox", "article_id": "b66e8c7cfcdcf57ce90ce31c32314ad0", "date_access": "2015-08-22 20:50:03.046998"}
