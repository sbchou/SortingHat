It is customary and well understood that these become the property of the Committee and that\u2014consistent with the separation of powers\u2014obviously the House may determine how to use them,\u201d Ware said Tuesday when asked to comment on State's memo. \n\u201cThat said, the State Department and the Committee have had an understanding from the beginning that any documents produced could be released publicly by the Committee and that it is the prerogative of the Committee to make this determination. The Committee is handling documents consistent with this agreement and has provided the Department an opportunity to recommend certain sensitive information be redacted,\" he added.\nThe arrangement appears to give the State Department and the panel the opportunity to blame each other if sensitive information is released intentionally or inadvertently at Thursday's hearing or in the lead-up to it.\nSuch a controversy over the thoroughness of State\u2019s review and the wisdom of Gowdy\u2019s plan to release the emails erupted Monday after a single email he made public online Sunday contained the name of a former Libyan intelligence official who reportedly cooperated with the CIA, Moussa Koussa.\nState Department spokesman Mark Toner acknowledged a \u201chuman error\u201d in failing to flag that name for deletion, although he said the CIA had not requested withholding the name. Gowdy aides substituted a new version of the document on the web, excising Koussa\u2019s name, and blamed State for the foul-up. \nHowever, in a letter Sunday Gowdy had asserted that his panel would exercise independent judgment about what information should be released and had access to experts who are \u201cuniquely well suited to gauge intelligence information and how it should be handled.\u201d\nDemocrats have also requested that State review for sensitivity some documents they may wish to make public at the Thursday hearing, a source familiar with the process said.\n\nCongress\n\n            By \nRachael Bade\n\nRelying on the FOIA process, as State suggests, could mean a longer wait for many of the documents. So far, State has released only about 37% of the roughly 54,000 pages of Clinton emails she turned over to her former agency last December. Clinton has said she wants the messages released as soon as possible. \nMonthly court-ordered email releases are expected to continue through January. Those monthly releases are generally working through Clinton\u2019s four-year tenure at State in chronological order, although a batch of about 850 pages of Benghazi related records were released publicly in May. State officials have said there is no plan to prioritize an additional 950 Libya-related records the panel received last month in preparation for Thursday's hearing, including the Blumenthal emails State provided in redacted form Saturday.\nA memorandum of understanding negotiated between State and the Benghazi committee gives State five days to review documents that the panel wishes to release publicly but provides no assurance that the committee will abide by the proposed State redactions.\nThe State memo described the review of the Blumenthal-related emails for FOIA purposes as incomplete. \u201cThe enclosed documents do not reflect the input of all of the various other executive agencies that may have equities in certain documents,\u201d the memo said.\nAs a practical matter, executive branch agencies have little control over information once it is turned over to congressional committees. While legislators may face internal sanctions for releasing classified information, the Constitution\u2019s Speech or Debate Clause immunizes lawmakers against legal repercussions for disclosures in the course of their duties.\nIf agency officials disagree with a congressional decision to disclose records, they may suspend cooperation with Congress. But Congress retains its subpoena and funding power, ultimately giving lawmakers the upper hand in most such disputes.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Despite review, agency calls messages 'not appropriate for public release.'", "title": "State Department objects to email release by Benghazi panel", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/state-department-objects-benghazi-panel-email-release-214965", "topics": ["immigration", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Ray Takeyh", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Justin Trudeau", "Rachael Bade", "Jim Jordan", "Henry C.
