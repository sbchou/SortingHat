James told The Hollywood Reporter: \"I can speak for myself \u2014 my politics are a private matter. I\u2019ve never spoken about them publicly.\"\nThe extent to which James and Lachlan's political leanings may differ from their father's has fueled speculation about what their ascension means for Fox News chief Roger Ailes\u2014arguably a hero in Republican circles\u2014who now reports to them and Rupert jointly.\nLachlan reportedly clashed with Ailes when the former was an executive at News Corp. in the early- to -mid-2000s. That was years before the corporate split in 2013 that removed U.S. television assets like Fox News from News Corp. and put them under the newly minted 21st Century Fox banner.\n\"We both talk to him all the time,\" Lachlan said of Ailes, responding to a question about their relationship. \"The business he\u2019s built, and the channels he\u2019s built, are terrific. We have a huge regard for him, and he\u2019s done a great job.\"\n \"We have a good relationship with Roger, and it\u2019s been a long one,\" echoed James. \"Certainly, from my perspective, he just signed a new contract and we\u2019re really pleased with that, and we hope he stays for as long as he wants.\"\nSpeaking of Fox News, the Brothers Murdoch were asked if they get involved when the network comes to blows with Donald Trump.\n\"We\u2019ll always support our editors and news producers, and certainly our journalists,\" said Lachlan. \"If someone wants to have a feud with any of them, not just Donald Trump, we\u2019ll always support our really hard-working and decent journalists. Part of our job is to protect them.\" \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Rupert&#39;s children are known to be more liberal than their father, though they are not as public about their beliefs as he.", "title": "Murdoch heirs defend father Rupert, profess their love of Ailes", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2015/10/murdoch-heirs-defend-father-rupert-profess-their-love-of-ailes-215003", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Katy O'Donnell", "Joe Pompeo", "Anna Palmer", "Hadas Gold", "Paul Demko", "Lauren French", "Steven Shepard", "Barack Obama", "Joe Biden", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Theodoric Meyer", "Nahal Toosi", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Patrick Temple", "Roger Ailes", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Jeremy Herb", "John Bresnahan", "Marco Rubio", "Carl Icahn", "Eliza Collins", "Paul Ryan", "Nicholas Vinocur", "Brianna Ehley", "Rupert Murdoch", "Tim Starks", "Adam Sneed", "Donald Trump", "Ben Bernanke", "Jack Lew", "Jake Sherman", "Victoria Guida", "Eric Wolff", "Bill Tomson", "Darius Tahir", "Ben Carson", "Caitlin Emma"], "orgs": ["EMV", "NRCC", "Congress", "Senate", "UAW", "House Democrats", "PAC", "Treasury", "Metro", "GOP", "House Freedom Caucus", "The Hollywood"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30728, "fullname": "nick gass", "primary_org": "politico"}, {"author_id": 31592, "fullname": "gabriel debenedetti", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-10-21 16:12:58", "org": "politico", "article_id": "4ffb6b859f79b7e3a9e399ece9ad3fac", "date_access": "2015-10-21 19:00:16.478754"}
