{"body": "\t\t\t\n\t\t  \tThe businessman\u2019s got billions. The senator\u2019s got ambitions.\n\nTogether, they make an imposing match for a march to the White House.\n\nSouth Florida billionaire Norman Braman's long-time support \u2013 through financing and friendship \u2013 of Sen. Marco Rubio is now under the spotlight as the former Philadelphia Eagles owner is expected to spend between $10 million and $25 million to fund the presidential candidate\u2019s super PAC.\n\nBut it isn't just Braman\u2019s mega-money that is attracting people's attention.\n\nThe Braman family's philanthropic foundation counts as one of its employees Jeanette Rubio, the candidate\u2019s wife. The group pays her more than $50,000 for a part-time job, reports the Tampa Bay Times. Braman also gave Florida International University $100,000 that helped fund a teaching job for Rubio, according to the New York Times, which noted that the 82-year-old benefactor \u201chas left few corners of Rubio's world untouched.\u201d\n\nThe Florida senator, who in the past has also been Braman\u2019s lawyer, is defending his ties to the donor, saying he\u2019s a long-time friend and has never asked for any favors in return for his financial support.\n\nBraman, Rubio has said to reporters, is like a second father who has counseled him about which books to read and how to be a leader. After Rubio's father died in 2010, Braman called him every other day to see how he was coping.\n\n\"What is the conflict?\" he responded when asked by the Times whether he saw any ethical concerns in his ties to Braman. \"I don't ever recall Norman Braman ever asking for anything for himself.\"\n\nHe told MSNBC, \"Norm Braman is a great man, a pillar of the South Florida community and someone who I\u2019m personally close to. I\u2019m very proud to be associated with him.\"\n\nQuestions about Rubio\u2019s relationship with Braman come as his fellow Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), faces federal charges that he accepted money and gifts from a Florida doctor \u2013 Salomon Melgen, who long has donated to Menendez's campaigns \u2013 and in exchange made moves using his political office that benefited Melgen. Menendez and Melgen both deny the charges.\n\nIn an April interview with the Washington Post, Braman \u2013 who is an ardent detractor of the another\u00a0potential presidential candidate from Florida, former Gov. Jeb Bush \u2013\u00a0said he\u2019s had his eye on Rubio, whom he met in the early 2000s, for a long time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tracked him and watched his growth, watched him become speaker of the [Florida] House,\u201d Braman said. \u201cI was incredibly impressed with his intellect, his gift of communication. He was somebody who dealt with solutions.\"\n\n\"Everybody runs for political office knocking somebody and very few run on, \u2018This is what I stand for. This is what I believe will solve these problems,'\" he said. \"That\u2019s what Rubio did when he was ... in a position of leadership here in Florida. And that\u2019s how he\u2019s been and how he\u2019ll be in his candidacy.\u201d\n\nSounding a theme that Rubio used when he launched his presidential campaign, Braman added, \u201cHe also represents the future, not the past. We\u2019re in 2015 \u2013 it\u2019s not 1988.\u201d\n\nMany political experts say big-time donors have become an integral part of presidential campaigns, and they don\u2019t expect the Rubio-Braman link to adversely affect the candidate, who has done well in early polls.\n\n\u201cSen. Rubio has to get through the primaries and to do that he will need lots of money, a situation shared by each of his competitors,\u201d Louis DeSipio, a professor of political science and Chicano/Latino studies at the University of California at Irvine, told Fox News Latino. \u201cNone of the candidates are in a position to self-fund. So all the successful candidates will each have large contributors, each of whom will have made his/her money in a way that could potentially be questioned.\u201d\n\nIf Rubio wins the Republican nomination, DeSipio added, and runs against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the general election, she is likely to face many more questions about funding than he will.\n\nThe Democrats, meanwhile, casts the Rubio-Braman link in a different light.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder millionaires and billionaires are backing Rubio and these GOP candidates,\u201d Pablo Manriquez, the Democratic National Committee's Hispanic media director, in a statement. \u201cThey have consistently supported policies that protect the wealthy\u2019s bottom line while slashing programs that create opportunity for middle class families.\u201d\n\n\u00a0Elizabeth Llorente can be reached at elizabeth.llorente@foxnewslatino.com.
