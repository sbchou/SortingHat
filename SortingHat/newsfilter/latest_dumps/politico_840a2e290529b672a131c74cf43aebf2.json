The disclosure led to Petraeus\u2019s resignation and eventually to his guilty plea earlier this year to a misdemeanor charge he mishandled classified information by storing it at his home and sharing it with Broadwell.\nIn a court filing early Thursday (posted here), the Justice Department pointed to stories on CNN\u2019s website and in POLITICO detailing aspects of a key FBI agent\u2019s deposition in the case. The motion seeking to limit questioning of FBI officials stopped just short of accusing the Kelleys or their attorneys of the leaks, but argued that the disclosures appeared to be part of an effort to abuse depositions in the case to fish for information on topics that government lawyers believe should be off limits.\n\u201cWithin days after the parties (both plaintiffs and defendants) designated certain portions of the [FBI Agent Fred] Humphries deposition transcript as \u2018CONFIDENTIAL-SUBJECT TO THE PROTECTIVE ORDER\u2019, a redacted copy was provided to the media,\u201d DOJ lawyers wrote. \u201cDefendants do not know who provided this transcript to the media, except they know it was not provided by either defendant FBI or DoD nor their counsel.\u201d\n\u201cIn July and August, plaintiffs deposed several current and former DoD employees, and information from those depositions was later provided to the press and reported in news articles appearing to cast plaintiffs in a favorable light,\u201d the Justice Department continued. \u201cOne [AP] story\u2026purported to describe testimony given by the DoD witnesses at these depositions\u2026It also described the plaintiffs \u2018legal strategy,\u2019 including their plans to subpoena journalists.\u201d\nThe DOJ filing argues that the Kelleys\u2019 attorneys are pursuing an \u201culterior motive\u201d by using the depositions to embarrass and harass witnesses and to seek information not related to the only surviving issue in the suit: whether the FBI or Defense Department leaked private information about the Kelleys to the media. Some press accounts after the probe became public suggested Jill Kelley had an affair with Gen. John Allen, something both parties deny.\nA lawyer for the Kelleys, Alan Raul, did not respond to a request for comment for this story.  However, in comments quoted in the pleadings, another lawyer for the Kelleys argued that the manner in which the FBI carried out the investigation and the timing of when individuals received the Kelleys\u2019 personal information was relevant to who may have leaked their personal information and why.\n\u201cI\u2019m being met with obstruction,\u201d Kelley lawyer Guy Neal declared at a deposition last month after government lawyer Lisa Marcus set forth a series of objections and repeatedly instructed FBI Agent Adam Malone not to answer certain questions.\nAt a hearing in the case last week, Judge Amy Berman Jackson criticized \u201can unbelievable waste of time by both sides\u201d during an earlier deposition. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not representative of depositions in this case,\u201d she said.\nLast month, Jackson also dressed down the Kelleys\u2019 legal team for publicly filing a list of nine journalists or former journalists subpoenaed in the case.\nThe latest government motion asks to limit discovery requests and depositions of FBI personnel to \u201cfacts sufficient to show disclosure(s) to the media by one or more FBI employees in a manner violating the Privacy Act.\u201d\nJackson issued an order late Thursday afternoon giving the Kelleys\u2019 legal team until next week to respond the government\u2019s filing.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "A flurry of improper leaks to the media is plaguing a lawsuit the FBI is facing over allegations of it illegally leaked private information, the Justice Department complained Thursday.", "title": "Feds complain leak lawsuit spurred leaks", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2015/10/feds-complain-leak-lawsuit-spurred-leaks-214858", "topics": ["economy", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Kyle Cheney", "Rachael Bade", "Helena Bottemiller Evich", "Henry C.
