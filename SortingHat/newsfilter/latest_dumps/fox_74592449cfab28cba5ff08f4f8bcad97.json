And like other candidates and hopefuls, he will face increasing scrutiny about his politics, policies and outside interests as the race heads toward Election Day 2016. \n\u201cWell, there is going to be a lot of criticism thrown my way,\u201d he said. \nShow host Bob Schafer cited a published news report about the infomercial, which Huckabee has stopped doing, not being supported by the \u201cmedical community\u201d and referred to the kit as a \u201ccure.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou are talking as a populist, a blue-collar populist. You had lent your name for money to questionable products. \u2026 What about that?\u201d Schafer asked. \nHuckabee also made clear the kit focuses on exercise, a healthy diet and maintain low blood-sugar levels and included diet supplements but not pills. \n\u201cThese were not pills,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cThat\u2019s a misnomer.\u201d \nHe also argued that his concern about diabetes is that the disease is one of four medical conditions -- including cancer, Alzheimer's and heart disease -- that are costly to the U.S. health care system. \n\u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Huckabee defends criticism about backing 'questionable' diabetes program", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/10/newest-2016-candidate-huckabee-defends-criticism-about-backing-questionable/", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "economy"], "people": ["Bob Schafer", "Mike Huckabee"], "orgs": [], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-05-10 23:35:32", "org": "fox", "article_id": "74592449cfab28cba5ff08f4f8bcad97", "date_access": "2015-05-10 22:50:17.151798"}
