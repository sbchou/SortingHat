The 40,000-seat Ladd-Peebles Stadium was about half-full when Trump began his speech.\nTrump was welcomed by an array of Alabama politicians, including Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions, who praised him for the attention he's drawn to immigration issues. And Trump led off his speech with more criticism of immigrants living in the country illegally, drawing loud cheers when he repeated his promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.\nHe reiterated his intention to end \"birthright citizenship\" for children of immigrants here illegally.\nTrump also attacked the Obama administration's deal with Iran to restrict that country's nuclear program, calling it \"so sad.\"\n\nAnd he promised to \"repeal and replace Obamacare\" \u2014 the health care law that's President Barack Obama's singular domestic achievement.\nBefore Trump arrived, his fans \u2014 some carrying signs, others wearing T-shirts supporting the billionaire businessman \u2014 spoke of his outsider status in a crowded field dominated by former and current elected officials as the song \"Sweet Home Alabama\" blared from loudspeakers.\n\"Donald Trump is telling the truth and people don't always like that,\" said Donald Kidd, a 73-year-old retired pipe welder from Mobile. \"He is like George Wallace, he told the truth.

That is the way we are here in the South,\" she said.\nMary Anne Bousenitz, 59, a retired psychiatrist from Tuscaloosa, said she isn't offended by the insults Trump has directed at women, like \"dog\" and \"bimbo.\"\n\"I'm not married to the man and it's not like I'm going to have to sit across a turkey at the table with him,\" she said.\nInterest in the candidate forced organizers to move a planned rally from the Mobile Civic Center, which holds about 2,000 people, to Ladd-Peebles Stadium, a 40,000-seat football stadium.\nBefore the rally, Trump tweeted: \"We are going to have a wild time in Alabama tonight! Finally, the silent majority is back!\"\nDuring the height of the Vietnam War, Richard Nixon sought the backing of the \"silent majority,\" widely considered to be Americans who stood behind the Republican president and weren't getting the attention that protesters attracted.
