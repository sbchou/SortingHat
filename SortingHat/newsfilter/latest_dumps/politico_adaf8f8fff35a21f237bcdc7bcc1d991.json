{"body": "POLITICO\nMike Allen's must-read briefing on what's driving the day in Washington\nBy Mike Allen\n6/21/15 9:39 AM EDT\nHappy Dad\u2019s Day \u2013 and first day of summer -- from New Orleans, where we had lunch Friday at Galatoire\u2019s with Jason Recher and Wynn Radford, two George W. Bush alumni now raising daughters down here. After our duck-and-andouille gumbo, Sazeracs and sweet-potato cheesecake, we wandered out to Bourbon Street for a drink \u2013 Friday afternoon is a definite thing in the Big Easy \u2013 and ran into Paul Morse, photographer for both President Bush and the Clinton Global Initiative.\nNext time you\u2019re here, it\u2019s worth the 15-minute drive to Boucherie, in Uptown, for Krispy Kreme Bread Pudding.\nStory Continued Below\nCHUCK TODD, \u201cWhy I\u2019ve Done a \u2018180\u2019 on Father's Day\u201d: \u201cThere was a time I dreaded the third Sunday in June. I had nobody to call. ... Nobody to reminisce with. My dad died when I was 16. ... I had to play grown-up whether I liked it or not. My mother and I became partners, far too often, though, silent ones. She was focused on trying to keep a roof over our heads and making sure I didn't lose momentum to go to college. ... It was about 10 years after my dad died that I realized what an ineffectual jerk I might look by my attempts to ignore the holiday.\n\u201cMy mother had remarried by then to a great guy, who was also a father. And yet, I never even sent him a card or even made a call. ... And then came Father\u2019s Day 2004, three months after the birth of my daughter. I found myself more excited about getting my first Father\u2019s Day card than I had my most recent 10 birthdays.\u201d http://on.today.com/1QKiFwz\nNEW THIS AM: \u201cFiorina, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee Gain Ground in WSJ/NBC News Poll: Bush, Walker, Rubio hold firm; Rand Paul sees support drop since April,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Patrick O\u2019Connor: \u201c[T]he share of likely GOP primary voters who said they could see themselves backing [Rand fell] from 59% in late April to 49% in mid-June.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1dXaTgZ\nTHE GREAT DEBATE \u2013 Two-thirds of the front page of The (Columbia, S.C.) State, \u201cKILLINGS REIGNITE DEBATE ON FLAG: Public, pundits, politicians again vent anger over Confederate flag,\u201d by Jeff Wilkinson: \u201cA renewed push for the flag\u2019s removal [from state Capitol grounds] has arisen quickly. ... [I]n 2000 [the flag] was taken down from the Capitol dome [where it] had flown ... since 1962. A hard-fought compromise resulted in its relocation to behind a monument to Confederate dead at the intersection of Gervais and Main streets, arguably the most prominent intersection in South Carolina. ...\n\u201c[G]arnering enough support for removing the flag may be hard to find in the Palmetto State. In November, a Winthrop University poll ... showed 61 percent of South Carolinians said the flag should continue to fly where it is, while 33 percent say it should not. ... 73 percent [of whites] said the flag should continue flying, while 61 percent of blacks said it should come down.\u201d http://bit.ly/1H6AYYq\n--PUNDIT PREP: \u201cLawmakers set to return to Columbia this week for budget debate.\u201d BUT WILL THEY ACT ON THE FLAG? http://bit.ly/1d9bKdI\nMITT ROMNEY got 36,820 retweets and 37,836 favorites for his tweet hear \u2019round the world: \u201cTake down the #ConfederateFlag at the SC Capitol. To many, it is a symbol of racial hatred. Remove it now to honor #Charleston victims.\u201d\n--President Obama replied from his personal account, @POTUS: \u201cGood point, Mitt.\u201d\nTHE GOP\u2019s 2016 field was more timid \u2013 Marc Caputo and Ali Breland round up the reaction: \u201cJeb Bush was the first candidate to issue a statement, noting that as governor of Florida, \u2018we acted, moving the flag from the state grounds to a museum where it belonged.\u2019 But even Bush showed reluctance to demand that South Carolina remove the controversial flag ... \u2018This is obviously a very sensitive time in South Carolina and our prayers are with the families, the AME church community and the entire state,\u2019 Bush wrote in a Facebook post. \u2018Following a period of mourning, there will rightly be a discussion among leaders in the state about how South Carolina should move forward and I\u2019m confident they will do the right thing.\u2019 ...\n\u201cSen. Marco Rubio approvingly pointed to Bush\u2019s decision, in 2001, to quietly move Florida\u2019s confederate flag from the state Capitol to a museum. [Rubio told reporters at the Miami-Dade Republican Party\u2019s Lincoln Day Dinner:] \u2018I think ultimately the people of South Carolina will make the right decision for South Carolina. And I believe in their capacity to make that decision.\u2019 Asked if moving the flag was an example of the \u2018right decision,\u2019 Rubio wouldn\u2019t say. ...\n\u201cRubio didn\u2019t mention that he signed on to what became a failed bill in the 2001 Florida Legislature that would have prevented the further removal of Confederate and other war memorabilia by executive action. The bill was drafted in opposition to Bush\u2019s unilateral removal of the Confederate flag at Florida\u2019s Capitol. ...\n\u201cWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said in a statement, \u2018The placement of a Confederate flag on the Capitol grounds is a state issue and I fully expect the leaders of South Carolina to debate this but the conversation should wait until after the families have had a chance to bury and mourn their loved ones.\u2019 Ohio Gov. John Kasich said, \u2018This is up to the people of South Carolina to decide, but if I were a citizen of South Carolina I\u2019d be for taking it down.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/1GsTgwl\n--@Vincent Harris, GOP digital guru: \u201cIt seems everyone online is an expert in the Civil War and flags now.

Campaign aides have said Mrs. Clinton will take a vacation in August, but they declined to comment on the specifics of when or where.\n\u201cWhether they rent there or not, the couple are expected to spend much of their vacation on the shores of Long Island, where their circle of New York friends and donors own luxe houses. The Clintons will also spend at least one weekend in their old vacation haunt of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, likely alongside President and Michelle Obama, to celebrate the 80th birthday of their friend Vernon E. Jordan Jr.\u201d\u00a0http://nyti.ms/1QKiaTe\nWHO THEY ARE \u2013 \u201cMarco Rubio, Everyman: Americans say they empathize all too well with the GOP candidate\u2019s financial struggles,\u201d by Adam Wren, a contributing editor at Indianapolis Monthly, writing on Politico http://politi.co/1H6CTw1\nSTATE OF THE ART \u2013 Cover of N.Y. Times Sunday Review, \u201cWhat\u2019s the Matter With Polling? It\u2019s gotten much harder to predict who will win an election, and 2016 will be harder still,\u201d by Cliff Zukin, a professor of public policy and political science at Rutgers University: \u201cThose paying close attention to the 2016 election should exercise caution as they read the polls. Because of the high cost, the difficulty in locating the small number of voters who will actually turn out in primaries and the increasing reliance on non-probability Internet polls, you are likely to see a lot of conflicting numbers.\n\u201c[T]he cellphone problem is more acute in states than it is at the national level, because area codes and exchanges often no longer respect state or congressional boundaries. Some polling organizations will move to sampling from voter lists, which will miss recently registered voters and campaigns\u2019 efforts to mobilize them.\n\u201cWe are less sure how to conduct good survey research now than we were four years ago, and much less than eight years ago. And don\u2019t look for too much help in what the polling aggregation sites may be offering. They, too, have been falling further off the track of late. It\u2019s not their fault. They are only as good as the raw material they have to work with. In short, polls and pollsters are going to be less reliable.\u201d http://nyti.ms/1GeBAWb\n--L.A.

[Some Republicans worry that competing data houses within the GOP are] out of touch with the Silicon Valley culture of information sharing ...\n\u201c\u2018We believe in free markets and innovation,\u2019 said Katie Walsh, chief of staff at the RNC. ... A growing chunk of [GOP data] is under the stewardship of a firm [controlled] by ... Charles and David Koch. The company, i360, ... is proving to be popular with candidates. ... \u2018It is very dangerous to put a company that has no accountability to anyone and is not elected to anything in charge of the data people need to run for office,\u2019 Walsh said.\u201d http://lat.ms/1K4gI8B\nBEYOND THE BELTWAY \u2013 \u201cSweet Briar will remain open, get new president: Agreement brokered by Virginia Attorney General announced Saturday evening\u201d \u2013 The [Lynchburg] News & Advance: \u201cThe agreement comes out of closed-door negotiations brokered by the office of Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring ...

One strike away from the 24th perfect game in MLB history, Scherzer threw a slider to Pittsburgh Pirates pinch-hitter Jose Tabata that caught Tabata on the elbow pad. ...\n\u201cDid Tabata lean into the pitch that separated Scherzer from perfection? ... [Scherzer said:] \u2018Just didn\u2019t finish the pitch. Backed up on me and clipped him ... It\u2019s just one of those things that happened. Just focus on what you can do next.
