{"body": "Not long ago we read that Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign was undertaking its umpteenth effort to \u201chumanize\u201d the candidate. One reader quips that the campaign has \u201cmore reboots than Windows Vista.\u201d (We skipped from XP to Windows 7, so we\u2019re afraid we don\u2019t get the joke.)\nTo judge from this story in the Hill, the inevitable Democratic nominee is now releasing her inner child:\nWhat a silly taunt. But it leads us to some serious\u2014well, half-serious\u2014questions:\nWhat is her position this week on the deals the Obama administration recently struck with Iran and communist Cuba? We thought she supported them, but the invidious comparison suggests disapproval.\nIf the NRA is like \u201cthe Iranians or the communists,\u201d does she recommend the same negotiating strategy the administration has employed with them\u2014i.e., make concession after concession, then declare a diplomatic triumph?\nAnd is red-baiting of civil-liberties organizations now acceptable in Democratic politics? Outrage ensued in 1988 when George H.W. Bush quoted Michael Dukakis\u2019s self-description as a \u201ccard-carrying\u201d member of the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cEven in a negative campaign for President, one topic that ought to be off-limits is questioning an opponent\u2019s loyalty to country,\u201d the New York Times editorialized. (For our younger readers, Dukakis was making ironic reference to the McCarthy-era idiom \u201ccard-carrying member of the Communist Party.\u201d Oh, and he was the Democratic presidential nominee that year.)\nMrs. Clinton made bigger news later in the day when, in an interview with PBS\u2019s Judy Woodruff, she announced her opposition to the Trans Pacific Partnership:\nThis is not really a surprise; as we noted in June, Mrs. Clinton endorsed the (unsuccessful) efforts of congressional Democrats (joined by some Republicans) to scuttle TPP via procedural roadblocks, saying they had \u201clegitimate concerns.\u201d At the time, CNN prepared a list of 45 instances in which Secretary of State Clinton spoke approvingly of the accord, which was then being negotiated. No.\u00a05, from November 2012, is getting wide circulation this week: \u201cThis TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.\u201d\nThough we guess Mrs. Clinton has never actually favored the gold standard.\nIn her latest memoir, \u201cHard Choices,\u201d Mrs. Clinton also described the agreement in glowing terms:\nBut in the next paragraph, she hedged her bets:\nOf course she hasn\u2019t actually read the agreement; she told Woodruff her opposition is based on \u201cwhat I have learned about it.\u201d She cited two particular things she\u2019d heard\u2014that \u201ccurrency manipulation\u201d is \u201cnot part of the agreement, and that the agreement is too favorable to American pharmaceutical companies.\nEven the liberal young-adult site Vox finds these objections ridiculous. \u201cThese are totally plausible arguments for opposing the TPP,\u201d writes Vox\u2019s Timothy Lee. \u201cBut they make no sense as reasons for Clinton to change her mind about the treaty\u201d:\nAs for currency manipulation, the Obama administration \u201cflatly refused\u201d demands from TPP critics to make that part of the agreement:\nThe real reason for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s switch is entirely transparent: Free trade is increasingly unpopular on the Democratic left. (Also, curiously enough, on the Republican right.) She is facing an unexpectedly strong primary challenge from Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent self-described socialist who advocates American autarky.\nAnd it\u2019s not just Sanders. The Wall Street Journal quotes Martin O\u2019Malley, whoever he is: \u201cWow! That\u2019s a reversal! Secretary Clinton can justify her own reversal of opinion on this, but I didn\u2019t have one opinion eight months ago and switch that opinion on the eve of debates.\u201d (The first Democratic primary debate is next Tuesday.)\nMuch has been written about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s difficulties earning voters\u2019 trust. The latest Quinnipiac swing-state poll finds that 59% of respondents in Florida and 61% in both Ohio and Pennsylvania answer in the negative when asked if she is \u201chonest and trustworthy.\u201d Even Donald Trump does slightly better on that question.\nThis is usually understood in terms of her email and other scandals. But her trade turnabout demonstrates that there is also reason to distrust the sincerity of her positions on matters of public policy.\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s flip-flop has drawn comparisons to John Kerry. \u201cHillary on Pacific Trade Pact: She Was for It Before She Was Against It,\u201d reads a puckish Power Line Blog headline. The reference is to then-Sen. Kerry\u2019s awkward 2004 explanation for a protest vote the preceding year against funding the Iraq war: \u201cI actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it.\u201d\nThe comparison is perhaps unfair to Kerry, who also voted in 2002 to authorize the war itself, then reversed his position within months. It\u2019s obvious he cast that vote in the erroneous belief that it would prove politically expedient. Then-Sen. Clinton voted for the war in 2002, too, but waited an eighth of a century before flatly declaring: \u201cI made a mistake.\u201d\nAs with the TPP, one can only speculate what her true position is or was, or indeed if she had or has one at all apart from the political exigencies of the moment. Kerry might not have had the courage of his convictions, but at least he had convictions.\nTwo Papers in One!\n(Hat tip: Walter Olson.)\nOut on a Limb   \u201cWatergate Reporter: Hillary Clinton \u2018Less Than Truthful\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014headline, Washington Examiner, Oct.\u00a07\nWe Blame George W.
