During the show, NBC will announce that TRUMP has confirmed for a similar interview/town hall, date TBD. See the set: two pics http://bit.ly/1LaG1Tt ... http://bit.ly/1LdpZfT \nStory Continued Below\nIt\u2019s the first Monday in October, the opening of the Supreme Court term. \nTRUTH BOMB \u2013 BEARISH ON BIDEN: Visitors to Vice President Biden say their conversations suggest he\u2019s leaning TOWARD a run. A confidant involved in the process told Playbook: \u201cNothing he has heard in the past couple of months has deterred him.\u201d But several friends are making a last-minute plea to him NOT TO DO IT. Their message to the V.P.: With the likely outcome of a race against Hillary Clinton (a beat-down), that\u2019s just not what he needs after what he and his family have been through. \nSuper-close sources tell us the most likely scenario is a family decision NEXT WEEKEND or shortly thereafter, with an announcement (or calls by the Vice President to confidants) possible a week from today -- which happens to be the day before the first Democratic debate. If the decision is a \u201cgo,\u201d the announcement could be delayed as confidantes begin assembling a campaign. \nA former Senate colleague said after visiting the V.P. recently: \u201cHe loves what he does, and he has a great deal of confidence that he could contribute in a meaningful way. He\u2019s willing to face, ultimately, having his final political expedition be a defeat.\u201d \nBut three friends who have talked to Biden said they hope he won\u2019t go. One said he believes that testing the waters has been its own therapy after Biden\u2019s loss of his son \u2013 the V.P. has been showered with love and attention, and should declare victory and avoid a likely political debacle. Another said the long windup \u2013 and the fact that no staff has been hired -- tells its own story: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to run, you run. Every time he pushes back a decision, that\u2019s the ultimate tell.\u201d \nA third said: \u201cI can\u2019t see how he can wake up one morning and think some big tidal wave sweeps him in. The raw politics just aren\u2019t there.\u201d Friends and advisers are split on what he\u2019ll do. \u201cThat\u2019s Joe Biden,\u201d one of them said. \u201cHe could talk to someone on a rope line tomorrow, and decide to do it. His emotional state just increases his unpredictability.\u201d \n **SUBSCRIBE to POLITICO Playbook by email: http://politi.co/1M75UbX\nTHE STATE OF NEWSPAPERS, in one stunning image. http://bit.ly/1iYy5Ov \nWHAT PLAYBOOK IS HEARING: A high-profile Republican House member phoned last night to report that Rep.
