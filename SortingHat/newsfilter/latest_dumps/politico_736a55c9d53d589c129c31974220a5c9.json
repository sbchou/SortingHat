There were zero questions about education over the course of the second, three-hour debate hosted by CNN. And none of the Republican candidates focused on the issue in any substantial way. Education only received fleeting mentions amid a debate heavy on immigration, national security, defense and other issues. (Your Morning Education author could swear a Common Core question was coming when moderator Hugh Hewitt asked Jeb Bush about the \u201celephant in the room.\u201d But alas, no.) POLITICO fact-checked the candidates on a range of issues here: http://politi.co/1W4gnHQ. And here are a few highlights from education\u2019s sudden and short-lived moment in the spotlight:\n\u2014 Donald Trump randomly knocked Jeb Bush on the Common Core, noting that Bush supports the standards despite the fact that they\u2019re a \u201ccomplete disaster.\u201d\n\u2014 Trump and Bush then sparred over speaking Spanish, with Trump insisting that immigrants speak English if they want to assimilate in the U.S. Bush then praised \u201cthe largest voucher program in the country,\u201d referring to Florida\u2019s tax credit scholarship program established in 2001 when he was governor. If one of those voucher students asks him a question in Spanish, then he\u2019s going to answer in Spanish, he said. \n\u2014 Trump at one point inaccurately linked childhood vaccines to autism, calling for \u201csmaller doses over a longer period of time \u2026 We\u2019ve had so many instances \u2014 people that work for me, just the other day. Two years old, 2 1/2 years old, a child, a beautiful child, went to have the vaccine, and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.\u201d Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, said there\u2019s \u201cextremely well-documented proof\u201d that there\u2019s \u201cno correlation between vaccination and autism.\u201d Rand Paul said he\u2019s \u201call for vaccines but I\u2019m also for freedom ... I should be able to spread out vaccines if I want to.\u201d The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that giving children multiple shots at the same time is proven to be safe.\n\u2014 Carson also knocked the Obama administration\u2019s free community college proposal, saying that it\u2019s fiscally irresponsible and it could destabilize the country. \n\u2014 Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said several times that he came out on top after his 2011 brawl with labor unions, including teachers unions, saying he refused to back down even amid a recall effort. He also panned liberal efforts to raise the minimum wage, saying it makes more sense to give people a better education, among other things.\n\u2014 During the earlier debate for the lower-profile contenders, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum linked Kentucky clerk Kim Davis\u2019 faith and refusal to provide marriage licenses to gay couples to Columbine student Cassie Bernall. Santorum said Bernall\u2019s \u201cyes\u201d answer to one of the shooter\u2019s questions about whether she believed in God led to her death. But that story has been widely debunked, with investigators in Jefferson County, Colo., saying it was someone else \u2014 who survived \u2014 who faced that scenario. \n\u2014 Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said he didn\u2019t think Texas high school freshman Ahmed Mohamed should\u2019ve been arrested [http://politi.co/1Qi3CWq] for bringing a homemade clock to school, which Irving, Texas, Police Chief Larry Boyd called a \u201choax bomb.\u201d \nSPEAKING OF 2016 ... NO CANDIDATE LEFT BEHIND: Hillary Clinton took a dig at Republicans on immigration, writing of meeting with DREAMers on Cinco de Mayo this year at a Las Vegas high school. In a column posted on a Univision site, she said the \u201cpolitical debate over immigration has never been easy,\u201d but that she left the meeting thinking that if others could hear the young people she met, \u201cthe debate would be over.\u201d She went on: \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that this summer, the Republican primary would come to seem less like a competition for the highest office in the land and more like a race to see who can make the most hostile, outlandish, vitriolic claims about the immigrant community. I won\u2019t repeat their comments here. I will only say: America is better than this.\u201d More here: http://bit.ly/1iwOVEs \n\u2014 On campus sexual assault, Sen. Bernie Sanders quietly signed onto a Senate bill to address the problem right after Clinton delivered a speech highlighting the issue, according to The College Fix: http://bit.ly/1NDXEl6\n\u2014 ICYMI: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush recently unveiled a political network for college students in an effort to boost support among millennials. About 135 campus chapters are already in place across 36 states, CNN reports: http://cnn.it/1W4dI11. (h/t Young Invincibles)\n\u2014 Republican Sen. Rand Paul said last week at Iowa State University that his campaign has met its goal of establishing 300 student groups within 30 days.

Featured speakers include: Nashville Mayor Karl Dean, Delegated Deputy Secretary John King, Department of Education; Karen Mills, former administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration and senior fellow at Harvard University; and more. Find out more http://politi.co/1LgPvkI and RSVP here.\nRANKINGS BEST ED DEPARTMENT: Just 16 percent of prospective students use Education Department resources like College Navigator in their college search \u2014 but 80 percent of those who do find them helpful, a new survey says. That\u2019s more positive feedback than students give high school guidance counselors or teachers. And department officials \u2014 unlike many colleges \u2014 will be pleased to hear that only 23 percent of respondents used rankings like U.S. News & World Report\u2019s, though higher-income students were more likely to do so. The fifth and final brief in New America\u2019s College Decisions Survey series focuses on how prospective students gather information and what resources they find most useful. The report says college websites and online search engines are the most popular resources \u2014 actual campus visits rank a distant third. White students were significantly more likely to consult their parents than are their peers of other races. Hispanic and low-income students were also most likely to say they didn\u2019t get enough information through their research. New America is live-streaming a 9 a.m. ET presentation and panel on the paper: http://bit.ly/1JyrWPT.\n\u2014 Moving on to graduate students: 2014 was a record-breaking year for applications, offers of admission and enrollment of first-time grad students, which grew 3.5 percent overall, according to a new Council of Graduate Schools report: http://bit.ly/1FNv3Ss.\n\u2014 The Upshot ranks the top colleges doing the most for low-income students: http://nyti.ms/1iQhD3d. \nYOU\u2019RE INVITED: POLITICO Magazine is hosting an event on Sept. 22 about the future of cities and the role of education: How do cities build a skilled urban workforce for the jobs of today and tomorrow? What does it take for community colleges to become a path to success \u2014 and should tuition be free? What have we learned about charter schools and their effect on low-income neighborhoods? Participants include John King, senior advisor delegated duties of deputy secretary of education at the Education Department, and others. Details: http://politi.co/1JQS9t5. \nCOOL CLOCK, AHMED: The Texas teenager who was arrested after he brought a homemade clock to school might be headed to D.C. and Silicon Valley. ICYMI, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed found himself in handcuffs when a teacher spotted his clock and alerted police, mistaking it for a bomb. The resulting firestorm got lots of attention, including from the White House. After President Barack Obama invited [http://politi.co/1Qi3CWq] Ahmed to drop by for a visit, U.S. Chief Data Scientist D.J. Patil wrote about his experience growing up, making things and showing them off to his teachers [http://1.usa.gov/1NDY4Yx]. OSTP Director John Holdren also invited Ahmed to attend the White House Astronomy Night on Oct. 19. Education Secretary Arne Duncan tweeted [http://bit.ly/1Ki9f3i], \u201cWe need to be encouraging young engineers, not putting them in handcuffs. #IStandWithAhmed.\u201d \n\u2014 The tech world got in on the action, too. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg extended an invitation to visit Facebook and saying, \u201cHaving the skill and ambition to build something cool should lead to applause, not arrest.\u201d [http://on.fb.me/1W3Y6KQ] Twitter went one step further, asking Ahmed if he\u2019d consider being an intern [http://bit.ly/1NDZaUb]. \n\u2014 The Texas teenager is likely going to transfer schools following his arrest, The Texas Tribune reports: http://bit.ly/1JcDBCi. \nCHILDREN IN POVERTY: More than one in five children under 18 lived in poverty. That adds up to about 15.5 million children, according to new U.S. Census Bureau [http://1.usa.gov/1KROvVH] figures. The poverty rate for families was 11.6 percent, with an estimated 9.5 million families living in poverty. These figures for 2014 are relatively unchanged from a year earlier.

At a time when politicians often question why government should fund research projects that lack obvious practical benefits, the Golden Goose Award is intended to highlight the \u201cunpredictable nature of basic scientific research and the fact that some of the most important scientific discoveries come from federally funded research that may once have been viewed as unusual, odd or obscure.\u201d \n\u2014 The 2015 recipients are: Walter Mischel, Yuichi Shoda and Philip Peake for their creation of the classic \u201cmarshmallow test,\u201d which led to the development of techniques to boost self-control; Torsten Wiesel and the late David Hubel for their Nobel-prize winning project on neuroplasticity that started with showing moving lights to cats; and Joel E. Cohen and Christopher Small, whose work studying the distribution of human population by altitude ultimately aided disaster preparedness. The ceremony is set to begin at 5:30 p.m. ET, with Frank Sesno, former CNN anchor and director of the George Washington University School of Media and Public Affairs, serving as the master of ceremonies.\nIT\u2019S CONSTITUTION DAY! Today is Constitution Day, and the National Constitution Center and the College Board are launching a new online tool called the Interactive Constitution.

The Interactive Constitution will also be a featured tool in a number of Advanced Placement history and government courses. \u201cAmerica\u2019s Founding Documents, and the Constitution in particular, have inspired a great conversation about freedom, justice, and human dignity that continues to this day,\u201d said College Board president and CEO David Coleman. \u201cIt is a conversation that we need more students to be prepared to join through the careful study of these remarkable documents.\u201d\nMICROSOFT\u2019S COMPUTER SCIENCE COMMITMENT: A day after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called for all public schools to phase in computer science over the next 10 years, Microsoft announced a new $75 million, global commitment toward expanding access to computer science.
