Not Lindsey Graham.\u00a0\nThe South Carolina senator and GOP presidential candidate responded Wednesday to Donald Trump giving out his personal phone number with a dramatic one-minute video, titled, \u201cHow to destroy your cell phone with Lindsey Graham.\u201d\u00a0As the title implies, the video shows the senator mercilessly destroying a phone.\u00a0\nSet to classical music, Graham blends, beats, drops, chops and throws an old mobile to death. He lights it on fire. He shreds it in a blender. He drops it off a roof ... you get the idea.\u00a0\nHe ends with the kicker: \u201cIf all else fails, you can always give your number to the Donald.\" He then says, \"This is for all the veterans,\" and chucks the phone off screen.\u00a0\nGraham\u2019s response, released by IJReview, quickly racked up views on YouTube.\u00a0\n\nThe video is the latest smack in the long-distance spat between Graham and Trump. A day earlier, Trump swiped at Graham by his reading his phone number to supporters at a South Carolina rally.\u00a0That was after Graham called him a \"jackass.\"\u00a0\nThe two have been trading jabs ever since Trump questioned the \"war hero\" status of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a friend of Graham's, over the weekend.\u00a0\nDespite the dramatic -- and, for some, cathartic -- footage of senseless phone\u00a0destruction, though, it turns out the phone in the web video is not Graham's actual phone. The status of the senator's true cell phone remains unclear.\u00a0\nThere was no immediate response to the Graham video from Trump\u2019s team.\u00a0\nThe latest Fox News poll has Trump in first on the GOP side with 18 percent and Graham polling at less than 1 percent.\nFox News' Ashley Koerber contributed to this report.\u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "Most people just toss their old cell phones in the junk drawer.
