{"body": "Republicans rarely have nice things to say about President Obama. Especially those who once wanted to take his job.\n\nBut Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who sought the White House in 2012, gave Mr. Obama a backhanded compliment on Tuesday. He said Hillary Rodham Clinton would be a downgrade if she replaced him.\n\n\u201cI think in the end, while Obama is a radical, and I obviously think he is very dangerous on foreign policy because he is so incompetent, he is not venal and he doesn\u2019t corrupt the entire system,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said in an interview with First Draft. \u201cHaving the Clintons back in the White House would be like having a very bad mayor running a very corrupt city.\u201d\n\nDespite the tough talk, Mr. Gingrich, who will turn 72 next month, said that while he is watching the early machinations of the 2016 race, his days of seeking the presidency were over.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too big a mountain,\u201d said Mr. Gingrich, the longtime former Georgia congressman who is joining the global law firm Dentons as a public policy adviser. \u201cYou have to be honest about what you\u2019re capable of doing.\u201d\n\nWith the \u201cfirst-rate\u201d talent running in the Republican field, he said he thought it would be impossible to break out of the pack. Mr. Gingrich called Jeb Bush a great innovator, said that Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was one of the smartest politicians he had come across, and even suggested that Senator Ted Cruz of Texas was a better debater than he was.\n\nHis own debate strategy, Mr. Gingrich said, was overly reliant on short bombastic bursts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a very good debater,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. \u201cTed would beat me in a standard debate easily.\u201d", "byline": "ALAN RAPPEPORT", "description": "Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and longtime Georgia congressman, said running for president these days is \u201ctoo big a mountain\u201d for him.", "title": "First Draft: Newt Gingrich Weighs In on 2016 Crop and Why He\u2019s Not in It", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/05/20/newt-gingrich-weighs-in-on-2016-crop-and-why-hes-not-in-it/", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "personality", "economy"], "people": ["Jeb Bush", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Marco Rubio", "Barack Obama", "Newt Gingrich", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": ["Clintons"], "authors": [{"author_id": 8381, "fullname": "alan rappeport", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-05-20 14:10:17", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "1ef55d5b6c97949a4356c693b9f52392", "date_access": "2015-05-20 13:58:11.410894"}
