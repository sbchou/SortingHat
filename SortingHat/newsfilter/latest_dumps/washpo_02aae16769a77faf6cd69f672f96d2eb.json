{"body": "   Sometimes, he changes his mind. REUTERS/Jim Young  Donald Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner, has done a lot of things no other GOP candidate this year would dare try: pick a fight with Fox News. Bad-mouth prisoners of war. Wear Palm Beach casual-wear\u00a0to the Iowa State Fair. Tell small children he is Batman. But this might be the most daring: Trump seems to be making up his own platform as he goes along. Looking back over his interviews and speeches, it appears that Trump came into the race with only a vague idea -- or perhaps no idea -- how he wanted to handle some major, obvious, policy issues. So, when someone pointed out a new wrinkle that Trump hadn't thought of, he came up with a new answer. And then another. On some issues, Trump's campaign has gone through more than half a dozen plans in two months. And counting. \u00a0For instance: \u00a0 Donald Trump\u2019s plan to defeat the Islamic State. Version #1: Find a guy. \u201cWithin our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy. I will find the guy that\u2019s going to take that military, and make it really work. \u201d (June 16, presidential campaign kickoff speech) Version\u00a0#2: [Secret plan] Bill O\u2019Reilly, Fox News Channel: \u201cAre you telling me you are going to send American ground troops into Syria?\u201d Trump: \u201cI'm not telling you anything.\u201d (June 16) Version #3: No longer secret. Send in American ground troops. \u201cI will tell you what my plan will be\u2026You have to go in. You have to go in.\u201d O\u2019Reilly: \u201cWith ground troops?\u201d \u201cWell, you bomb the hell out of them and then you encircle it, and then you go in.\u201d (June 16, shortly after Version #2). Version\u00a0#4: Maybe don\u2019t. O\u2019Reilly: \u201cThere's no way you can defeat them without invading.\u201d Trump: \u201cI disagree.\u201d (June 16, minutes after #3). Version\u00a0#5: Definitely do send in ground troops. Have them seize ISIS oilfields. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have so much money.\u201d (Sunday, NBC's Meet the Press). Version\u00a0#6: Send in ground troops. Seize oilfields. Sell the oil, and give the money to the families of the soldiers who died protecting the oil. \u201cWhat I would do with the money that we make, which would be tremendous, I would take care of the soldiers that were killed, the families of the soldiers that were killed, the soldiers, the wounded warriors that are -- see, I love them\u2026\u201d\u00a0(Sunday, NBC's Meet the Press). Version #7: Send in ground troops. Seize oilfields. Sell the oil. Give some of the money to the families of the soldiers who died protecting the oil. Chuck Todd, NBC: \u201cShouldn't [oil money] be given to the Iraqis? Trump: \u201cWell, we can give them something.\u201d (Sunday, seconds after #7) \u00a0 Now, Donald Trump\u2019s plan for the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States.  Version\u00a0#1: Figure it out later. \u201cThe first thing we have to do is strengthen our borders. And after that, we're going to have plenty of time to talk about it.\u201d (July 23) Version\u00a0#2: Figure it out now. Deport \u201cthe bad ones.\u201d Work out something so the good ones can stay. \u201cIf somebody's been outstanding, we try and work something out.\u201d (July 24) Version\u00a0#3: Deport the bad ones. Maybe let some of the good ones stay. \u201cWe're going to do what's right. \u00a0Some are going to have to go.\u00a0 And some, we're just going to see what happens.\u201d (July 26) Version #4: Deport everybody. \u201cBut the good ones -- of which there are many -- I want to expedite it so they can come back in legally.\u201d (July 27) Version\u00a0#5: Maybe don\u2019t deport everybody. Dana Bash, CNN: \u201cWhat about the \u2018Dreamers?\u2019 What about people who came here when they were children, they didn't know what they were doing, they came with their parents who brought them here illegally?...Should they have to leave too? Trump: \u201cThey're with their parents? It depends.\u201d (July 29) Version\u00a0#6: Deport everybody, the sequel. Chuck Todd, NBC: [talking about the \u201cDreamers\u201d] \u201cYou're going to kick them out?\u201d Trump: \u201cThey have to go.\u201d (Sunday, on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d) \u00a0 Then there's Donald Trump\u2019s plan for tax reform. Version\u00a0#1: Make taxes simpler. \u201cSimplify it.\u00a0At a minimum, simplify it.\u201d (June 18) Version\u00a0#2: Don't have a plan. \"You can't be just boom, boom, hard and fast.\" (August 11, in an interview on CNN). Version\u00a0#3: Maybe get rid of the income tax and have a national consumption\u00a0tax, which proponents call a \u201cFair Tax.\u201d \u201cYou can have a \u2018Fair Tax\u2026\u2019 (August 11, just after #2). Version\u00a0#4: Or maybe keep the income tax, but make it one flat rate for everybody. \u201cYou can have a flat tax\u2026\u201d (August 11, just after #3). Version\u00a0#5: Or maybe don\u2019t change the current system at all. Except add new things. Which will be\u00a0really good. \u201cOr you can leave the system alone, which is probably the simplest at this point.\u00a0Leave the system alone and take out deductions and lower taxes and do lots of really good things, leaving the system the way it is.\u201d (August 11, just after #4) Version\u00a0#6: [Secret plan] \u201cI know exactly what I want to do, I just don't want to announce it yet.\u201d (August 11, just after #2, #3, #4 and #5). Version\u00a0#6a: [Definitely secret] Chris Cuomo, CNN: \u201cIf I was sitting across from you, making you a pitch to do anything for you and I said, \u2018Look, I got a plan, but I'm not going to tell you yet.\u2019 I think I'd get an eye roll and I'd get ushered out of the office.\u201d Trump: \u201cOh, I'm going to say it. I'm just not prepared to tell you right now on your fantastic show that is getting better ratings all the time because you have Trump on so much.\u201d (same interview) \u00a0 And Donald Trump\u2019s plan for the nuclear deal with Iran. Version\u00a0#1: Re-negotiate it. \u201cI guarantee you that if I were president, this deal wouldn't be made, a deal would be made that's 100 times better.\u201d (August 11) Version\u00a0#2: Maybe don\u2019t re-negotiate it. \u201cIt\u2019s very tough to do, when you say, \u2018Rip up a deal.\u2019 Because I\u2019m a deal person\u2026I would police that contract so tough that they don't have a chance.\u201d Chuck Todd, NBC:\u00a0\u201cSo the\u00a0deal\u00a0lives, in a\u00a0Trump\u00a0administration?\u201d Trump: \u201cIt's very hard to say, \u2018We're ripping up.\u2019\u201d (Sunday, Meet the Press). \u00a0 Here's Donald Trump\u2019s plan for \u201cObamacare.\u201d Version #1: Get rid of it. Replace it with something \"much better.\" \u201cLet it be for everybody. But much better, and much less expensive for people and for the government. And we can do it\" (June 16, presidential campaign announcement.) Version\u00a0#2: Get rid of it. Replace it with something \"terrific,\" which lets people buy insurance across state lines. And still gives poor people a way to get healthcare, when they can\u2019t pay for it. \u201cI want to take care of everybody. You know, you have a group of people that aren't able to take care of themselves.\" Dana Bash, CNN: \u201cHow do you do that?\u201d (July 29) Version\u00a0#3: Work out \u201csome kind of a deal\u201d with hospitals. \"We're going to have work out some kind of deal with hospitals where they can get some help, when they are sick, when they have no money and they are sick...\" Bash: \u201cHow do you do that, thought?\u201d (July 29, just after #2) Version\u00a0#4:\u00a0The deal will be very, very smart. Trump: \u201cWe are going to have to work out some kind of a very, very smart deal with hospitals around the country.\u201d (July 29, just after #3). \u00a0 And finally: Donald Trump\u2019s plan for governing the United States. Version #1: Be flexible. \u201cWe\u2019ve had no leadership in the country\u2026For doing that, you need compromise. You need back-and-forth. And it\u2019s not about a plan. It\u2019s about flexibility. You need flexibility.\u201d (August 14)", "byline": "", "description": "Trump's policy positions often seem a little like the weather in New England: if you don't like them, just wait a few minutes.", "title": "20 times Donald Trump has changed his mind since June", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/17/20-times-donald-trump-has-changed-his-mind-since-june/", "topics": ["terrorism", "personality"], "people": ["Bill O'Reilly", "Dana Bash", "Jim Young Donald Trump", "Chris Cuomo", "Donald Trump", "Chuck Todd"], "orgs": ["GOP", "United States."], "authors": [{"author_id": 31242, "fullname": "david a. fahrenthold", "primary_org": "washpo"}], "date_written": "2015-08-17 18:00:39", "org": "washpo", "article_id": "02aae16769a77faf6cd69f672f96d2eb", "date_access": "2015-08-17 17:30:03.782714"}
