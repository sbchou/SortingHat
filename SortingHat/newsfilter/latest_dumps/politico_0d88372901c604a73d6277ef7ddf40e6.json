[Jake] Sullivan, Clinton\u2019s top policy adviser, remains in nearly daily contact with White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes.

Clinton on the Fourth of July, during my drive to the Mount Washington hotel in Bretton Woods, N.H., where she was staying, I passed a moose ... It was thrilling, and I felt compelled to tell Clinton about it within seconds of my arrival. \u2018Oh, really? Wow,\u2019 Clinton exclaimed with a big smile as she poured herself a cup of coffee. She might have been humoring me, but still seemed genuinely excited by my sighting and seized on it as a point of connection. \u00a0...\n\u201c[Her Brooklyn campaign headquarters] ... resembled a large insurance company in its expanse of cubicles. ... I spotted Reggie Love, President Obama\u2019s semifamous \u2018\u2018body man,\u2019 meeting with someone in a conference room. He says he was visiting a friend. ... [H]er kickoff speech on Roosevelt Island in New York in June ... was supposed to take place in May, but the campaign put it off. The drafting of her address was described to me as a free-for-all, if not a fiasco.\n\u201cNumerous co-authors from inside and outside the campaign were called in from the various shadow governments of Hillarylands past and present. There were alums from the Bill Clinton White House and the Hillary Clinton State Department (Lissa Muscatine was enlisted) and veterans of Obama World (Jon Favreau), ... along with a far-flung network of friends and advisers and satellites. Clinton ... has never been known for soaring rhetoric \u2014 or, for that matter, inspirational slogans.\n\u201c\u2018She tends to resist starting out with a message and working back to a program,\u2019 said John Podesta, ... chairman of the campaign. ... No one would expect Clinton to meet her husband\u2019s impossible standard as communicator, or Obama\u2019s a speech-giver, but the kickoff address came off more as a hodgepodge than a call to action. ...\n\u201cClinton\u2019s enterprise has a grind-it-out quality reminiscent of Obama\u2019s re-election strategy of 2012: cover your base, attack often. Her team will emphasize data, targeting and field operations \u2014 all specialties [campaign manager Robby] Mook sharpened as a wunderkind state director for Clinton in 2008 ... Ground troops will identify supporters and make sure they vote, without giving much thought to persuading swing voters. In nearly every campaign event, the candidate catalogs all the fights she has waged on their \u2018\u2018everyday American\u2019 behalf. That\u2019s as close as there comes to a big idea in this expedition. ...\n\u201cMook does not sit, as his office is equipped with a standing desk. ... In early July, after much back and forth with the campaign and reluctance on my part, I decided to take the campaign up on its offer of an off-the-record conversation with Clinton. I figured I would use the opportunity ... to ask Clinton directly for an interview or at least to let me do part of our conversation on the record. She chose the latter. ...\n\u201cShe has a knack for extolling her credentials in terms of simply being present: in the Situation Room during the Bin Laden raid, in 112 countries as your secretary of state, as a senator from New York on 9/11. ... \u2018Winning the culture wars is not enough,\u2019 she told me. \u2018It\u2019s never final.
