{"body": "Washington (CNN)Bernie Sanders says he'd have a litmus test for Supreme Court nominees if he's elected president: They'd all support overturning the Citizens United decision. \nThe Vermont senator who's seeking the Democratic presidential nomination said Sunday on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" that he wants to \"overturn this disastrous decision\" that allowed unfettered spending on politics by unions and corporations, rolling back campaign finance contribution limits. \nRELATED: Sanders doesn't want billionaires' backing\nSanders, who said he won't have his own super PAC or endorse one that supports him, is seeking space to Hillary Clinton's left in the Democratic nominating process on Wall Street reform, campaign finance laws, international trade agreements and more. \nHe said Sunday that mega-donors like the conservative brothers Charles and David Koch will play an outsized role in determining the party nominees in 2016. \n\"There is in my view massive dissatisfaction in this country today with corporate establishment and the greed of corporate America,\" Sanders said. \nThe court decided Citizens  United in 2010, but in the decision encouraged Congress to pass more robust campaign spending disclosure laws. Congress, however, has failed to do so.\n", "byline": "", "description": "\n    \n", "title": "Sanders' Supreme Court litmus test: Citizens United", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/10/politics/bernie-sanders-supreme-court-litmus-test-election-2016/index.html", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "trade"], "people": ["Bernie Sanders", "Hillary Clinton", "David Koch"], "orgs": ["PAC", "Supreme Court", "Congress", "Citizens United"], "authors": [{"author_id": 2529, "fullname": "eric bradner", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-05-10 15:58:44", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "d994154963aa989583c3ac5d989e86b9", "date_access": "2015-05-10 15:05:29.928664"}
