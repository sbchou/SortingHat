{"body": "A Republican senator looking for information about Hillary Clinton\u2018s email practices and dealings as secretary of state is losing patience with what he says is the State Department\u2019s lack of cooperation.\nSen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said Thursday he will hold up the nomination of 20 candidates for foreign service officer posts, ramping up pressure on the State Department to turn over records that could prove embarrassing to Mrs. Clinton in her presidential bid.\nEarlier this week, Mr. Grassley said he would hold up a nomination of an assistant secretary of state, in reprisal for the way he said State Department officials have handled his request for records.\nMr. Grassley said in a statement that \u201cthe department must recognize that it has an obligation to respond to congressional inquiries in a timely and reasonable manner.\u201d\nA State Department official said Thursday that department officials have fielded multiple requests from Mr. Grassley and are attempting to comply.\nAsked about Mr. Grassley\u2019s moves to block various nominations, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Thursday: \u201c[W]e\u2019ve received nearly a dozen letters and requests from Senator Grassley in recent months, and just in \u2013 as recently as July 1st we responded to him and then told him that a response that includes a document production was in process, and this response also included substantial responses to his queries on \u2013 specific queries on records retention at the State Department.\n\u201cThese \u2013 as we\u2019ve discussed at length here, these kind of document productions take time, and the department will be providing information to Senator Grassley in response to the requests in the very near future.\u201d\nIn some cases, Mr. Grassley said, department officials have failed to return calls from his office inquiring about the status of various requests.\nMr. Grassley\u2019s inquiries touch on some of the most sensitive issues that Mrs. Clinton has faced in her nearly four-month-old presidential campaign: Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email system and senior aide Huma Abedin\u2018s special employment status that allowed her to work for the State Department and also earn outside income from two other employers.\n______________________________________________________\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.
