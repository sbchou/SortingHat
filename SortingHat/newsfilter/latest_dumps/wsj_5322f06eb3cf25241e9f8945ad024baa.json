{"body": "Each of the Republican presidential candidates is preparing a strategy for the Aug. 6 primary debate that is not just about how to comport themselves but also about how to manage or challenge\u00a0Donald Trump.\nMost of the 17 candidates are senators, former governors, and otherwise proven leaders. Most have voting records to showcase their principles.\nMr. Trump has said he is going to play nice\u2014what the person atop the polls usually does to protect his status. The conventional strategy would be to go after the front-runner and work to score points against him while showcasing conservative principles, policy knowledge, and zeal for the job.\nInstead of focusing on whether Mr. Trump adopts a presidential manner\u2014or hoping that he makes some gaffe in front of viewers\u2014smart candidates will keep this in mind: Republican primary voters watching debates this early in the election cycle are pretty serious customers. They are looking to support candidates who are the most conservative in their positions who could win a general election. And however many other viewers may tune in Thursday, the goal is still to build support with the GOP base.\nMr. Trump\u2019s inflammatory comments about Hispanic immigrants and Sen.\u00a0John McCain\u2019s service record have not diminished voters\u2019 fascination with him. Increasingly, questions are being asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s financial contributions to Democratic candidates such as\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u2014who had a prime seat at Mr. Trump\u2019s 2005 wedding\u2014and remarks such as his 2004 statement that \u201cIn many cases, I probably identify more as Democrat.\u00a0 It just seems that the economy does better under the Democrats than the Republicans.\u201d\nThere is no telling how deep Mr. Trump\u2019s allegiance to the GOP runs or whether he would remain a Republican throughout his term if elected. But two things are clear: In politics, if you have to start explaining, you are losing. And the GOP voters who will cast ballots in primaries and caucuses next year are looking for someone who is reliably conservative.\nRon Bonjean is a partner at Rokk Solutions, a Washington-based public relations firm.
