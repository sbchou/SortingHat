The Office of Management and Budget received the final version of the Obama administration\u2019s teacher prep regulation last month, and many groups expected that it would publish by Nov. 1. (The department said [http://politico.pro/1hpnr2h] last year that a final rule would be out by September 2015.) But Education Under Secretary Ted Mitchell told higher education groups in a meeting Tuesday that it wouldn\u2019t be ready by Nov. 1. He said the department is considering the cost and methodology of the rule, according to a source who attended the meeting, and continues to look at public comments.\nStory Continued Below\n\u2014 The final reg is long overdue: After a couple years of delay, the Obama administration revived [http://politico.pro/1JQIDov] the effort in April 2014. The proposed rule, released [http://politico.pro/1L4IwuU] last November, would punish low-performing programs by cutting off access to federal TEACH grants that students can use to pay for school. It would also compel states to collect more data and evaluate their programs by several key metrics, including how many graduates get jobs and whether teachers are boosting student learning. The department has said the rule would cost states and providers $42 million over 10 years. A department official said last year that \u201cwe believe that the actual costs will be lower due to technology and other efficiencies.\u201d But a number of groups opposing the rule say the department\u2019s estimation is wildly inaccurate. The California Commission on Teacher Credentialing said it could cost the state $485 million for just one year, for example. \n\u2014 The timeline for the proposed regulation extends to 2021, when the changes in TEACH grant eligibility would fully take effect. This school year, states would have to start talking to teachers, school leaders and others to come up with a system for evaluating their teacher preparation programs. States would have to develop those plans by next school year. More on that timeline: http://politico.pro/1hpnr2h. \nGOOD WEDNESDAY MORNING, OCT. 7.

The foundation says this is the first such speech by Gates in nearly eight years. He is expected to address the crowd at 12:20 p.m. ET, followed by a question-and-answer session moderated by Gwen Ifill at 12:40 p.m. ET. The forum will be livestreamed starting at 11:30 a.m. ET. Watch: http://bit.ly/1Z82Ql1.\nTODAY ON THE HILL: The House Ways and Means Oversight subcommittee looks at whether universities are doing enough to justify the tax-free treatment they receive for their endowments. Expect a lot of questions about the size of their holdings (Ninety schools have endowments worth more than $1 billion.) as well as how much aid they\u2019re doling out to students. (Unlike private foundations, colleges are not required to spend a minimum share of their assets.) Interestingly, though, no one from the Ivy League is slated to appear, though it has come in for especially sharp criticism over building enormous endowments (Harvard\u2019s totals more than $36 billion). Instead they\u2019ll hear from MaryFrances McCourt, chief financial officer at Indiana University, as well as David Lucca, a research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Richard Vedder, head of Ohio University\u2019s Center for College Affordability; Brian Galle, a Georgetown University law professor, and Terry Hartle of the American Council on Education. \n\u2014 The House Education and the Workforce Committee, meanwhile, discusses Head Start, starting at 10 a.m. ET. Watch live: http://1.usa.gov/1jNcg5a.\n\u2014 House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) will attend a rally outside the Capitol today with the advocacy group NDD United. Lawmakers and advocates will call for a budget agreement that lifts the current caps on discretionary spending. Two speakers, American Association of State Colleges and Universities President Muriel Howard and Anne Arundel Workforce Development Corporation President and CEO Kirkland Murray, will discuss the effects of the sequester on workforce and education programs. The rally starts at 1:30 p.m. ET on the East Front Lawn. \n\u2018EVERY STUDENT, EVERY DAY\u2019: The White House, Education Department and other federal agencies today launched a new plan to cut chronic student absenteeism by 10 percent a year, starting with the current school year. The initiative targets the 5 million to 7.5 million students who miss at least 10 percent of school days a year \u2014 which translates to 18 days or more. Chronic absenteeism is a gateway to falling behind on lessons and dropping out of school. The new \u201cEvery Student, Every Day\u201d call to action includes a summit in the spring, a new toolkit and new stats from the 2013-14 Civil Rights Data Collection. More details on the plan: http://1.usa.gov/1QXSDSf. And there will be a virtual summit next month: http://bit.ly/1PhsXSn. \nOHIO TO PASS CHARTER BILL: After months of work and years of debate, the Ohio House and Senate are expected to approve a comprehensive charter school reform bill today that would lay out new performance, reporting and accountability requirements for the state\u2019s troubled charter sector. A bipartisan state panel unanimously approved the compromise legislation Tuesday. The bill would make it easier for high-performing charter schools to expand while preventing underperforming charter school operators from shopping around for other sponsors. The bill comes amid intense criticism and concern about waste, fraud and abuse steeped in the state\u2019s charter sector. Earlier this year, the state\u2019s top charter official resigned after mishandling authorizer evaluations. Democratic Rep. Teresa Fedor, an advocate for traditional public schools, said the bill addresses a number of concerns. \u201cI believe that this bill is moving in the right direction to begin to prevent the waste, fraud and abuse that we\u2019ve seen in the past and for us to assure quality education for all of our children,\u201d she said. The Associated Press has more: http://bit.ly/1QXVpHg. \n\u2014 Ohio education officials want to increase the number of charter schools in the state by a third over the next five years after receiving a grant through the federal Charter Schools Program, The Columbus Dispatch reports: http://bit.ly/1VCJDZr. \n\u2014 NYC charter school rally: The advocacy group Families for Excellent Schools says it expects 15,000 parents, students and educators to attend a charter schools rally in New York City today.

Details: http://bit.ly/1VCzRGS.\nLACKING LIBERAL ARTS: The majority of college students graduate without studying fundamental subjects like economics, literature and government, the American Council of Trustees and Alumni says. The 2015-16 installment of the group\u2019s What Will They Learn? report finds many colleges aren\u2019t providing \u201creal value for the vast amounts families must pay.\u201d Of the more than 1,100 institutions included, only 2 percent require students take six of seven liberal arts subjects the group calls essential: literature, composition, economics, math, foreign language, science and American government or history. While 82 percent of colleges require composition credits, only 3 percent mandate economics. Although 87 percent make science classes compulsory, just 13 percent do the same for foreign language; 18 percent for U.S. history or government. And slightly more than one in three requires literature.
