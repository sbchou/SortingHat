But as the trade deal nears completion the UAW confronts a difficult choice.\nStory Continued Below\nIf it backs the deal, it will face a livid rank and file that's deeply skeptical of U.S. trade policy. But if it rejects it, that will rock the boat with an administration it's enjoyed close ties to. National political director Mary Beth Cahill worked as a consultant to Priorities USA Action, a Super PAC created to support Obama's re-election in 2012. Also, it was under President Barack Obama that the auto industry received an $80 billion bailout begun under President George W. Bush. \nThe UAW has some substantive reasons to favor TPP, including its lengthy extension of protective tariffs. But the union is unhappy that the current deal doesn't address currency manipulation and weak labor rights in Mexico. After the agreement was largely finalized earlier this month, UAW President Dennis Williams issued a public statement warning that auto suppliers \"might be faced with a flood of subsidized imports\" and urged Froman to go back to the bargaining table. But for now, the UAW is staying neutral. More from Brian Mahoney here: http://politico.pro/1PwFl0I\nGOOD MORNING!

Central States, one of the largest multiemployer pension plans in the country, filed the proposal September 25. The cuts come nearly one year after Congress enacted legislation that allows trustees for financially troubled multiemployer pension plans to cut benefits if they receive Treasury\u2019s approval and if plan participants approve the cuts. Treasury can override a \u201cno\u201d vote, though, if a plan\u2019s insolvency would cost the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation more than $1 billion--which the Central States plan is projected to do. \nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle are still skeptical about the 2014 law. Last week, Sen. Rob Portman introduced bill that would prevent the Treasury Department from overriding a \u201cno\u201d vote. In June, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH) introduced legislation that would stop the cuts altogether and bail out insolvent multiemployer plans by closing two tax loopholes.\nWHY DON\u2019T WORKPLACE DISASTERS PUT CEOS IN JAIL?: Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship is one of the few corporate executives to face possible jail time for the workplace deaths of his employees. But the specific charges against Blankenship -- arising from the deaths of 29 miners in 2010 -- don\u2019t derive from mine safety statutes. Instead, International Business Times\u2019 Cole Stangler writes, Blankenship has been charged \u201cunder general conspiracy statutes -- in effect, for defrauding the United States government. He faces two such felony counts: conspiracy to violate mining safety rules and conspiracy to block inspectors from carrying out their duties at the Upper Big Branch mine before the explosion. The other felony is for misleading financial regulators about his company\u2019s safety record after the explosion.\u201d\nWhy isn\u2019t Blankenship being prosecuted for mine safety violations? Because those laws are fairly weak. \u201cWorkplace safety laws prescribe criminal charges under a narrow set of circumstances: Employers must willfully violate safety standards, give advanced notice of inspections, or make false statements. Then, the enforcement agencies -- in most cases, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which covers most private sector workers, and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) which covers mining workers -- have to recommend criminal prosecution to the Justice Department. The maximum penalty for these sorts of violations is a misdemeanor.\u201d\nOSHA Director David Michaels recently asked Congress to add criminal penalties to the OSH statute. \u201cSimply put, OSHA penalties must be increased to provide a real disincentive for employers accepting injuries and worker deaths as a cost of doing business,\u201d Michaels said. But given the GOP Congress we\u2019re not likely to see tougher laws any time soon. http://bit.ly/1jECHK7\nNLRB UPDATE \nBOARD MARVELS AT MCDONALD\u2019S \u2018CHUTZPAH\u2019: The NLRB continued its long-standing discovery spat with McDonald\u2019s in filings to Administrative Law Judge Lauren Esposito, who\u2019s overseeing the agency\u2019s joint employer case against the franchise. NLRB attorney Jamie Rucker asked Esposito to deny McDonald\u2019s\u2019 request that the trial in the case commence on Jan. 11. (Rucker doesn\u2019t yet oppose that date but wants to reserve his right to ask for a continuance). \nAs we noted earlier this week, the trial\u2019s been held up as the NLRB seeks a federal court enforcement order requiring Mcdonald\u2019s to comply with its voluminous discovery requests. McDonald\u2019s said in earlier papers that it\u2019s been stunned by the behavior of board lawyers, who are equally unimpressed with company lawyers. \u201cIn light of its behavior\u2014and despite its claim to be \u2018stunn[ed]\u2019\u2014it should be plain to McDonald\u2019s why the General Counsel claims it is responsible for the fact that hearing has not resumed in this matter,\u201d Rucker\u2019s said. \u201cThe inescapable fact is that McDonald\u2019s is responsible.\u201d \n\u201cMcDonald\u2019s\u2019 attempt to attribute the delay in resuming hearing to the time it took for General Counsel to file enforcement papers is a particular brand of chutzpah,\u201d Rucker added. \u201cIn essence, McDonald\u2019s complains that the General Counsel is taking too long to force it to behave.\u201d http://bit.ly/1G87DwS\nAttached to its brief, the NLRB also appended a detailed May 22, 2014 memo from McDonald\u2019s attorneys to the board\u2019s division of advice on the applicability of the then-pending Browning-Ferris joint employer case to the charges at the heart of the McDonald\u2019s case, as well as a general defense of the joint employer allegations.

The Culinary Workers and its largely Latino membership are an incredibly valuable bloc in the early primary state. \u201cWhen you have a group of that size willing to put resources into a campaign, it\u2019s powerful,\u201d David Damore, an associate professor of political science at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, told the Times. \u201cThere is no need for a new mobilization effort of Latino voters here in Nevada,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat they have is consistent and will be there.\u201d http://lat.ms/1LQaUNg\nUNION PROPOSES TARGETED MINIMUM IN SACRAMENTO: UNITE HERE Local 49 filed a ballot measure in Sacramento that would raise the city\u2019s minimum wage to $15 by 2019, but it would apply only to city lands.

Company pilots have already voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike, but the union must first exhaust its administrative remedies. Toward that end, Teamsters officials asked the National Mediation Board to release the union from ongoing negotiations with the airline. \nThe NMB could decide to send the case to a third-party arbitrator. If that process fell through, the Teamsters could then strike after a 30-day cooling period. More from the A.P.: http://abcn.ws/1MFjJOX\nCAN UBER DRIVERS STRIKE? Some Uber drivers are pushing for a strike this weekend. According to a Facebook events page, strike organizers are calling on Uber to raise rates by 60 percent nationwide, add tip options, raise the cancellation fee to $7, and raise the minimum fare to $7. The strike will test whether or not Uber drivers can successfully organize meaningful collective action, even though the company insists they are not employees. \nCOFFEE BREAK \n\u2014\"Companies to Workers: Start Saving More\u2014Or We\u2019ll Do It for You,\" from The Wall Street Journal: http://on.wsj.com/1RLpYAW\n\u2014 \"Graduate students nationwide press for right to form union,\" from Al-Jazeera: http://bit.ly/1jFsBZk\n\u2014 Fiat-Chrysler will end production of the Viper under new UAW contract, from Automotive News: http://bit.ly/1X7K6jE\n\u2014 Unions battle for immigrant workforce in South Florida, from Fusion: http://fus.in/1MsybW5\n\u2014 \"Walmart Is Raising Wages, And No One Is Happy,\" from BuzzFeed: http://bzfd.it/1GgIm3p\n\u2014 Local lawmakers in Missouri support right-to-work, from Rolla Daily News: http://bit.ly/1GJ31YC\n\u2014 \"Jobless Graduates Who Sued Law Schools Find Little Success in Court,\" from The Wall Street Journal: http://on.wsj.com/1Pkk3UZ\nTHAT\u2019S ALL FOR MORNING SHIFT. \nBrian Mahoney is a labor and employment reporter for POLITICO Pro.
