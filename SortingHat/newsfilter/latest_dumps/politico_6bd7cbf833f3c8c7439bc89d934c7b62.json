{"body": "POLITICO\nPolitical intelligence on the intersection of Washington and Wall Street\nBy Ben White\n8/5/15 8:00 AM EDT\nGOP DEBATE PREP \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Ben White: \u201cWhen the Republican candidates take the debate stage in Cleveland on Thursday night they will confront an American public deeply anxious about the state of the economy and desperate for a fresh voice to offer a way out. \u2026 So far, that voice has largely belonged to Donald Trump, the brash billionaire whose promises to crush China and create tens of millions of new jobs propelled him to big leads in national polls.\n\u201cThe task facing Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker and the rest of the top tier in the GOP field is to acknowledge the current national malaise and present credible ideas that go beyond Trump\u2019s braggadocio. It will be an especially difficult job, historians and political strategists say, because unlike Trump, none in the top tier have the kind of private sector success story or outsider, maverick credentials that are so tantalizing to disaffected voters right now.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cBush will have to begin convincing voters his plan to double the nation\u2019s economic growth rate is something more than a talking point. Rubio will have to translate his Reaganesque anecdotes about hard-working people keeping more of their paychecks into something more concrete. And Walker will have to prove that he has a vision broader than just busting unions.\nSTATE OF NATIONAL DISMAY \u2014 \u201cThe problem right now for all these candidates is that we have settled into this general state of national dismay. No one is happy and no one really believes that anyone can fix it anymore,\u2019 said Jason Johnson, a political historian and professor at Hiram College. \u2018People gravitate to Trump because he\u2019s made money and built stuff and been very successful. None of the other Republican candidates can really say that and will have a hard time convincing anyone they have the answers.\u2019\n\u201cThe stakes on Thursday are perhaps highest for Bush, whose candidacy is based on a bold promise to double the current economic growth rate to 4 percent. Bush has seen his support fade as Trump\u2019s has risen. Thursday\u2019s debate offers the former Florida governor his first big chance to slow Trump\u2019s rise and convince GOP primary voters that he offers something new despite his dynastic last name and massive establishment financial support.\u201d http://politi.co/1M4kTlY\nWHY THE TOP LINE ECON NUMBERS DON\u2019T MATTER \u2014 Per a senior Democratic congressional aide: \u201cI think one thing people tend to fail to appreciate is the extent to which the indicators Washington obsesses over have become more and more remote from most peoples' actual lives. Productivity and GDP meant more when people actually shared in it. And same for employment rates \u2014 it meant more when more people were on the labor force.\u00a0\n\u201cNow you see a small fraction of zip codes whose further wealth accumulation depends on this stuff \u2014 but distressed communities everywhere else are falling further and further behind and live with rising economic fragility and uncertainty regardless of what talking heads are saying on cable news about the go-to economic indicators. It just isn't resonant with the larger patterns they are living with. So I think there's something going on more than just the animal spirits point (though I don't disagree with that).\u201d\nDEBATE FIELD SET \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Steve Shepard: \u201cChris Christie and John Kasich are in. Rick Perry is out. And Donald Trump will be center stage. The jockeying to win a ticket to the first Republican presidential debate in Cleveland ended Tuesday afternoon, when Fox News announced the roster of 10 candidates who will be on the stage Thursday evening. \u2026 The candidates, drawn from an average of the five most recent national polls, ranked from first to tenth: Trump, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Christie and Kasich.\n\u201cPerry, the former three-term governor of Texas whose performance in the debates four years ago helped doom his campaign, finished in 11th place, eight-tenths of a point behind Kasich. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore and former New York Gov. George Pataki are farther behind. The top 10 candidates will debate in a two-hour event at 9 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday night. The also-rans will be invited to appear at a separate, one-hour debate, which airs at 5 p.m. Eastern.\u201d http://politi.co/1SKV3Jm\nHOW JEB SPENT HIS WALL STREET YEARS \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Justin Baer: \u201cTen weeks before the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., a financial disaster that ushered in the global economic crisis in September 2008,\u00a0Jeb Bush\u00a0was in Mexico City to seek help from billionaire\u00a0Carlos Slim. \u2026 . Mr. Bush signed on with Lehman after leaving the Florida governor\u2019s mansion, making it clear he wanted work as a hands-on investment banker rather than hold a ceremonial role typically given ex-politicians. Now was his chance. \u2026 More doors closed that summer before Lehman shut its own, but Mr. Bush, following in the footsteps of a grandfather and great-grandfather, latched onto investment banking through the worst downturn since the Great Depression.\n\u201cFor more than seven years, nearly the length of his two gubernatorial terms \u2026 spent as much as half of his working hours advising Lehman and later\u00a0Barclays,\u00a0which bought the collapsed investment bank\u2019s U.S. business. He wasn\u2019t an employee of the firms \u2026 but was paid to attend meetings, dinners and conferences where he spoke to clients and bank executives on such subjects as health care, education, immigration and energy \u2014 matters he has started taking up this year with voters. Mr. Bush earned\u00a0about $1.3 million a year at Lehman and some $2 million from Barclays\n\u201cMr. Bush received a warm welcome on Wall Street, where financial firms often seek former political figures to help open doors. At least six firms offered Mr. Bush a position when he finished his second term as governor in January 2007, according to people familiar with the matter. \u2026 Mr. Bush would spend most of his time at Lehman working under\u00a0Steve Lessing,\u00a0who had been a \u201cRanger\u201d for George W. Bush, a title for supporters who raised at least $200,000 for Mr. Bush\u2019s 2004 presidential campaign. Mr. Lessing headed client-relationship management and was the face of the firm to many money managers, hedge funds and insurance companies. Mr. Bush soon drew the attention of Lehman\u2019s senior investment bankers, who looked for ways to put him in front of clients. He appeared at conferences for health-care clients and corporate directors, and joined a ski junket for bankers \u2026 He crisscrossed the country and flew commercial, often alone. \u2026 More than a dozen of Mr. Bush\u2019s former colleagues and clients described him as focused, blunt and often opinionated. Unlike most former politicians in finance, Mr. Bush was seen as a \u201ccommercial,\u201d almost a term of endearment on Wall Street\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1MaxRjy\nGOOD WEDNESDAY MORNING \u2014 M.M. had some smart reader feedback suggesting that we are too obsessed with 2016 too far out from any actual voting and not focused enough on other financial services industry news. Very fair point and well taken. Today somewhat aside (because there\u2019s the debate and everything!) we will try and curb our enthusiasm a bit. As always, constructive critiques very welcome (just be nice!). We are here to serve you and happy to hear when we miss he mark. OK, not happy but appreciative.\nTHIS MORNING ON POLITICO\u00a0PRO\u00a0FINANCIAL SERVICES\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u00a0Patrick Temple-West on the SEC's plans to approve the controversial Dodd-Frank CEO pay-ratio rule today [http://politico.pro/1JLv0fn].\u00a0For\u00a0Pro's subscriber-only coverage -- and to get Morning Money every day before\u00a06 a.m.-- please contact\u00a0Pro\u00a0Services at\u00a0(703) 341-4600 or\u00a0info@politicopro.com.\nSMART POINT ON FINANCIAL CRIME \u2014 From a Democratic policy strategist: \u201cAlthough your blurb on the story never said where the Libor Machiavelli was sentenced to prison, the fact that it was a criminal conviction and jail time for a misbehaving banker made it clear that it wasn't the U.S. That is just another reason why there is so little passion from the masses (as opposed to elites) for Hillary or Jeb. Most people believe that our policy bias towards an entrenched financial elite would continue unabated either way \u2014 and the fundraising totals strongly suggest the people may be right.\u201d\nSPEAKING OF WHITE COLLAR CRIME \u2014 IBT: \u201cNew federal data shows that under Obama, prosecution of white collar crime has now hit a 20-year low. This development has occurred as the administration has significantly increased its use of so-called \u201cdeferred prosecution\u201d agreements allowing corporations and their executives to avoid prosecution.\u201d http://bit.ly/1UmTsqz\nLOCKART: FED HAS A RIGHT TO RISE \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Jon Hilsenrath: \u201cFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart said the economy is ready for the first increase in short-term interest rates in more than nine years and it would take a significant deterioration in the data to convince him not to move in September. \u2018I think there is a high bar right now to not acting, speaking for myself,\u2019 Mr. Lockhart said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. He is among the first officials to speak publicly since the Fed\u2019s policy meeting last week, at which the central bank dropped new hints that a rate increase is\u00a0coming closer into view, a point he sought to underscore.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018It will take a significant deterioration in the economic picture for me to be disinclined to move ahead,\u2019 he said \u2026 His comments follow those of\u00a0James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, who\u00a0said in an interview with the Journal on Friday, \u2018we are in good shape\u2019 for a rate increase in September. \u2026 In weighing when to move, Mr. Lockhart said he was looking at the economy\u2019s cumulative progress over many months, particularly on the job front. \u2018We\u2019re getting positive signals from the employment numbers,\u2019 he said\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1IWC0qE\nPUERTO RICO DEFAULT HITS MARKETS \u2014 NYT\u2019s Mary Williams Walsh: \u201cWhile Puerto Rico\u2019s first bond default in its history reverberated through the financial markets on Tuesday, another move by the cash-poor island may provide a clue to where the next trouble spot lies \u2026 After openly acknowledging on Monday afternoon that it had not made a $58 million bond payment, the government quietly disclosed in a financial filing later that afternoon that it had temporarily stopped making contributions of $92 million a month into a fund that is used to make payments on an additional $13 billion in bond debt. A small payment from the fund is due on Sept. 1.\n\u201c[A] much bigger payment on the general obligation bonds, about $370 million, comes due on Jan. 1. If Puerto Rico misses that one, \u2018it would be an earthquake for the markets,\u2019 said Matt Fabian, a partner at Municipal Market Analytics, a financial research firm\u2019 \u2018Defaulting on the Public Finance Corporation bonds was a change in direction,\u2019 he said, referring to the government unit whose bonds have been in default since Monday. \u2018Defaulting on the general obligation bonds would change the game entirely.\u2019\u201d http://nyti.ms/1Ij7zaR\nGREECE/LEDNERS STRIKE UPBEAT TONE \u2014 Reuters/Athens: \u201cBoth\u00a0Greece\u00a0and its lenders said on Tuesday they were optimistic they could broker a deal within days on a multi-billion euro bailout, striking a surprisingly upbeat tone on a process previously fraught with bitterness. \u2026 A bailout worth up to 86 billion euros ($94.5 billion) must be settled by Aug. 20 \u2014 or a second bridge loan agreed \u2014 if\u00a0Greece\u00a0is to pay off debt of 3.5 billion euros to the European Central Bank that matures on that day. Wrapping up a day of talks in Athens, Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said negotiations were going better than expected. In Brussels, a Commission official said they were 'encouraged' by progress. \u2026\n\u201cIt will be the indebted nation's third bailout since 2010, designed to stave off bankruptcy and keep the country from toppling out of the\u00a0euro zone. Negotiations have been tortuous in the past, bogged down in minutiae of reforms ranging from pensions to shop opening hours. Over much of this year they were also peppered with angry outbursts about responsibility, sovereignty and even blackmail. However, sources on the creditors' side briefed on negotiations described the Greeks as being \u2018very, very cooperative\u2019 in talks which resumed in the last week of July after weeks of deadlock over bailout terms.\u201d http://reut.rs/1P5N2sH\nREGS SET TO APPROVE PAY GAP DISCLOSURE RULE \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Victoria McGrane and Joann S. Lublin: \u2018Regulators are set to approve a contentious new rule requiring companies to disclose the pay gap between rank-and-file employees and the chief executive, marking the culmination of years of debate and pressure on the Securities and Exchange Commission over a mandate from the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. \u2026 The SEC is slated to vote on a final version of the rule at a meeting Wednesday. The measure is expected to leave corporations and their trade groups disappointed by allowing companies to exclude only 5 percent of their\u00a0overseas workers from the pay-ratio calculation \u2026\n\u201cCompanies had argued the SEC should allow them to exclude a much larger percentage of foreign workers, an approach that would have likely narrowed the reported pay gap at some multinational firms. \u2026 Some companies already reveal such pay-ratio information. In March,\u00a0Noble Energy\u00a0Inc.disclosed that former CEO\u00a0Charles Davidson\u00a0made\u00a082 times more than the median employee, who took home $103,500 in direct compensation in 2014. Mr. Davidson made $8.5 million in direct compensation, Noble said \u2026 The rule would require companies to disclose median worker pay \u2026 and compare it with CEO compensation.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1W0tElL\nJPM LEADS OFR RANKINGS OF SYSTEMIC IMPORTANCE \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Zachary Warmbrodt\u00a0and\u00a0Jon Prior: \u201cJPMorgan Chase is the world's most systemically important bank and its U.S. competitors are close behind in an Office of Financial Research ranking that highlights potential risks from big bank failures and raises questions about their capital levels. \u2026 In\u00a0the report, a pair of OFR researchers compared the systemic importance of 30 U.S. and international banks using 2013 data.\r\n\u201cThey found that U.S.-based firms make up half the list of the top 10 most systemically important banks in the world. JPMorgan is No. 1, followed in order by HSBC, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas, Barclays, Bank of America, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, comes in at 19th. The metrics that OFR's researchers used for the rankings are familiar to policymakers in the banking world: size, interconnectedness, substitutability, complexity and cross-border activity. They said one weakness in the methodology is exchange rate fluctuations.\u201d\nNEW REGS NEEDED IN ONLINE SMALL BUSINESS LENDING? \u2014 Brayden McCarthy in an American Banker op-ed: \u201cRegulators have thus far permitted online small-business lending to flourish with minimal oversight. But several recent developments suggest that may be changing. \u2026 Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel\u00a0launched\u00a0a city-wide campaign in January cautioning borrowers about \u2018predatory online lending,\u2019 and the state of Illinois is working\u00a0on a bill to rein in unsavory practices. Meanwhile, federal regulators have largely taken a wait-and-see approach.\n\u201cBut the Treasury's July\u00a0request\u00a0for public input on marketplace lenders suggests that policymakers are keeping a close eye on the industry. \u2026 Many in the online lending industry are worried about the possibility that increased scrutiny could lead to regulations that stymie innovation. However, regulation doesn't have to put a chill on genuine innovation\u201d http://bit.ly/1IjYpe4\nFIRST LOOK: NEW SIFMA SITE \u2014 Per release going out later this a.m.: \u201cSIFMA has launched a microsite\u00a0www.keepretirementopen.com\u00a0as part of a larger industry-wide effort to highlight the unintended consequences of the Department of Labor\u2019s retirement regulation, and encourage savers to contact Congress with their concerns\u201d\nLIVING WILL GUIDE \u2014 The Richmond Fed posted a new research paper, \u201cLiving Wills for Systemically Important Financial Institutions: Some Expected Benefits and Challenges\u201d http://bit.ly/1IjYJtt\nFIRST LOOK: NEW BANK PRESSURE GROUP LAUNCHING \u2014 Per release going out today:\u00a0\u201cAllied Progress, a new organization that deploys hard-hitting research and creative issue campaigns, launched today in an effort to hold accountable the powerful interests that all too often seek to silence or take advantage of hardworking American families. \u2026 The new endeavor will run aggressive issue campaigns that target a range of powerful interests including payday lenders, major financial institutions, leaders of industry, for-profit colleges, voter suppression advocates, and more.\n\u201cIn the coming weeks, Allied Progress will launch initial initiatives targeting payday lenders influence over Congress, increasing awareness of the lending industry\u2019s business model and practices, and exposing the large financial institutions underwriting these and other predatory lending practices.\u201d http://bit.ly/1P5MgMk\nYOU'RE INVITED, PLAYBOOK BREAKFAST: On Thursday, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert McDonald and David Brock, founder of Correct the Record, American Bridge 21st Century, and Media Matters for America, join Mike Allen at the Newseum for a Playbook Breakfast.
