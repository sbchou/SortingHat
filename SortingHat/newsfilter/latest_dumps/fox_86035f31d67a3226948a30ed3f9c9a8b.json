The organization allowed a reporter to sit in on a focus group as different anti-Hillary lines of attack were tested.\nBut the headline sounded like the Times was offended: \u201cThe Best Way to Vilify Hillary Clinton? GOP Spends Heavily to Test It.\u201d\nVilify?\nAs in, use bad-guy methods to blacken her reputation?\nThe dictionary definition says it means to \u201cdefame,\u201d to \u201cslander,\u201d which kinda sorta implies that it\u2019s unfair.\n\nDo the mainstream media talk about Democrats vilifying Republicans? Or just attacking them, going negative against them, or holding them accountable?\n\u201cThe effort to vilify Mrs. Clinton,\u201d the paper intones, \u201ccould ultimately cost several hundred million dollars, given the variety and volume of political organizations involved.\u201d\nThis is, well, standard operating procedure. Both sides spend a fortune conducting polls and focus groups and honing messages that will be most effective in tearing down the opposition candidate. Hillary\u2019s campaign will do it, and so will the liberal PACs that are supporting her.\nWhat\u2019s more, the Times knows full well that the liberals do the same thing: \u201cRepublicans are acutely aware that early attacks labeling Mitt Romney as elitist were impossible for him to shake in 2012, and they view these next several months as critical in laying the groundwork to taint, and ultimately defeat, Mrs. Clinton.\u201d\nAnd who did those early attacks on Mitt come from? President Obama\u2019s campaign and the Democratic establishment. You might even say they were vilifying him. (The piece later acknowledges that the pro-Obama Priorities USA laid the groundwork for those attacks.)\nSo let\u2019s fire up the Google machine and see how the Times handled it when Priorities USA went after Mitt. Here\u2019s a piece that said the group was \u201chighlighting a study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and suggesting that Mitt Romney\u2019s plans would raise taxes on the middle class while cutting them for the wealthy.\u201d  Here\u2019s another one on how the Priorities commercials \u2014\u201cincluding the \u2018coffin ad,\u2019 featuring workers laid off from a plant acquired by Bain Capital, Mr. Romney\u2019s former firm \u2014 helped define Mr. Romney early in the campaign.\u201d  See? Romney wasn\u2019t vilified by a liberal PAC, he was \u201cdefined.\u201d  The Times says American Crossroads found, for example, that Hillary\u2019s comment about she and her husband having been \u201cdead broke\u201d when they left the White House did not play well in the focus group. But most pundits could have told you it was damaging the moment she said it during last year\u2019s book tour.\nThe story did spotlight an interesting note: \u201cOne problem in developing negative messages about Mrs. Clinton, Republican strategists have found, is that she and her husband have survived so many controversies by dismissing them as partisan attacks. So the Republican organizations are seeking to develop lines of attack that resonate more deeply or raise unsettling questions about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s character.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Time magazine has a glowing cover story on Elizabeth Warren, touting her liberal agenda and the way she\u2019s moving the Democratic Party to the left. There is nary a critical sentence about the Massachusetts senator.  Why put her on the cover when she\u2019s not running for president and hasn\u2019t done anything particularly new? Why not Bernie Sanders, who is running for president and has embraced essentially the same populist, break-up-the-banks agenda?  Probably because Elizabeth as the cover girl sells more copies.  Time recently included Warren on its 100 Most Influential People list. And who wrote the accompanying piece on how she \u201cnever lets us forget that the work of taming Wall Street\u2019s irresponsible risk taking and reforming our financial system is far from finished\u201d?  Hillary Clinton.\nClick for more Media Buzz\nmedia-buzz\n\nMedia Buzz, hosted by Howard Kurtz, airs on Sundays at 11AM and 5PM ET on Fox News Channel.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this show\n\n\n\n", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "MEDIA BUZZ: 'Vilifying' Hillary?
