But among those born between roughly 1985 and 1997, 54 percent back the democratic socialist senator from Vermont. Just 26 percent supported Clinton, down from 34 percent in September and 36 percent in August.\nStory Continued Below\nVice President Joe Biden went down to 10 percent from 15 percent last month, while other candidates earned 1 percent or less.\nClinton, however, commands strong leads among all other age groups, including Gen Xers and Baby Boomers.\nA majority of 56 percent also said Clinton performed best during Tuesday's debate, with 33 percent responding that Sanders won the night.\nBiden, who has not announced a bid, earned 10 percent in the overall vote among Democrats but just 3 percent among millennials aged 18 to 29. (Millennials born in the early 1980s are, of course, now part of the 30-to-44 age cohort.)\nThe poll was conducted by SurveyMonkey from Oct. 13-15, surveying 1,857 registered Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Millennials warming to Sanders, cooling to Clinton", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/poll-millennials-bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-214874", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "immigration"], "people": ["Katy O'Donnell", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Kenneth P.
