Republicans and outside groups have openly wondered if the post presented a conflict of interest for the woman who is now vice chair of Hillary for America, or if her other jobs influenced what happened at State.\nHer lawyers have maintained that she did nothing wrong, noting that government workers have moved to SGE status before.\n\n\n\n            By \nTim Starks\n\nPOLITICOreportedWednesday that the president of the outside company where Abedin would end up working later that year, Doug Band of Teneo, had contacted her that spring in April 2012, asking her for help getting a client appointed to a post on the President\u2019s Global Development Council.\nIn the email, he made sure Abedin knew the woman, Judith Rodin, president of The Rockefeller Foundation, was also a big supporter of the Clinton Foundation \u2014 another place Abedin would collect a paycheck after her SGE status was approved.\nClinton, in an interview with MSNBC on Sept. 4, said she \"was not directly involved\" with Abedin's job arrangement.\n\"Do you think [Donald Trump] had a point in raising the question of whether it was appropriate for her to be taking a State Department salary and also be paid by an outside company closely associated with your husband, by you?\" asked reporter Andrea Mitchell.\n\"Well, I was not directly involved in that, but everything that she did was approved under the rules as they existed by the State Department,\" Clinton said.\nThe document states the following: \u201cI certify that this is an accurate statement of the major duties and responsibilities of this person\u2026 and the position is necessary to carry out government functions for which I am responsible,\u201d the form reads in a box labelled \"supervisory certification.\"\n\u201cHillary Rodham Clinton, Secretary of State,\u201d reads the name in that box.\nThe signature, however, has been blanked out by the State Department.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Hillary approved special status for aide Huma Abedin", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/clinton-abedin-state-job-approved-214038", "topics": ["economy", "terrorism", "campaign_finance", "trade"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Rachael Bade", "Matthew Karnitschnig", "Henry C.
