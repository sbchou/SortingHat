We\u2019re now begging Elizabeth Warren to run for president.\n\nAre journalists so determined to slow down the Hillary coronation that they will badger and beseech the freshman senator until she runs just to stop the media torture?ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT\n\nFolks, this is getting embarrassing.\n\nHow many times does Warren have to say she is not pursuing the presidency before we take her at her word? How many different ways does she have to word her denials?\n\nSure, a woman-on-woman contest for the Democratic nomination would be fascinating to cover in a country that has had 44 male presidents. But read my lips: Not. Going. To. Happen.\n\nWhen Warren makes Shermanesque disavowals in dozens of interviews, why does each journalist think that this time there will be a different result?\n\nThis has to transcend the desire for a horse race. Some pundits\u2019 hearts simply beat faster when the Massachusetts Democrat talks about taking on Wall Street and battling special interests. The prospect of her launching a liberal crusade in 2016 excites them in ways that Hillary\u2019s cautious, establishment-oriented approach does not \u2014 even more so in the wake of the email furor.\n\nTake the Boston Globe, whose editorial page has openly urged its home-state gal to take the plunge: \u00a0\n\n\u201cDemocrats would\u00a0be making a\u00a0big mistake\u00a0if they let Hillary Clinton coast to the presidential nomination without real opposition, and, as a national leader, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren can make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. While Warren has repeatedly vowed that she won\u2019t run for president herself, she ought to reconsider\u2026\n\n\u201cA presidential campaign would test Warren as never before. Her views on foreign policy are not fully formed. And on many other important issues \u2014 climate change, gun control, civil rights \u2014 Warren could struggle to articulate clear differences between herself and Clinton. That\u2019s a risk she should be willing to take.\u201d\n\nIn other words, run, Liz, run!\n\nWhich brings us to the \u201cToday\u201d show. Warren has been making the rounds to promote the paperback edition of her book, and swatting away the inevitable question. Savannah Guthrie would not give up.\n\nShe began: \u201cYou didn\u2019t think you\u2019d get away with this interview without my asking you point-blank: Are you going to run for president?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI\u2019m not running and I\u2019m not going to run.\u201d\n\nThe senator said she had a great job and wants to fight for such issues as student loans, medical research and the minimum wage. But Guthrie was not to be deterred.\n\n\u201cLet me make sure that we underscore this and maybe bold it and put it in all caps\u2026It has seemed you were hedging a little bit in the past. I don\u2019t hear you hedging now. Are you saying unequivocally, I am not running for president in 2016?\u201d\n\nWarren started laughing. \u201cI\u2019m not running. I\u2019m not running,\u201d she said.\n\nGuthrie tried another angle: Warren was the \u201cperfect person\u201d to push these middle-class issues, but her supporters are \u201cafraid Hillary Clinton won\u2019t give voice to these issues that you care about.\u201d\n\nWarren wouldn\u2019t take the bait and didn\u2019t mention Hillary in her answer. So Savannah tried again: Is Hillary \u201cthe right messenger\u201d?\n\n\u201cI think we need to give her a chance to decide if she\u2019s going to run,\u201d said Warren, who obviously knows Hillary is running.\n\nThat must have been it, right? Uh uh.\n\n\u201cPossibly I\u2019m beating a dead horse here,\u201d Guthrie said, admitting the obvious, \u201cbut did you ever even entertain, consider the possibility, of running for president?\u201d\n\nThe answer: no.\n\nGuthrie was doing her job, trying to prod Warren into uttering a newsworthy sound bite rather than just repeating her talking points and plugging her book.\n\nAs in romance, Warren is more desirable for being unobtainable. Mitt Romney went through the same thing, with the press badgering him about running a third time, until he said he might, whereupon the same press ripped him for being a bad candidate. And many forget that Warren had a rocky campaign when she won her Senate seat.\n\nElizabeth Warren\u2019s dogged denials on \u201cToday\u201d should end this question once and for all. But journalists, who are in denial, will keep on asking.\n\nClick for more Media Buzz\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmedia-buzz\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMedia Buzz, hosted by Howard Kurtz, airs on Sundays at 11AM and 5PM ET on Fox News Channel.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore on this show\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t", "byline": "", "description": "Has it come to this?
