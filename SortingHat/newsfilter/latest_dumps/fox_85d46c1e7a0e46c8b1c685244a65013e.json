Jeb Bush, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Carson tied with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.\nCarson criticized President Obama\u2019s plan to provide free community college education to Americans. He said existing Pell Grants already help students from low-income families receive a higher education. And he offered advice for those who don\u2019t qualify for assistance.\n\u201cW-o-r-k,\u201d he said, arguing that government is not responsible for providing everything to it citizens, including those in low- and middle-income families.\n\"We don't have to give away everything,\" Carson said. \"That was never the intention. The government is not there to give away everything and to take care of people. It is to facilitate our ability to have life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That's it.\"\nCarson also weighed in on the recent debate about immunization and the measles outbreak that has divided the potential 2016 GOP White House field. He said parents should immunize their children.\nCarson said many parents who don\u2019t immunize are the victims of old misinformation and suggested the public health community hasn\u2019t done a good enough job of getting out the correct information, which is that the obvious upsides outweigh the potential downsides, such as allergic reactions.\nHowever, he argued the issue shouldn\u2019t be partisan.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a Republican or Democratic issue,\u201d Carson told Fox News.\nDays earlier, Paul suggested parents should have their children immunize but also argued that \"the state doesn\u2019t own the children.\u201d", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Dr. Ben Carson says he's eyeing 2016 presidential run -       Kerry opens door to '16 White House bid, but just slightly", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/08/carson-says-getting-personnel-rational-in-place-for-2016-white-house-run-hints/", "topics": ["personality", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Chris Christie", "Jeb Bush", "Scott Walker", "Mike Huckabee", "Ben Carson"], "orgs": ["GOP White House", "Pell Grants", "Anselm New Hampshire", "GOP"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-02-08 23:54:55", "org": "fox", "article_id": "85d46c1e7a0e46c8b1c685244a65013e", "date_access": "2015-02-09 01:07:04.378047"}
