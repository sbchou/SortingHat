Martin O'Malley at a conference hosted by the South Carolina Democratic Party in Myrtle Beach, S.C.\u00a0(AP)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley positioned himself Sunday as a progressive alternative to the old political dynasties represented by fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Jeb Bush in the 2016 presidential race.\n\n\u201cI think that our country always benefits from new leadership and new perspectives,\u201d O\u2019Malley told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cThe presidency of the United States is not some crown to be passed between two families. It is an awesome and sacred trust that is to be earned and exercised on behalf of the American people.\"ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT\n\nNeither Bush, Clinton nor O\u2019Malley have officially declared a 2016 White House bid. But O\u2019Malley said Sunday that he would decide this spring. \u00a0\n\nBush, a former Florida governor whose father and brother each served as president, is among several potential GOP candidates near or at the top of most early polls. And Clinton, whose husband was commander in chief, is the Democratic front-runner with no clear challenger, with the possible exception of O\u2019Malley, for her party\u2019s nomination.\n\n\u201cHistory is full of times where the inevitable front-runner is inevitable until they\u2019re no longer inevitable anymore,\u201d O\u2019Malley said.\n\nO\u2019Malley endorsed Clinton in her failed 2008 White House bid. And the Clintons have long been supportive of O\u2019Malley, who reportedly got Hillary Clinton\u2019s blessing as far back as 2013 to run for the White House.\n\nO\u2019Malley has yet to take on Clinton directly but will almost certainly have to in order to win the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where she stands. Will she present a break with the policies of the past? I don\u2019t know,\u201d O\u2019Malley said Sunday when given the opportunity to challenge Clinton\u2019s platform. \u00a0\n\nHe then cited his accomplishment as a two-term governor in liberal-leaning Maryland, saying he signed a state law that allows illegal immigrants to get a driver\u2019s license and another that allows some illegal immigrants to attend college on reduced, in-state tuition.\n\n\u201cI believe there are new perspectives that are needed in order for us to solve problems we face,\u201d O\u2019Malley said. \u201cNew perspective and leadership are needed.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley has already made visits this year to early-voting states Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nHowever, he faces an uphill challenge should he decide to take on Clinton, whose strong early lead has made fundraising difficult for potential primary challengers.\n\nO\u2019Malley also has not done well in early polling. In a Quinnipiac University poll last month, for example, zero percent of 619 likely Iowa caucus-goers indicated they would support him for president next year.\n\nHe told ABC that the greatest threat to the United States is Iran getting a nuclear weapon and extremist violence.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can separate the two,\u201d O\u2019Malley said, also saying that climate change is the greatest man-made threat to the country.", "byline": "", "description": "Former Maryland Gov.
