Lerner\n7/16/15 6:33 PM EDT\nDonald Trump has jumped back into the ring \u2014 this time for an all-out brawl with fellow Republican presidential contender Rick Perry.\nTrump started the feud with multiple comments in recent weeks bashing Perry\u2019s work securing the border while serving as governor of Texas.\nStory Continued Below\nAfter several measured defenses of his border policies, on Thursday Perry finally fired back with a more aggressive statement, saying, \u201cWhat Mr. Trump is offering is not conservatism, it is Trump-ism \u2014 a toxic mix of demagoguery and nonsense.\u201d\n\u201cDonald Trump continues to demonstrate his fundamental misunderstanding of border security,\u201d said Perry.\nTrump tweeted back: \u201c.@GovernorPerry just gave a pollster quote on me. He doesn\u2019t understand what the word demagoguery means.\u201d\nAlso on POLITICO\nALEX ISENSTADT\n\u201d.@GovernorPerry failed on the border. He should be forced to take an IQ test before being allowed to enter the GOP debate,\u201d Trump added, reiterating a trope about the Texas Republican that surfaced after numerous fumbles during the primary 2012 campaign.\nThe Republican-on-Republican smackdown was Trump\u2019s second of the day.\nOn Thursday morning, the New Yorker published an interview with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who said that Trump had \u201cfired up the crazies\u201d in the Republican party.\nTrump responded by tweeting that McCain \u201cshould be defeated in the primaries.\u201d\n\u201cGraduated last in his class at Annapolis \u2014 dummy!\u201d Trump added.\nBy KEITH KOFFLER\nBy JACK SHAFER\nBy AFSHON OSTOVAR\nBy LAWRENCE J.
