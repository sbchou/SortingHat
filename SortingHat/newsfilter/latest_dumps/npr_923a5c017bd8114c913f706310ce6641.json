For the first time in this campaign, we'll see all the candidates (separated into two events) debate serious issues \u2014 likely answering questions about national security, the economy, foreign policy \u2014 even the Planned Parenthood controversy that's been in the news. The questions will be determined by Fox News. If Americans had their choice, according to a list released by Gallup, they would want to know about the economy, confidence in Congress, race relations and immigration. But the candidates themselves also took a stab at writing some questions for the debate. Six candidates have posted videos on Facebook, which is partnering with Fox News on the debate, posing questions to their rivals. We don't know if these videos will actually air during the debate (Fox News did ask regular people to submit video questions via Facebook, some of which will air). In any case, Mike Huckabee said he wants to ask the candidates about the Supreme Court's same-sex marriage ruling, Rick Perry asked about the economy and Donald Trump wants to know how the candidates are \"going to make America great again\" (his campaign slogan). Watch the questions from the six candidates below: Scott Walker: Which candidate do you admire the most? \n(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3\";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));My Debate Question to GOP CandidatesThe first GOP debate is tomorrow night in Cleveland, OH.
