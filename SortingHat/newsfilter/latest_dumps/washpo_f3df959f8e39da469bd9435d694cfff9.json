Trey Gowdy released the subpoena he sent her in March. Gowdy,\u00a0 chairman of the House Select Committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks, claimed Clinton left him \u201cno choice in order to correct the inaccuracy.\u201d [House committee subpoenas e-mails from Clinton\u2019s personal account] The subpoena, sent to Clinton\u00a0on March 4, asked for the following documents:     In the CNN interview that aired Tuesday afternoon, Clinton was responding to a question about why she would delete her e-mails from her personal server when facing a subpoena. Clinton can claim that she was not facing a subpoena at the time she cleared her server. The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond. But Gowdy, in a statement accompanying the subpoena release, said regardless of the subpoena,\u00a0 Clinton \u201chad a\u00a0statutory duty to preserve records from her\u00a0entire\u00a0time in office \u2026\u201d and that she had not been forthright about her \u201cunusual e-mail\u00a0arrangement\u201d until it was revealed during his investigation. While Gowdy made this document public, he did not release the deposition transcript of Clinton confidante Sidney Blumenthal. There had been some thought that Gowdy would let the Benghanzi panel vote Wednesday on whether to release it, but he did not. Democrats have pressed Gowdy to\u00a0let the public read Blumenthal\u2019s entire testimony, saying\u00a0it\u2019s only fair to let him explain the e-mails he sent to Clinton in his own words.\u00a0They\u2019ve accused Gowdy and Republicans of selectively leaking information from the hearing and his e-mails as an attempt to embarrass Clinton during her run for president.
