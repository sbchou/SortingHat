We know that liberal women have trouble accepting that there are many, many women who don't agree with them,\" Fiorina declared. \"And in fact, it's liberal women, unfortunately, who believe that unless you follow their orthodoxy -- [MSNBC's] Rachel Maddow is one, but Hillary Clinton is one, as well.\"\nFiorina then recalled that Clinton, campaigning for Iowa senatorial candidate Bruce Braley last year, \"went through her litany of liberal orthodoxy\" on GOP candidate Joni Ernst, when she said of the Iowa Republican that \"it's not enough to be a woman.\"\n\n\n\n            By \nGabriel Debenedetti\n\n\"You have to be committed to expand rights and opportunities for all women,\" Clinton added.\nAccording to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll out Monday, Fiorina led Clinton 52 percent to 38 percent in a hypothetical matchup.\n\"Actually, note to Democrat Party: We're half the nation. And so our views differ, just like men's views differ,\" Fiorina said. \"And yes, I think I am distinctly horrifying to liberals that I am a conservative woman who right now, head-to-head, beats Hillary Clinton soundly.\"\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Fiorina: 'I'm distinctly horrifying to liberals'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/carly-fiorina-i-am-to-horrifying-liberals-214462", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "trade", "personality"], "people": ["Kelly Ayotte", "Burgess Everett", "Paul Dallison", "Kyle Cheney", "James Dudley", "Rachael Bade", "Kevin Robillard", "Henry C.
