Richard Hanna on Thursday for claiming his investigation was aimed at hurting 2016 Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. \n\u201cRunning investigations in a private, fact-centric way is unquestionably the right way to conduct a serious investigation,\u201d Gowdy said in the statement, arguing that Hanna knew nothing of what his panel was working on. \u201cThe pitfall, of course, is that commentators, and sometimes even members of your own Conference, offer thoughts on matters on which they are not familiar.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\nGowdy has been keeping a relatively low profile amid a barrage of criticism lately from the Clinton campaign and a fired committee investigator, among others. The charges of partisanship come just a week before the former secretary of State\u2019s much-anticipated appearance before the committee. \nOn Wednesday night, Hanna, a New York Republican, said during a radio interview that he agreed with Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's controversial remarks suggesting the panel was created to hurt Clinton politically. McCarthy later retracted his comments and apologized, but Hanna said McCarthy was probably telling the truth. \n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\n\"This may not be politically correct, but I think that there was a big part of this investigation that was designed to go after ... an individual: Hillary Clinton,\" he said. \nDemocrats seized on the comments. \n\"House Republicans aren't even shy anymore about admitting that the Benghazi Committee is a partisan farce,\u201d said Brian Fallon in a statement, blasting out Hanna\u2019s comments. \u201cHillary Clinton will still attend next week's hearing, but at this point, Trey Gowdy's inquiry has zero credibility left.\"\nThe panel, which rarely puts out press releases, blasted out Gowdy's response to Hanna.\n\u201cThere are seven members of the Benghazi Committee who are intimately familiar with the work of the committee, the motives behind the work, and the results of that work. Congressman Hanna is not one of them,\u201d Gowdy's statement reads.\nGowdy said he personally called Hanna this morning to discuss the matter.\n\u201cMy team of investigators, drawn from the military, federal agencies and the congressional oversight and ethics committees, has worked hard, and in an above-board manner,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt is unfortunate when claims are made by those who do not know what the committee has done, why it has done it, or the results of its work.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Gowdy slams fellow Republican over Benghazi remark", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/trey-gowdy-benghazi-committee-richard-hanna-214857", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Katy O'Donnell", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Kenneth P.
