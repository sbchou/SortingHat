The name appeared to have been redacted in several other instances, but was included in a subject line of a forwarded email.\nThe redacted email was released at Gowdy's direction \"so the American people could decide for themselves regarding concerns about sources and methods,\" the Benghazi committee said in a statement. The committee replaced the document online with another version in which Kousa's name does not appear.\nAsked about the change, Benghazi committee spokesman Jamal Ware said the State Department had cleared the email for release in the form it initially appeared Sunday.\n\"The State Department failed to redact a name in a subject line, so the committee took steps to remove this information so it was consistent with State Department\u2019s redaction of it in another subject line.\" Ware said. \"The Committee will not confirm the name in question is the alleged source.\u201d\nA State Department spokesman had no immediate comment on the disclosure of Kousa's name or the committee's claim that State had cleared the email for release.\n\nWar Room\n\n            By \n                    Jeff Eggers\n\nThe top Democrat on the Benghazi panel, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, revealed Sunday morning that the CIA had not requested the deletion of the source's name and did not consider the information classified. Cummings said the CIA's stance undercut Gowdy's earlier claim that Clinton had endangered national security by having such information on her private server and by forwarding the message to one of her aides.\nIn Gowdy's response Sunday, he said he was committed to protecting the source's identity, even if the CIA was not.\n\"Sources and methods of intelligence are among the most closely guarded information our government has,\" Gowdy wrote to Cummings. \"We will continue to redact that information and treat it with the highest level of confidentiality and sensitivity, and we would advise you to do the same.\"\nThe CIA normally would treat the names of its alleged sources as confidential. However, Kousa's contacts with U.S. intelligence have been publicly acknowledged for years.\nThe former spy chief defected to Britain less than two weeks after informal Clinton adviser Sidney Blumenthal sent Clinton the March 18, 2011 email. Blumenthal said his information on the CIA's dependence on Kousa came from former CIA officer Tyler Drumheller. Drumheller died in August.\n\nHistory Dept.\n\n            By \n                    Alan Greenblatt\n\nWhile it's unclear how much information Kousa was giving to Western officials at the time the email was sent, the former spy chief's role was being bandied about publicly at that time. A mention of Kousa in former CIA director George Tenet's memoir was referenced in a New York Times story the day before Blumenthal sent the email in question to Clinton.\nCummings said in his letter that State had asked for a redaction from the email on privacy grounds to \"avoid bringing additional undue attention to this person.\" A State spokesman confirmed Monday that a redaction for privacy reasons was requested.\nThe disclosure of Kousa's name in the email the Benghazi panel made public appears to have been first reported Monday by Yahoo News.\nA CIA spokesman declined to comment Sunday. \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The disclosure came as the Benghazi panel chairman said he was committed to protecting the source's identity.", "title": "Gowdy appears to accidentally release CIA source&apos;s name", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/trey-gowdy-release-cia-source-name-benghazi-committee-214919", "topics": ["trade"], "people": ["Lauren Dezenski", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "George Tenet", "Sidney Blumenthal", "Allie Grasgreen Ciaramella", "Rachael Bade", "Grover Norquist", "Doug Palmer", "Hadas Gold", "Carla Marinucci", "Orrin Hatch", "Elijah Cummings", "Tyler Drumheller", "John Boehner", "Natasha Korecki", "Joe Biden", "Pierre Briancon", "Brian Mahoney", "Jeremy Herb", "Theodoric Meyer", "Josh Gerstein", "Brianna Ehley", "Shane Goldmacher", "Nick Gass", "Trey Gowdy", "Brett Norman", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Andrew Glass", "Donald Trump", "John Bresnahan", "Jake Sherman", "Barack Obama", "Chase Purdy", "Bernie Sanders", "David Pittman", "Tim Starks", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Adam Sneed", "Adam Behsudi", "Brian Faler", "Sarah Karlin", "Vince Chadwick", "Hillary Clinton", "Ben White", "Carl Hulse", "Eric Wolff", "Jamal Ware", "Alan Greenblatt", "Paul Ryan"], "orgs": ["CIA", "House Benghazi Committee", "Fed", "State Department", "Congress", "Senate", "NSA", "One Nation", "Supreme Court", "Drumheller", "Senate GOP", "TPP", "Umpqua Community College", "FBI", "GOP"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30728, "fullname": "nick gass", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-10-19 17:50:41", "org": "politico", "article_id": "3760765f1268f6408e3c8b863205e533", "date_access": "2015-10-19 18:43:24.417906"}
