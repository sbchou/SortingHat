Yet, spending on retail prescription medicines accounts for just 10 percent of U.S. health care spending. And the federal government projects this trend will continue through at least the next decade. How is this possible? Because the competitive biopharmaceutical market that exists in the U.S. helps to control costs while encouraging the development of innovative new therapies.
