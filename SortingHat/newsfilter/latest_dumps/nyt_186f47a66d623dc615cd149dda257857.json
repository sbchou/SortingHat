{"body": "WASHINGTON \u2014 United States presidential campaigns usually aren\u2019t sunk by major policy mistakes or the attacks of an opponent. They result from self-inflicted, unforced errors.\n\nThis was apparent anew when Jeb Bush, the establishment favorite for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, recently tripped over himself as he tried, repeatedly, to answer a simple, predictable and fair question: Knowing what we know now, would you have invaded Iraq in 2003?\n\nThis isn\u2019t fatal for Mr. Bush, though he can ill afford many more such fumbles. He\u2019ll be hit with other questions on the shortcomings of his brother President George W. Bush, such as his botched 2005 effort to overhaul Social Security.\n\nBut the incident is a useful reminder of how presidential campaigns are derailed. Consider:\n\n\u2022    Mitt Romney probably wouldn\u2019t have won the general election in 2012 anyway. But Election Day was seven weeks away when he was privately taped telling wealthy Florida donors that President Obama automatically would get 47 percent of the vote, representing those who \u201care dependent upon government, who believe they are victims.\u201d Such people, he said, \u201cbelieve they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it.\u201d (Self-inflicted wounds may be a family tradition: Years earlier the presidential campaign of his father, George Romney, effectively ended when he said his support for the Vietnam War was the result of \u201cbrainwashing.\u201d)\n\n\u2022    Rick Perry, the Texas governor, was a hot Republican contender in 2011. Then, as he attempted to list the three government agencies he would eliminate, he couldn\u2019t remember the third. \u201cSorry, oops,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022    President Gerald R. Ford was closing the gap against the Democrat Jimmy Carter a month before the 1976 election when, in a debate, he declared, \u201cThere is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.\u201d The Berlin Wall didn\u2019t fall for 13 more years.\n\nDemocrats, too, have made devastating and defining unforced errors:\n\n\u2022    In 1979, Edward M. Kennedy, favored to topple the incumbent, Mr. Carter, was asked in an interview why he wanted to be president. The Massachusetts senator gave a rambling answer from which he never recovered.\n\n\u2022    Nine years later, the presidential nominee Michael S. Dukakis, trying to burnish his national security credentials, posed for photographs riding in an Abrams tank. He looked more like Snoopy chasing the Red Baron than a commander in chief. The image stuck.\n\n\u2022    In 2004, John Kerry, when talking about a military appropriations bill for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, volunteered that he \u201cactually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it.\u201d He had supported an alternative measure, but the waffler label stuck. (Mr. Kerry lacked the dexterity of Bill Clinton, who in 1992 escaped harm when asked about whether he would have supported the 1991 Gulf War resolution. He said, \u201cI would have voted with the majority if it was a close vote,\u201d then added, \u201cbut I agree with the arguments the minority made.\u201d\n\nSometimes candidacies are undone by larger matters. The former House speaker Newt Gingrich was a long shot to win the 2012 Republican nomination. But any slim hope evaporated when it was disclosed he privately accepted $1.6 million to help Freddie Mac, the mortgage giant and a favorite target of conservatives during the financial crisis.\n\nThe most consequential was Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s support for a measure authorizing the Iraq war, probably the most important vote she cast. She defended the decision in her 2008 presidential campaign, though she now says it was a mistake. Yet if she\u2019d voted against the war, there might not have been an Obama candidacy and she would be completing her second term in the White House.\n\nThis time, there probably isn\u2019t any signature vote or event. However, the winnowing process of the huge field \u2014 particularly on the Republican side \u2014 will be made easier when some of the candidates say or do something small and stupid.", "byline": "ALBERT R.
