The highlight of the nearly 17 hour affair was Carly Fiorina ripping into Donald\u2019s Trump\u2019s comments on her looks. \u201cI think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said,\u201d Fiorina said to thunderous applause. Trump, clearly not getting it, responded: \u201cI think she\u2019s got a beautiful face and I think she\u2019s a beautiful woman.\u201d That was not the only blood drawn from Trump. Jeb Bush went after him, alleging he tried to use contributions to the former Florida governor to get casino gambling in the state. \nTrump again stumbled badly on substance, giving rambling answers on how we would handle Syria, Russia and Vladimir Putin and saying he didn\u2019t really need to know all the \u201cArab names\u201d that Hugh Hewitt asked him about in a recent radio interview. Will any of it matter? Who knows? Trump still dominated in the Drudge Report online poll asking who won the debate. Trump could probably sacrifice a goat on stage and still win these kind of polls. Jeb Bush did OK but probably not enough to move his numbers or cheer up his donors. And Margaret Thatcher on the $10? Yikes. \nMarco Rubio was very strong again \u2014 stronger than Bush \u2014 but it didn\u2019t seem to do much for him last time. Chris Christie and John Kasich both had a couple good moments, though Christie\u2019s argument that Trump and Fiorina\u2019s business records don\u2019t matter was ridiculous. It\u2019s pretty much all that matters about them. The rest \u2026 who really cares? Fiorina did take some heat from Trump on her Hewlett-Packard record (firing back over Trump company bankruptcies.) And if the former CEO rises in the polls, her record of shareholder value destruction (and layoffs) will become a very big topic. \nFIORINA-MENTUM? \u2014 POLTICO\u2019s Gabriel Debenedetti: \u201cIn a race that lately has turned on who is the most convincing outsider \u2026 Fiorina staked a forceful claim on Wednesday night that a political newcomer need not be blustery to be sharp, and need not be uninformed about policy to be fresh and appealing \u2026 Fiorina cast herself as far better-informed on the issues than Trump and more forceful than Carson.\n\u201cShe combined her own brand of Trumpian putdowns with a far more detailed command of policy, crisply detailing her approach to bolstering allies, country by country, in the Middle East. Appearing in the main-card debate for the first time after a strong performance in the undercard of the first debate, she commanded voters' attention early on by responding sternly, and unflinchingly \u2026 to Trump's attacks on her appearance.\u201d http://politi.co/1FhPZWG\nMORE ON TRUMP AND THE GAMBLING thing from POLITICO\u2019s Ben Schreckinger: http://politi.co/1FOjHxy\nBUSINESS BRAWL \u2014 POLITICO's Kyle Cheney reports Trump and Fiorina \u201ctook turns thrashing each other's business records, each accusing the other of running their companies into financial disaster.\" http://politi.co/1ixG3hS\nEVERYTHING IS AWFUL \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Mike \u201cHappy Days\u201d Grunwald on the grim picture the GOP candidates (especially Trump) paint of 2015 America. http://politi.co/1LzwmGx\nWAY BACK MACHINE \u2014 Fortune\u2019s Carol J.

After the last debate, despite missteps, Trump rose rather than fell.

Now it looks like they\u2019re going to get a Denali-sized one. With the nation's borrowing authority set to lapse as early as November, and money to keep the federal government and road construction projects funded increasingly likely to run dry around the same time, the end of 2015 increasingly has the makings of a very unhappy holiday season for Washington.\n\u201cIndeed, the ongoing inertia of Congress could produce a year-end scramble on those big-ticket items, as well as the looming expiration of billions in tax breaks. That\u2019s bad news not just for lawmakers\u2019 hopes of an early Thanksgiving break.\u201d \nMORE HEADACHES FOR MARY JO WHITE \u2014 Bloomberg\u2019s Robert Schmidt David Michaels: \u201cU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White is facing pressure to recuse herself from picking the next head of the regulator that polices accountants because of a potential conflict with her husband\u2019s legal work. White is in the midst of weighing candidates to head the [PCAOB] \u2026 a little-known watchdog whose chairman makes more than $670,000 a year and has great sway over the industry.\n\u201cThe Center for Effective Government, an advocacy group, said White should step aside because her husband, John White, sits on an official advisory group to the audit board. While the position is unpaid, it gives John White regular access to top PCAOB officials. His law firm, Cravath, Swaine & Moore, highlights the role in marketing materials.\u201d http://bloom.bg/1MczN8K\nTHE BIG DEAL: ALTICE TO BUY CABLEVISION \u2014 NYT\u2019s Michael J. de la Merced and Andrew Ross Sorkin: \u201cCablevision has agreed to sell itself to Altice, an acquisitive European telecommunications giant, for about $17.7 billion, including debt \u2026 It is the latest deal to reshape the broadband and cable television landscape. \u2026 The transaction would further realign an industry already in upheaval as cable and telecom companies seek greater scale and negotiating power with content providers.\n\u201cBut the takeover of Cablevision \u2014 one of the last trophies of the American cable industry and the longtime province of its founding family, the Dolans \u2014 could also draw significant concern from regulators, particularly as control of the telecom market shrinks to fewer and fewer players. \u2026 Charter Communications, a cable operator with ties to the billionaire John C. Malone, has already agreed to buy Time Warner Cable after its archrival Comcast failed to complete a deal. AT&T recently completed a $48.5 billion takeover of the satellite television operator DirecTV.\u201d http://nyti.ms/1NyNy3b\nFED FLY-AROUND \u2014 \nWALL STREET SAYS NO \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Min Zeng and Ira Iosebashvili: \u201cWall Street is skeptical that the Federal Reserve has room to raise short-term interest rates Thursday, underscoring persistent doubts about the health of the global economy and financial markets following seven years of easy policy \u2026 Some of the biggest names in the financial industry say a rate rise now would be unwise. And some executives whose firms would benefit from higher rates nevertheless don\u2019t expect an increase Thursday\n\u201cSome say doing so would risk a repeat of central-bank moves that have drawn criticism, such as the European Central Bank\u2019s decision to raise interest rates in 2008, just before the acute stage of the financial crisis, and the Fed\u2019s decision to tighten policy in 1937, a move some commentators say added years to the Depression\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1FOpMtF\nTHE CLIFFHANGER \u2014 NYT\u2019s Binyamin Appelbaum: \u201cYellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, faces a crucial moment on Thursday when the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee announces whether the time has come to start raising interest rates.Liberal activists, economists and some policy makers are pressing hard for Ms. Yellen to continue the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign \u2026 At the same time, Ms. Yellen faces growing internal pressure to start raising rates from Fed officials who are concerned about froth in financial markets and about maintaining control of inflation.\n\u201cAnalysts say the decision will further sharpen Ms. Yellen\u2019s priorities as perhaps the most powerful economic official in the world. \u2026 For much of the summer, the Fed seemed on track to announce after this meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee that it would raise its benchmark interest rate for the first time since the financial crisis. \u2026 Then China swooned and markets skittered downward, and Fed officials started wondering aloud whether it might make sense to wait at least a few more weeks, if not longer\u201d http://nyti.ms/1iQBXkJ\nBLANKFEIN: DON\u2019T DO IT! \u2014 FT\u2019s Ben McLannahan: \u201cLloyd Blankfein has added to a chorus of voices advising the US Federal Reserve to hold off from pushing up interest rates, saying that \u2018the data just isn\u2019t there\u2019 to justify any tighter monetary conditions. The advice from the Goldman Sachs chief executive, among the longest serving at the biggest US banks, comes on the eve of one of the most keenly awaited policy decisions by the central bank since it last raised rates nearly a decade ago. \u2026 \n\u201cMr Blankfein said that such a move would be a mistake, as it would undermine the Fed\u2019s insistence that economic data is its primary policy consideration. \u2018Everybody has visibility on everything; if a decision [to increase rates] gets made it\u2019s not because there\u2019s a tsunami of evidence of a quickening of the recovery, or a tightening of labour or an acceleration of inflation \u2014 it is almost a question of wanting to get over that hurdle, he said. Such \u2018soft\u2019 factors should not trump \u2018hard data evaluation,\u2019 he added. \u2018And the data evaluation isn\u2019t compelling an interest-rate rise at this point.\u2019\u201dhttp://on.ft.com/1UWjGyi\nPOLITICO\u2019S WHAT WORKS D.C.: Join POLITICO Magazine for the next in their What Works series, focusing on the future of Washington, D.C.
