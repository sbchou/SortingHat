Normally, I\u2019d say \u201chappy Friday\u201d or \u201cgood Friday.\u201d But it\u2019s the 14th anniversary of 9/11. It\u2019s a day to be somber, a day to honor those who died then and thereafter amid its fallout. And it\u2019s a day to be outraged. Our government, under Republican and Democratic administrations, is still blocking the public from simply reading 28 pages of a congressional inquiry that exposed Saudi complicity in 9/11. A South Florida judge is reviewing 80,000 documents to help determine what info to release. How about all of it? Former FL Sen. Bob Graham has crusaded for our right to know. His reward: the FBI detained and insulted him. \nIF INFORMATION IS THE CURRENCY OF DEMOCRACY, OUR GOVERNMENT ACTS AS IF IT\u2019S BANKRUPT. In that vein, after you go through Florida Playbook, please read the following story Lucy Morgan broke last month\u2026\nGRAHAM V. BIG BROTHER -- \u201cWhy did the FBI Detain Bob Graham?\u201d by The Tampa Bay Times\u2019 Lucy Morgan: \u201c[I]in 2011 \u2026 he and Adele were heading to the Washington, D.C., area to spend Thanksgiving with one of their daughters. As they stepped off an airplane at Dulles International Airport, two FBI agents approached and asked the Grahams to accompany them to a nearby agency office. Graham had not informed the FBI that he was traveling to the Washington area and to this day does not know how they knew where he planned to spend Thanksgiving or what airplane he would be aboard.\u201d http://bit.ly/1J1i93f\nGWEN GRAHAM V. IRAN DEAL \u2013 \u201cGwen Graham to vote against Iran deal,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Steve Shepard: Rep. Gwen Graham announced Thursday she will oppose President Barack Obama\u2019s nuclear agreement with Iran. \u201cAfter this thoughtful process and careful consideration, I have decided to vote against the agreement because I have grave doubts it will prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, and a deep concern it could provide a pathway to legitimizing Iran\u2019s nuclear program,\u201d Graham wrote in an op-ed published in the Tallahassee Democrat and Panama City News Herald and posted on her congressional website. http://politi.co/1UFFm79\n--Graham\u2019s op-ed here: http://1.usa.gov/1KbtbDP\n--Final Florida congressional delegation Iran-deal tally: Support: 6 Democrats.

Lawmakers are slated to hold a round of committee meetings, but will also spend much of their time just a block away, at The Governor\u2019s Club, the members-only establishment that\u2019s Tallahassee\u2019s favorite spot for campaign fundraisers.\u201d http://politi.co/1Mfvyw8\nBEST OF THE JEB WEBS \u2013 Paul Steinhauser @steinhauserNH1: \u201c2016 News on @NH1News - @JebBush photo bombed my standup #nhpolitics #fitn #nh1news\u201d https://db.tt/AHtLfaOc\nGOOD FOR JEB -- \u201cJeb Bush\u2019s tax plan is great for Jeb Bush by The Washington Post's Catherine Rampell: \u201cThe Republican presidential candidate would make out like a bandit under his own plan. According to my quick-and-dirty, back-of-the-envelope calculations based on Bush\u2019s 2013 tax return, his liability for that year would have fallen by about $800,000, or about a quarter of what he paid Uncle Sam.\u201d http://wapo.st/1iAS2Lq\nBAD FOR THE DEFICIT? --\u201cJeb Bush\u2019s tax plan doesn\u2019t quite add up,\u201d the Washington Post editorial board: \u201cMr. Bush\u2019s plan would reduce federal revenue \u2014 a lot. An analysis from Mr. Feldstein and three other economists estimates that, without accounting for any added economic growth the plan might spur, the tax scheme would lose the government an astonishing $3.4 trillion over 10 years. A \u2018dynamic\u2019 analysis estimating the effects of added economic growth still predicts a loss of $1.2 trillion.\u201d http://wapo.st/1UFIgZz\nJEB\u2019S MIAMI MUSCLE --\u201cDetails set for Jeb Bush's Miami field office opening,\u201d by The Miami Herald\u2019s Patricia Mazzei: \u201cThe office at 5430 SW 8th St. will formally open its doors at 4:30 p.m. Saturday.\u201d http://bit.ly/1O4pDKC\nHOUSE SPEAKER HELPERS \u2013 \u201cGOP Florida House speakers past and present back Jeb Bush,\u201d by Miami Herald\u2019s Patricia Mazzei: \u201cThe list includes current Speaker Steve Crisafulli and his predecessor, Will Weatherford, as well as Dean Cannon, Larry Cretul, Allan Bense, Tom Feeney, John Thrasher and Daniel Webster. Webster, now a U.S. congressman, was the first speaker to take the House reins after it came under GOP control in 1996... Bush didn't seek the support of former Speaker Ray Sansom, was accused of pursuing $6 million in state money for a hangar to benefit a GOP donor. A judge later dropped the charges.

Residents of Milton and the surrounding community voiced strong opinions at the Aug. 3 council meeting, with many pushing council to put the issue to bed one way or another as division continues to grow about either keeping or removing the Confederate flag. City Council first tabled discussion in July about making any changes to the city's six flags, which include the so-called Stars and Bars flag, also known as the First National Flag of the Confederacy and the Bonnie Blue flag \u2014 both of which are on display at the corner of Stewart Street and U.S. 90.\u201d http://on.pnj.com/1VQHoOV\nSCOTT\u2019S WATER BOY \u2013 \u201cIn SFWMD shakeup, Scott sends former deputy Pete Antonacci in to take reins,\u201d by Miami Herald\u2019s Jenny Staletovich: \u201cA political insider who served as general counsel to Gov.
