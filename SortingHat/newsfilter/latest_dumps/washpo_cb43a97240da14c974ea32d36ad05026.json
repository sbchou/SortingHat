{"body": " Her strong performance at the second Republican presidential debate has put a new spotlight on former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina\u2019s long-shot bid for the 2016 nomination. Whether she can turn buzz into momentum, however, hinges on overcoming a set of substantive and logistical challenges. Until now, Fiorina has been running near the back of the pack, essentially living off the land as she campaigns in the early-voting states. One question ahead is whether she can quickly build a top-tier organization to go with her new status as a serious contender. Another is how well her corporate record will stand up once voters start examining it more closely. \u201cI went into this debate understanding that half the people watching had never heard my name and didn\u2019t know I was running for president,\u201d she said Thursday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cAnd so it was a really important opportunity for me to continue to introduce myself to the American people.\u201d \u201cI was satisfied that I said what I needed to say last night,\u201d Fiorina added. The day-after reviews from the conservative commentariat were ecstatic.   Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina in 2002, celebrating the company\u2019s merger with Compaq. (Chris Preovolos/AP)  \u201cTime and time again, Carly Fiorina showed she could hold up against the rest. It was a very real introduction to the nation as a legitimate contender,\u201d RedState editor Erick Erickson wrote on the Fox News Web site, adding, \u201cThe big question now is not whether Carly Fiorina\u2019s polling goes up, but from whom does she take votes?\u201d Fiorina may also be part of the answer to the GOP\u2019s difficulties appealing to female voters. The party is looking for a nominee who can go toe-to-toe with former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, who is seeking to make history by becoming the nation\u2019s first female president. Fiorina deflated front-runner Donald Trump, something no other Republican contender has managed to do to the bombastic billionaire. Asked about disparaging comments he had made about her face, she coolly replied, \u201cI think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.\u201d For once, Trump seemed taken aback. He tried to overwrite one comment about Fiorina\u2019s appearance with another one: \u201cI think she\u2019s got a beautiful face, and I think she\u2019s a beautiful woman.\u201d  [Carly Fiorina and the underappreciated art of listening]  With the attention that Fiorina is now getting, however, there is certain to come new scrutiny. Much of it will center on her record at Hewlett-Packard. After achieving acclaim in 1999 for being the first woman to head one of the nation\u2019s 20 largest corporations, Fiorina was fired in 2005. Fiorina got a taste of that new scrutiny before the debate had even ended Wednesday night. When her business record came under attack during the event, there was a spike in Google searches for \u201cCarly Fiorina fired\u201d and \u201cCarly Fiorina fired why.\u201d Fact-checkers quickly challenged her familiar assertions that, under her leadership, HP \u201cdoubled the size of the company, we quadrupled its top-line growth rate, we quadrupled its cash flow, we tripled its rate of innovation.\u201d The main force driving the higher numbers was Fiorina\u2019s decision in 2001 to merge HP with rival company Compaq. It was a controversial move \u2014 one that Dell founder Michael Dell dubbed \u201cthe dumbest deal of the decade\u201d \u2014 and helped lead to her ouster. There are also certain to be reminders of the 30,000 layoffs that occurred at HP on her watch. But none of this comes as a surprise to Fiorina, who clearly has been preparing for the onslaught and faced similar fire when she ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 2010 against incumbent Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). During the debate, Trump taunted her: \u201cI only say this \u2014 she can\u2019t run any of my companies. That I can tell you.\u201d Her rejoinder was to bring up the four times that Trump\u2019s companies filed for bankruptcy: \u201cYou ran up mountains of debt, as well as losses, using other people\u2019s money.\u201d Another question that will now arise is how well Fiorina can capi\u00adtal\u00adize on her expected boost in the polls and in fundraising. Thus far, Republican operatives say, she has almost no organization on the ground in the early-voting states. \u201cWe are reaching a critical point for organization. It will take significant infrastructure to win the early states,\u201d said Matt Moore, chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party. \u201cBy Thanksgiving, if organization is not ready, you stand a real risk of not being able to capi\u00adtal\u00adize on momentum.\u201d Fiorina told MSNBC that she is undaunted by that prospect. \u201cYou know, the first caucus still is about four or five months away,\u201d she said. \u201cIt may not be an exciting answer, but the real answer, the true answer, is I\u2019m going to keep doing what I\u2019ve been doing, which is working hard every single day to answer every question, to meet as many voters as I can, to be transparent about who I am and what I intend to do.\u201d \u201cI hope what people saw last night is that I can win this job and I can do this job,\u201d she added. Unlike campaigns with larger staffs, Fiorina\u2019s does not yet appear to have the capacity to stage multiple events in a single day. A typical appearance on the stump features Fiorina and a microphone. She sometimes lacks a second one for those in the audience to use when they ask her questions. She rarely turns down an opportunity for a radio or television interview. That worked to her advantage recently, when she followed Trump on the radio show of conservative host Hugh Hewitt, who was also one of the questioners at Wednesday\u2019s debate. Where Trump had flubbed a series of questions from Hewitt about foreign policy, Fiorina handled them with ease. As is the case with other GOP presidential candidates, Fiorina benefits from the efforts of a super PAC. At her campaign events, there is usually a table of brochures, reading material and signs produced by Carly for America. After Trump\u2019s comment about her face was reported in Rolling Stone, the super PAC produced a widely praised ad that showed the faces of other women and closed with Fiorina telling an audience: \u201cThis is the face of a 61-year-old woman. I am proud of every year and every wrinkle.\u201d But the law prohibits coordination between candidates and their ostensibly independent super PACs, which means there are limits to how much the outside organization can substitute for the operational abilities of Fiorina\u2019s campaign. One of Fiorina\u2019s gifts is her quickness and agility when the spotlight is on her. But as a candidate now seen as a viable contender for her party\u2019s nomination, Fiorina\u2019s comments will be examined more closely. For instance, one crowd-pleaser at Wednesday\u2019s GOP debate also came under fire Thursday as inaccurate.   [Fact-checking the second round of GOP debates]  She had graphically described watching a video of a fetus with a beating heartbeat have its brain removed at a Planned Parenthood clinic, and challenged Democrats to have the courage to watch it. \u201cWatch a fully formed fetus on the table, it\u2019s heart beating, it\u2019s legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain,\u201d Fiorina said. In fact, no such footage has surfaced in the ongoing controversy over secretly recorded videos by the antiabortion group called the Center for Medical Progress. The video to which Fiorina referred has a disturbing interview with a biotechnology technician, whose company partnered with Planned Parenthood, describing such a scene as images of a fetus are shown.
