While I won't predict ratings for this debate, we expect the audience to be significantly smaller,\u201d said CNN Washington Bureau Chief Sam Feist.\n The 2008 cycle saw some high numbers for the Democratic debates, drawn by the head-to-head match-up of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, both of whom had a chance to make history as either the first black or woman president. The most watched Democratic debates of the 2008 cycle came late in the season. On Jan. 31, 2008, the Democratic debate hosted by CNN, brought in 8.3 million viewers. The second most watched debate of the 2008 cycle was hosted by MSNBC on Feb. 26, and brought in 7.77 million viewers. \nFor comparison\u2019s sake to Tuesday\u2019s debate, the October debate of the 2008 cycle, hosted by MSNBC, brought in just 2.45 million viewers. \nAnother element to contend with: Baseball. The New York Mets will play the Los Angeles Dodgers and the St. Louis Cardinals will play the Chicago Cubs in playoff games. The first two GOP debates did not have major sports games to compete with.\n\u201cApart from the minor complications of the start of the fall TV season and the baseball playoffs, for the most part the difference between the size of the ratings for the two CNN debates \u2014 Democratic vs Republican \u2014 will be a quantification of the Trump Effect. How much has Donald Trump's presence increased interest in Campaign 2016 beyond the traditional political hardcore?\u201d said Andrew Tyndall, television analyst and author of the Tyndall Report.\nTyndall argued that the Republican debate had such astronomically high viewership because it attacked Democrats, Republicans and the apolitical who tuned in because \"politics aside, it had elements of a reality TV elimination contest.\"\nAnd, while there\u2019s a good chance the three lesser known candidates \u2014 Martin O\u2019Malley, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee \u2014 may engage in some antics to get more face time, Tyndall said he\u2019s not expecting it to draw in any new viewers.\n\"The Democratic debate holds little interest for Republican-leaning viewers, except for the novelty of a genuine socialist on the national stage. It holds little interest for reality TV viewers, since it promises little ad hominem drama and few prospects of outrageous behavior. Therefore both elements of the Trump Effect will be absent,\u201d Tyndall wrote. \"When Donald claims credit, as I am certain he will, for the difference in the two sets of ratings, he will be entitled to do so.\"\nFormer DNC spokesperson Mo Elleithee agreed, noting that he doubts many of the people who watched the GOP debates will actually vote in a primary.\n\"Total number of viewers is important, but even more important from [the DNC\u2019s] perspective is the percentage of viewers who go on to vote in a Democratic primary,\u201d said Elleithee, who is now executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service. \"From the party's perspective, these debates are organizing tools. You want them to create excitement among Democrats to get involved.\"\n CNN is employing some tactics to help boost ratings. Singer Sheryl Crow will be singing the national anthem. The network has also left the door open for Vice President Joe Biden to be on stage, even if he chooses declare the same day (CNN hosts have been tweeting photos of the extra podium for Biden \u2014 just in case.) The moderator will be Anderson Cooper in place of political junkie Jake Tapper, who was brought into the second GOP debate to help control and direct the Republican circus. Anchor Don Lemon, who draws good ratings on his \u201cCNN Tonight\u201d show and is known for his unpredictability, will be asking questions along with CNN Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash and CNN Espa\u00f1ol anchor Juan Carlos Lopez. \nHadas Gold is a reporter at\u00a0Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "CNN expects &#8216;significantly smaller&#8217; ratings for Dem debate", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/cnn-democratic-debate-ratings-expectations-214664", "topics": ["immigration", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Mary Jo White", "Ron Paul", "Joe Pompeo", "Sam Feist", "Rachael Bade", "Hillary Clinton", "Jason Rezaian", "Andrew Tyndall", "Spiro Agnew", "Hadas Gold", "Angela Merkel", "Henry Kissinger", "Richard Nixon", "Anderson Cooper", "Dana Bash", "Patrick Temple", "Kimberly Hefling", "John Boehner", "Juan Carlos Lopez", "Josh Gerstein", "Katie Glueck", "Nick Gass", "Jack Shafer", "Trey Gowdy", "Martin O'Malley", "Isaac Dovere", "Joe Biden", "Lincoln Chafee", "Jim Webb", "Mo Elleithee", "David Rogers", "Andrew Glass", "Donald Trump", "Nicholas Vinocur", "Eliza Collins", "Paul Ryan", "Jake Tapper", "Richard M.
