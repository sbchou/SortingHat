{"body": "Jeb Bush planted a foot in two angry worlds, demanding justice for Freddie Gray and the rule of law in riot-battered Baltimore.\n\nBen Carson wagged his finger at the parents of the city\u2019s youth, telling them, \u201cTake control of your children.\u201d\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton deplored a broken system of criminal justice, pleading for an end to \u201cmass incarceration\u201d for nonviolent offenders.\n\nAnd Rand Paul sounded oddly off-key, chuckling about the terror he has felt while traveling by train through downtown Baltimore. \u201cI\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t stop,\u201d he said.\n\nAn emerging presidential campaign characterized so far by upbeat announcement speeches and mostly abstract agendas on Tuesday confronted shocking scenes of violence and rage in a city not an hour away from the White House.\n\nIt was a jarring, concrete crisis \u2014 and many of the 2016 contenders seemed either caught off guard or uncertain of how, or even whether, to respond.\n\nFor those seeking the White House, the conflagration in Baltimore exposed a complicated truth: The racial comity that the election of Barack Obama seemed to promise has not materialized, forcing them to grapple with a red-hot, deeply unresolved dynamic that strays far from their carefully crafted messages and favored themes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of the candidates want or expect the summer of 2015 to be like the summer of 1968,\u201d said Rick Wilson, a longtime Republican political strategist who is not aligned with any campaign.\n\nA number of people \u201ccrafted this tacit bargain in their heads,\u2019\u2019 he said, speaking of Mr. Obama\u2019s election. \u201cThis is going to be the end of the ugly parts of racial division in America.\u201d\n\nIt has not been the end.\n\nReactions ranged from the personal to the doctrinaire, from compassionate to flippant. Former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley rushed back from paid speechmaking in Ireland to the West Baltimore neighborhood he once oversaw as mayor, seeming at once heartbroken and eager to project calm.\n\nAmid drum circles and hovering helicopters, Mr. O\u2019Malley spoke with city residents \u2014 some admiring, others not \u2014 at an intersection caddy-corner to the burned out shell of a CVS Pharmacy. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of good people in our city,\u201d he said. \u201cThe longer arc of Baltimore, the longer arc of our history, is black and white people coming together to make a better life for themselves.\u201d\n\nMr. Carson, a former neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital, evoked his own time as a resident of Baltimore, sounding like a man who felt betrayed by his former neighbors.\n\nHe denounced \u201cirresponsible individuals,\u201d and \u201cuncontrolled agitators\u201d in the city. But he tempered his frustration with milder suggestions,, counseling change through \u201cpeaceful conversation and policy ideas.\u201d\n\nWith few exceptions, the candidates first grappled with the city\u2019s turmoil from the safe distance of a written statement released by aides or a brief posting on social media.\n\n\u201cI am praying for peace and safety in Baltimore,\u201d Mrs. Clinton wrote on Twitter on Monday night, calling Mr. Gray\u2019s death \u201ca tragedy that demands answers\u201d before delivering broader remarks at a fund-raiser Tuesday. She planned to give a speech Wednesday morning proposing specific changes.\n\nGov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a likely Republican candidate, remained in the shelter of his cautious Twitter stream. \u201cOur prayers for restoration of peace in Baltimore,\u201d he posted on Twitter, without elaboration.\n\nMr. Bush, traveling in Puerto Rico, offered a more expansive response.\n\n\u201cThere has to be a commitment to the rule of law,\u201d he said of the rioters, but he insisted on an investigation into Mr. Gray\u2019s death \u201cas quickly as possible so that people know that the system works for them.\u201d\n\nMr. Bush lamented what he said could be a long wait for a satisfying conclusion to the inquiry. \u201cIt takes a really long time. And the world we live in now is really coming hour by hour.\u201d\n\nThe moment is vexing for those with long records in government, who must answer for a criminal justice system \u2014 now the source of so much rage \u2014 whose construction they sometimes financed or supported. As governor of Florida, Mr. Bush backed mandatory sentencing for drug offenders, rules that many Republicans now view as unfairly consigning a generation of black men to prison.\n\nMrs. Clinton faces a similar burden \u2014 in her case, by association. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, signed the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, the most significant crime legislation ever passed and a measure that critics say contributed to a climate of police abuse.\n\nThe 1994 law included $30.2 billion to bolster cities\u2019 law enforcement rosters and build dozens of new prisons. It also created tougher penalties for drug offenders and expanded the number of crimes that could be punished by the federal death penalty.\n\nLesser-known and underfinanced rivals quickly sought to highlight those vulnerabilities. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is expected to announce his long-shot campaign for the Democratic nomination next week, bemoaned what he said was overly punitive legislation from the Clinton era.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of rethinking of that type of legislation,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in an interview. \u201cIf for no other reason just financially it makes more sense to provide jobs and education than building jails. Building jails only destroys lives because the greatest education center for crime is jails. \u201c\n\nOf course, the debate over policy and police tactics gave way to coarser, and, at times, racially tinged, reactions. Donald Trump, who has relentlessly flirted with but never embarked on a Republican presidential run, declared that \u201cour great African-American president hasn\u2019t exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore.\u201d\n\nIn Baltimore, where fires still smoldered, presidential politics felt like a distant luxury, unneeded and unwanted to people like Sharon Norris, 58, who lives in West Baltimore.\n\n\u201cIf politicians are using this as a way to say, \u2018I\u2019m there for you, I understand,\u2019 it doesn\u2019t matter to these folks,\u201d Ms. Norris said of her neighbors. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to move any votes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Hillary Clinton came down here to speak to these folks, it wouldn\u2019t matter,\u201d she added. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t matter if Obama came. Not going to change their thoughts.\u201d\n\nMs. Norris politely excused herself to finish a more urgent task. She needed to move her car to a spot in front of her house where she could keep watch in case of riots.\n\n\u201cNot that I could do anything,\u201d she said. \u201cThank God I have insurance.\u201d", "byline": "MICHAEL BARBARO", "description": "With few exceptions, the candidates first grappled with the city\u2019s turmoil from the safe distance of Twitter or statements released by aides.", "title": "Baltimore Forces Presidential Hopefuls to Confront a Jarring Crisis", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/us/politics/baltimore-forces-presidential-hopefuls-to-confront-a-jarring-crisis.html", "topics": ["personality", "economy"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Martin O'Malley", "Freddie Gray", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Scott Walker", "Donald Trump", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Barack Obama", "Bernie Sanders", "Rick Wilson", "Ben Carson", "Bill Clinton"], "orgs": [], "authors": [{"author_id": 316, "fullname": "michael barbaro", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-04-29 10:00:22", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "683e75f15187d7a9100555ebdee780da", "date_access": "2015-04-29 09:25:10.466977"}
