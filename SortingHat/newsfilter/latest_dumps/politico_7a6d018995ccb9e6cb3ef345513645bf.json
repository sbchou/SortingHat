I\u2019m astounded by that. Why would they send me a box of Dominican cigars when I could go buy them in any cigar shop?\u201d\nVentura, echoing comments on his show, said the gift \u2014 and now the denial \u2014 speak to problems with Bush\u2019s campaign.\n\u201cCome on. You\u2019re even going to cover this up? You\u2019re going to deny a box of cigars, like what: that\u2019s going to determine the election? It\u2019s a simple and true story,\u201d Ventura said. \u201cI guess the point that I\u2019m making is elites live by a different set of rules than all the rest of us because they can get Cuban cigars, clearly, when the rest of us can\u2019t.\u201d\nVentura, who no longer smokes cigars, indicated the issue had personal salience because he once had U.S. Customs agents take two Cuban cigars from him as he reentered the United States from Canada. He said he wanted to give the cigars to his dad.\nVentura told the story about Bush\u2019s gift during an interview with consultant and political operative Roger Stone, who recently departed Donald Trump\u2019s campaign in a dispute over messaging. Ventura has had a decades-long relationship with Trump. One of the early professional wrestling \u201cWrestlemanias\u201d was held at the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, where Ventura wrestled as \u201cJesse The Body Ventura.\u201d He said Trump told him that Wrestlemania tickets sold out the venue faster than boxing events.\nYears later, Ventura was elected to one term in Minnesota in 1998 at the same time Bush won office in Florida. Ventura couldn\u2019t remember the year that the governors met with Clinton in the White House, but he vividly recalls telling the president that he opposed the Cuban embargo, which Clinton had signed into federal law in 1996.\n\u201cI hate to feel like a criminal every time I go to smoke a Cuban cigar,\u201d Ventura said he told the president. \u201cJeb approached me and told me to keep it down.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t bring that up, I don\u2019t want that up. I\u2019ll send you all the Cuban cigars you need,\u201d Bush said privately to his Minnesota counterpart, according to Ventura. Ventura said he later walked over to Bush and put an empty aluminum Romeo y Julieta cigar tube in the Florida governor\u2019s top pocket and said \u201cthere\u2019s my brand.\u201d\nVentura said that, 10 days later, \u201cI got a box of Romeo Julieta Cubans delivered to the Capitol in Minnesota.\u201d\nIs there a chance that the cigars he got were actually from the Dominican Republic?\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ventura told POLITICO. \u201cThe cigar box was sealed and the cigars each came in a silver tube that said \u2018Cuba\u2019 on the side.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cHow would Jeb be able to get his hands on a box of Cuban illegal cigars?\u201d Ventura asked. \u201cIt shows the embargo isn\u2019t working.\u201d\n\n Author: Marc Caputo\nfollow this reporter\n", "byline": "", "description": "Bush spokesperson: \"\"The cigars were Dominican.\"", "title": "Jesse Ventura accuses Jeb of Cuban cigar cover-up", "url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/florida/2015/08/8574315/jesse-ventura-accuses-jeb-cuban-cigar-cover", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["Bill Clinton", "Jeb Bush", "Donald Trump", "Roger Stone", "Marc Caputo", "Jesse Ventura"], "orgs": ["McClatchy"], "authors": [{"author_id": 37322, "fullname": "marc caputo \n6:40 p.m. | aug. 13", "primary_org": "politico"}, {"author_id": 36491, "fullname": "2015\n\nfollow this reporter", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-08-14 00:08:57", "org": "politico", "article_id": "7a6d018995ccb9e6cb3ef345513645bf", "date_access": "2015-08-14 00:20:13.934418"}
