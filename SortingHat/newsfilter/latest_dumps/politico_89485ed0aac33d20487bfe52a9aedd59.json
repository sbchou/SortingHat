The state Republican Party has been racked by drama made for an HBO series, capped by a coup attempt targeting its chairman amid charges of blackmail and infidelity. A coveted prospective candidate, Rep. Mike Coffman, decided not to run for the seat. And big-spending GOP groups have poured millions of dollars into efforts to defend vulnerable GOP incumbents \u2014 instead of pummeling the 50-year-old, first-term Bennet.\nThe stakes for the party go well beyond a single Senate seat. Win in this perennial swing state and the GOP\u2019s chances of hanging onto the Senate in a very tough year would improve dramatically. A strong candidate could also help the party compete in what\u2019s expected to be a hard-fought battle for the state\u2019s nine electoral votes in the presidential race.\nNow the party is pinning its hopes squarely on one man: George Brauchler, a polished but politically unproven district attorney who prosecuted the man convicted of gunning down a dozen people in the 2012 movie theater massacre in Aurora, Colorado. The 45-year-old prosecutor is under pressure from the party to take on Bennet \u2014 in the season of Trump, they see him as someone who could claim the \u201coutsider\u201d mantle \u2014 and to jump in soon. \n\u201cI think if he ran for the Senate, he\u2019d be someone who a lot of Republicans could get behind \u2014 including myself,\u201d said Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who unseated Democratic Sen. Mark Udall in a hotly contested race last year. \u201cI think there are a lot of people who are very interested in this race. I think a lot of them are waiting on George Brauchler.\u201d\n\n2016\n\n            By \nRachael Bade\n             and \nJosh Gerstein\n\nIn an interview with POLITICO last week as the theater trial wrapped up, Brauchler said he\u2019s weighing a bid and would decide \u201crelatively soon.\u201d \n\u201cThe biggest thing for me right now is I\u2019ve got to get some distance between me and the case,\u201d he said.\nThere\u2019s no clear Plan B for Republicans if Brauchler passes. They\u2019re reaching out to business executives \u2014 including a nephew of Mitt Romney\u2019s \u2014 and other wealthy, if politically inexperienced, types who could underwrite a campaign against Bennet and his stocked war chest.\nBennet, who prevailed in a nail-biter in 2010 to win his first full term, said in an interview his biggest hurdle is being an incumbent when voters seem to be even more anti-Washington than usual. He\u2019s trying to pitch himself as a get-things-done pragmatist who\u2019s worked with Republicans on issues like immigration, education and pharmaceutical policy.\nBut he\u2019s fully cognizant it\u2019s not an easy sell in this environment.\n\u201cJust the sort of general anti-incumbent sentiment in the country is probably the thing that I know I\u2019m going to face,\u201d Bennet said when asked about his challenges. \u201dSomehow we\u2019ve to create a political conversation in this country where the arsonists aren\u2019t the ones who are getting away with complaining that the place is on fire.\u201d\nSitting outside a Starbucks on a sweltering afternoon here last week, Bennet warned his party not to take his seat for granted.\n\u201cI can\u2019t say it another way: It will be close, I know it will be close,\u201d said Bennet, a former superintendent of Denver public schools and Yale-educated lawyer who was first appointed to his seat in 2009. \u201cI\u2019ve been telling everybody nationally that that\u2019s true.\u201d\nColorado is a rare pickup opportunity for Republicans next year. There are 24 GOP seats up this cycle vs. just 10 for Democrats. Of those 10, Bennet is the only incumbent seeking reelection who\u2019s considered at risk. \nEven then, Bennet has a clear leg up: No Republican White House hopeful has won the state since 2004, and no GOP Senate candidate has won in a presidential year since 1996. On top of that, an influx of Hispanic and younger voters moving into the state bodes well for Bennet, especially with a presidential race sure to drive turnout higher.\n\u201cHaving survived 2010, which was brutal, I don\u2019t mind confessing that I\u2019m glad I\u2019m running in a presidential year \u2014 so I think that will be a big difference,\u201d said Bennet, who defeated now-Rep. Ken Buck by less than 2 points five years ago.\n\n\n\n            By \nPhilip Ewing\n\nSo far, at least, national conservative groups are focusing on defending their incumbents in blue and purple states like New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Illinois. \nStill, the fastest-growing segment of the population is the independent vote. There are roughly 1 million unaffiliated voters in Colorado now, outnumbering registered Democrats and Republicans, so any candidate has to appeal to moderates.\nTop Republicans believe Brauchler can.\n\u201cIf the guy runs,\u201d said Josh Penry, a former Republican leader of the Colorado state Senate, \u201cwe couldn\u2019t do better.\u201d \nBrauchler was elected to his current post in 2012, so he could run for reelection next year instead, or wait until 2018 and try for governor. A graduate of University of Colorado law school, he has spent most of his career as a prosecutor and litigator. Serving as a judge advocate general in the military, Brauchler was called to active duty in 2010 before being deployed to Iraq a year later. In 2012, he won his campaign to become district attorney for a Denver-area region with nearly 1 million people.\nBrauchler gained notoriety \u2014 locally and nationally \u2014 for his aggressive pursuit to impose the death penalty on James Holmes in the Aurora shooting. But he\u2019s also faced fierce criticism for drawing out the case: At least one juror refused to consent to the death penalty, leading to a hung jury and ultimately 12 life sentences for Holmes without parole. Critics said that Brauchler could have won the same deal before the trial, presumably saving millions in legal fees and avoiding the painful memories that were reopened.\nThe Colorado Criminal Defense Bar, which opposes the death penalty, said it was \u201cextremely disheartened by the wastefulness of the trial, which could have been avoided two years ago when a plea was offered that would have produced the exact same result.\u201d\nBut Brauchler was unapologetic, saying the demands made by the \u201clife for murder crowd\u201d to drop the pursuit of the death penalty were \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not justice,\u201d Brauchler said. \u201cIt was justice to seek death, and it would have been justice had he received death.\u201d\nFive Republicans have already announced to run for the Senate seat, but none so far is seen as viable, intensifying the focus on Brauchler. If he opts out, an array of local officials, state legislators, business executives and potentially even U.S. congressmen are expected to consider jumping in.\nOne is Rep. Scott Tipton. A spokesman said the Republican lawmaker is planning to run for reelection at the moment but \u201cis not going to close the door on any opportunity.\u201d\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n             and \nAaron MaK\n\nAnother is Romney nephew Doug Robinson, a managing director of the audit and tax consultancy KPMG who chaired the 2012 White House hopeful\u2019s campaign in Colorado.\n\u201cI have had some friends in the community approach me about it, and I am thinking whether this would be right for Colorado and right for my family,\u201d Robinson said in an email. He noted he would put \u201csome\u201d of his own cash into a potential Senate bid but would raise \u201ca lot\u201d given the tens of millions of dollars it would take to run.\nBennet has kept a low profile in the Senate, though he nabbed a slot on the influential Finance Committee and ran Senate Democrats' campaign arm last cycle. He was also a central player in the attempt to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the last Congress, which ultimately stalled but could play well for him among the state's growing Latino population.\nRepublicans see a chance to tether Bennet to an unpopular president, given the Democrat\u2019s support for much of the Obama agenda. While he praises Obamacare and notes he \"approves\" of President Barack Obama's performance in office, Bennet says he\u2019s had his tangles with the White House \u2014 bucking the president, for example, on a 2012 budget deal.\nWhatever Bennet\u2019s perceived weaknesses, several Republicans have already declined to challenge him \u2014 none more important than Coffman, who represents a critical battleground district in the Denver suburbs.\nExacerbating the Republican dilemma is the turmoil that\u2019s engulfed the state party this year. In the spring, the two-term state party chairman, Ryan Call, was ousted by a tea party-backed insurgency behind the campaign of Steve House. But later, the state\u2019s attorney general, Cynthia Coffman, and former Rep. Tom Tancredo turned on House and sought his ouster from the job.\nHouse alleged that the GOP officials sought to spread false rumors accusing him of infidelity, a jaw-dropping charge tantamount to blackmail that played out in the Colorado press for weeks earlier this summer.\nMany Republicans are nervous the party's infighting could be problematic come 2016, particularly in the Senate race.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough path, a steep path, and it\u2019s made all the more difficult by a challenging political environment and dysfunctional state party,\u201d Call said.In an interview, House downplayed the disputes, saying he\u2019s traveled across the state to foster party unity and build a robust operation to improve his party\u2019s chances in 2016.\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, it was an intrafamily disagreement, and we\u2019ve resolved it,\u201d he said.\nBut Republicans say the one thing can truly unify the party is winning in 2016 \u2014 and that Brauchler represents their best shot. \nHis allies argue that Brauchler\u2019s courtroom chops and speaking skills \u2014 he has brought more than 140 cases to verdict \u2014 would translate well to the campaign trail. Though he's relatively inexperienced as a candidate \u2014 Brauchler lost a 2008 bid for DA, the only other time he's run for elected office \u2014 he was courted during the 2014 election cycle to challenge Gov. John Hickenlooper. The Democratic incumbent stayed the execution of a man on death row for his 1993 murder of four people at a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant in Aurora, and Brauchler won over many Republicans with his sharp-edged criticism of Hickenlooper.\nBut while Brauchler is quick on his feet, he\u2019s a blank slate politically. That could cut both ways. He lacks a voting record that could be picked apart on the campaign trail, but he\u2019s also never endured the rigors of such a high-profile election.\nAsked about his ideology, Brauchler said, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m a conservative.\u201d \nHe went on to note that he opposes abortion, when asked about his position.\n\u201cThis is something that nobody cares about when you run for DA,\u201d Brauchler said with a laugh. \u201cNobody ever asks you if you are in favor of Roe vs. Wade. I\u2019m a DA, man!
