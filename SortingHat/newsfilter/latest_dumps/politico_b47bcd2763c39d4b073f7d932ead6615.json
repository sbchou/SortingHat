Trump's message: \"I'm going all the way.\"\n\"Not even a thought. Look, it's a phony deal that was perpetrated on the public,\" Trump told CNN's Chris Cuomo in a telephone interview on \"New Day.\"\nStory Continued Below\nDuring interviews aired this Sunday on ABC and NBC, Trump laid out a hypothetical scenario in which he would consider abandoning his bid for the White House. \n\"Number one, I'm not a masochist. And if I was dropping in the polls where I saw that I wasn't gonna win, why would I continue? And it's funny. Maybe it's, like, not like me because it's the power of positive thinking -- I'm a very positive person, I'm a positive thinker -- but the truth is, I'm a realist. I'm doing great in the polls right now, I think you will say. I'm not saying anything. I'm leading everything, right?\" Trump asked NBC's Chuck Todd.\nThe real-estate mogul unloaded on media coverage of the remark.\n\"Let me make it a little bit different: I\u2019m not getting out. I\u2019m gonna win, OK? I gave a very honest answer, but the press takes an answer like that and they make it like, oh, there's a big story, they make headlines out of it. It\u2019s ridiculous,\" Trump declared. \"The question was: Would you get out? The answer is: I\u2019m going all the way and we\u2019re going to win. It\u2019s a simpler answer and people can\u2019t play around with that. I mean, I watch these politicians \u2014 you know they\u2019re getting out in the next two weeks and they say, 'Oh, I\u2019m never getting out.' They\u2019re not telling the truth.\"\nDuring the segment, which lasted more than 20 minutes, he also defended his wait-and-see approach on Syria regarding Russia's involvement in the region on Tuesday, insisting that it would not be \"trusting Russia.\"\n\"Well now they're supposedly hitting ISIS, which is a positive thing and you know my attitude is we're backing rebels, we have no idea who they are,\" Trump said on CNN's \"New Day,\" reacting to reports that Moscow was hitting Islamic State targets in the modern city of Palmyra. \"Frankly, every time we just get bogged down in the Middle East and Russia will get bogged down in the Middle East,\" he added.\nOn the region as a whole, Trump warned that the U.S. does not know exactly who the rebels are that it is supporting in Syria.\nSyrian President Bashar Assad \"is a bad guy, but you can have worse,\" he said, \"and maybe these people are worse, we have no idea. I spoke to a general the other day, who's very well-versed in the area, he said, 'We have no idea who these people are we're backing.'\"\nIf Assad's regime were still in place, Trump said, \"you wouldn't have the migration of millions of people and all of the problems that that's causing. And death, death all over the place.\"\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying, sit back, just take it easy, just relax, save your billions of dollars, let\u2019s build some bridges, let\u2019s fix the roadways in our country, let\u2019s rebuild America, make America great again, let\u2019s rebuild our military,\" he told Cuomo of his thinking.\nOn Afghanistan, Trump said that he would \"begrudgingly\" keep boots on the ground, as President Barack Obama has said, because otherwise the country would \"collapse after two seconds\" if the U.S. left now.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Trump: 'I'm going all the way'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/donald-trump-2016-going-all-the-way-214463", "topics": ["terrorism", "personality", "trade"], "people": ["Kelly Ayotte", "Burgess Everett", "Paul Dallison", "Kyle Cheney", "Jack Shafer", "James Dudley", "Rachael Bade", "Kevin Robillard", "Chris Cuomo", "Henry C.
