That\u2019s one of several controversial provisions under Trump\u2019s plan, which is particularly galling to New Hampshire GOP insiders \u2014 85 percent of whom said the real estate mogul and current GOP front-runner's immigration plan was harmful to the party.\nNearly two-thirds of Iowa Republicans said the same.\nAlso on POLITICO\nHADAS GOLD\n\u201cHe\u2019s solidly put an anchor around the neck of our party, and we\u2019ll sink because of it,\u201d an Iowa Republican said of Trump.\n\u201cEnough already,\u201d vented another Iowa Republican, who like all participants was granted anonymity in order to speak freely. \u201cThis kind of garbage only appeals to the hard core\u2026 while alienating the soft middle that we must win in order to take the presidency.\u201d\nA Granite State Republican said it was \u201charmful to the party, the brand and the future of our country. What\u2019s disappointing is the speed in which other candidates follow his lead. He\u2019s forced that to be standard operation.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s plan has pushed the issue of birthright citizenship, which is protected by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, to the fore of the GOP presidential debate. A number of prominent candidates, including Scott Walker and Ted Cruz, have said they support revoking that right for the children of undocumented immigrants.\n\u201cAmazing how many ad hoc constitutional scholars, I mean activists, now believe this is a good policy,\u201d snarked an Iowa Republican.\nThe dynamic in the GOP field suggests that the lessons of 2012 \u2014 when the GOP performed abysmally among Latino voters but vowed to make concrete improvements by 2016, have already been forgotten \u2014 several insiders said.\nAlso on POLITICO\nNICK GASS\n\u201cWasn\u2019t the whole \u201cGOP rebrand\u201d effort of the 2012 loss supposed to address this\u2026in the opposite direction?\u201d said a New Hampshire Democrat, who like all participants answered via an online survey.\nNinety-seven percent of Democratic respondents called the plan harmful for the GOP.\n\u201cQuite a number of these candidates appear very willing to toss out any findings of the analysis of the last presidential election and put the general election at risk for their party,\u201d another Granite State Democrat said.\nPlenty of insiders on both sides of the aisle said that if the debate unfolding this week continues, Republicans will have a serious problem come general election time.\n\u201cThis move is not helpful in broadening the November 2016 pool of voters,\u201d warned a New Hampshire Republican.\n\u201cA great way to throw the general and become a permanent minority party,\u201d agreed an Iowa Republican.\nHere are two other takeaways from this week\u2019s POLITICO Caucus:\nHillary Clinton may have an early-state email problem.\nNearly 40 percent of Democrats \u2014 and 100 percent of Republicans \u2014 say ongoing scrutiny of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s email practices while at Foggy Bottom are damaging her campaign.\n\u201cI think people are starting to pay more attention as the story isn\u2019t going away,\u201d an Iowa Democrat said. \u201cAnd her handling of the situation is not giving confidence to her backers.\u201d\nA New Hampshire Democrat offered a similar assessment.\n\u201cClinton\u2019s response and her campaign\u2019s handling of this issue is, at least in part, the reason I am still on the sidelines in this election cycle,\u201d a Granite State Democrat said.\nThis Democrat continued: \u201cThere is an element of tone-deafness here that one just has to marvel at. Average folks really do get the distinction between using a personal email account and having a private server.\u201d\nOther early state Democrats blamed Republicans for creating a circus, but said Clinton should be dealing with it better.\n\u201cThe attention is unwarranted, or at least exaggerated, in my view but the narrative that has been set up - more by the national press than the Republicans, actually - is that she is guilty until proven innocent,\u201d added another Democratic Granite Stater.\nHer use of a private server to conduct State Department business is under review by government officials, including by a federal judge who said Thursday that she violated government policy. Her campaign maintains that she did nothing improper, but the controversy has dominated Clinton coverage in recent weeks.\nOur Republican insiders saw potentially fatal issues with the email and server dustup. Several likened the incident to \u201cWatergate,\u201d and an Iowa Republican, noting that the FBI is conducting a counter-intelligence investigation related to her server, said, \"The terms FBI and POTUS candidates do not mix.\"\nStill, the bulk of Democrats defended Clinton.\n\u201cNot ONE person asked Sec. Clinton about this on her last NH trip,\u201d a Granite State Democrat said. \u201cPeople are paying attention. They just don\u2019t care. The average voter will care if she broke the law, but they don\u2019t care about endless pointless handwringing.\u201d\nAdded another New Hampshire Democrat: \u201cHave they heard about it, yes. Do they care, no.\u201d\nOne source said they were personally troubled by the revelations, but didn\u2019t yet see it having an impact.\n\u201cYou think a 60-something Democratic woman is going to dump Hillary for a male candidate over this? No way in hell,\u201d an Iowa Democrat said.\nBut the same Democrat noted: I\u2019m nervous and that\u2019s why I wanted Elizabeth Warren to run. Too late.\u201d\nJeb Bush has some enthusiasm issues.\nRepublicans are split about whether Bush, who is faltering in some national polls, is in trouble. Fifty-four percent of Iowa Republicans say he is, while 43 percent of GOP Granite Staters say the same.\n\u201cThe concern for Bush is not the polls, but the overall lack of relevancy in New Hampshire at this point,\u201d said one GOP Granite Stater.\nSaid an Iowa Republican, \u201cMoney can\u2019t buy him love,\u201d added an Iowa Republican, representing a conservative state that was always going to be a challenge for Bush.\nSeveral noted the rise of Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a relatively moderate candidate who announced recently.\n\u201cThree pillars of the NH GOP establishment \u2014 Tom Rath and Doug and Stella Scamman \u2014 committed to Kasich this week,\u201d another New Hampshire Republican said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to read that as a rejection of Bush.\u201d\nBut the same Republican said Bush has looked good in person. \u201cI saw Jeb at a town hall two weeks ago and he was by far the best I\u2019ve seen him yet. Ads are coming that will remind voters of his mainstream conservative record. And he remains broadly acceptable to the majority of the party. Bush will still be a semi-finalist.\u201d\nThe other half of Republicans surveyed said Bush is doing fine \u2014 for the moment.\n\u201cNot yet [in trouble], as it\u2019s still too early to draw any conclusions,\u201d a New Hampshire Republican said. \u201cBut any notion of inevitability is gone, and he will have to out campaign the rest of the field to win. Thus far I don\u2019t see evidence that he can do that.\u201d\nMany said he is where he needs to be at this relatively early point in the cycle.\n\u201cHis crowds are still solid and his team is quietly building a good caucus organization. It\u2019s August people,\u201d an Iowa Republican said.\nSaid one New Hampshire Republican: The \u201crace is wide open, no doubt. The Kasich movement in past month will get media tongues wagging on this but Jeb Bush is not in trouble.\u201d\nThese are the members of The POLITICO Caucus (not all of whom participated this week):\nIowa: Tim Albrecht, Brad Anderson, Rob Barron, Jeff Boeyink, Bonnie Campbell, Dave Caris, Sam Clovis, Sara Craig, Jerry Crawford, John Davis, Steve Deace, John Deeth, Derek Eadon, Ed Failor Jr., Karen Fesler, David Fischer, Doug Gross, Steve Grubbs, Tim Hagle, Bob Haus, Joe Henry, Drew Ivers, Jill June, Lori Jungling, Jeff Kaufmann, Brian Kennedy, Jake Ketzner, David Kochel, Chris Larimer, Chuck Larson, Jill Latham, Jeff Link, Dave Loebsack, Mark Lucas, Liz Mathis, Jan Michelson, Chad Olsen, David Oman, Matt Paul, Marlys Popma, Troy Price, Christopher Rants, Kim Reem, Craig Robinson, Sam Roecker, David Roederer, Nick Ryan, Tamara Scott, Joni Scotter, Karen Slifka, John Smith, AJ Spiker, Norm Sterzenbach, John Stineman, Matt Strawn, Phil Valenziano, Jessica Vanden Berg, Nate Willems, Eric Woolson, Grant Young\nNew Hampshire: Charlie Arlinghaus, Arnie Arnesen, Patrick Arnold, Rich Ashooh, Dean Barker, Juliana Bergeron, D.J.
