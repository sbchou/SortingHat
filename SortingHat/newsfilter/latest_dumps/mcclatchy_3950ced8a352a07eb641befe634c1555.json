{"body": " Can anyone stop Donald Trump? Or at least get tough with the Republican front-runner?\nEDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM\nWednesday\u2019s Republican debate is a crucial test for the party\u2019s would-be presidents, who have spent the summer largely in the shadow of the outspoken, often polarizing real estate mogul. \nBen Carson, John Kasich and Carly Fiorina have inched out of the pack in recent weeks, but can they demonstrate the gravitas to become serious players? Can Jeb Bush, Rand Paul, Scott Walker and other big names mired in political quicksand climb out? How risky will it be to confront Trump?\nA lot of answers are likely as 11 Republicans gather Wednesday at 8 p.m. EDT at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library for the campaign\u2019s second debate. The others will participate in an earlier debate from 6-7:45 p.m.\nEDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM\nHere\u2019s what the main event\u2019s contenders need to do to stand out:\nDONALD TRUMP\nCan he expand his support? Trump has won the backing support from a solid 30 percent of Republicans in most polls, but huge blocs of other voters view him unfavorably. That\u2019s politically toxic, and Trump needs to show he can expand his constituency. Watch whether he seems more intent on being presidential or being entertaining. Is he more eager to offer policy details or tweetable sound bites?\nBEN CARSON\nCan he come off as presidential? He got good notices from conservatives after the first debate. They appreciated the retired neurosurgeon\u2019s quiet style, deeply felt faith and ability to talk issues in some depth. Carson now needs to show command of the intricacies of national security and economic issues. He also must show that while he has strong, often controversial views on social issues, he\u2019s tolerant and understanding of others.\n\n18% Ben Carson\u2019s showing in the Monmouth University poll Aug. 31-Sept. 2, up 13 points from the pre-August debate poll.\nJOHN KASICH\nWill Republicans welcome his center-right views? The governor of Ohio, one of the last Republicans to enter the race, quickly surged into second place in New Hampshire polls. Many voters appreciated his down-to-earth style and willingness to challenge conservative orthodoxy. Rivals will challenge him on those views, notably his decision to support Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.\nCARLY FIORINA\nCan she continue to shine on national security? The former business executive\u2019s discussion of foreign policy at the August second-tier debate won her strong notices. This time she\u2019s in center court, fresh from being insulted by Trump for her appearance. Will she take him on? Will she stand out?\nJEB BUSH\nCan he energize his campaign? The former Florida governor was supposed to be most viable alternative to Trump, thanks to his family\u2019s political network and his ability to raise big money. He retains strong potential, but so far he has failed to break out of the pack. He needs to forget Trump, show what he stands for, and rally voters looking for a substantive alternative.\n\n6% Jeb Bush\u2019s support among Iowa Republicans in latest NBC-Marist poll, a distant third behind Trump and Carson.\nTED CRUZ\nHow does he separate himself from Trump? No one has been hurt as much as the senator from Texas by Trump\u2019s rise. Cruz has fashioned himself as the sharp-tongued, anti-Washington candidate, but so has Trump. Cruz has been careful not to criticize the front-runner, and confronting him would risk alienating his followers. But how does Cruz distinguish himself?\nMARCO RUBIO\nIs his methodical campaign too patient? Rubio has quietly, steadily built his campaign, figuring that as voters get more serious early next year, they\u2019ll see what a smart, reasonable, telegenic candidate he is. His mission is similar to Bush\u2019s \u2013 break away from the Trump orbit and explain why he should be president.\nRAND PAUL\nWhere is he? Paul\u2019s father rallied a devoted libertarian constituency when he ran in 2012, but his son seems to be doing little with it. Or with anything else. Paul got aggressive in the August debate, but it didn\u2019t get him far. He badly needs to stand out this time, perhaps by championing what he calls more realistic, constitutionally based policies governing foreign affairs.\nCHRIS CHRISTIE\nCan he get noticed? Hard to think the big, blustery governor of New Jersey has been invisible, but he seemed all but forgotten in the last debate. The format is not his friend, since Christie\u2019s plainspoken tough-guy persona can\u2019t break through when it\u2019s only visible for minutes at a time.\n\nThere was one point where I went 20 questions in a row without being asked a question, and that\u2019s hard. Chris Christie discussing the August debate with \u201cTonight Show\u201d host Jimmy Fallon\nMIKE HUCKABEE\nCan he expand his constituency? The former governor of Arkansas has assiduously courted social conservatives, appearing this week with Kentucky court clerk Kim Davis, jailed after she refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Can Huckabee show more mainstream appeal?\nSCOTT WALKER\nCan he demonstrate some depth? Walker\u2019s had a rough summer. His Iowa poll lead not only evaporated, but he fell to 10th place in last week\u2019s Quinnipiac poll. He had three different positions on birthright citizenship in a single week last month. The governor of Wisconsin needs to establish himself as a thoughtful would-be commander in chief.\nDavid Lightman: 202-383-6101, @lightmandavid", "byline": "", "description": "Trump will be center stage\nCan Carson, Fiorina, Kasich maintain momentum?\nBush, Rubio, others need to get noticed\n\u2026\nClick to Continue \u00bb", "title": "GOP debate: Another Trump show or will a new star emerge?", "url": "http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article35184000.html", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Chris Christie", "Kim Davis", "Jeb Bush", "John Kasich", "Donald Trump", "Jimmy Fallon", "David Lightman", "Scott Walker", "Carly Fiorina", "Ben Carson"], "orgs": ["Monmouth University", "Medicaid", "Ronald Reagan Presidential Library", "Marist", "Quinnipiac"], "authors": [{"author_id": 33909, "fullname": "david lightman", "primary_org": "mcclatchy"}], "date_written": "2015-09-14 16:14:42", "org": "mcclatchy", "article_id": "3950ced8a352a07eb641befe634c1555", "date_access": "2015-09-14 16:20:03.277720"}
