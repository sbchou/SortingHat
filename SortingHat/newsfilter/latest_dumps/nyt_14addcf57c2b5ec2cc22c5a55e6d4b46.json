{"body": "Two issues normally confined to the nerdy world of poll analytics may determine the final spots on stage for this week\u2019s Republican debate.\n\nThe ways that Fox News \u2014 which is televising the debate and setting the rules \u2014 resolves the issues could end up keeping Rick Perry from participating. Fox has said the 10 candidates who have fared best in an average of the last five polls released before 5 p.m. Tuesday will be admitted to the debate. It will be held on Thursday night in Cleveland and is the first debate of the nomination campaign.\n\nFor now, Mr. Christie and Mr. Kasich appear to be holding the final two spots, according to our analysis of the polls, with Mr. Perry having fallen to 11th place in the last few days.\n\nFox, which is working with Facebook and the Ohio Republican Party to run the debate, has outlined its rules but has declined to go into precise detail, making it difficult to predict who exactly will be on stage. In particular, the network has not said how it will round polling numbers \u2014 to the nearest percentage point or the nearest tenth of a percentage point. The more that Fox rounds off the number, the greater likelihood of a tie for 10th place \u2014 which could conceivably cause the debate organizers to allow 11 candidates on stage.\n\nBeyond the battle for the final spots, the field appears largely stable. Donald Trump sits atop the polling average \u2014 and has in fact widened his lead over the field \u2014 with Jeb Bush and Scott Walker close behind. A handful of other candidates \u2014 Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz \u2014 occupy a third tier, with a small amount of support but seemingly enough to make the cutoff.\n\nNow let\u2019s look more closely at the two big sources of uncertainty:\n\nBy our estimates, Mr. Kasich leads Mr. Perry by 0.6 percentage points, with 3.4 percent to Mr. Perry\u2019s 2.8 percent. The last five polls come from: Monmouth University, NBC/The Wall Street Journal, Quinnipiac, CNN and ABC/Washington Post.\n\nIf you\u2019re a believer in rounding these numbers to the nearest whole number \u2014 as Mr. Perry surely is these days \u2014 the candidates would be tied at 3 percent and both would be allowed into the debate. Fox has said that in the case of ties, it may allow more than 10 candidates on stage. When we asked the network about its policy on rounding, it said it was not describing its rules in any more detail than it already has.\n\nIf you\u2019re Rick Perry, you could certainly argue that rounding to the nearest whole number is reasonable. With such small gaps among the candidates, a difference of a few tenths of a percentage point is very likely to reflect noise.\n\nRounding to the nearest percentage point would signal the network\u2019s understanding that polling is an a highly imperfect measure and perhaps doesn\u2019t merit the precision of the decimal place.\n\nIf you\u2019re John Kasich, you can mount a counterargument: Yes, you lead by a mere 0.6 percentage points, but that lead is based on the average of the last five polls. In those five polls, you could point out that you beat Mr. Perry in three and matched him in one.\n\nThe whole point of using an average of polls is to reduce the risk that any one decision \u2014 like how one poll weights one group of respondents \u2014 will determine the debate field. By most measures, Mr. Kasich can fairly claim to lead Mr. Perry.\n\nFox\u2019s rules state that the polls \u201cmust be conducted by major, nationally recognized organizations that use standard methodological techniques.\u201d The polling standards of national media organizations typically require surveys to be conducted using live interviews, not so-called robopolls that use automated technology. If Fox adopted such a standard, as most analysts have assumed, it would exclude polls from Rasmussen Reports.\n\nBut there\u2019s reason to wonder whether Fox would exclude Rasmussen, which released a poll on July 30. The network partnered with Pulse Opinion Research, a Rasmussen spinoff, for polling as recently as the 2010 midterm election. The firm, widely considered to be conservative, has a good reputation among Republicans. Scott Rasmussen, a co-founder, makes frequent appearances on the Fox News, although Mr. Rasmussen has since left the firm.\n\nIf Fox included Rasmussen, the 10-candidate field would not change, but Mr. Perry would almost certainly be left out out of the debate, regardless of rounding.\n\nThere are still more than 24 hours before Fox\u2019s Tuesday 5 p.m. Eastern deadline for polls, and most analysts expect at least one more poll to appear. Any new polls could cause these decisions over rounding and Rasmussen to matter more or less \u2014 and to change the candidates most affected. We will be updating this page today and tomorrow.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in the ways that other sources of statistical error could affect the debate field, we\u2019ve written a more in-depth article on that subject. The brief version is that sampling error alone \u2014 the fact that a poll usually does not perfectly capture the opinions of the population it is surveying \u2014 means there is some chance that the wrong mix of candidates will be on stage.", "byline": "KEVIN QUEALY", "description": "For now, John Kasich is in and Rick Perry is out of Thursday\u2019s debate.
