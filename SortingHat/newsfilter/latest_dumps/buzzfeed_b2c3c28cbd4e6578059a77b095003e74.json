Party members had spent much of the weekend, between sessions and in the hotel lobby bar, engaged in a vigorous exchange of opinions about the state of the race. (Things could be better!) Donald Trump was solidifying his lead, Hillary Clinton was losing hers, and the other Democratic candidates, Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley, were making urgent appeals for support as the frontrunner\u2019s sheen of \u201cinevitability\u201d appeared to be fading all over again. There was some panic (Clinton\u2019s emails), some outrage (only six debates!), and speculation all around (Biden?).These updates did not interest Walter F. Mondale.Past the threshold of Salon B, during a meeting of the state\u2019s Senior Caucus, the former vice president recalled his view of a more fundamental era of politics.In a brief speech, Mondale, 87, reminded the hundred or so elderly Democrats in the crowd that, \u201ctogether,\u201d they had pushed to pass Medicare, Medicaid, the Voting Rights Act, and the food stamp program; to create rules against racial discrimination in the Democratic Party and to enact legislation for the environment, fair housing, and school lunches. This was \u201cthe high tide of American history,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are things that we did.\u201dThere was a sense, as Mondale left the Senior Caucus meeting on Saturday, that he was not as impressed with the current state of affairs.In the hallway, when a woman identified herself as a \u201cbig fan from Georgia,\u201d Mondale stopped her. \u201cAh, Georgia! I worked for a guy down there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all praying for him.\u201d His boss in the White House, President Jimmy Carter, announced earlier this month that he would begin treatment, at the age of 90, for cancer in his brain. Mondale was planning a visit next week.\u201cYou know,\u201d he told the Georgia woman, \u201che was so gracious \u2014 compared to these asses running.\u201dThe vice president attended as the DNC\u2019s hometown guest of honor. He is retired but still works out of his law office in downtown Minneapolis. On Friday, during the string of speeches that make up the gathering\u2019s main event, Mondale functioned as party elder: The presidential candidates praised him from the podium, and the delegates rose each time to applaud.The next morning, Mondale continued his tour as weekend statesman. He exchanged more pleasantries with the members of the Senior Caucus: \u201cHow many of you were in the \u201948 campaign?\u201d He navigated the challenges of the digital camera: \u201cPress this one\u2026 Oh, alright, I see\u2026 Zoom in\u2026 We\u2019re zooming\u2026 One, two, three!\u201d And then came several questions.Yes, he supports Hillary. He did during the 2008 campaign, too. (In her speech, she \u201cshowed a lot of fight and spark,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we need.\u201d) And yes, six seems like a fine number of DNC debates. (The Republicans \u201ckeep at \u2019em \u2019til they kill themselves.\u201d)No, this Democratic primary is not like his in 1984. (\u201cIt probably doesn\u2019t have any bearing at all.\u201d) And no, there is not a current analog to Gary Hart, the young senator who challenged Mondale, the presumptive nominee, with a generational campaign of \u201cnew ideas.\u201d (\u201cI don\u2019t see any person out there. It could be Bernie,\u201d he said, then hesitated. \u201cWhat do I say\u2026? I think he\u2019s got an age problem.\u201d A shrug. \u201cI\u2019ve got an age problem.\u201d)Mondale has his own questions. They worry him far more. Would the country continue to be up front, as he said in his speech to the seniors, on \u201cthe great rules of justice and decency\u201d? And when would the low-tide recede \u2014 taking with it the latest \u201casses\u201d of the election cycle?\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that,\u201d Mondale said. \u201cBut at this time when we need our good country to sit down and reason with each other, have a civil tone, an honest look at problems and major answers, and have a good contest \u2014 instead we\u2019re having a yelling contest.\u201d\u201cAnd it really troubles me. Because I don\u2019t remember it being quite this bad before.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton is joined on stage with Mondale during a campaign stop in Minneapolis in February 2008.\nRobyn Beck / AFP / Getty Images\nThese matters have long been a point of dismay for Mondale. In 1992, when Bill Clinton and Ross Perot were making regular appearances on MTV and the talk show circuit, Mondale lamented to the New York Times that, in the old days, \u201cThere was a dignity to running for the presidency.\u201dWhat we have now, Mondale said in Minneapolis, is Trump leading the pack \u2014 but with \u201ca lot of people who seem to be agreeing with him and are still yelling at each other.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very negative, negative, negative, negative every day. You can\u2019t run a country on that.\u201dAnother question on his mind: Where had all the Jimmy Carters gone?Mondale has told \u201ceverybody\u201d he knows to watch the press conference. In Atlanta, Carter told reporters earlier this month about his cancer, faith, and his feeling at \u201cease with whatever comes.\u201d\u201cVery few things have moved me more,\u201d Mondale said.He plans to visit the Carter family next week, bringing with him a recently clipped cartoon from the Minneapolis Star Tribune: The drawing shows the former president \u201cbuilding this home,\u201d said Mondale. The Carters volunteered for decades with Habitat for Humanity. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful house. He\u2019s putting on the last bit. And it says, \u2018Carter, the decent builder, the kind man.\u2019 I think that was one of the great, gracious, courageous, decent things I\u2019ve ever seen a public servant do.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a wonderful thing.\u201dFor Mondale, there is still hope for this presidential campaign. He would like, for instance, to see a woman become president. Clinton, he believes, could do it \u2014 prognostications aside.\u201cThis is the first time in American history \u2014 and that\u2019s a long time \u2014 that a gifted woman has a real chance to be president,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s worth a lot to me.\u201dAnd the email investigation? Would it hurt her?\u201cYou know\u2026\u201d He stopped. \u201cI think if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll quit at this point.\u201d\n", "title": "Walter Mondale Wants To Know: Where Have The Jimmy Carters Gone?", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/walter-mondale-wants-to-know-where-have-the-jimmy-carters-go", "topics": ["personality", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Gary Hart", "Martin O'Malley", "Bill Clinton", "Hillary Clinton", "Walter Mondale", "Donald Trump", "Walter F.
