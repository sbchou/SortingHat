To be a citizen of Mexico is almost impossible.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t be a citizen,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBecause they don\u2019t like WASPs. They don\u2019t like white Anglo-Saxon Protestants, I think. They don\u2019t want me. I don\u2019t think I could become a citizen of Mexico.\u201dTrump has made opposition to illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign, and frequently casts Mexico as a villain in his public comments. He has been accused of racism for saying that Mexico sends rapists and murderers across the border.Though Trump has been showing signs that his momentum might not be what it was over the summer, this wasn\u2019t evident in Oklahoma, where he was greeted by a large crowd of fans on a hot, windless day. He was mobbed as he moved around the fair, shaking hands and answering a few questions from the press (the Pope is a \u201cgreat guy, I think he\u2019s fantastic,\u201d he said, and \u201cI think it\u2019s fine\u201d that he\u2019s been talking about climate change and immigration, something that has drawn criticism from other conservatives). One supporter, Joanna Whipple, an 18-year-old Oklahoma City University student, was \u201cabsolutely\u201d excited because Trump had touched her face, she said later.The crowd reacted with glee to nearly every Trump applause line during a characteristically meandering speech that jumped from birthright citizenship to the Iran deal to Russia\u2019s involvement in Syria and back again, at times repeating points he had made earlier.Trump continued his recent pattern of attacking Marco Rubio, whom he called \u201cone of these real dopes\u201d and, repeatedly, a \u201clightweight\u201d during his speech. He also criticized Rubio\u2019s attendance record in the Senate. The crowd seemed more enthusiastic about his attacks on Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton, though they did not boo his insults to Rubio as attendees of the Values Voter Summit reportedly did on Friday morning.Trump went after the media several times, accusing them of distorting crowd sizes and of being \u201cterrible people.\u201dIn a testament to his popularity among conservatives, Trump was able to make an admission that he \u201cused to be, like, total establishment\u201d and get away with it; Trump frequently slams other candidates for taking money from big donors, but openly admits that he used to be one of those donors.At one point, he brought out Duck Dynasty\u2019s Willie Robertson, who declared, \u201cI do like me some Trump.\u201dAbout 50 minutes after he began, he made his grand exit, leaving the stage to Twisted Sister\u2019s \u201cWe\u2019re Not Gonna Take It.\u201d\n", "title": "Trump: Mexico Doesn't Like WASPs", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/trump-mexico-doesnt-like-wasps", "topics": ["immigration", "mexico"], "people": ["Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Willie Robertson", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Sean Rayford"], "orgs": ["Senate", "Duck Dynasty"], "authors": [{"author_id": 8663, "fullname": "rosie gray", "primary_org": "buzzfeed"}], "date_written": "2015-09-26 03:16:49", "org": "buzzfeed", "article_id": "b64a40ae340fd17b5fed56a8450cd992", "date_access": "2015-09-26 03:17:02.600735"}
