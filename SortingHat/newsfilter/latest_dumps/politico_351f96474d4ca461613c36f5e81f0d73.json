{"body": "AP Photo\nBy Nick Gass\n7/22/15 8:24 AM EDT\nDonald Trump has no regrets about giving out Lindsey Graham\u2019s cellphone number on Tuesday.\nIn fact, Trump said Wednesday, he \u201cdid it for fun.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\nAsked on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d whether he was sorry about sharing the South Carolina senator\u2019s personal number during a campaign event in Graham\u2019s home state, Trump said, \u201cnot at all.\u201d\nTrump referenced Graham calling him a \u201cjackass\u201d during television appearances on CBS and CNN.\n\u201cHe\u2019s got zero in the polls,\u201d Trump declared. \u201cI did it for fun, and everybody had a good time, and we had a packed house. We had a beyond-packed house. We had auditoriums next door that were packed. The place was amazing.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems to have gotten a lot of press,\u201d Trump said. \u201dHe calls me names, you have to fight back.\u201d\nAlso on POLITICO\nDYLAN BYERS\n\u201cI\u2019m a nice person, Trump said, guessing that perhaps people are \u201chaving a field day\u201d at his expense because he has led several recent national polls.\nTrump has super-charged his media presence since saying over the weekend that Sen. John McCain was \u201ca war hero because he was captured,\u201d a remark for which he has never fully apologized.\nThe comments came after he already whipped the Republican presidential field into a frenzy by accusing Mexico of dumping \u201crapists\u201d and drug peddlers into the United States.\nAsked on Wednesday whether he would change his approach as the debates and primary season draw nearer, Trump demurred.\nMore on POLITICO\n\u201cI have to be myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to read teleprompters.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go out and do that,\u201d he added, slamming Florida Jeb. Bush for using a pollster, \u201cbecause that\u2019s not real.\u201d (Trump has hired a pollster, Federal Election Commission reports show.)\nBut who among the 2016 candidates is real?, Trump was asked.\nHis response: \u201cDonald Trump is real.\u201d\nBy ADAM WREN\nBy MATT CAROTENUTO and  KATHERINE LUONGO\nBy REP.
