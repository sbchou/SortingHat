Bernie Sanders, 42 percent to 35 percent \u2014 with Biden, who is mulling entering the race, at 17 percent. But when pollsters asked those favoring Biden to pick their second-choice candidate, the majority of Biden backers flocked to Clinton, who would lead Sanders by 15 points without the vice president in the race.\nStory Continued Below\nThe other Democratic contenders \u2014 former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee \u2014 were at 1 percent or less in either scenario. The poll surveyed 256 Democratic voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 6.1 percentage points.\nOn the Republican side, neurosurgeon Ben Carson has pulled into a tie with real estate magnate Donald Trump. Trump has just a one-point advantage over Carson, 21 percent to 20 percent.\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina are tied for third at 11 percent. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is at 7 percent, Ohio Gov. John Kasich is at 6 percent, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is at 5 percent, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is at 3 percent, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is at 3 percent and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is at 2 percent.\n\n\n\n            By \nEliza Collins\n\nBringing up the rear are former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, both at 1 percent. Failing to earn any support were South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, former New York Gov. George Pataki and former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore. The poll includes interviews with 230 Republican voters, and results for this question carry a margin of error of plus or minus 6.5 percentage points.\nThe poll was conducted Sept. 20-24 for the two media outlets by the Democratic firm Hart Research Associates and the Republican firm Public Opinion Strategies.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Democratic and Republican front-runners are losing their leads.", "title": "Poll: Carson ties Trump, Biden draws from Clinton", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/trump-biden-nbc-poll-carson-clinton-sanders-214108", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "personality"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Joe Biden", "Eliza Collins", "Kyle Cheney", "Rick Santorum", "Richard Nixon", "Kenneth P.
