SHUTDOWN AHEAD? \u2013 In Forbes this a.m., Stan Collender increases odds of a shutdown to 6 percent: \u201cWashington really didn\u2019t need to make it tougher to avoid a government shutdown when the new fiscal year begins on October 1. But the prospects that no deal would happen, which I estimated at 60 percent at the beginning of August, got worse last week when it became clear the White House would have the votes it needed to prevent Congress from stopping the deal it negotiated with Iran.\n\u201cThe Obama administration\u2019s impending win on Iran complicates the already problematical CR debate even further. Because of that, I\u2019m increasing my estimate of the chance of a government shutdown to 67 percent. \u2026 The Iran deal worsens the outlook for a shutdown for two reasons. The first is the amount of time it will take for Congress to debate the issue. \u2026 [T]he second reason for the increasing odds of a shutdown: the continuing resolution will provide those senators and representatives against the deal with a second bite of the disapproval apple.\u201d\nHEAVY AGENDA; LITTLE TIME \u2013 Thorn Run Partners\u2019 Jason Rosenstock in his morning note out later this a.m.: \u201cOn the menu are; funding the federal government, extending the debt limit, reauthorizing the transportation bill, considering the Iran Nuclear Deal, dealing with the annual list of tax extenders that need to be renewed, reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Act, extending child nutrition programs, and potentially renewing the expired Export-Import Bank Charter. \u2026 With only ten legislative days scheduled for September it looks like there will only be time to deal with two of the issues this month. \n\u201cFirst is the Iran Deal, and with both the House and Senate scheduling the debate and vote on the issue for next week \u2026 Second, the conventional wisdom is that the House and Senate will pass a short-term, fairly clean continuing resolution (CR) before the end of the month (and possibly before the Pope arrives on September 24th). .. [I]t likely to be a short-term solution, that will only keep the doors open through the end of the year. This means the second CR may be paired with the need to raise the debt ceiling, or the transportation bill, or tax extenders\u201d \nWAY BACK MACHINE \u2013 No sign of any letup in Trump-mentum but it\u2019s worth remembering that at this time in 2012, Rick Perry had a big lead for the GOP nomination: http://bit.ly/1KXfEF4 \u2026 And at this point in 2008, Hillary Clinton had a big lead on Barack Obama: http://bit.ly/1EP87qD\nBIG WEEK FOR SQUAWK \u2013 CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d kicks off its 20th anniversary celebration with a pile of big guests this week including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Tuesday and Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Wednesday\nICYMI: FED PUZZLE GETS HARDER \u2013 POLITICO\u2019s Ben White: \u201cThe U.S. economy created 173,000 jobs in August and the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 percent, increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve as it meets later this month to decide whether it's finally time to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. \u2026 It's a highly delicate time for the Fed following weeks of market turmoil and central bank officials giving mixed signals on whether they might make a move this month, a decision with profound economic and political ramifications.\n\u201cBut even the jobs report \u2014 which was slightly weaker than expected but showed wages rising and joblessness falling to the lowest level in seven years \u2014 may not give the Fed or markets more clarity. It was not weak enough to force the Fed to wait, or good enough to make a September rate hike an easy call. \u2018The Fed itself clearly doesn\u2019t know what to do in September,\u201d said Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife and John Hancock Asset Management. \u2018I think they were surprised by all this market volatility and that volatility isn\u2019t going anywhere\u2019\u201d \nUNCERTAINTY JAM \u2013 \u201cThe August report was mainly positive with earnings up 0.3 percent and the June and July figures revised up by a total of 44,000. But the labor force shrank by 41,000 in August, helping explain some of the drop in joblessness. This mixed picture will only make the Fed's call more difficult. \u2026 \u2018With something for everybody in the report, this places the Fed in a complex uncertainty jam,' said Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz. \n\u201c\u2018On its own, this report is unlikely to prove decisive for Fed decision makers. It is not strong enough to suggest that the US economy can easily withstand the adverse impact of weaker global growth and financial market volatility; and it is not weak enough to signal a red light for a September rate hike.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/1VJq4v4\nHISTORY WEIGHS ON THE FED \u2013 Pantheon\u2019s Ian Shepherdson: \u201cIf the current rate of decline continues \u2014 and betting against the trend has been a huge mistake for the past four years \u2014 the headline unemployment rate will be just 4.25 percent a year a from now. And the broad rate, U6, will be just 8.5 percent. The last time U6 was at that rate and still falling, the fed funds rate was at 4 percent and rising, and the Fed\u2019s discretionary balance sheet was zero. It would be reasonable to assume, by any historical yardstick, that the Fed does not want the labor market to reach this position with monetary policy on current settings. \n\u201cGiven that policy changes work with long and variable lags, it is hard to find an explanation in the data, with the exception of the current inflation numbers, for the Fed\u2019s failure to have raised rates already. The slow growth of wages is part of the story, but not all of it: At the time of the first rate hike in June 2004, the year-over-year rate of growth of hourly earnings was believed to be 2.2 percent exactly the rate recorded in August.\u201d\nKRUGMAN HEARTS TRUMP (SORT OF) \u2013 NYT\u2019s Paul Krugman: \u201cMr. Bush has chosen to attack Mr. Trump as a false conservative, a proposition that is supposedly demonstrated by his deviations from current Republican economic orthodoxy: his willingness to raise taxes on the rich, his positive words about universal health care. And that tells you a lot about the dire state of the G.O.P. For the issues the Bush campaign is using to attack its unexpected nemesis are precisely the issues on which Mr. Trump happens to be right, and the Republican establishment has been proved utterly wrong.\n\u201cAnd here\u2019s what\u2019s interesting: all indications are that Mr. Bush\u2019s attacks on Mr. Trump are falling flat, because the Republican base doesn\u2019t actually share the Republican establishment\u2019s economic delusions. The thing is, we didn\u2019t really know that until Mr. Trump came along. The influence of big-money donors meant that nobody could make a serious play for the G.O.P. nomination without pledging allegiance to supply-side doctrine, and this allowed the establishment to imagine that ordinary voters shared its antipopulist creed\u201d http://nyti.ms/1K34Ynu\nGOOD TUESDAY MORNING \u2013 Welcome back!

With concerns about China\u2019s outlook helping trigger the biggest monthly sell-off in global stocks in more than three years in August, a gathering of Group of 20 finance chiefs Friday and Saturday focused on China\u2019s efforts to shore up its economy. People\u2019s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said in a statement that the rout in Chinese equities is close to ending, and that state intervention prevented systemic risk and stopped a free-fall.\u201d http://bloom.bg/1isNpmG\nBANK SHARES PUNISHED \u2013 WSJ\u2019s Corrie Driebusch and Saumya Vaishampayan: \u201cThe late-summer market tumult has taken a hefty toll on bank shares, the latest sign of the uncertainty plaguing investments that are expected to benefit from rising interest rates. The financial sector was one of the U.S. stock market\u2019s hottest sectors through the second-quarter earnings season in July, as investors wagered that a Federal Reserve rate increase as soon as this month would open a period of increasing profits for banks, brokerages and insurers.\n\u201cBut the intense market volatility kicked off by China\u2019s decision Aug. 11 to devalue its currency, the yuan, has punished bank shareholders with large price declines and unusual intraday swings. Many portfolio managers are steering clear of the sector despite lower prices, saying they would prefer to wait for signs that volatility is abating. \u2026 Many analysts and traders say U.S. stocks are unlikely to post a broad, durable recovery from the recent tumult without gains in financial shares. Given banks\u2019 critical role in allocating capital to the economy, if they aren\u2019t prospering as a result of healthy loan demand, other sectors are likely to be struggling as well, the analysts reason\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1PXXIJH\nWILL LABOR RALLY TO BIDEN? \u2013 POLITICO\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere and Brian Mahoney in Pittsburgh: \u201cIf Joe Biden runs for president, he can count on the kind of union workers who came here to march next to him on Labor Day: white, ethnic, from families that have been paying local chapter dues for generations. The problem for Biden: there are fewer and fewer of those union workers left, here or anywhere else. It\u2019s a movement now that\u2019s less male and far less Italian, Polish, or Irish than when Biden got started in politics in the 1970s. It\u2019s one that cares about immigration reform as much as trade. And it\u2019s one that\u2019s highly conflicted about a potential contest between the vice president and Hillary Clinton.\n\u201cBiden rallied this industrial crowd by talking about his roots, the need for labor to build the middle class, and the longest walk up the stairs any father ever has to make to tell his family he\u2019s lost his job. \u2018I\u2019m mad. I\u2019m angry. These are the people I grew up with,\u2019 Biden said, criticizing Republican policies that he says have hurt labor nationwide.But thinking about union workers as the kind of people he grew up with in the 1940s is outdated, and that\u2019s something Biden will struggle with if he runs for president.\u201d http://politi.co/1i8ICHc\nWELCOME TO FALL \u2013 NYT\u2019s Jennifer Steinhauer: \u201cWhen Congress returns for business on Tuesday, lawmakers have scheduled a mere 12 legislative days to find a bipartisan compromise to keep the government open, vote on one of the most contentious foreign policy matters in a generation, reconcile the future of funding for Planned Parenthood and roll out the red carpet \u2014 and a few thousand folding chairs \u2014 to greet Pope Francis. What could go wrong?\u201d http://nyti.ms/1K21FIN\nCOMMODITIES SLUMP HITS GLENCORE \u2013 FT\u2019s Neil Hume and David Sheppard in Singapore, and Michael Pooler in London: \u201cGlencore announced plans to slash its $30bn debt pile by shelving dividends, selling assets and raising fresh equity, as the mining and metals behemoth wrestles with a slump in commodities that has battered its share price. \u2026 The debt plan underscores the huge pain being inflicted on the mining sector by China\u2019s economic slowdown, which has driven the price of industrial commodities such as coal and copper to six-year lows.\n\u201cBut investor concerns over Glencore\u2019s large debt load and high exposure to copper relative to peers mean its shares have fallen even further than rivals such as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto this year. It is a humbling moment for Ivan Glasenberg, the daring dealmaker who transformed Glencore into a metals and mining behemoth, raising $60bn in a stock market flotation four years ago and acquiring miner Xstrata in 2013, a move that turned it into one of the world\u2019s largest natural resources groups\u201d http://on.ft.com/1KXiLwL\nBofA PUSHES TO KEEP MOYNIHAN AS CHAIR \u2013 WSJ\u2019s Christina Rexrode and Joann S. Lublin: \u201cStung by a wave of investor criticism, Bank of America Corp. is stepping up efforts to convince shareholders that Chief Executive Brian Moynihan should remain chairman. The Charlotte, N.C., bank agreed to a Sept. 22 vote on the issue after its decision to combine the two roles last October stirred up resentment among investors. The move to make Mr. Moynihan chairman reversed a bylaw that was approved by shareholders in 2009. \n\u201cActivist institutional investors and major proxy advisers are lining up against the way the board made Mr. Moynihan chairman, arguing the bank\u2019s board overstepped its authority and needs to work to regain shareholder trust. In response, Bank of America is trying to marshal support. The bank\u2019s head of strategy and marketing, Anne Finucane, General Counsel Gary Lynch and Jack Bovender, the board\u2019s lead independent director, have been speaking with big investors on the phone and in meetings at some investors\u2019 New York offices. In addition, the bank has hired two outside firms to dial up individual investors.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1i8Xkh8\nALSO FOR YOUR RADAR \u2013\nTIME TO RETHINK RULE 48? \u2013 NYPost\u2019s Jonathan M. Trugman: \u201cThe NYSE has had investors baffled and confused during these past few weeks of wild volatility with its use of Rule 48. The little-known rule, which was passed in 2007, permits specialists or \u2018market makers,\u2019 as they prefer to call themselves today, to open a stock very quickly during periods of \u2018extreme market volatility\u2019 without even indicating a price.\nThis ruling cost many investors lots of money, as they unknowingly sold their stock into the hands of the Wolves of Wall Street at unnecessarily low prices. \n\u201cBut it did let the market open earlier (and more quickly, presumably), but for the benefit of whom? The primary problem with Rule 48 is that it removes the indication of a stock\u2019s opening price range in the most volatile of times for all investors except the specialists/market makers. A need for some adult supervision is evident when Johnson & Johnson, among the bluest of blue-chip stocks, closes at $95.56 on the Friday prior to the Monday 1,000-point crash and opens down at $81.79 that Monday morning, only to take off later and close almost $10 higher, at more than $91.\u201d http://bit.ly/1UxlkeZ\nHOUSING WON\u2019T LEAD TO FAST GROWTH \u2013 WSJ\u2019s Kris Hudson and Nick Timiraos: \u201cThe U.S. housing market dragged the economy into a deep recession nearly eight years ago. Could it now insulate the domestic expansion during a fragile period of global growth? Recent numbers look promising, but several obstacles \u2014 including shifts in where young households want to live, their capacity to take on debt and rising costs for home builders \u2014 suggest the sector won\u2019t soon offer breakout growth. First, the good news: New foreclosures have dropped to precrisis levels and sales of previously owned homes \u2014 the bulk of the market \u2014 have climbed to the pace of the early 2000s. \n\u201cRising housing prices have made homeowners feel better about spending on their homes. The problem: Housing still isn\u2019t contributing much to overall economic growth because new construction of single-family homes, which packs an outsize economic punch, is stuck near levels hit during the early 1990s recession. Initially, construction collapsed due to falling demand. Now, it faces a second headwind: Supply constraints have emerged as more people want to live in cities and construction costs have risen, while demand remains stubbornly weak at the entry level.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1KXihGM\nSUBPRIME IS BACK \u2013 FT\u2019s Joe Rennison and Anna Nicolaou: \u201cFor \u2018subprime\u2019, read \u2018non-prime\u2019. Yield-hungry investors are ready to endorse a revival of bonds backed by riskier US residential mortgages, as lenders warm to house buyers who do not meet strict borrowing guidelines introduced after the financial crisis. But the now toxic label of subprime mortgages has been dropped. Instead, Angel Oak Capital is in the process of pricing a deal for a bond offering of so-called \u2018non-prime mortgages\u2019 \u2014 a term funds are using to describe mortgages that do not meet government standards. Lone Star Funds completed a deal worth $72m\u201d http://on.ft.com/1JPIG7v\nFIRST LOOK: GSE BAILOUTS, 7 YEARS LATER \u2013 American Action Forum has new research out today that \u201cgoes through how much taxpayers injected into the GSEs, the amount of dividend payments made to Treasury, whether the taxpayer has been repaid, and what the future holds for the companies\u201d http://bit.ly/1UDryEL\n** A message from the Consumer Bankers Association:Since 1919, we have served as the voice of retail banking in Washington.
