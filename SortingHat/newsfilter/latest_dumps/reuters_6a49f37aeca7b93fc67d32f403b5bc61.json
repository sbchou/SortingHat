{"body": "* Valeant sinks after Citron report, drags Allergan\n* GM, Boeing rise after strong results\n* Ferrari up on debut\n* Dow down 0.3 pct, S&P down 0.6 pct, Nasdaq down 0.8 pct\n\n (Adds eBay up after the bell, Community Health down, latest\nvolume)\nBy Caroline Valetkevitch\nOct 21 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday as a sharp\ndrop in Valeant Pharmaceuticals hit the healthcare space, while\nthe energy sector dropped along with oil prices.\nValeant Pharmaceuticals' U.S.-listed shares plunged\nto an intraday low of $88.50 on record volume after a\nshort-seller accused the company of using specialty pharmacies\nto inflate its revenue.\nThe company denied the allegation, and later investor Bill\nAckman said he increased his Valeant stake by about 2 million\nshares. The stock pared losses to end down 19.2 percent at\n$118.61, still its lowest level since October 2014. It lost\nabout $9.6 billion in market capitalization.\nThe news also dragged down shares of other healthcare names\nincluding Allergan, down 1.7 percent at $259, and Endo\nInternational, down 13.3 percent at $54.46, though both\ncompanies tried to ease concerns about their use of specialty\npharmacies.\nAlso in the healthcare space, insurers Aetna, Humana\n, Anthem and Cigna all fell at least 3\npercent after Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\nsaid she had \"serious concerns\" about the mergers the companies\nwere proposing.\nA drop in crude oil prices weighed on the S&P 500 energy\nsector, which fell 1 percent. That led sector declines\nfor the S&P 500, followed by materials, down 0.9\npercent, and S&P health care, also down 0.9 percent.\n\"Oil inventories were up quite a bit, so energy was down and\nthat weighed down the market early. Going into the afternoon,\nthe buyers were just lined up to watch as we drifted lower into\nthe the close,\" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at\nBB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 48.5 points, or\n0.28 percent, to 17,168.61, the S&P 500 lost 11.83\npoints, or 0.58 percent, to 2,018.94 and the Nasdaq Composite\n dropped 40.86 points, or 0.84 percent, to 4,840.12.\nAdding to the negative tone, Yahoo shares fell 5.2\npercent to $31.12, a day after the Internet company's quarterly\nearnings and profit missed expectations.\nOn the plus side, shares of General Motors rose 5.8\npercent to $35.42, while Boeing rose 1.7 percent to\n$141.19, after both industry heavyweights reported\nbetter-than-expected results.\nFerrari was up 5.8 percent at $55 in its debut on\nthe New York Stock Exchange.\nStocks have mostly gained this month following a sharp\nselloff in the third quarter. The S&P 500 is up more than 5\npercent for the month so far.\nAfter the bell, shares of eBay rose 8.4 percent to\n$26.25 following its results, while shares of Community Health\nSystems dropped 15.3 percent to $34.35 after a\ndisappointing outlook. Other hospital operator shares also fell\nafter the bell.\nDuring the session, declining issues outnumbered advancing\nones on the NYSE by 2,173 to 888, for a 2.45-to-1 ratio on the\ndownside; on the Nasdaq, 2,066 issues fell and 717 advanced for\na 2.88-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.\nThe S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and five new lows;\nthe Nasdaq recorded 52 new highs and 82 new lows.\nAbout 6.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges,\ncompared with the 7.3 billion daily average for the past 20\ntrading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.  \n\n (Editing by Don Sebastian, Chizu Nomiyama and Bernard Orr)", "byline": "", "description": "* Dow down 0.3 pct, S&P down 0.6 pct, Nasdaq down 0.8 pct (Adds eBay up after the bell, Community Health down, latest volume)", "title": "US STOCKS-Wall St declines; Valeant, healthcare weigh", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/companyNews/~3/s5qiBWCsdfw/story01.htm", "topics": ["other", "economy"], "people": ["Caroline Valetkevitch", "Bernard Orr", "Hillary Clinton", "Bucky Hellwig"], "orgs": ["BB&T Wealth Management", "S&P", "New York Stock Exchange", "Aetna", "Cigna", "General Motors", "Humana"], "authors": [{"author_id": 33346, "fullname": "reuters editorial", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-10-21 23:33:11", "org": "reuters", "article_id": "6a49f37aeca7b93fc67d32f403b5bc61", "date_access": "2015-10-21 23:13:38.022156"}
