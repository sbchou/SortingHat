Our research shows college degrees don\u2019t matter in politics.\n\n            By \n                    Nicholas Carnes\n             and \n                    Noam Lupu\n\nNext week, Scott Walker is expected to announce that he\u2019s running for\r\npresident. When he does, he\u2019ll give voters a decision many have never faced in\r\ntheir lifetimes: should you vote for someone without a college degree for\r\nPresident of the United States?\n\r\n\r\nThese days it\u2019s rare for someone without a college diploma to get\r\npicked for an internship, let alone stand for the highest office in the country.\r\nWalker\u2019s opponents have sparkling resumes from college and beyond: Jeb Bush\r\ngraduated Phi Beta Kappa, Marco Rubio has an honors law degree, Ted Cruz went\r\nto Princeton and then Harvard Law School, Hillary Clinton\u2019s law degree is from\r\nYale.\n\r\n\r\nWalker\u2019s last degree, on the other hand, came from Delavan-Darien High\r\nSchool. Throughout his career, Walker\u2019s opponents have often pounced on this\r\naspect of his biography. In February, Howard Dean called Walker \u201cunknowledgeable\u201d\r\nand questioned, \u201cHow well-educated is this guy?\u201d In May, John Morgan\u2014an\r\ninfluential Democratic campaign donor\u2014put the case against Walker even more bluntly:\r\n\u201cWe just cannot have a dumb\r\nshit as president.\u201d\n\r\n\r\nAs the campaign wears on, voters are going to hear a lot more about the\r\nfact that Walker didn\u2019t finish college. Should they care?\n\r\n\r\nWe recently completed the largest study to look directly at this\r\nquestion\u2014does having a college degree matter for politicians?\u2014and the answer is,\r\nwe don\u2019t think so. (You can download the study here.)\n\nIT\u2019S EASY TO understand why so\r\nmany pundits assume that candidates without college degrees are less qualified.\r\nIn the general public, college is an important commodity, and people with\r\ncollege degrees tend to earn higher incomes and participate in civic life more.\r\nBut when it comes to holding office\u2014which requires skills that aren\u2019t taught in\r\na college classroom\u2014a college degree isn\u2019t a guarantee that a candidate knows\r\nwhat he or she is doing. And the leaders who make it into office despite not\r\nhaving a college diploma tend to do just fine. When we examined hard data on how\r\npoliticians with and without college degrees actually perform in office, on\r\naverage, we didn\u2019t find any real differences between leaders who finished college\r\nand leaders who didn\u2019t.\n\r\n\r\nOur research relied on several large datasets on the educational\r\nbackgrounds of politicians. Most of our analysis focused on a dataset\r\nwith information about every national executive in the world who served between\r\n1875 and 2004. We\u2019ve also looked at data on the\r\nmembers of Congress who served from 1901 to 1996 (there was only one US\r\nPresident without a college degree during that time) and data from Brazil,\r\nwhere the national government conducts one of the world\u2019s best anti-corruption audits.\n\r\n\r\nIn our research, we looked at outcomes that most voters care about:\r\neconomic growth, unemployment, inflation, how often major labor strikes happen,\r\nhow often the country initiates a new military conflict, economic inequality,\r\nand so on. Obviously, politicians can\u2019t control all of these things. But if\r\nleaders with college degrees really are better, then countries with\r\ncollege-educated national executives should tend to perform better on some of\r\nthese measures.\n\r\n\r\nBut they don\u2019t. Other things equal, countries with college-educated\r\nleaders and countries led by politicians who didn\u2019t finish college have similar\r\nrates of economic growth, similar unemployment rates, similar inflation rates,\r\nsimilar numbers of wars and major work stoppages, and similar levels of income\r\ninequality. When it comes to major social outcomes that voters care about, it\r\njust doesn\u2019t seem to matter whether a country\u2019s national executive has a college\r\ndiploma.\n\r\n\r\nThe same was true when we looked at an innovative anti-corruption\r\nprogram in Brazil. Every year since 2003, an anti-corruption office in Brazil\u2019s\r\nfederal government has randomly selected 250 municipalities and extensively\r\naudited how they spend their money. We looked at the data, and corruption\r\nappears to be just as common in cities run by college-educated mayors as it is\r\nin cities whose mayors didn\u2019t finish college.\n\r\n\r\nEven in the US Congress, a college diploma doesn\u2019t seem to signify\r\nanything special. Throughout the 20th century, members of Congress who didn\u2019t\r\nhave college degrees introduced just as many successful bills as their\r\ncolleagues who had college diplomas. They didn\u2019t suffer with voters, either: they won just as many votes on average,\r\nand were just as likely to get reelected. Despite our best efforts, our\r\nresearch didn\u2019t turn up any performance measure that favored college-educated legislators.\r\nOnce someone without a college degree gets to Congress, they tend to do just\r\nfine.\nAnd that's probably\u00a0the key\r\nto understanding why politicians without college degrees tend to perform just as well: even without a college\r\ndegree, these are people who wound\r\nup as leaders. By definition, they have more in common with a college dropout\r\nlike Bill Gates than a typical college dropout. Getting into public office in\r\nmost places is a gauntlet\u2014especially here in the US\u2014and the only people who usually\r\nmake it through are brilliant workaholics who can stomach a lot of mud.\n\r\n\r\nIn the general public, people with college degrees tend to be more\r\nskilled and tend to make more money, but political candidates aren\u2019t the general public. They\u2019re a\r\nvetted, screened, battered subset of the rest of us. Among the people who make\r\nit into that pool, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019ve got a college degree.\r\nYou\u2019ve proven yourself in other ways.\nSCOTT WALKER IS a case in point. He enrolled at Marquette University in\r\n1986. He was actively involved in campus politics, and he made okay grades.\r\nDuring his junior year, he lost a race for student body president and he got a\r\njob offer from the American Red Cross, so he left Marquette (\u201cin good\r\nstanding,\u201d his supporters often note). He planned to go back and complete his\r\ndegree, but he got sucked into a whirlwind political career, and he never found\r\nthe time to finish up.\n\r\n\r\nIf Walker had stuck around and finished his college degree, would he be\r\na different governor today? A different presidential candidate? Would another\r\nyear of schooling have made him better at winning elections or passing laws?\r\nWould two more semesters have changed his political outlook? Probably not.\n\r\n\r\nMost politicians don\u2019t learn what they know about governing in college.\r\nThey learn how to lead the way most people really\r\nlearn to do their jobs: by doing their jobs. College teaches students a\r\nlot, but holding office is a massively-specialized occupation, and no one\r\nlearns how to do it by taking classes. They learn how to do it by doing it.\n\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t to say that college is worthless. As university professors,\r\nwe get to see first-hand how a high-quality college education can change someone\u2019s\r\nlife.\u00a0 But we don\u2019t kid ourselves that\r\nour students are ready to be President the minute they graduate\u2014or that they\u2019re\r\nthe only people in the country who are qualified to hold office.\n\r\n\r\nIn many ways, Scott Walker\u2019s college experience isn\u2019t all that remarkable.\r\nLots of successful people left college early to start their careers: Harry\r\nTruman, Karl Rove, Mark Zuckerberg. If you met someone at a party who told you\r\nhe left college a year early, his career took off in a major way, and he just\r\nnever found the time to finish up, you probably wouldn\u2019t think much of it. We\r\nall know there\u2019s a lot more to a person than whether they have a fancy diploma\r\nhanging on their wall.\n\r\n\r\nThe same is true for politicians. When voters hear that Scott Walker\u2014or\r\nany politician\u2014didn\u2019t finish college, they probably shouldn\u2019t make too much of\r\nit. They should listen to the person\u2019s ideas, they should look at the person\u2019s\r\ntrack record, but they shouldn\u2019t get too hung up on the college part.\n\r\n\r\nShould you vote for someone without a college degree for President of\r\nthe United States? If you think they\u2019re the best candidate, why wouldn\u2019t you?\nNoam\r\nLupu is an Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of\r\nWisconsin-Madison and the author of \u201cParty\r\nBrands in Crisis\u201d (forthcoming with Cambridge\r\nUniversity Press).
