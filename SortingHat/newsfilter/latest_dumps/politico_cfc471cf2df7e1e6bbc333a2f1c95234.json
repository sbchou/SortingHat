Actually\r\nwe looked at the words: What did candidates actually talk about? How much did\r\nthey talk, and for how long? The answers give us three new ways to think about what\r\nmattered in the debate, and who won.\n1.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t all about\r\nTrump, but it was primarily about Trump\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing that we noticed was that Trump was clearly the\r\ncenter of attention. This is reflected in both the number of words he spoke\r\nduring the debate, which represents how much of the debate he controlled, and\r\nthe number of turns he was given to speak, which shows how often the moderators\r\ngave him control of the floor. Trump uttered almost twice as many words as\r\ndebate champion Ted Cruz, or noted filibusterer Rand Paul. He was also the only\r\ncandidate to speak more than any of the moderators.\n\r\n\r\nIn terms of the number of the number of times they were given\r\nthe floor, the moderators gave the most attention to Trump (26 times), Paul\r\n(21), Christie (17) and Bush (11). Trump alone got more than one-fifth of all the\r\nturns to speak. Paul got almost as many turns to speak as Trump (26 vs. 21),\r\nthough he said fewer words; this seems to reflect the fact that many of Paul\u2019s\r\nturns to speak came from him aggressively inserting himself in shorter\r\nresponses and back-and-forth arguments with other candidates, such as his testy\r\nexchange with Chris Christie.\n\n2. Megyn talked about\r\nScott. Scott talked about Hillary.\n\r\n\r\nIn some ways politics is like the junior-high cafeteria: You\r\ncan tell who counts by who gets talked about. So we also looked at who\r\nmentioned whom throughout the debate. All three moderators mentioned Trump by\r\nname more than any of the other candidates on the stage, with Chris Wallace\r\ngiving the most attention to Trump. Megyn Kelly mentioned Trump the least of\r\nthe moderators\u2014although her interactions were arguably the most\r\nmemorable.\nThe network graph here\u00a0shows who talked about\r\nwhom.\nClick for network graph of the GOP debate.\nIt also reveals that some of the most mentioned figures in the debate\r\nweren\u2019t there at all. A number of candidates mentioned Hillary Clinton, with\r\nScott Walker mentioning her the most of any of the other candidates. President\r\nBarack Obama was also mentioned a number of times throughout the debate; the\r\ngraph shows Cruz, Paul, and Bush all bringing him up.\n3. Trump really likes to\r\ntalk about Trump\nThe \u201cword clouds\u201d here are another way to see what candidates\r\ncare about. The size of the word indicates the proportion of the time that it\r\nwas used, and the first thing we noticed is that Trump was a little different\r\nfrom the other candidates.\nIn fact, he was so different that we gave him his own word\r\ncloud. In his word cloud, he takes center stage: his most commonly used words are\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve.\u201d (Other candidates tended to put much more emphasis on\r\n\u201cpeople.\u201d) Trump used \u201cI\u201d more than three times as often as he used the pronoun\r\n\u201cwe\u201d\u2014and no other candidate came close to this ratio. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul\r\ncame the closest, using \u201cI\u201d a little less than twice as often as \u201cwe.\u201d\nSome words in Trump\u2019s word cloud are absent from\r\nthose of the other nine candidates\u2014\u201cstupid,\u201d \u201cbankrupt\u201d and \u201cMexico.\u201d This\r\ndoes not mean that other candidates didn\u2019t use these words, just that Trump\u2019s\r\nemphasis on them was much higher. These reflect Trump\u2019s\r\ncampaign emphasis\u2014securing the border and the stupidity of others\u2014and also the\r\nspecific questions leveled by the Fox News moderators about his past business\r\nand political dealings.\n\nHow do we define winning?\n\r\n\r\nSome commentators have suggested that Rubio, Carson or even\r\nFiorina (who participated in the early debate) may have had the best debate\r\nperformance. Other commentators have specifically suggested that this debate\r\nmay have finally sunk Trump\u2019s campaign. If the goal was to be the center of\r\nattention at the debate, however, Trump clearly achieved it. Primarily because\r\nof the moderators, Trump was able to keep the debate focused on what seems to\r\nbe his favorite subject: himself.\nLazer Lab team:\u00a0David Lazer\u00a0is Distinguished Professor of Political Science and\r\nComputer and Information Science at\u00a0Northeastern\r\nUniversity,\u00a0Visiting Scholar at the\r\nHarvard Kennedy School, and founder of\u00a0Volunteer\r\nScience.\u00a0Oren Tsur\u00a0is a postdoctoral fellow in computational social\r\nscience and natural language processing at Northeastern University and Harvard\r\nUniversity.\u00a0Katherine\r\nOgnyanova\u00a0is a postdoctoral fellow\r\nin computational social science and network science at\u00a0 Northeastern\r\nUniversity and Harvard University.
