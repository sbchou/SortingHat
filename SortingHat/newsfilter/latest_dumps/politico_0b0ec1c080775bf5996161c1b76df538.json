But with only seven legislative work days until Sept. 30, when the government runs out of money, leaders want to ensure they have the ability to bring any bill to the floor quickly to avoid a shutdown.\nDemocrats are already protesting the move. House Democrats asked for a recorded vote on Thursday to draw attention to the move. The vote will need to pass the House with Republican votes only, sources say. \nThe request for \"martial law\" underscores the tight deadline Boehner faces. Next week will be dominated by Pope Francis\u2019 appearance in the Capitol. \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "House wants 'martial law' power to pass spending bill", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/house-martial-law-authority-213790", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "personality", "trade"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Lauren Gardner", "David Kendall", "Kevin Robillard", "Kate Bennett", "Hadas Gold", "Elvis Presley", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "Marc Caputo", "Tim Starks", "Ted Cruz", "Ben White", "Chris Christie", "Connie Milstein", "Jenny Hopkinson", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Theodoric Meyer", "Josh Gerstein", "Annie Karni", "Donald Trump", "James Panichi", "Brianna Ehley", "Xi Jinping", "Jeff Flake", "Nick Gass", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Toby Eckert", "Seung Min Kim", "Jeremy Herb", "Pope Francis", "Jake Sherman", "Barack Obama", "Paul Ryan", "Eric Wolff", "Lauren French", "Carly Fiorina", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Adam Sneed", "Adam Behsudi", "Jennifer Haberkorn", "Daniel Strauss", "Todd S.
