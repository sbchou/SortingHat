{"body": "\nUpdated, 12:55 p.m. | \nWhile trying to soothe feelings among Hispanics for use of the term \u201canchor babies,\u201d former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida appears to have offended some in the Asian-American community. \n\nMr. Bush said on Monday that it was \u201cludicrous\u201d to suggest that he was using a slur to talk about Hispanics when discussing birthright citizenship. He went on to explain that he was largely referring to people from Asian countries who sneak into the United States planning to give birth.\n\n\u201cNo matter which ethnic group you\u2019re referring to, \u2018anchor babies\u2019 is a slur that stigmatizes children from birth,\u201d said Representative Judy Chu, a California Democrat, who was the first Chinese-American elected to Congress. \u201cAll that is accomplished through talk of anchor babies \u2014 be they from Latin America, Asia, Europe or Africa \u2014 is to use xenophobic fears to further isolate immigrants.\u201d\n\nMr. Bush also drew attention from the Alliance for Citizenship group, which said he was wrong to use language that has been popularized by his rival, Donald J. Trump.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t pander to Latinos in one breath and then insult Asians and Asian-Pacific Americans in the next,\u201d said Dawn Le, a spokeswoman for the group. \u201cJeb\u2019s remarks suggest how he might lead as president \u2014 by following Donald Trump down to the bottom of the barrel.\u201d\n\nAlthough Mr. Bush has said his plans for immigration differ vastly from what has been proposed by Mr. Trump, he did echo the billionaire tycoon in calling for people to \u201cchill out\u201d when it comes to political correctness and at a town hall in Colorado on Tuesday he defended his record and tone on immigration.\n\n\u201cI was talking about a very narrow casted system of fraud, where people are bringing pregnant women in to have babies, to give birthright citizenship,\u201d Mr. Bush said when asked if he was scapegoating the Asian immigrant community. \u201cI support birth right citizenship, by the way.\u201d\n\nHappy to stir the pot, Mr. Trump took to Twitter to say that Mr. Bush had made a mess of the matter. \n\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2015\n\n", "byline": "ALAN RAPPEPORT", "description": "A Democratic Chinese-American congresswoman from California and the Alliance for Citizenship group took exception to Jeb Bush\u2019s language in discussing immigration, saying it follows down the path of Donald J.
