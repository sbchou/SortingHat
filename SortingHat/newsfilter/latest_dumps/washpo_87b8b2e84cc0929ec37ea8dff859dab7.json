{"body": "THERE IN Quicken Loans Arena, the home of Cleveland hoops, the mood often turned indeed cavalier at Thursday\u2019s title-card GOP debate, as shots were fired faster than a LeBron-in-the-lane scoring spree. Kicking off with a 10-minute build-up worthy of another three-letter moniker \u2014 the WWE \u2014 the event sometimes felt more like not verbal basketball, but rather like a 10-contender heavyweight bout, plus a seven-candidate under-card. And Donald \u201cWomen\u2019s Glib\u201d Trump was happy to play both hero and villain, as long as the spotlight stayed warm and the mic stayed hot. Elsewhere, contenders Christie and Paul aimed to land some hard jabs; Ted Cruz (a true student of the \u201csweet science\u201d of debating) was trying to score technical points in a brawl; Marco Rubio was fleet on his feats; and for most of the bout, Ben Carson was\u00a0the\u00a0near-silent ring doctor, till even he jumped in for a late haymaker. Meanwhile, local favorite John \u201cKid Cleveland\u201d Kasich somehow seemed to emerge unscathed.
