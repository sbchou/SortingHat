{"body": "   Hillary Clinton announces her opposition to Keystone at a Des Moines elementary school yesterday. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)  THE BIG IDEA: Clinton\u2019s\u00a0change of heart is\u00a0about more than pandering to the Democratic base. Hillary Clinton\u2019s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, proclaimed just last month that it would be irresponsible for the Democratic frontrunner to weigh in on the Keystone XL pipeline before the State Department finishes its review.\u00a0\u201cHaving the experience of being a former Secretary of State distinguishes her and her candidacy, but it comes with responsibilities that can at times limit her,\u201d Palmieri said. \u201cBut we know the experience is well worth whatever price she may politically.\u201d \u2014 The supposedly sacrosanct review process continues, but Clinton yesterday announced that she\u2019s against the pipeline,\u00a0explaining she\u2019s impatient with its length\u00a0and has a \u201cresponsibility\u201d to speak out. The statement comes as Clinton\u2019s poll numbers \u00a0continue to slip and her vulnerability makes\u00a0Joe Biden more likely to enter\u00a0the race.\u00a0The revelation, made late yesterday afternoon, was almost certainly timed to get buried behind Pope Francis\u2019 visit. The Post, Times and Journal are\u00a0each\u00a0running\u00a0the Keystone\u00a0story\u00a0inside\u00a0the\u00a0A-section. Keystone has become a litmus test in both parties. The general public wants the pipeline by a more than two-to-one margin. So do unions, concerned more about jobs than the environment. But the donor class and liberals are stridently against it. The\u00a0issue is\u00a0a flashpoint in the Democratic\u00a0contest \u2014 Clinton gets asked about it constantly on the trail and at fundraisers. Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley are both unabashedly against Keystone and\u00a0say so in their stump speeches. \u2014\u00a0There\u2019s something more significant going on than just answering to the Democratic base. This year more than ever, voters hate politicians who triangulate and constantly recalibrate. It\u2019s\u00a0one of the main reasons that Scott Walker collapsed, as we discussed here yesterday. Most of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters disagree with him on major issues, but they\u2019re okay with it because he says what he thinks and doesn\u2019t come across as focus-grouped.\u00a0This mentality makes it harder for other candidates to get away without taking a firm position on major issues. For better and worse, base voters in both parties have little patience for nuance and non-answers. \u2014 Like on so many other issues, Clinton has evolved on Keystone: Shot 1: In October 2010, the then-secretary of state described herself and the Obama administration as \u201cinclined\u201d to give TransCanada the permit. \u201cWe\u2019re either going to be dependent on dirty oil from the Gulf or dirty oil from Canada,\u201d she said in San Francisco. Shot 2: Pressed by a New Hampshire voter this summer, Clinton said she would \u201cwait and see\u201d what President Obama does. \u201cIf it is undecided when I become president, I will answer your question,\u201d she said. Chaser: Speaking to the Des Moines Register editorial board yesterday, Clinton said: \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to have a pipeline bringing very dirty oil, exploiting the tar sands in western Canada, across our border.\u201d    Foreman Javier Garcia works with his crew as they lower a section of pipe into the ground, along the TransCanada Keystone XL Pipeline section near Winona, Texas.

Leonnig and Rosalind S. Helderman scoop. \u201cThey said the request was not simply about general record-keeping but was prompted entirely by the discovery that Clinton had exclusively used a private e-mail system. They also said they first contacted her in the summer of 2014, at least three months before the agency asked Clinton and three of her predecessors to provide their e-mails\u2026 \u2018In the process of responding to congressional document requests pertaining to Benghazi, State Department officials recognized that it had access to relatively few email records from former Secretary Clinton,\u2019 State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement e-mailed to The Washington Post\u2026 The State Department also realized it was not automatically preserving internal communications, with some other senior officials\u2019 e-mails missing.\u201d The FBI has recovered personal and work-related e-mails that Hillary deleted from her\u00a0private computer server,\u00a0Bloomberg\u2019s Del Quentin Wilber reports. \u201cThe Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s success at salvaging personal e-mails that Clinton said had been deleted raises the possibility that the correspondence eventually could become public. \u2026 The exact number of personal e-mails recovered by the FBI could not be learned. \u2026 Once the e-mails have been extracted, a group of agents has been separating personal correspondence and passing along work-related messages to agents leading the investigation.\u201d \u201cMore previously undisclosed State Department emails related to Benghazi have surfaced in a federal court filing,\u201d\u00a0Politico\u2019s Josh Gerstein and Rachael Bade report. \u201cThe filing Monday in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the conservative group Citizens United describes about a dozen Benghazi-related emails that were withheld in whole or in part as State responded to one of the group\u2019s requests seeking information about contacts between a top aide to Clinton and officials with the Clinton Foundation. Most of the documents also appear to have been withheld from the House Select Committee on Benghazi.\u201d     Carly Fiorina speaks during a town hall meeting at The Citadel in Charleston, S.C., yesterday.

SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: \u2014 ZIGNAL VISUAL:\u00a0Hillary Clinton came out swinging against high drug prices on Tuesday as she unveiled a new plan to cap out-of-pocket costs for prescriptions. But she also seemed to step on her own message later in the afternoon by coming out against Keystone. This chart from our analytics partners at Zignal Labs shows how Hillary drove the morning news cycle with the unveiling of her health care plan. The call for capping drug costs earned as many as 50 mentions per minute during the morning hours.     But look at what happened in the afternoon when she came out against Keystone. The red line below represents all mentions of Clinton\u2019s drug plan. The blue line tracks the Keystone mentions. At their peak, there were nearly three Keystone-related mentions per second. By the end of the day, Keystone dominated the Hillary news, while her prescription drug plan had faded into relative obscurity.     \u2013Pictures of the day:\u00a0Craving more of Pope Francis?
