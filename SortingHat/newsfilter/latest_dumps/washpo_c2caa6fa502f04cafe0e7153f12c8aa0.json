(Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  When it comes to the presidential race, there\u2019s Donald Trump and there\u2019s everybody else. The billionaire businessman\u00a0received nearly as many mentions as all the other candidates combined across both traditional and social media last month, according to our\u00a0analytics partners at Zignal Labs. Against all expectations, his share of the chatter is only growing: Over the past eight days, The Donald has owned a 50 percent \u201cShare of Voice\u201d or more every single day. That means at least one in every two mentions of a presidential candidate involved Trump. Put another way, over this last week, Trump\u00a0was mentioned more than the rest of the field\u2014including Democrats and the 16 other Republicans\u2014combined. Here\u00a0is a chart from Zignal comparing daily mentions of all candidates other than Trump against daily Trump mentions for every day in August:    ", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Trump mentioned more than all the other 2016 candidates combined", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/09/01/trump-mentioned-more-than-all-the-other-2016-candidates-combined/", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Melina Mara"], "orgs": ["Zignal Labs"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30994, "fullname": "james hohmann", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-09-01 12:58:49", "org": "washpo", "article_id": "c2caa6fa502f04cafe0e7153f12c8aa0", "date_access": "2015-09-01 12:30:02.853430"}
