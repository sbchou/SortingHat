It is evident that the regular rules do not apply to him. Two months into his rowdy campaign, it is instead the political media that has been leveled by Trump \u2014 floored, mystified and stupefied by a candidate who prospers where others would perish. What\u2019s more, the press corps is beginning to realize that nothing it might do \u2014 no report it can publish, no question it can ask \u2013 has the power to push this candidate an inch off the course that is preordained for him, one which is far more likely to burn out on its own terms than flame out under some great bonfire set by the media.\nThat is the consensus, anyway, of the nearly two dozen journalists, pundits, campaign strategists and political advisers who spoke with POLITICO this week about what many described as the \u201cexceptionalism\u201d of Trump\u2019s campaign. Trump\u2019s bombast and bluntness are resonating with voters, they said, and there\u2019s not a damn thing the press, pundits or rival campaigns can do about it.\nThe list of offenses that would likely cripple other candidates is long: Trump called Mexican immigrants criminals and rapists. He said that Sen. John McCain, who spent five-and-a-half years in a North Vietnamese prison, is not a war hero. He has referred to women as \u201cfat pigs,\u201d \u201cdogs,\u201d \u201cslobs\u201d and worse, and had those remarks read to him before 24 million Americans by one of the most popular female news anchors in the country \u2014 because, Trump later suggested, she was menstruating. Far from dismantling Trump\u2019s campaign, these controversies seem to have benefited him.\n\u201cThe only thing that takes him out is either Father Trump or Father Time,\u201d said Matthew Dowd, the former chief strategist for President George W. Bush. \u201cSo far, he is immune.\u201d\nMore recently, Trump sat down for an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Asked who he talks to for military advice, Trump replied: \"Well, I watch the shows. I mean, I really see a lot of great \u2014 you know, when you watch your show and all of the other shows and you have the generals and \u2014 and you have certain people that you like.\u201d\nIf Trump\u2019s remark called to mind Sarah Palin\u2019s inability, in a 2008 interview, to name a single newspaper or magazine that she had read before being tapped as McCain\u2019s vice presidential nominee, it has not had the same effect. For Palin, it was an embarrassment that continues to dog her reputation. For Trump, the \u2018shows\u2019 remark barely registered.\n\u201cIn any other campaign cycle, another campaign would have been making Trump pay for that remark before he even walked out of the studio,\" Kevin Madden, the senior adviser and spokesman for Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign, said. \u201cIt\u2019s an entirely disqualifying statement, yet we didn\u2019t see other campaigns move with much speed or purpose to expose it.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s ability to shrug off controversy and criticism, to out-shame his detractors in the media and on the campaign trail, is almost certainly a reflection of widespread public frustration with career politicians and the mainstream press, and with its way of covering elections.\nIn fact, Trump is playing according to a different bit of wisdom, one that belongs to show business and is thought to have come from circus-master P.T. Barnum: all publicity is good publicity.\nHe has done this before. Among the small conclave of family and corporate dynasties that have long dominated New York City\u2019s real estate industry, discretion has forever been a watchword \u2014 the preferred method of influence is boardrooms and living rooms and wood-paneled offices not made up for a reality television show like \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d\nTrump did not succeed (or at least survive) in the cutthroat world of New York real estate by playing by its rules, but by flouting them. It only worked because it made him an outlier: None of the rules have changed for his equals in the industry.\nThat Trump can bring those rules with him on the road to the 2016 presidential election makes him a completely different candidate from the rest of the pack. The rules of show business are just as fickle as those of presidential politics. But they are completely different. And they are serving him in politics as they once served him in business.\n\u201cThe conventional wisdom doesn\u2019t apply to Donald Trump \u2014 at least not so far,\u201d Roger Stone, the former top adviser with Trump\u2019s campaign, said.\nRead the full report here.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "From my report on the seemingly unshakeable rise of Teflon Don:", "title": "The unsinkable Donald Trump", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/08/the-unsinkable-donald-trump-212757", "topics": ["women"], "people": ["Michael Grunwald", "Nicholas Kusnetz", "Sarah Palin", "D.C.
