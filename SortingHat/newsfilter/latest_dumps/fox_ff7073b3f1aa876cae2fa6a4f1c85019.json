{"body": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA petition asking NBC to fire Donald Trump has collected more than 200,000 signatures.\nPosted on the Change.org website, the petition calls out NBC of choosing business over \"ethics, principles and values\" in the wake of Trump's recent statements when declaring his candidacy for president. Among his remarks, the GOP hopeful portrayed immigrants from Mexico as \"bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.\"\nLast week, Univision, the nation's largest Spanish-language network, said it wouldn't air the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants, which are co-owned by Trump, and will cut all future business ties with him.\nNBC responded only by saying the company doesn't \"agree with his positions on a number of issues including his recent comments on immigration.\" NBC is co-owner with Trump of the pageants and is in business with him as host and a producer of \"The Celebrity Apprentice.\" A sister network of NBC is Telemundo, another major Spanish-language TV outlet, which aired the Miss Universe pageants before Univision won the contract.\n\"A large part of your audience is Hispanic and we watch NBC, NBC News and Telemundo,\" said the man who posted the petition, Guillermo Castaneda, Jr., in addressing NBC. \"How about looking out for us?\"\nNBC had no comment on the petition.\n", "byline": "", "description": "A petition asking NBC to fire Donald Trump has collected more than 200,000 signatures.", "title": "More than 200,000 sign petition for NBC to cut ties with Donald Trump", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/wigzXQH59SM/", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Guillermo Castaneda"], "orgs": ["Telemundo", "Univision", "GOP"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-06-29 16:34:05", "org": "fox", "article_id": "ff7073b3f1aa876cae2fa6a4f1c85019", "date_access": "2015-06-29 17:50:22.261196"}
