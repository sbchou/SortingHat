{"body": " Bobby Jindal\u2019s super PAC on Monday went up across Iowa with a commercial that highlights the Louisiana governor\u2019s hardline views on immigration. The 30-second spot from Believe Again is backed up by half a million dollars. It is the group\u2019s first media buy and comes the week after Jindal announced his bid for the Republican nomination. [Bobby Jindal announces entry into 2016 presidential race] \u201cI think our immigration system is broken,\u201d Jindal said in a recent speech, which is showcased in the ad. \u201cIf folks want to immigrate to America, they should do so legally. They should adopt our values. They should learn English. And they should roll up their sleeves and get to work.\u201d The commercial is also part biographical and includes photographs of a young Jindal with his father. \u201cI\u2019m tired of hyphenated Americans. We\u2019re not Indian-Americans or African-Americans or Asian-Americans,\u201d Jindal is shown saying. \u201cWe\u2019re all Americans. When my parents came to America, they were coming to be Americans.\u201d Jindal's parents are immigrants from India; he was born in the United States. [From Piyush to Bobby: How does Jindal feel about his family\u2019s past?] Jindal is positioning himself as the most ideologically-pure conservative governor in the GOP field, and he hopes that immigration will help him make headway in the polls. Several of the leading establishment candidates, including former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), have supported comprehensive reform that includes varying degrees of legal status for undocumented immigrants. Last week, Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) \u2013 who will announce on July 21 \u2013 said in Des Moines that it is \u201cinhumane\u201d to deport immigrants. Based on an average of current national polls, Jindal would not be among the 10 candidates to participate in the first presidential debate on Fox News this August. A TV buy, even though it is only in Iowa, could increase his name recognition in the state and help him earn more national coverage. \u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "Bobby Jindal\u2019s super PAC on Monday went up across Iowa with a commercial that highlights the Louisiana governor\u2019s hardline views on immigration.The 30-second spot from Believe Again is backed up by half a million dollars.
