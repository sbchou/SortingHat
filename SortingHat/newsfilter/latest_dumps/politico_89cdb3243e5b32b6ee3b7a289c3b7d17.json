A lot of people think it\u2019s just going to be this positive thing,\u201d said the group\u2019s communications director Ammar Campa-Najjar, who went on to share some choice words about the businessman, his ideas and his candidacy. They included \u201csad,\u201d \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cbroken.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been tight-lipped for a while, but I\u2019ve got to speak up now,\u201d said Campa-Najjar. \u201cIt would be funny if it wasn\u2019t so sad that this man is leading in the polls and that this is his idea for a fiscally responsible, fair and feasible plan for dealing with immigrants.\u201d\nCiting its $400 billion price tag, Campa-Najjar said Trump\u2019s immigration plan was a fiscal loser. He added, \u201cThe deporting thing is so absurd that no one can get behind it and he needs to explain how that\u2019s going to work.\u201d\nCampa-Najjar also dismissed the Trump campaign\u2019s claims that he already enjoys support among many Hispanics and his belief that he will win over much of the rest of them.\n\u201cWhen we talk to them, they give the impression they\u2019re doing so well with Hispanics, \u2018oh Hispanics love me,\u2019 and I think that\u2019s at best, out of touch with reality,\u201d he said. \nCampa-Najjar pointed to the small sample size of a July poll, oft-cited by Trump, that shows him winning Hispanic Republicans in Nevada with 31 percent support. \u201cCongratulations, you got 80 Hispanics to say they support you,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s 55 million Hispanics and you need 47 percent of the Hispanic votes to win the White House, according to some estimates.\u201d\n(In a national ABC/Washington Post poll conducted in July, 84 percent of Hispanics said they \u201cdefinitely would not\u201d vote for Trump)\n\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re hearing is he has virtually no chance of winning back support from the Hispanic business community,\u201d said Campa-Najjar. \u201cThat\u2019s putting it mildly -- he never had it. At best he could clarify his stance.\u201d\nA Trump campaign spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Hispanic Chamber\u2019s president and CEO, Javier Palomarez, also said Trump was in for rigorous questioning. \u201cWe will challenge Mr. Trump on his views. We\u2019ll challenge him on his rhetoric. We intend to have a very candid discussion,\u201d said Palomarez. \u201cHe claims he\u2019s been mischaracterized so this will give him an opportunity to set the record straight, and we\u2019ll allow our constituency of business owners and executives to be the judge and jury of Donald Trump and his words.\u201d\nCiting a shared interest in business, Campa-Najjar predicted that Trump and the chamber\u2019s members could also reach some common ground. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find some things that we don\u2019t outright disagree with,\u201d he said. \u201cA broken clock is right twice a day.\u201d\nBen Schreckinger is a reporter for Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "\u2018It would be funny if it wasn\u2019t so sad that this man is leading in the polls,\u2019 said the spokesman for a group set to host Trump next week.", "title": "Donald Trump is about to walk into a buzz-saw", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/donald-trump-hispanic-chamber-of-commerce-immigration-214334", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Josh Earnest", "Harry Reid", "Joseph J.
