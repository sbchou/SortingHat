What that will look like, no one is saying, but it\u2019s the thought that counts. \u201cIf you just look at the long-winded statements people are making \u2026 there\u2019s tremendous concern on this. I don't think anybody that supports this is a no-brainer,\u201d said Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker in an interview. \u201cSupporters acknowledge it\u2019s deeply flawed \u2026 there\u2019s significant concern that this administration \u2026 has zero strategy to counter Iran in the region with its newfound strength.\u201d New sanctions are the most likely avenue, but Republicans believe that it\u2019s going to be up to Congress to aggressively keep Iran in check, not the White House. \u201cI do think at some point it will be addressed again. We need to first see if the deal is approved and then we\u2019ll go from there,\u201d Corker said. \nSpeaking of long-winded: Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware is out this morning in support of the deal with an 1100-word op-ed in the Wilmington News-Journal. \u201cThis is a good deal for America and our allies, including Israel, one of our closest allies. And, oh yes. It beats the likely alternative \u2013 war with Iran \u2013 hands down.\u201d That makes it 30 Senate Dems for, two against. http://goo.gl/AEbnWU\n2014er strikes back: I didn\u2019t peg former Sen. Mary Landrieu as one of the big bashers of Obama\u2019s diplomacy. She was always conciliatory toward the president on the campaign trail, but now she\u2019s writing op-eds for The Hill arguing there\u2019s a better deal to be had. http://goo.gl/UIurUa\nHOUSE SUPPORT UP TOO: Reps. Hank Johnson, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Jim McDermott and Earl Perlmutter are among the latest backers of the Iran deal in the House. That\u2019s 74 for, 14 against per The Hill\u2019s House tracker. http://goo.gl/uBp7UY\n8 million reasons to vote against? New York is really the epicenter of opposition at this point, which is why Rep. Jerry Nadler\u2019s public backing of the deal last week was so important. He counters members like Carolyn Maloney, the latest House Democrat to oppose the deal. \u201cThere are strong arguments for and against the agreement but, as a matter of conscience, I have decided to oppose it,\u201d she told the NYDN. http://goo.gl/5T7qAu\nWhither the whip: Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has done a great job of creating momentum for the deal this month, and she\u2019s done so without any help or support from No. 2 House Democrat Steny Hoyer. And Hoyer sounds like he\u2019s leaning away from the White House. LA Times: \u201cThe administration is working it very hard. They feel very strongly that this is the best deal that we could get and that we are much better off if we approve this deal,\u201d Hoyer said. \"I think that is the administration's case, I think Nancy shares that view. I'm not sure I share that view.\" http://goo.gl/oVC3vQ\nBUSH AND CANTOR: Thinking of people that you\u2019d want to endorse you for president, one of the most shocking primary losses doesn\u2019t come to mind. And yet ousted House Majority Leader Eric Cantor is endorsing Jeb Bush, per Mike Allen. http://goo.gl/yyzam1\nBrat pack: So what would it take to get Rep. Dave Brat\u2019s endorsement? Matt Fuller reports that the Cantor slayer is \u201cWaiting for the first [candidate] to reference 127 trillion in unfunded liabilities and that all federal revenue will go toward only the 4 entitlement programs and interest payments by 2027 \u2026 So no endorsements yet but the first one that weighs in on that topic will grab my attention very quickly.\u201d http://goo.gl/M5Rj6q\nFINALLY FRIDAY.

Catch us back on Tuesday after Labor Day for all the drama under the dome. \nA GOOD GUY: As most of you know, Manu Raju is taking his talents to TV-land in a few days. But not before I say that he\u2019s been an awesome teammate and also a good friend in the nearly 2.5 years we\u2019ve covered the Senate in tandem. We\u2019ve written dozens of stories together (his name is usually before mine, not that I\u2019m bitter) but we actually teamed up before I even covered the Senate to take a look at how Sen. Jim DeMint might run the Commerce Committee. Of course, the GOP did not win the Senate in 2012 and he resigned his seat, but it\u2019s still a good story with a sizzling quote from Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. In tribute to Manu, check out \u201cChairman DeMint\u201d: http://goo.gl/0V069H\nPP FIGHTS BACK: Those Planned Parenthood videos that have been animating a potential government shutdown fight in Congress have been manipulated, according to a report for the group that was sent to congressional leadership. Per Jen Haberkorn: David \u201cDaleiden, who founded and leads CMP, told POLITICO that the footage missing from the tapes is \u2018bathroom breaks\u2019 and conversations between the group\u2019s members. He denied cutting anything substantial or any leading questions.\u201d http://goo.gl/NyTlTM\nTARGETING BERNIE: Vermont\u2019s Seven Days is out with a tough piece on Sen. Bernie Sanders, with lots of anonymous claims that he\u2019s a jerk to his employees. He\u2019s dubbed as \u201cincredibly abusive,\u201d a swear word, a yeller, \u201charsh to a fault\u201d and lacking a \u201csoft touch.\u201d Longtime spokesman Michael Briggs: \"Too many writers and publications look at politics as a soap opera and engage in gossip and personal attacks.\" http://goo.gl/32ihSX\nMy take: I\u2019ve known Bernie for several years. He\u2019s certainly gruff and not especially warm but I\u2019ve yet to see anything to indicate he\u2019s a mean person. Briggs has been with him forever, and high staff turnover is usually a good indicator of someone\u2019s temperament. \nFORMERS PRAISE BIDEN: Man that vice president is riding a presidential buzz this summer. He\u2019s even got former GOP Sen. Dick Lugar saying things like \u201che has sufficient independence of thought and sufficient energy to be a very strong leader.\u201d Lots of other kind words from former colleagues that aren\u2019t as closely shackled to party politics as serving senators. Roll Call: http://goo.gl/z1oUGS\nSeen another way: Sen. Marco Rubio says Vice President Joe Biden would be a \"disastrous commander-in-chief\u201d because \u201che has a lot of experience at being wrong.\u201d The Hill: http://goo.gl/YvSQoV\nCRUZ BULLETIN: \u201cSen. Cruz has invited Donald Trump to join him on the Capitol grounds for a rally to call on members of Congress to defeat the catastrophic deal that the Obama Administration has struck with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The event will be sponsored by Tea Party Patriots, Center for Security Policy, and the Zionist Organization of America. We are thankful for all their hard work on this effort and will have more details on time, date, and location as they are finalized.\u201d\nTHURSDAY\u2019S TRIVIA WINNER \u2013 Jeremy Berkowitz was the first to answer that Bill Clinton announced his successful presidential campaign after Labor Day, on Oct. 3, 1991.\nTODAY\u2019S TRIVIA \u2013 Jeremy has today\u2019s question: Since the early 1970s, this Southern state has consistently had at least one of its U.S. Senators serving in their first term.
