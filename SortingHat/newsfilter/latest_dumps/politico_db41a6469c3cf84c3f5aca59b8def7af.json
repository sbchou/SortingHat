{"body": "Fourth Estate\nSure, she\u2019s up and down \u2014 but we can\u2019t learn anything about 2016 yet.\nBy JACK SHAFER\nJune 03, 2015\nLead image by Getty.\nPolitical journalists abhor a vacuum, especially the vacuum that forms 17 months before a presidential election, attaches itself to their brains like a sea lamprey and sucks hard.\nTop Stories, Videos & Photos\nOh, political journalists have so much to write about this distant from a general election. There are speeches to cover, fundraising numbers to chase, campaign jockeying to chronicle, backstories to collate, campaign staff rosters to collect, press management schemes to detect and vats of wonkery to fry. Such coverage is all necessary and good, but at this point even the press hounds will concede that they\u2019re mostly barking at dust and vapor, waiting for the field to thin and for primary ballots to be cast so they can write more concretely about the race. (After all: Just how much public appetite is there for in-depth coverage of George Pataki or Lincoln Chafee?)\nUntil then, journalists casting for something tangible to hang their thoughts upon are reaching for poll data\u2014like the figures released this week from CNN/ORC and Washington Post/ABC News, which show Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cfavorability\u201d numbers crumbling to a 14-year-low of 46 percent. \u201cThe honeymoon is over for Hillary Clinton, according to two new polls,\u201d reported the National Journal. \u201cAs revelations mount, Hillary Clinton\u2019s poll numbers\u00a0plunge,\u201d proclaimed the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The conservative press, including Breitbart and the Washington Examiner danced on the new polls. \u201cIs Hillary \u2018Likeable Enough\u2019?\u201d asked National Review.\nWhile glory awaits the journalist who buries Hillary Clinton, carves her tombstone and tidies her grave, the makings of her demise cannot be read in these poll results. Clinton rides a favorability rollercoaster, and has been riding it hard for the past 23 years, as the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Karlyn Bowman and her team demonstrate in a recent analysis of Clinton polling data. As an infographic they produced indicates, Clinton favorability numbers vary with the role she\u2019s playing. Her numbers grew steadily in the campaign year of 1992 and higher still when she became First Lady in 1993. First ladies, notes Bowman, \u201cgenerally receive positive marks.\u201d\nInfographic courtesy the American Enterprise Institute.\nBut Clinton\u2019s numbers suffered whenever she stepped outside of the traditional First Lady function to join the policy and politics tussle (the healthcare debate) or became attached to White House \u201cscandals\u201d (Travelgate, Whitewater, Lewinsky, et al.). As a U.S. senator (2001-2009), Clinton\u2019s numbers varied much less, dropping some during her 2008 run for president. Then came her secretary of state years (2009-2013), when she exuded diplomacy and did her soaring best in the polls. Her numbers descended again as she became identified with the Benghazi attack in 2013.\nHow to best interpret Clinton\u2019s latest decline? When asked to rate Hillary Clinton on a favorable-unfavorable continuum, it has usually mattered to respondents what Clinton\u2019s duties were. Now that she\u2019s running for president, it\u2019s predictable that some of the respondents who liked Clinton enough to give her a favorable rating when she was a self-effacing, team-playing diplomat might not like her enough to give her a favorable rating when they view her as a private citizen prepping a presidential candidacy. (This timeline from the Pew Research Center ties Clinton career \u201cmilestones\u201d to her favorability ups and downs.)\nClinton\u2019s numbers could easily go lower, of course, given the twin backdrops of the email controversy and the Clinton Foundation coverage. Also, in the coming months, as the Republican field winnows out, the remaining candidates will increase the frequency of their attacks on Clinton, their most credible opponent on the Democratic side, and lower her favorability still more.\nBut it\u2019s hard to imagine a favorability-ratings veteran like Hillary Clinton panicking at this week\u2019s or next week\u2019s numbers. As the wise man once said, Clinton operates in glacial time, and has the patience to build support\u2014and favorability\u2014as the campaign throttles up. She has almost 30 years of hands-on experience handling political calamities and downturns. Plus, as low as her favorability ratings have dropped, they\u2019re still about 15-to-20 percentage points higher than several of her Republican opponents'.\nIt\u2019s always easier for a politician to survive a trough when she has so much experience living on the crest.\n******\nMy POLITICO colleagues Gabriel Debenedetti and Annie Karni are on my wavelength.
