{"body": "Washington (CNN)Republican frontrunner Donald Trump said he would \"do great\" in a hypothetical matchup with Vice President Joe Biden in part because of the prospective candidate's plagiarism in law school.\n\"I think I'd matchup great. I'm a job producer. I've had a great record, I haven't been involved in plagiarism. I think I would match up very well against him,\" Trump told conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt on Wednesday night.\nBiden admitted to plagiarizing a law review article while in law school -- lifting from writings by British politician Neil Kinnock -- and it became an issue that haunted his failed 1988 presidential bid. \nBiden has been mulling a third run, particularly while he's vacationing with his family in South Carolina this week, but has yet to decide whether he will seek the Democratic nomination.\nBiden's office declined to comment on Trump's comment. \n", "byline": "", "description": "Republican frontrunner Donald Trump said he would \"do great\" in a hypothetical matchup with Vice President Joe Biden in part because of the prospective candidate's plagiarism in law school.", "title": "Trump knocks Biden for plagiarism in law school", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/13/politics/donald-trump-joe-biden-plagiarism/index.html", "topics": ["personality", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Neil Kinnock", "Hugh Hewitt", "Joe Biden"], "orgs": [], "authors": [{"author_id": 28110, "fullname": "tom lobianco", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-08-13 16:18:31", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "db0b9e58ec59ba9b04302d26e6297965", "date_access": "2015-08-13 15:30:05.999117"}
