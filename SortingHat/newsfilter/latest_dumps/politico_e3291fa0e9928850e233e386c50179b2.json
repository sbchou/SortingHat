ONC wanted to work out kinks and bugs on the site before making it publicly available. The problem is that acting Deputy National Coordinator Jon White\u2019s blog announcing the site went live Friday and links to a page showing an error message. Interested readers have had a ball poking fun at that. A timing issue on HHS\u2019s end had the two launching out of sync--so refrain from your HealthCare.gov jokes.\neHealth tweet of the day: @deansittig: This might be my favorite @ONC_HealthIT SNAFU of all-time ... You are not authorized to access this page. http://t.co/5Tg9PuvrYM\nIS HEALTH IT SPURRING HOSPITAL MERGERS?: American Hospital Association CEO Rick Pollack told the House Judiciary Committee that he thought so, during a hearing last week on competition in health care. He estimated that hospitals will spend between $20 million and $200 million on EHRs each year depending on their size, and that dollar amount is unmanageable for smaller hospitals. The result: They merge, creating fewer players in a given market. \u201cThe fundamental restructuring that CMS anticipates in response to its alternative reimbursement models will undoubtedly come with a high cost that will be particularly difficult to bear for small and stand-alone hospitals,\u201d Pollack testified.

Physicians, he says, don\u2019t want problematic technology to be sealed in amber--or rather, they don't want to be sealed in the amber of problematic technology--through the finalization of the Stage 3 regs. \u201cThere is tremendous pent up anger about being \u2018locked in\u2019 by the vendors,\u201d Kibbe says. \u201cAnd the providers see that they need more room to move, not less, in the near future. Stage 3 is viewed as a way for the some vendors to lock in at a higher level of complexity.\u201d Kibbe says the smart money is on EHR vendors who can provider higher customer service at lower prices. \nREACTION TO RECENT GAG CLAUSE STORY: @EmilyFPeters: Compare to @PracticeFusion that has been gag-order free (and also free in price) since the start: http://bit.ly/1J8Vke3 \nBIG DATA: ALL TALK, LITTLE ACTION: Half of large hospitals surveyed reported not having a clear strategy for using data analytics, a recent survey from the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions found. Only five of the 50 hospitals who responded to the survey said they expected their analytics spending to grow significantly in the next three years. \u201cMany health systems have yet to take advantage of the capabilities that analytics can bring to meet their enterprise objectives,\u201d the report found. The authors do expect analytics to play a greater role as health insurers move to value-based purchasing. The report: http://bit.ly/1ORmbQO \nTIME FOR CONSUMER DATA IN HEALTH CARE?: This post from the Commonwealth Fund asks that question. If clinicians know who is more likely to take their medication beforehand, for example, it could change the treatment plan. \u201cSegmenting patients by their motivations and behaviors can make it easier to target interventions and deploy resources to those most in need of them,\" says Cynthia Kilroy, a senior vice president at Optum, the health services consulting firm. Combining that information with clinical data \"is the next frontier in population health,\" she says. The post: http://bit.ly/1NsiRhF \nNURSES THINK MORE DATA SHOULD BE IN EHRs: The American Academy of Nursing think it\u2019s important to capture social and behavioral determinants of health in EHRs, and on Monday released a policy paper outlining what EHR vendors, hospitals, clinicians and funders need to do to make that a reality. The paper follows an April 2014 Institute of Medicine report that similar recommendations.

The company\u2019s 2net product has long integrated data from home-based health gadgets with doctors\u2019 EHRs. Qualcomm\u2019s acquisition, announced Monday, of Capsule Technologie will serve largely the same purpose for medical devices located in the hospital. It\u2019s hard to tell exactly how many hospitals are converting medical device results into digital data for the EHR\u2019s consumption; industry analysts pin that number at roughly 18 percent.  HEALTH IT SAFETY, A CONSIDERATION: A pair of health IT heavy hitters \u2014 Hardeep Singh and Dean Sittig \u2014 have taken to the pages of the British Medical Journal\u2019s Quality and Safety publication to discuss improving the patient safety characteristics of software. Singh and Sittig believe patient safety problems stem not only from health IT technology, but its implementation and the way clinicians interact with it and each other. The problems, then, are systemic. For the authors, health IT needs to be safe, and safely used, but also used to improve safety. To accomplish those tasks, the authors suggest better measurement and collaboration \u2014 neither of which is occurring to their satisfaction yet.
