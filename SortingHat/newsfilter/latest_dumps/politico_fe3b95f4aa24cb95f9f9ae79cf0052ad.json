{"body": "POLITICO\nA daily overview of education policy news\nBy Caitlin Emma\n8/26/15 9:59 AM EDT\nWith help from Allie Grasgreen, Kimberly Hefling, Maggie Severns and Nirvi Shah\nACT BUSINESS GROWS, STUDENT SCORES DON\u2019T: A historic number of 2015 high school graduates took the ACT, a new report out today says. About 1.9 million students from the most recent graduating class \u2014 nearly 60 percent of graduates \u2014 took the test. That\u2019s a 19 percent increase in tested graduates since 2011. Jon Erickson, ACT president, told Morning Education the growth comes from an increase in students taking the exam as part of their state\u2019s battery of standardized tests, in addition to increased growth in areas where earlier generations didn\u2019t take the test.\nStory Continued Below\n\u2014 Despite the growth, ACT says the readiness of students for college has remained steady in the last several years. The report said that among this year\u2019s graduates, 40 percent of students showed \u201cstrong\u201d readiness by meeting readiness benchmarks in at least three of the four core subject areas. The average composite score on the 36-point scale was 21. The report issues a \u201ccall to action\u201d to federal, state and local policymakers urging work to improve the education system. \u201cThe numbers continue to grow and ... the results aren\u2019t showing any change,\u201d Erickson said. \u201cThe gaps remain and in some ways they get bigger.\u201d Erickson said there\u2019s a need for a multifaceted solution \u2014 not just new tests or standards because \u201cthey\u2019re just parts of the equation.\u201d A lot of it, he said, comes down to the classrooms, communities and parents.\n\u2014 The report also reflects a gap between what students aspire to do and how much their scores reflect college readiness. Eighty-six percent of ACT-tested 2015 graduates said they want to attend a postsecondary institution, but ACT projects that only 69 percent of the graduates will enroll. That equates to more than 300,000 students who may have college aspirations, but won\u2019t enroll. Find the report here: http://politico.pro/1V58X6E.\nGOOD WEDNESDAY MORNING, AUGUST 26.

In advance of a bankruptcy court hearing today, several state and federal agencies are objecting to the defunct for-profit college\u2019s plan [http://bit.ly/1LvKSRZ] to dispose of its debts with the few dollars still at its command, The Wall Street Journal notes [http://on.wsj.com/1U2Q1Zi] in a preview of the hearing. But the objections won\u2019t generate more money to repay students, notes the Student Committee that represents former Corinthian students. The hearing is scheduled for 1 p.m. ET.\nINTEREST IN TUITION INSURANCE: Since launching in Arizona in June, the company Allianz Global Assistance\u2019s tuition insurance program has emerged in 10 states \u2014 most recently, Virginia \u2014 reaching 44 percent of all college students. Confidentiality kept Director of Marketing Joe Mason from disclosing precise uptake numbers, but \u201cwe had expectations and we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d he said. In an Allianz survey of 1,000 U.S. parents, 81 percent didn\u2019t know tuition insurance existed, and nearly half said they\u2019d buy it, if offered. The plans vary, but generally protect customers from non-refundable tuition costs and fees when a student withdraws for several reasons. \u201cThis is an area we\u2019ve been watching for the last few years,\u201d Mason said. To qualify, students must be residents in a state where Allianz is present \u2014 others include Texas, California, Pennsylvania and Michigan \u2014 but they can attend any accredited institution. The per-term cost and coverage ranges from $29.95 for a payout of up to $2,500, to 6 percent of college expenses for a payout of up to $50,000. By this time next year, Allianz executives hope to execute a national tuition insurance rollout.\n\u2014 Mason\u2019s isn\u2019t the only company in the business, though he says the individualized flexibility makes Allianz plans unique. Some offer group policies, while others offer insurance through colleges \u2014 and many institutions have their own policies similar to federal regulations dictating when pre-paid students who leave school can keep their aid. So the policies aren\u2019t for everyone, the information website FinAid advises. \u201cTuition refund insurance is generally not recommended for college students except when the student has a serious illness that may force the student to withdraw from school,\u201d Mark Kantrowitz wrote. \u201cBecause of the peace of mind benefit, tuition refund insurance is more likely to be of interest to parents whose children are attending more expensive colleges and who are paying most of the cost out of pocket.\u201d\n\u2014 Students must sign up with Allianz, which mainly focuses on travel insurance, by the first day of their college\u2019s classes: http://bit.ly/1hcbEod.\n\u2014 On a related note: University of Michigan professor Susan Dynarski wrote [http://nyti.ms/1JeeWRi] earlier this week in The New York Times that, amid congressional efforts to substantially reduce the lengthy FAFSA form, \u201cWe could go even further and eliminate the aid application altogether.\u201d A number of readers strongly disagreed, with one reader writing, \u201cWhy should we dumb down the first hurdle to make college easier? You don\u2019t deserve a high school diploma if you can\u2019t fill out the FAFSA.\u201d Read their responses: http://nyti.ms/1MS0T7W.\nMORE THAN ONE WAY TO UNDERMINE A UNION? Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker took on teachers unions and the rest of labor head on in 2011, sharply paring collective bargaining powers. Florida, already a right-to-work state, took a more subtle stab this year: The Florida Education Department this week said all full-time teachers now have access to $2 million in liability insurance protection [http://bit.ly/1Eh74PY] that will cover damages and costs of defense \u2014 based on a change to state law earlier this year. Liability insurance is one of the key protections also offered by ... union membership, making the liability insurance a reason to skip paying union dues. Florida\u2019s protection is similar, but not identical, to what membership in the Florida Education Association provides [http://bit.ly/1IdUlZE].\nNO CANDIDATE LEFT BEHIND: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said earlier this week on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d [http://on.msnbc.com/1Eiq4hx] that he\u2019d like to see colleges unbundle tuition. Families and students should be able to pay for what they want to pay for, he said. \u201cI just paid the bills, I\u2019ve got two in college,\u201d Christie said. \u201cBetween Princeton and Notre Dame this year it\u2019s $122,000 for the two of them ... Have you ever seen a more opaque bill than the college bill? It\u2019s three lines. Tuition, room and board, other fees, $62,000. If you got a bill like that at a restaurant, if you went to a restaurant and had $150 and it just said food, $150, you\u2019d send the bill back to the waiter.\u201d Christie said colleges \u201cshould have to detail what they\u2019re spending their money on and secondly, they should be able to unbundle it.\u201d ThinkProgress has more: http://bit.ly/1NRxJD4.\n\u2014 What will Donald Trump do with education policy as president? We could find out soon. He says he\u2019ll be out in upcoming weeks with his own education plan. He said as much in response to a question Tuesday about Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s higher education plan.\n\u2014 A poll of 3,000 likely voters in battleground states conducted by TargetPoint Consulting GQR Research found the first five years of a child\u2019s life are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d important. Among respondents who supported increasing early education funding, 74 percent said they would support an income tax increase that benefits early education programs. The firms conducted the poll on behalf of Save the Children Action Network.

(Now, only students with significant cognitive disabilities can take alternate exams, and for accountability purposes, only up to 1 percent of those exams can be included in rating schools. When more than 1 percent of students take the alternate tests, states or districts must count the scores from exams that exceed the cap as failing.)\n\u2014 Some special education advocates have argued that exams based on modified standards have been ripe for abuse, with too many students being pushed into taking these exams to boost school pass rates. The department got feedback that said the exams are essential, affecting some students\u2019 ability to graduate, interfering with the work of school employees trying to customize the education of students with disabilities. But times have changed since the alternate tests based on modified standards were first allowed, the department said, with more sophisticated test design and accommodations. \u201cThe importance of holding all students, including students with disabilities, to high standards cannot be overemphasized,\u201d the agency said in a Federal Register notice. [http://1.usa.gov/1JewDjN] \u201cLow expectations can lead to students with disabilities receiving less challenging instruction that reflects below grade-level achievement standards, and thereby not learning what they need to succeed at the grade in which they are enrolled.\u201d\nNEW TECH, NEW TREACHERY: Students taking massive open online courses appear to have developed an interesting response to the innovative academic model: \u201cCopying Answers using Multiple Existences Online.\u201d CAMEO, according to a new working paper, involves students using two separate accounts in MOOCs: one to answer test questions incorrectly and one to submit correct answers revealed by their errors. The Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers searched for the practice among 1.9 million users in 115 MOOCs at their two institutions, and found that the cheating strategy accounted for 1.3 percent of certificates in the 69 MOOCs where users executed it. The cheaters skewed young, male and international:  http://bit.ly/1NzFCjx.\nWHOSE GRADS SEE GREEN? The State University of New York, Maritime College has surpassed Harvey Mudd College as the institution whose graduates with bachelor\u2019s degrees only make the most money, according to PayScale\u2019s 2015-16 College Salary Report. The survey includes more than 1,500 colleges at all degree levels, and \u2014 though incomplete \u2014 is one of the most comprehensive reports of graduates\u2019 earnings. Maritime College\u2019s grads are making a median mid-career income of $134,000 a year. That\u2019s $1,000 more than Harvey Mudd alumni. But of any alumni at any institution in the survey, those from Emory University\u2019s School of Law are raking in the most money: $201,000 \u2014 more than law school graduates of UCLA, Georgetown and Harvard. But alumni of the latter\u2019s business school are making a median $190,000, the most in that field. Among the more general findings: earnings for graduates from master\u2019s and PhD programs at public universities lag significantly behind those at private non-profits. When it comes to two-year colleges, graduates of public schools make 15 percent more than those of private for-profits, and 25 percent more than those from private non-profits. And men make more at every level. More:  http://bit.ly/1p7H7V5\nSYLLABUS\n\u2014 Baylor University may face legal fallout from rape case.
