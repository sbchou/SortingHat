{"body": "   Crowd cheers for Donald Trump. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  WHAT TO EXPECT FROM TRUMP ON TAXES.\u00a0Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been letting bits and pieces of his thinking on tax policy slip in recent days, and the New York Times has a roundup of what those hints tell us about his overall policy. So far Trump has discussed\u00a0cutting taxes for the middle class, reducing rates for corporations and ending loopholes to simplify the code. So far those proposals are right in line with the rest of the GOP, where he differs is on taxes for the wealthy. Trump has said he would increase taxes on some high-income earners and wants to increase taxes for hedge fund managers by upping the rates for carried interest. PREPARING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DRAMA IN DECEMBER.\u00a0Welcome to your daily\u00a0reminder that Congress is in trouble in the fall. Today\u2019s warning comes from The Hill in a guest post from Richard Arenberg, a former staffer for Sens. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and George Mitchell (D-Maine), who warns that the remainder of the year will likely be marked by filibuster after filibuster. \u201cNow the summer is ending. Will the logjam break up?\u00a0 There\u2019s little chance of that.\u00a0 On the horizon is a pile-up of contentious issues each with its own filibuster possibilities. The new fiscal year begins on October 1.\u00a0 If the appropriations impasse is not resolved by then, we face another government shutdown. Neither party wants that, but that fact alone won\u2019t prevent it from happening.\u201d A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS SUPPORTS THE GAS TAX.\u00a0A new poll from the\u00a0Mineta Transportation Institute found that 71 percent of those surveyed support a 10-cent increase in the gas tax to help pay for infrastructure improvements. The Hill has more: \u201cSupport for increasing the gas tax to 28 cents-per-gallon drops to 31 percent if the money is used to \u2018maintain and improve the transportation system\u2019 instead of \u2018improve road maintenance,\u2019 according to the group. The group behind the study said \u2018the survey results show that a majority of Americans would support higher taxes for transportation\u2014under certain conditions.'\u201d Congress must find a way to pay for those highway and infrastructure projects before the Highway Trust Fund expires at the end of October but public support for increasing the tax isn\u2019t likely to impact transportation funding this year. The White House and many in Congress have already ruled out a gas tax hike\u00a0in previous discussions of highway funding.
