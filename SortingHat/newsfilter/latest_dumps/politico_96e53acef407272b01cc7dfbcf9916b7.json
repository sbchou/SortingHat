WALKER, RUBIO HEALTH PLANS OUT TODAY:\nStory Continued Below\nFIRST LOOK \u2013 Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, \u201cThe Day One Freedom Plan: My Plan to Repeal & Replace Obamacare\u201d: \u201cTo motivate Members of Congress to pass our reforms, I will require them to live under the same ObamaCare rules that have been forced on the rest of America. ... [O]n Day One, I will sign an executive order removing President Obama\u2019s special deal for Congress. Having to live with the same premium increases that other Americans have suffered under ObamaCare should light a fire under Congress to act quickly.\u201d http://bit.ly/1NCr5R7\n--Walker will unveil the plan at 11 a.m. ET today at Cass Screw Machine Products in Brooklyn Center, Minn.: \u201cMinnesota is not only an early presidential contest state, but has a large medical industry presence.\u201d\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO, writing on Politico, \u201cMy Plan To Fix Health Care,\u201d updating earlier three-point plan: \u201ccreate an advanceable, refundable tax credit that all Americans can use to purchase health insurance. ... reform insurance regulations to lower costs, encourage innovation, and protect the vulnerable. ... Without reforms, [Medicare and Medicaid] will eventually run out of money.\u201d http://politi.co/1flITEh\nPLAYBOOK IN-BOX \u2013 A health-policy expert, shown both plans, writes: \u201cNeither plan addresses how they\u2019ll fill the $137b deficit increase over 10 that repealing Obamacare will create. ... Both plans include traditional and longstanding GOP policy positions: block grant or cap Medicaid; reduce regulation; tax credits; state-led reform. Walker\u2019s plan includes a bunch of other recycled ideas (e.g. malpractice reform, high risk insurance pools, cross-state insurance purchase), none of which have ever been demonstrated to reduce the number of uninsured nor lower costs.\n\u201cWalker\u2019s plan reads like a governor\u2019s plan, with little recognition that his age-based tax credits might work in Wisconsin, but need to vary across states and insurance markets. Without expanding Medicaid, his plan would dramatically increase the number of uninsured in most states ...\n\u201cI ... would expect them both to need to come up with a much more detailed and serious replacement option should they make it to the general election. ... Repealing the ACA is taking away a current and real benefit from millions of Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions and kids covered under their parents\u2019 insurance plans up to age 26. Insurance companies aren\u2019t going to just sit back and continue to do both of those things post-repeal without some certainty that young healthy people would continue to buy insurance (which the mandate addresses).\u201d\nBREAKING -- \u201c[CNN/ORC] Poll: Trump continues his post-debate rise,\u201d by Nick Gass: Trump: 24 percent: Jeb: 13 percent\u00a0 ...

Even so, looming threats are a reminder that the slow-growing global economy is just a shock away from peril. Japan\u2019s economy contracted ...\u00a0 and Europe recorded lackluster growth. China\u2019s slowdown ... appears more severe than ... initially realized ...\n\u201cWith the U.S. expansion entering its seventh year, policy makers are planning how to respond to the next downturn, which history shows is inevitable. The current expansion is now 16 months longer than the average since World War II, and none has lasted longer than a decade.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1K3lGDJ\nAMAZING STAT -- N.Y.

Over the weekend, the Rev. Al Sharpton called on black churches to mobilize in support of the nuclear deal. On Monday, a group of 340 rabbis from multiple strands of Judaism released a letter urging lawmakers to vote for the pact. And plans are in the works for a coordinated roll-out of endorsements by a variety of religious groups next week ...\n\u201cThe campaign is led largely by Catholic and Quaker groups, such as the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Friends Committee on National Legislation, and it reflects many of the organizations\u2019 traditional anti-war stances.\u201d http://politi.co/1NCj9iR\nHILLARY and BLACK LIVES MATTER: \u201cMembers from the Black Lives Matter movement came from Boston to a Hillary Clinton town hall in Keene, N.H., last week.\u00a0 After the event, Clinton met with the group.

Yet, spending on retail prescription medicines accounts for just 10 percent of U.S. health care spending. And the federal government projects this trend will continue through at least the next decade. How is this possible? Because the competitive biopharmaceutical market that exists in the U.S. helps to control costs while encouraging the development of innovative new therapies.
