{"body": "POLITICO\nAn early filing of the day's tax news\nBy Toby Eckert\n8/7/15 10:02 AM EDT\nWith assistance from Brian Faler, Katy O\u2019Donnell and Elena Chiriboga\nDUELING TAX CUTS IN GOP DEBATE. The candidates in the prime-time debate broke no new ground on taxes. Unsurprisingly, the governors and former governors among them touted their tax-cutting records. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said he \u201ccut taxes every year, totaling $19 billion.\u201d But Pro Tax\u2019s Katy O\u2019Donnell points out that claim is based on cumulative revenue changes from 1999 to 2007, and not all revenue changes are tax cuts. They include fee and license changes, for example. What\u2019s more, part of the $19 billion figure is due to changes to the federal estate tax in 2001 \u2014 not the work of the Florida governor or Legislature. Leaving that out, Tax Analysts\u2019 Marty Sullivan pegs the tax cuts during Bush\u2019s administration closer to $13 billion. Ohio Gov. John Kasich claimed $5 billion in tax cuts. But that is a matter of some debate. Critics on the right note that Kasich has \u201cshifted\u201d some taxes \u2014 he\u2019s cut income taxes while increasing sales taxes and taxes on cigarettes, for instance. Kasich battled Ohio lawmakers and business groups this year over his plan to raise the sales tax and other levies by $5.2 billion to offset a $5.7 billion income tax cut. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said, \u201cWe cut business taxes $2.3 billion.\u201d But the Newark Star-Ledger said \u201csome of these cuts were passed under former Gov. Jon Corzine.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\nJINDAL: IRS SHOULD GO AFTER PLANNED PARENTHOOD. In the earlier \u201chappy hour\u201d debate,\u00a0Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said that, if elected, he would sic the IRS on Planned Parenthood. \u201cPlanned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election. Because I guarantee that under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS, and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going into Planned Parenthood,\u201d Jindal said. His fellow Republicans in Congress have been going after the IRS for the past two years for the type of political targeting Jindal seemed to advocate. Their gripe is with the IRS's treatment of tea party groups seeking tax-exempt status.\u00a0Former Sen. Rick Santorum, meanwhile, proposed a 20 percent flat tax, while former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore called for cutting the top income tax rate to 25 percent and charging businesses 15 percent.\nDOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE. In the latest sign of the Senate\u2019s ill feelings about combining tax reform with highway funding, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday rejected the idea. That\u2019s an ill omen for any quick resolution to the struggle over where to find money for a long-term extension of the Highway Trust Fund when Congress returns from its August recess. In a news conference with reporters, McConnell touted his own competing road- and transit-funding proposal and said he\u00a0believes highway financing and tax reform should be two entirely separate issues. \u201cSen. [Barbara] Boxer and I have put together a multiyear highway bill with credible pay-fors,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cA separate issue is the issue of tax reform. And there\u2019s been a lot of focus on going to a territorial system. I might be well enthusiastic about that but I view it as a totally separate track unrelated to the highway issue.\u201d\n\u2014 RYAN\u2019S PREFERRED ROUTE: McConnell\u2019s comments came as House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan pushed to combine an international tax code rewrite with longer-term highway financing. Ryan sought to build political momentum for the effort shortly before lawmakers\u2019 August recess by releasing a long-awaited \u201cpatent box\u201d proposal that seeks to keep intellectual property from moving abroad to dodge U.S. taxes. The idea has won some bipartisan support, from lawmakers such as Sen. Chuck Schumer, and he\u2019s been conferring with the Obama administration on the issue. But many Senate Republicans, in addition to McConnell, are wary of the effort for a host of reasons. McConnell has offered a competing highway financing program, with Boxer, that relies on a hodgepodge of pay-fors.\nIT\u2019S FRIDAY, \u2019nuff said.

Scammers using the phone or email to trick honest taxpayers into believing they owe the IRS money is nothing new. But in trying to stay one step ahead of the IRS, they\u2019re using some new tricks, according to a notice published by the IRS on Thursday. They\u2019re altering the caller ID that victims see when they call, making it look like they\u2019re calling from the IRS or another agency. They\u2019re using fake badge numbers. They\u2019re mining other sources of information about their victims to get personal details that make the call or email seem official. They\u2019re copying official IRS letterhead. \u201cBrazen scammers will even provide their victims with directions to the nearest bank or business where the victim can obtain a means of payment such as a debit card,\u201d the notice adds. \u201cAnd in another new variation of these scams, con artists may then provide an actual IRS address where the victim can mail a receipt for the payment \u2014 all in an attempt to make the scheme look official.\u201d One thing that hasn\u2019t changed: threats of arrest, deportation and other punishment to motivate the victims to pay up. http://1.usa.gov/1MTiMCl\n** A message from the Campaign to Fix the Debt: We need to encourage all the candidates for president to talk about how they would fix the debt.

Taxes may have gotten short shrift in last night\u2019s GOP debates, but they\u2019re bound to be a major topic in the presidential race sooner or later. In preparation for that, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and Fix the Debt put out a \u201cFiscal FactChecker\u201d with 16 \u201cbudget myths\u201d to look out for. On the tax side, they include: tax cuts pay for themselves by stimulating the economy, the federal debt problem can be fixed solely by taxing the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, the tax rate can be dramatically lowered by closing a few \u201cegregious loopholes, and \u201cany tax increases will cripple economic growth.\u201d The full report has much more detail on these and other fiscal matters, along with some handy charts and graphs. http://bit.ly/1IoEcns\nSTATE UPDATE \u2014 \nN.C. SENATE LOOKS TO PIN DOWN TAX BREAKS. North Carolina Senate Republicans are pushing a bill that \u201ccalls for three constitutional amendments, one of which would cap income taxes on corporations or individuals at 5 percent,\u201d WRAL reports. \u201cNorth Carolina's corporate income tax is already slated to fall under that level, but the individual income taxes currently sit at 5.75 percent, and most plans that have been floated so far this session don't anticipate going under 5 percent.\u201d Voters would decide on the amendments during the presidential primary vote in March. The change could have a price tag of somewhere between $1.7 billion and $2 billion. The full story: http://bit.ly/1T8jT0o\n\u2018KINGDOM OF HEAVEN\u2019 TAX DODGER TO SPEND TWO YEARS IN PRISON. A Minnesota woman, 56, has been ordered to spend two years in prison and will pay nearly $200,000 for evading income taxes for multiple years after claiming she and her husband were permanent residents of the \u201cKingdom of Heaven\u201d \u2014 not the U.S. Tami Mae May \u201cwas sentenced Tuesday in federal court in Minneapolis for not filing income tax returns or paying income tax from 1998 until 2005, despite receiving payments from customers of the family business, D & T & Son Excavating in Coon Rapids, totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars,\u201d The Star Tribune reports. The full story: http://strib.mn/1gNu6nr\nTHREE MEN INDICTED FOR TAX CREDITS SCAM IN VIRGINIA. Three men were indicted on federal charges on Thursday in Richmond, Va., for \u201cconspiracy to defraud the United States and aiding in the preparation of 19 false and fraudulent U.S. individual tax returns,\u201d WTVR reports. The indictment states the two men presented themselves as tax preparers in 2011 and conducted business out of a place called Mo\u2019 Money Taxes. The men \u201ccreated and inflated fictitious and fraudulent tax credits, including the Earned Income Credit and the American Opportunity credit, to claim tax refunds that customers were not entitled to receive.\u201d The full story: http://bit.ly/1IR04JH\nSUPREME COURT TO HEAR CLEVELAND \u2018JOCK TAX\u2019 CASE?\u00a0In a motion filed Wednesday, Cleveland asked for time to petition the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of the \u201cjock tax\u201d imposed on visiting athletes. \u201cCleveland asked the Ohio Supreme Court to stay its ruling in April overturning the tax method until it can petition the nation's highest court. Once it appeals, the U.S. Supreme Court will then decide whether to hear the case,\u201d Northeast Ohio Media Group writes. The Ohio Supreme Court has ruled that Cleveland must determine tax from the amount of days the visiting player works in a year, the way seven other cities impose the jock tax.

CASH: The number of euro notes issued by the central bank of tiny Luxembourg surged by 15 percent in 2013, almost double the grand duchy\u2019s GDP, Bloomberg reported, citing a report from the law-enforcement consortium Europol. A likely explanation: French, German and Belgian account holders in Luxembourg were cashing out their accounts to stay one step ahead of new rules that will largely erase the country\u2019s bank secrecy laws and prompt it to exchange information with other nations. http://bloom.bg/1IQAPXU\nTHE TAX DODGER FROM IPANEMA: Facing its own plague of tax avoidance, Brazil is offering amnesty to the holders of some $150 billion in unreported assets stashed in tax havens and secret accounts. The financially strapped nation hopes to raise $3 billion through the effort. But Reuters reports that the 35 percent penalty that amnesty seekers would have to pay could sink the program. \"\u2018It's going to be a major flop. A lot of\u00a0Brazilians would like to clean up the ledger, but 35 percent is too high, the government is crazy,\u2019 said a retired top executive of a foreign bank in\u00a0Brazil\u00a0who asked not to be named.\u201d http://reut.rs/1eVDUd5\nON THE SAME SUBJECT: Three more Swiss banks that abetted tax evasion struck deals with the Justice Department through its Swiss Bank Program. Privatbank Reichmuth & Co. will pay a penalty of $2.6 million and Banque Cantonale du Jura\u00a0will pay $970,000. The third bank, Banca Intermobiliare di Investimenti e Gestioni (Suisse), avoided a penalty. All three agreed to participate in continuing investigations of tax evasion by U.S. citizens. http://1.usa.gov/1Dxh9rM\nOver and out.
