And he clearly wanted to force a confrontation at Donald Trump\u2019s Iowa news conference.\nAnyone who buys Ramos\u2019 claim that he was just a reporter trying to ask a question hasn\u2019t watched the tape carefully enough.\nRamos broke in without being called on\u2014and I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s not some polite society rule, that\u2019s basic civility when a presidential candidate is taking questions.\u00a0\nAnd this was no mere interruption.\u00a0Ramos kept talking\u2014shouting, really\u2014when Trump told him to sit down. And he wasn\u2019t attempting to ask a question, he was lecturing Trump: \u201cYou cannot deport 11 million people,\u201d \u201cYou cannot build a wall for 1,900 miles.\u201d And he continued to shout as a Trump security guy escorted him out.\nThat\u2019s not exactly the behavior of a news anchor just trying to get answers. It was a stunt, one that virtually guaranteed that Ramos would be making the TV rounds yesterday.\n\nFor those who are cheering what Ramos did, imagine how you\u2019d feel if a conservative reporter had done exactly that to a liberal politician.\nActually, you don\u2019t have to imagine. In 2012, after he took unilateral action on immigration, the Daily Caller\u2019s Neil Munro interrupted President Obama while he was making a statement.\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you favor foreigners over Americans?\u201d Munro demanded.\n\u201cExcuse me, sir. Uh, it\u2019s not time for questions, sir,\u201d the president said.\n\u201cAre you going to take questions?\u201d Munro countered.\n\u201cNot while I\u2019m speaking,\u201d said Obama, who eventually answered the question.\nSome on the right cheered, but many on the left were appalled.\nWhile Trump had the right to boot Ramos from the presser, he quickly realized that it would look heavy-handed in the next morning\u2019s headlines. When reporters, especially NBC\u2019s Kasie Hunt, pressed him on the eviction, Trump shrewdly said he was open to talking to Ramos, and later engaged him in what amounted to a five-minute debate.\nThe Donald turned some questions back on the anchor, asking him if it was all right if he deported gang members who are here illegally.\nIt was an \u201cI paid for this microphone, Mr. Green\u201d moment for Trump.\u00a0He was, after all, seen taking on an agenda-driven journalist on his own signature issue.\nAnd those kind of fireworks are precisely why Fox, CNN and MSNBC were carrying his presser live\u2014something that no other candidate is afforded\u2014as they did with his events last week in New Hampshire and Alabama.\nBut Ramos' ploy worked as well, bringing him an avalanche of publicity that played well with his Univision audience.\nI understand that for Ramos, a legal Mexican immigrant, this is a very personal issue. But there's a difference between being tough and just being rude.\nRamos has a history of combativeness. In an interview last year, he told President Obama that \"you have destroyed families\" by not easing deportations sooner and that the president was known as the deporter-in-chief. Does that sound like a journalist or an advocate?\nAt a House presser that year, Ramos demanded to know why John Boehner was \"blocking\" action on immigration reform and urged him to call a vote, saying: \"You can do it, Mr. Speaker.\"\nJournalist or advocate?\nAnd there's a bit of personal history between him and Trump, who is generally portrayed negatively in Spanish-language media. Trump posted a handwritten interview request that included Ramos' cellphone number. And, as The Donald pointed out in their exchange, he is suing Univision for $500 million for dropping his beauty pageants.\nRamos is probably quite pleased with himself. Had he waited for Trump to call on him, he could proudly claim credit for the aggressive line of questioning. Instead, he hijacked the press conference for his own purposes.\nClick for more from Media Buzz\nmedia-buzz\n\nMedia Buzz, hosted by Howard Kurtz, airs on Sundays at 11AM and 5PM ET on Fox News Channel.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this show\n\n\n\n", "byline": "", "description": "If Jorge Ramos looked like an activist disrupting an event the other night, perhaps that is no accident.", "title": "Why Jorge Ramos crossed the line in confronting Donald Trump", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/XdkZD4z_rPI/", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Jorge Ramos", "Howard Kurtz", "Neil Munro", "John Boehner", "Kasie Hunt", "Donald Trump", "Adam Green"], "orgs": ["MSNBC", "Univision"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-08-28 01:32:58", "org": "fox", "article_id": "560a2350e99b99db9a5cf3be95997395", "date_access": "2015-08-27 09:30:03.753615"}
