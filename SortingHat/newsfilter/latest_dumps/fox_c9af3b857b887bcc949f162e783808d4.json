Liberal outlets and Democratic donors are pressuring her to offer substantive answers to the growing body of evidence against her and her husband and their cash fracking operation. That means she will soon have to meet the press (This time, expect a soft-focus interview with a credible but credulous reporter rather than the horror of her email press conference). While Clinton and her team are rehearsing lines that don\u2019t sound like a deposition but can get past the legal department, a more serious challenge is on the horizon. Katie Couric doesn\u2019t put you under oath. Trey Gowdy does.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner said Clinton \u201cviolated the law\u201d when she destroyed more than 30,000 emails from her time as secretary of state and that he was open to trying to subpoena her servers. And now, Clinton has been called to testify about her role in the cover-up of the Benghazi attack. She has said in the past that she would cooperate, but recently refused the offer of a closed-door chat. Will she refuse to appear in public? Would she fight a subpoena? The stakes are higher now that allegations of corruption are stacking up. Benghazi leads to questions about her servers and destruction of evidence. The destruction of evidence leads to questions about the new allegations of official misconduct. But does she dare say no?\n\nThe high-stakes legal gambits that have been the hallmark of the Clintons\u2019 decades in Washington are heading into new territory. Whatever else you think about her, at least everyone can agree that Clinton\u2019s candidacy means business for the D.C. defense bar. As to whether voters wish to endure more rounds of legal wrangling and Clinton drama is up to them.\n\nYou\u2019d better watch it - In the Fox News investigation, \u201cThe Tangled Clinton Web,\u201d anchor Bret Baier follows the money\u2014where it came from, where it went, and how it may have changed American policy.

Sen. Marco Rubio R-Fla., returns to the state on a hot streak with higher poll numbers following his successful launch. But Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., an Iowa favorite from a previous foray, is looking to do in Iowa what he recently did on a return trip to New Hampshire: show conservatives he\u2019s still their man and demonstrate that he can handle the heat of being in the top tier.\n\n[Walker is barnstorming through the conservative counties of northwest Iowa today ahead of Saturday\u2019s event.]\n\nHomers - But while Rubio and Walker would need a win or at least a good showing in Iowa to propel themselves into the final fight with establishmentarian Jeb Bush, Iowa means everything to the candidates who would need a win there to fuel their candidacies.\u00a0\u00a0 Former Gov. Mike Huckabee, R-Ark., might be considered the favorite in a state where he won a stunning victory in 2008, but former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., and former Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, also have favorability in the state. Newbies like Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., have put a lot of time in the Iowa, however, and might catch fire among libertarian-leaning Republicans, while unknowns like Carly Fiorina, who spent the past five days in Iowa, might take with voters there too. Not on the schedule is Ben Carson, who is expected to launch his candidacy next week in Detroit.\n\n[Cruz heads to Tulsa, Oklahoma today for a rally with former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and Utah Senator Mike Lee.]\n\nComing in hot - The Iowa x-factor is Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who is an evangelical heartthrob and making a direct appeal for libertarian-leaning GOPers as well. He arrives packing a bit of baggage. A controversy has brewed up around Cruz\u2019s visit to the home of a gay New York billionaire. On Monday, Cruz spoke at a reception hosted by hotel moguls Ian Reisner and Mati Weiderpass. Cruz reportedly spoke with the two about support for Israel, an issue on which they all agree. Cruz attacked the NYT for suggesting he was, as a staunch opponent of same-sex marriage, being hypocritical. And as if to show his seriousness on the subject, Cruz has reportedly now filed a Senate bill to forbid same-sex marriage through a constitutional amendment.\u00a0 There was also a kerfuffle over the fact that Cruz was the only senator to miss the vote on the confirmation of Loretta Lynch as attorney general.\n\n[Watch Fox: Senior National Correspondent John Roberts reports on the events from the Faith and Freedom Coalition live from Iowa.]\n\nFerocious ObamaCare fight looming for Sixteeners - TPM: \u201cThe Senate's top five Republican leaders have cosponsored legislation to extend until 2017 the Obamacare insurance subsidies that may be struck down by the Supreme Court this summer. The legislation, offered by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), one of the most politically vulnerable Senate incumbents in 2016, would maintain the federal HealthCare.gov tax credits at stake in King v. Burwell through the end of August 2017. The bill was unveiled this week with 29 other cosponsors, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and his four top deputies, Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), John Thune (R-SD), John Barrasso (R-WY) and Roy Blunt (R-MO). Another cosponsor is Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS), the chairman of the conference's electoral arm.\u201d\n\nKASICH SETS COLLISION COURSE WITH JEB\nOhio Gov. John Kasich is leaning into his expected presidential campaign this weekend. His in Washington for several speeches and is also expected to huddle with some of his former Hill colleagues as well a morning show double header on Sunday. And as he does, he sets himself on a collision course with establishment pick Jeb Bush. While Bush is busy Hoovering up cash around the country, Kasich is looking to win a war of ideas. He\u2019s selling an updated version of Bush\u2019s brother\u2019s compassionate conservatism, which means Kasich\u2019s path doesn\u2019t run through winning the conservative melee and being Bush\u2019s eventual foe. Instead, Kasich would have to try to disrupt Bush\u2019s hold on the establishment. That\u2019s a tall order, but if Bush continues to see hardening resistance in the party for his candidacy, establishment voters and donors might be open to an alternative.\n\nSo you\u2019re saying you\u2019re not a fan - Philip Klein lacerates Kasich: \u201cOhio Gov. John Kasich has made clear that he's seriously considering running for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. If he formally announces, it will be important for conservative voters to punish him for his expansion of President Obama's healthcare law in his state.\u201d\n\nLegit? - Tampa Bay Times: \u201cThe Bush campaign is reportedly planning to reverse the role of Bush\u2019s campaign committee and the \u2018independent\u2019 super PAC supporting him - so that the super PAC would essentially become Bush\u2019s campaign committee. The reason for this audacious move is simple: super PACs can be funded with unlimited donations, while a candidate\u2019s campaign is limited to contributions of $2,700 per donor per election\u2026The only problem is that the Bush scheme, as reported, would be illegal.\u201d\n\n[Bush\u2019s super PAC hosts a donor conference in Miami, Florida this weekend.

He didn\u2019t show his heart,\u2019 said the former governor of Florida. \u2018He didn\u2019t send a signal that he cared about people, when he did.\u2019\u201d\n\n[WaPo: \u201cPresumed Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush says he disagrees with critical comments about Israel made Monday by former Secretary of State James Baker\u2026\u201d]\n\nMazel tov, y\u2019all - Former President George W.

Ted Cruz and Rick Perry will also be there seeking Adelson\u2019s support.\n\nA fabulous Fred Barnes lede - Weekly Standard: \u201cIn 1974, Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich Hayek criticized those who believed they could measure the real-world impact of economic theories with scientific precision. They were wrong, Hayek said in his Nobel lecture, entitled \u2018The Pretence of Knowledge.\u2019 They didn\u2019t have enough solid information. What they lacked couldn\u2019t be reduced to a number. It wasn\u2019t quantifiable. Yet economists continued to \u2018proceed on the fiction that the factors which they can measure are the only ones that are relevant.\u2019 It might seem a stretch, but Hayek\u2019s insight applies to politics, and notably to the 2016 presidential campaign.\u201d\n\nCHARLES KOCH MAKES HIS CASE\nUSA Today: \u201cCharles Koch and his industrial empire are mounting an aggressive new defense of his company and his political advocacy, with the billionaire insisting his work to help elect Republicans is rooted in his decades-long quest to \u2018increase well-being in society.\u2019 \u2018We are doing all of this to make more money?\u2019 Koch said of charges that his drive to limit government's power will increase his bottom line. \u2018I mean, that is so ludicrous...I don't know how they can say that with a straight face,\u2019 he said...His comments came during an interview with USA TODAY in his office at Koch Industries, where he discussed a wide range of topics - from the nearly daily death threats against him to what he termed the \u2018hysteria\u2019 in some quarters about global warming.\u201d\n\nSOMETIMES, YOU JUST HAVE TO RIDE IT OUT\nA wardrobe malfunction at a horse race left spectators with an eyeful of one of the participants, and no, not the horse.

At least it wasn\u2019t during a Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\u201cBut what strikes me about all this is the unbelievable arrogance of the Clintons who do this in the full expectation that they're going to get away with it.
