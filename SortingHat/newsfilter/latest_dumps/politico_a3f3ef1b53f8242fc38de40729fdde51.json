Bush administration who has advised Kasich, Christie, Rubio and Jeb Bush on the need for a substantially larger fleet but believes the only way to pay for it would be to cut other programs, particularly social programs. \n A number of experts also pointed out that even the Navy\u2019s current shipbuilding plan is billions of dollars short of what is needed and GOP majorities in both houses of Congress have been unwilling to lift strict caps on government spending in order to cover the gaps. \n But the longing of GOP defense hawks for a bigger fleet has lasted generations. It can be traced, like so much else, to Ronald Reagan, who justified his unfulfilled dream of a 600-ship fleet by saying \u201cthe way to prevent war is to prepare for it.\u201d \n It\u2019s been one of the most reliable campaign pledges in recent presidential elections, sparking a memorable putdown by President Barack Obama when Mitt Romney proposed a 350-ship Navy in a debate in 2012 by arguing the fleet was the smallest it had been since 1917. (\u201cWe also have fewer horses and bayonets,\u201d Obama shot back.) \nPOLITICO PRO\n It\u2019s a love affair steeped in the ideology that more warships bristling with aircraft and missiles translates into more security \u2014 and that control of the high seas will not only guarantee international trade but also check the worst ambitions of other powers like Russia and China. And it\u2019s also fueled by a powerful shipbuilding lobby in Washington that is also calling anew for billions more in federal spending to beef up the sea service. \n Christie was the first to raise the issue earlier this election season, saying the Navy \u201cshould be an armada without equal,\u201d and pledging, if elected president, to reach the goal of 350 ships. Walker also noted earlier this year that \u201cwe\u2019re at, what, 275, 280 vessels right now? We\u2019re headed down toward 250. That\u2019s less than half of where we were under Reagan.\u201d \n And on Monday, Kasich weighed in, saying that \u201creinvigorating the Navy\u2019s ability to project power globally is critical to defending and advancing American interests, including ensuring the free flow of global commerce.\u201d Rubio has been more nuanced, calling for increasing the number of aircraft carrier strike groups from 10 to 12 (the newest carrier, about to enter the fleet, is estimated to cost $13 billion). \n One of the key architects of the 350-ship Navy proposal is John Lehman, who served as Reagan\u2019s Navy secretary and said he has advised Christie, Kasich, Rubio, Walker, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and \u201ca couple of others\u201d seeking the GOP nomination on the proposal. \n \u201cYou just cannot run the Navy the way the Carter administration did, and now the Obama administration is doing,\u201d Lehman said. \u201cThe Navy is just too small. What\u2019s happening with the Navy is almost an exact replay of what happened in the \u201970s.\u201d \n He noted that congressionally mandated commissions, including last year\u2019s high-profile National Defense Panel that reviewed the Obama administration\u2019s long-term defense strategy, have concluded that the Navy must get larger. \n The Republican presidential contenders, Lehman said, were basing their numbers on those and other recommendations. \n \u201cI hope this really solidifies into a strongly supported Republican platform and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been trying to support anyone who asks,\u201d he said. \n The candidates have key allies in Congress, such as Rep. Randy Forbes, a Virginia Republican who chairs the House Armed Services subcommittee that oversees the Navy\u2019s shipbuilding budget. \n Forbes, whose district is a major shipbuilding hub, supports a boost in funding for the Navy through broad increases in defense spending and through a hike in Navy spending relative to other parts of the Pentagon\u2019s budget \u2014 namely, the Army and Air Force. Traditionally, the Pentagon has tried to keep the peace among the three military departments \u2014 the Army, Air Force and Navy, which includes the Marine Corps \u2014 by dividing up each year\u2019s budget by roughly one-third. But given the importance of sea power to American prosperity and the potential dangers from China and Russia, Washington must \u201creevaluate\u201d those distributions, Forbes said. \nAlso on POLITICO\nMICHAEL CROWLEY\n \u201cI think what we have to do is present a fair assessment, both to policymakers and the general public as to what it takes to defend America,\u201d he said. \u201cI think [Americans] will respond to that, and I think we\u2019re seeing that across the country today as they realize that the pendulum really has swung too far.\u201d \n But others who are intimately familiar with the defense budget contend that shifting such an enormous amount of money from sister branches of the military to the Navy will meet fierce opposition from members of Congress in both parties, whose constituents and campaign donors would likely feel the brunt. \n \u201cYou may have to shift from someone\u2019s district to someone else\u2019s,\u201d said Jacques Gansler, who served as the Pentagon\u2019s top weapons buyer in the 1990s. \n The campaign season proposals dovetail with a major new push by the shipbuilding industry. The Navy League of the United States, the leading industry association for Navy contractors, recently launched a 16-month grass-roots campaign titled \u201cAmerica\u2019s Strength: Investing in the Navy-Marine Corps Team\u201d to build support for more funding for the sea service. \n The public advocacy effort asserts the Navy is at a \u201cbreaking point,\u201d citing years worth of overdue maintenance, stress on sailors and their families, and gaps in coverage near global hot spots. \n A growing roster of Republican hopefuls, including Sen. Marco Rubio, are going full steam ahead, in making the case for dozens of new warships. | Getty \n\n \n \u201cWe are concerned that if the Department of the Navy is required to continue to respond to crisis after crisis without the funding needed to build new ships, repair old equipment and provide routine maintenance to existing equipment,\u2019 the Navy League said, \u201cthe nation risks permanent damage to our national defense and negative impacts on the domestic and international economies that rely on the safety and security that U.S. sea power provides.\u201d \n But the league\u2019s proposal is far less ambitious than the one being put forward on the campaign trail. For instance, it calls for maintaining 308 ships in the fleet. \n Even some who support a significantly larger Navy question the wisdom of the GOP refrain. \n Richard Danzig, who served as Navy secretary in the Clinton administration and advised candidate Obama said \u201cmore is better than less.\u201d \n \u201cWhat the Navy does is provide a presence, which can be used for signaling or for calming,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is very helpful to have a substantial number of ships available to do that. If you are deploying ships to the Persian Gulf to signal commitment, for example, to countries in that region, it is highly desirable that you also have enough ships to signal commitment in the South China Sea. There are good reasons why people should value a bigger Navy.\u201d \n But he said throwing out numbers is \u201cjust a substitute for not thinking through what you really want or optimizing what you have,\u201d he believes. For example, Danzig said, \u201cin a world of cyber conflict, more ships that are not highly well-defended against cyberattack just renders more targets that can be disabled or become hostages, rather than real benefit.\u201d \n \u201cYou tie yourself to an artificial number and so you start to contort your budget to achieve your number instead of achieving the strongest overall Navy,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that those who are commenting on it in this political arena haven\u2019t yet shown that have in any way thought through what they really want and need. Instead they are substituting a round number \u2014 just happens to be a round number \u2014 for what they think is reliable. That is more sloganeering than strategic thought.\u201d \n Philip Ewing contributed to this report. \n\nAustin Wright is a defense reporter for Politico.\n\n                                            By \nAmb.
