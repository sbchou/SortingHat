{"body": "Several presidential candidates spoke on Aug. 23 political talk shows, taking jabs at each other and defending themselves on positions they have taken as the 2016 campaign cycle begins to pick up steam. Here are some top quotes.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want me as your vice president.\u201d\n\u2013Democratic presidential contender James Webb on whether he would agree to be someone\u2019s running mate, on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\u201cYes, except that I\u2019m telling the truth and she\u2019s not.\u201d\n\u2013New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d on Hillary Clinton\u2019s statements she will be exonerated over claims that she misused a personal email account. Mr. Christie has said in the past that he, too, would be exonerated over \u201cBridgegate.\u201d\n\u201cI would not amend the constitution. No, I would not amend it. No, absolutely not\u2026 Donald Trump may not be a politician, but he\u2019s sure acting like a politician in this regard. There are two funda\nmental things that must be done and they never have been done. We must secure our border, it is not rocket science, it is our job to do it, not anybody else\u2019s job to do it. It takes money, manpower and technology, it hasn\u2019t been done in 25 years. We must fix the legal immigration system, which is contributing to this problem,\u201d\n\u2013Carly Fiorina, Republican presidential candidate, on Donald Trump and immigration issues.\n\u201cRead my lips. Listen very carefully to what I am saying. I said there are caves. There are caves that they utilize. Those caves can be eliminated. There are a number of possibilities. That could be one of them. I am not talking about killing people, no people with drones,\u201d\n\u2013Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d on using drones to go after the caves along the U.S.-Mexico border used for illegal immigration purposes.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get great people that know what they\u2019re doing, not a bunch of political hacks.\u201d\n\u2013GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump during an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d, about how he will act on his proposed policies on illegal immigration.\n______________________________________________________\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.
