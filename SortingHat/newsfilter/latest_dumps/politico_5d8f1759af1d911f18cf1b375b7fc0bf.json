Mark Meadows improperly paid an employee severance.\nThe Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust wrote OCE a letter last week asking the panel to \u201cimmediately investigate and take appropriate action\u201d into Meadows\u2019 alleged breach of House Ethics Rules for paying his chief of staff after he no longer worked for the lawmaker.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cIt appears Representative Meadows permitted a former employee to remain on payroll and violated the House Code of Official Conduct,\u201d the group wrote.\nFACT Executive Director Matthew Whitaker, a former U.S. attorney in Iowa, said that \"one of the rock hard rules in all of the government, and certainly in Congress, is you can't pay someone who is not working.\"\nWhitaker said the group is nonpartisan and is \"equal opportunity\" accountability group.\nWhen asked about FACT's calls for an investigation, Meadows' spokeswoman Alyssa Farrah said \u201cwe are not aware of any rules barring severance.\"\nShe added: \"Mr. Meadows\u2019 commitment to being a good steward of taxpayer dollars is well-documented. At the end of both 2013 and 2014 Congressman Meadows returned over $100,000 remaining from his office budget to the American taxpayer.\"\nPOLITICO reported earlier this month that Meadows\u2019 chief of staff Kenneth West stopped working for the North Carolina Republican on May 21, yet continued to be paid through Aug. 15. A Meadow\u2019s spokeswoman at the time said West was paid for \u201cvacation and severance.\u201d\nBut severance pay appears to be against House rules. The House Ethics Manual says, \u201ccompensation may be received only for duties performed within the preceding month.\u201d Additionally, the Members\u2019 Congressional Handbook says an employee must \u201cperform official duties commensurate with the compensation received.\u201d\nAdditionally, if a congressional aide is given a lump-sum payment, it must be disclosed separately. In House disbursement records, Meadows reported West's pay from May through August as regular compensation, though he changed West's position to \"senior advisor.\"\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Conservative watchdog wants Meadows investigated", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/mark-meadows-investigation-sought-office-congressional-ethics-214143", "topics": ["abortion", "immigration"], "people": ["Katy O'Donnell", "Michael Grunwald", "Bashar Assad", "Philip Gordon", "Daniel Webster", "Anna Palmer", "Hadas Gold", "Vladimir Putin", "Kelsey Sutton", "Steve Latourette", "Matthew Whitaker", "Joe Biden", "Theodoric Meyer", "Brian Mahoney", "John Boehner", "Caitlin Emma", "Pope Francis", "Brianna Ehley", "Victoria Guida", "Nick Gass", "Jack Shafer", "Robert B.
