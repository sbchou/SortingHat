{"body": "  ATLANTA \u2014 They packed a ballroom for Carly Fiorina, clutching copies of her books. They packed it again for Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Former Texas governor Rick Perry, barely registering in the polls, held the stage like a front-runner. The 700 or so activists who filled the hotel ballroom here Friday for the seventh annual conference organized by the conservative blog RedState were energized by the Republican presidential debates held the night before \u2014 and excited for what feels like a new phase in the 2016 contest. But they were not ready to pick a favorite. There was fresh enthusiasm for Fiorina, the former Silicon Valley executive who stood out during Thursday night\u2019s debate among the lower-tier candidates, and angst about Donald Trump\u2019s chaotic bid. Still, at the gathering \u2014 which has replaced the defunct Iowa straw poll as a sort of second kick-off for the 2016 campaign \u2014 the energy in the room showed that no one had been ruled out of the race.  In the halls and in the seats, the conservative base was demanding that its candidates move right, and the candidates were obliging. \u201cJeb Bush says that we need to be ready to lose the primary to win the general election,\u201d said Jindal, who has been lagging in polls but has begun taking swipes at the former Florida governor, who is pushing the GOP to adopt a softer tone that might appeal to centrist general-election voters. \u201cI disagree with that,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cThat is saying we need to hide our conservative beliefs and get the left and the media to like us. I\u2019m here to tell you that if we do that again, we lose again.\u201d Bush is scheduled to address the conference Saturday and confront activists who think the party lost its way under President George W. Bush, his brother. The nine other candidates visiting the conference are more in sync. All are on record, for example, as supporting the end of taxpayer funds for Planned Parenthood.  Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), who skipped the conference for a campaign trip to South Carolina, spent part of the day sparring with Christie over Bush-era surveillance tactics. RedState\u2019s outgoing editor in chief, Erick Erickson, has helped set the tone for these arguments. He has written jeremiads against the party with titles like \u201cEunuch Mitch McConnell Squeals Like a Pig\u201d and \u201cHouse Conservatives Have the Power and Should Depose Speaker John Boehner.\u201d  \u201cA lot of the tea party disconnect that you\u2019ve seen was a reaction to the fact that George W. Bush refused to stand up to the appropriators in his party,\u201d said Leon Wolf, 37, a senior writer at RedState. The tea party movement lives on at RedState. Erickson introduced Rubio not as a linchpin in the 2013 immigration debate but as the insurgent candidate who beat a centrist Republican in his 2010 Senate race.  Rubio\u2019s speech barely touched on the roiling primary fight. Instead, he stuck to his usual themes of generational change and reminded the attentive conservatives before him about his work on foreign affairs in the Senate, where he has become a leading hawk. Outside the InterContinental, the hosting hotel in Buckhead \u2014 an Atlanta suburb dotted with pricey fashion stores and chain steakhouses often found on expense accounts \u2014 homemaker Mary Howard of Indiana debated her top three candidates with Loren Heal, 52, an Illinois activist. They agreed on all three: Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) in first place, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker in second and Fiorina running a close third. \u201cI liked her before, but I really like her now,\u201d Howard said. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to pick anything this early, and you know, I didn\u2019t think she was that serious months ago. But things have changed.\u201d  Why the move toward Fiorina? \u201cI don\u2019t want to say the obvious \u2014 she\u2019s a woman \u2014 but she is a very smart businesswoman, and that\u2019s what this country could use in the White House.\u201d Heal said he had little patience for Trump, the real estate magnate who leads in polls but whose bombastic style has unnerved some in the party. \u201cNot suitable at all,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m astonished people aren\u2019t seeing through his act. He\u2019s the perfect example of someone who uses government for his own means.\u201d Not everyone was so cool on Trump. Few attendees appreciated his flirtation with a third-party run, but rebellion inside the Republican Party was fine by them. For others, a rebellion that could split votes and put the Clintons back into power was too much.  Fiorina drew a rapturous response when she tore into Hillary Rodham Clinton, calling the former secretary of state and Democratic front-runner dishonest. \u201cShe did lie about Benghazi, she did lie about her e-mails, she did lie about her server,\u201d Fiorina said. Fiorina favored a Republican \u201cnominee who throws every punch.\u201d She was referring to herself, but RedState attendees saw plenty of fighters.  The unease among some about Trump did not stop people from asking if there were spare tickets to his scheduled Saturday night appearance at the nearby College Football Hall of Fame.
