Scott Walker attempted to clarify his position on the United States' relationship with China on Friday, rejecting the notion that calling for the cancellation of an official state visit amounts to calling for a freeze on relations with the Chinese government. \nEarlier in the week, Walker called on President Barack Obama to cancel the official state visit from Chinese President Xi Jinping next month. In his statement, Walker cited Chinese cyberattacks, military aggression in the South China Sea, persecution of Christians and dissidents, as well as government manipulation of the country's currency as reasons to \"show some backbone.\"\nAppearing on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Walker responded to a question from Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass, who inquired as to how he would influence North Korea without a relationship with China.\n\"Well you do have to have one, and I'm not talking about walking away with that, nor am I talking about walking away from trade,\" Walker said. \"Trade with China and many other places around the world is important to the country as a whole. Heck, it's important to my state, it was important to the state I was in yesterday in Iowa out there.\"\nBut when it comes to an official state visit, the governor said, the U.S. needs to \"stand up and do something about it.\"\nWalker was speaking from Charleston, South Carolina, where he will deliver a foreign policy address at The Citadel later on Friday.\n\n                                            By \nCaleb Hannan\n\n\n                                            By \nMichael Brown\n\n\n                                            By \n                                                    Amb.
