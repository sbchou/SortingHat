SPEAKER-ELECT? If you have to be a little bit crazy to run for president, you have to be pretty well certifiable to want to be speaker of the House of Representatives.  And yet, three seemingly sane humans will today stand for election among their fellow members of the Republican House majority.  There are certainly reasons to do it. Aside from patriotism and duty, there is the prestige of being only the 54nd speaker in 226 years \u2013 to follow in the footsteps of the likes of Henry Clay and Sam Rayburn and be two heartbeats away from the presidency.  Plus, you get a very swank office and a whole cyclone of staff, security and various upkissers swirling around you at all times. And when you\u2019re done, even if you finish in disgrace, you can go get good and rich.  But the job itself hardly seems worth it, especially these days. It\u2019s so bad that John Boehner, like another famous German Catholic, took a surprise retirement.  Boehner may have only been a few steps ahead of the lynch mob in his caucus when he left, but he will still be the first speaker since Tip O\u2019Neill to leave under his own steam and not be forced out by voters or by scandal.  So what\u2019s the deal with Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who has an actual risk of contracting the speaker-itis ailment? The others running today can do so content in the knowledge that they are all but certain to fail, making a candidacy an appealing way to either make oneself more famous or make an ideological point.  McCarthy, though, is actually likely to end up with the job after an election ordeal that is only the amuse-bouche before the feast of degradation and frustration that lies ahead.  The election this afternoon will go like this: McCarthy is all but certain to win a majority of the 247 Republican House members, but not get the 218 votes he needs at the end of the month to be elected speaker by the whole House. With enough GOP members having vowed to not vote with their party\u2019s pick, they can deny McCarthy a win on the first ballot, and, they hope, force the vote into chaos and allow other options \u2013 ranging from intriguing to absolutely batty \u2013 to come to the fore.  To prevent this from happening, McCarthy will spend the rest of the month making impossible promises to mistrusting adversaries. Those promises will make his eventual job so much more miserable.  Unable to deliver in office the unicorns of conservative excellence and purity promised by his foes, McCarthy will be called a traitor and a failure and the same folks who have reviled Boehner will threaten and thunder over McCarthy.  And the same Washington elites who deplored Boehner for not being able to simultaneously ignore and lead his own members will still be tweeting away in their just-so Capitol Hill mews or their paneled study in Great Falls.  So, um, congratulations, Mr. Speaker-elect?  JEB ESCALATES ATTACKS ON RUBIO USA Today: \u201c[Jeb Bush] repeatedly, and not subtly,\u00a0attacked those rivals\u00a0\u2014 particularly fellow Floridian\u00a0Marco Rubio, the senator who\u2019s competing for the same segment of the party's primary electorate. \u2018If you\u2019ve been in\u00a0Washington, D.C., the last six years as a\u00a0United States senator, what have you done?\u2019 Bush asked the crowd at a coffee shop in\u00a0Muscatine\u00a0on Wednesday morning. \u2018You\u2019ve pushed back against\u00a0President Obama, and I admire that, but there\u2019s been no change in the culture. We still are stuck, there\u2019s still gridlock.\u2019 And while that jab could\u2019ve been aimed at any one of four incumbent senators in the GOP field, his next one was a bit more specific. \u2018By the way,\u2019 Bush said, \u2018I think if congressmen \u2014 and women \u2014 are elected to serve, they actually ought to show up and vote.\u2019\u201d  Jeb says he doesn\u2019t need Dubya to \u2018rescue\u2019 him - In an interview on CBS News, Jeb Bush said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to rescue me,\u2019 Bush said of his brother. \u2018I am on the path.

This is my job.\u201d  [The Bush Super PAC has started shelling New Hampshire television viewers with new ads.]  Team Rubio warns of weak fundraising report - AP: \u201cAhead of what is expected to be a new and disappointing fundraising report next week, Rubio's aides have stressed that their thriftiness gives them a competitive advantage over campaigns with more money.\u201d  Trump says he\u2019s \u2018satisfied\u2019 and wants to stay at current poll level - The Hill: \u201cDonald Trump on Wednesday acknowledged that his months long momentum in polls has likely ended, while expressing a desire to stay atop the GOP presidential field.\u00a0 \u2018When I started I went to 8 [percent in the polls] and they said, \u2018He plateaued.\u2019\u00a0 Then the next week I went to 16 [percent], right?\u2019 Trump said during a campaign event in Waterloo, Iowa. \u2018And they said, \u2018Oh, well, but that's a plateau.\u2019 Then I went to 20, to 24 [percent] \u2014 we had a poll today, I think it was 35 or 34 [percent], it\u2019s crazy,\u2019 the celebrity businessman said. \u2018I want to plateau now, I'm satisfied,\u2019 Trump added.\u201d  [Act II? - Donald Trump seeks to plot his second act as the race really starts to heat up. Chris Stirewalt and Howard Kurtz give their take on \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d Watch here.]  Carson not sorry for saying bystanders should attack mass shooters - USA Today: \u201cRepublican presidential candidate Ben Carson on Wednesday sought to clarify his remarks that he would try to fight back against a shooter and not \u2018just stand there\u2019 in a mass shooting\u2026Speaking Wednesday morning on CBS, Carson his comments were intended to help people prepare for future attacks. \u2018I want to plant in people\u2019s minds what to do in a situation like this because this unfortunately probably is not going to be the last time this happens,\u2019 he said.\u201d  Burn book - WashEx: \u201cDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton sent a signed copy of her memoir\u00a0Hard Choices\u00a0to several of the major Republican presidential candidates. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul responded by signing the book with a message for Clinton and auctioning the memoir on\u00a0eBay. \u2018Hillary, you refused to provide security for our mission in Benghazi,\u2019 Paul wrote. \u2018Should forever preclude you from higher office! Rand Paul.\u2019 The book signed by Paul and Clinton has already received several bids online, in excess of $300 as of press time.\u2019\u201d  Nebraska endorsement for Carly - Omaha World-Herald: \u201cRep. Jeff Fortenberry, R-Neb., is backing Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, as are Howard and Rhonda Hawks. Howard Hawks is the founder and chairman of Omaha-based Tenaska, a private energy company, and a University of Nebraska regent. Rhonda Hawks is president of the Hawks Foundation.

WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026 It was 252 million years ago that nearly all life on earth vanished because of what paleontologists believe was a massive volcanic explosion. But some were able to survive this environmental catastrophe. How did they do it? WaPo brings us the story of two scientists who uncovered a theory about the \u201cGreat Dying\u201d writing: \u201cThe key to survival seems to lie in food webs, the complicated interactions you probably mapped out in middle school that illustrate\u00a0how species in an ecosystem get food \u2014 and avoid getting turned into food. A stable food web can isolate a community from environmental disasters, even the loss of\u00a0some\u00a0species, and the best food webs are like a well-built building: individual bricks may\u00a0crumble or be removed, but the overall structure remains sound.\u201d  Got a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

Pro-GOP group America Rising has released a 36-page report documenting long-time Clinton aide Huma Abedin\u2019s work with Hillary Clinton over the years. Abedin, who is scheduled to testify at the House special committee on Benghazi in the coming weeks, has come under scrutiny for simultaneous roles in the State Department, Clinton Foundation, and consulting firm Teneo. In light of uncovered emails that reveal conflicts of interest in Abedin\u2019s multiple roles, America Rising compiled articles and book excerpts all the way from Abedin\u2019s White House intern days to her upward progression in the Clinton political universe.  Awkward defense of attack super PAC - In her interview with PBS, Clinton claimed that her campaign did not coordinate with the pro-Clinton group Correct the Record to attack Sen. Bernie Sanders. But a few months ago, the PAC split from its parent just so they could coordinate with the campaign. Hmmm\u2026  Trading her Prada for flip flops on Wall Street - Reuters: \u201cU.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will unveil on Thursday a sweeping plan to curb what she has called the abuses of Wall Street, proposing everything from raising the fines that can be levied by regulators to requiring executives to bear some of those costs. The outline of Clinton\u2019s plan, which was provided to Reuters for review, also includes strengthening the \u2018Volcker rule\u2019 in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and imposing a new tax on high-frequency trading. Clinton's push to get tough on Wall Street comes as she is fending off a challenge from U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, her main rival for the Democratic nomination for the November 2016 election.\u201d  Completes full reversal on trade deal - Vox: \u201cAfter months of hinting she might oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership,\u00a0Hillary Clinton made it official this week. And her explanation for why she's coming out against the deal now \u2014 after years of supporting it \u2014 makes no sense\u2026She even said in 2012 that \u2018this TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements.\u2019 Now she sees things differently. In the interview with PBS\u2019s Judy Woodruff where she came out against the treaty, she cited two specific objections: It doesn't have language dealing with currency manipulation, and it has provisions that favor big drug companies over patients.\u201d  Susan Rice backhands Hillary - Free Beacon: \u201cNational Security Adviser Susan Rice [was asked by Bloomberg] to list three of Clinton\u2019s biggest accomplishments while Secretary of State, \u2026\u2018Well, first of all, we were able to bring to conclusion two long and costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and she was very much involved in supporting those transitions,\u2019 Rice said\u2026\u2018We\u2019ve been negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement to bring that to fruition,\u2019 Rice said. \u2018We are looking forward to obtaining Trade Promotion Authority from Congress. That is another significant\u00a0accomplishment.\u2019\u201d  Zing! Biden says secretary of state would be \u2018demotion\u2019 - The Hill: \u201cVice President Biden wrapped up his address to union leaders during a summit at the White House on Wednesday with a joke about being \u2018demoted to secretary of State\u2019\u2026\u2018And if I don't move, I\u2019ll be demoted to secretary of State or something like that,\u2019 Biden said to laughs as he moved to wrap up his remarks after arriving a few minutes late to the lectern. \u2018That\u2019s a joke,\u2019 he quickly added, pointing to the press in the room. \u2018That\u2019s a joke. That's a joke.\u2019\u201d  The Judge\u2019s Ruling: Laws of man and nature - Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano notes that as\u00a0Hillary Clinton seeks political gain from the tragic shooting in Roseburg, Ore., her proposed \u201cfix\u201d of\u00a0Supreme Court rulings upholding the right to bear arms would\u00a0run roughshod over the Second Amendment:\u00a0\u201cThe right to self-defense is a manifestation of the natural instinct for survival, borne in the hearts of all rational people. \u00a0But Hillary Clinton rejects that instinct because she prefers we become dependent upon the government \u2013 as long as she is running it.\u201d Read here.  TAKE FIVE: \u00a0MARQUEE MATCHUP IN GRANITE STATE New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan\u2019s announcement that she\u2019ll challenge incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte turns the spotlight to a key race for control of the Senate. Democrats see Hassan as their best chance to oust Ayotte and pick up one of five seats they need to wrest control from Republicans. In the latest episode of \u201cPower Play with Chris Stirewalt\u201d The Weekly Standard\u2019s Daniel Halper dissects the matchup and his top five Senate picks.  Halper ranks Illinois and Wisconsin as the most competitive races this cycle, followed by Florida, Ohio, and yes, New Hampshire. While Ayotte has a slight edge in early polling, Halper points to Hassan\u2019s having won state-wide and the slightly leftward lean of Granite State voters in her favor. But Ayotte\u2019s strategy of tying Hassan to the gridlock in the state capitol may take its toll. WATCH HERE.  Your picks - The current tally of Fox News First reader votes on the top five battlegrounds for control of the Senate: 1) Illinois; 2) Wisconsin; 3) Pennsylvania; 4) Ohio; 5) Florida.  Neck and neck in Ohio - Former Gov. Ted Strickland, D-Ohio, holds a razor thin lead over Republican Sen. Rob Portman, according to a\u00a0new Quinnipiac University poll. \u00a0Strickland edge, 46 percent to Portman\u2019s 43 percent, falls just outside the poll\u2019s 2.9 percent margin of error. The race has been tight since Strickland saw an early summer lead evaporate to a statistical tie in August. The Q-poll numbers come just 3 days after the Portman campaign announced it\u00a0raised more than $2 million in the quarter that just ended, and has more than $11 million on hand. Strickland has yet to release any figures for the quarter.  At least Kirk will get one win this cycle - Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk may be in trouble when it comes to keeping his Senate seat, but he\u2019s in the pink today. With the Chicago Cubs victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League Wild Card Wednesday night, Kirk wins a friendly bet with Republican colleague from Pennsylvania, Sen. Pat Toomey. Kirk\u2019s prize: Iron City beer and pirogies. But the news is not all bad for Toomey, this week\u2019s Quinnipiac poll shows him leading all Democratic comers by a wide margins.

Daily Courier: \u201cPolice don\u2019t get calls like this every day. Monday night, Oct. 5, at about 8 p.m., a banana attacked, then split, giving cops the slip. A male subject - police don\u2019t know how old he was - in a banana suit, opened the door of a business in the 7000 block of Florentine Drive, shouted \u2018Banana!\u2019 and threw a banana inside. Then he ran from the business. Not long after that, an officer reported that a couple walking a dog told him that a banana just ran past them. The subject was described as wearing jeans, black shoes, and, yes, a banana suit.\u201d  Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News. Want FOX News First in your inbox every day?
