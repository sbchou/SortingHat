Mike Pompeo (R-Kansas) declared. \"You asked for more of them. You read them. You corresponded with him. And yet the folks that worked for you didn't have the same courtesy.\"\nGOP members said it was telling that Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens--one of the four Americans killed in the Sept. 11, 2012 attack--did not have Clinton's email address while Blumenthal did.\n\"Ambassador Stevens didn't have your email, is that correct? Your personal email?\" Pompeo asked. \"Did he have your fax number?....Did he have your home address?\"\nHowever, Clinton's aides and allies saw the focus on Blumenthal as proof that the committee had come up with nothing of substance during its 17-month investigation.\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\n\"After 17 months and $4.7 million spent, their whole argument is about Sid Blumenthal?\" longtime Clinton adviser John Podesta tweeted. \"Blumenthal was not in the government & had nothing to do with the events that led to deaths of 4 Americans...No better proof that the Committee is totally political & completely undermines Gowdy's argument that investigation is on the level.\"\n\"The Republicans don't seem to realize that every minute spent talking about Sid Blumenthal is a minute they are losing,\" tweeted Dan Pfeiffer, former White House communications director and senior adviser.\nOf about 12,000 Clinton emails released publicly so far by the State Department, 488 were to or from Blumenthal or contained his email address. GOP lawmakers said they now have about 150 emails from Blumenthal about Libya and Benghazi. Many also related to relations with Europe and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's potential candidacy for chief of the E.U. At least one has been deemed classified by State, including information Clinton sent to Blumenthal, who had no security clearance.\nDemocrats on the panel called the GOP's protracted interest in Blumenthal bizarre.\n\"I just don\u2019t understand the preoccupation with Sidney Blumenthal,\" said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) \"You would think that for the time we've spent on him he was in Benghazi that night manning the barricades.\"\nWhile the discussion of Blumenthal often seemed removed from the core issue of whether the U.S. government should have done more to head off or respond to the Benghazi attacks, it was one of the few areas where Republicans seemed to throw Clinton off-balance.\nWhile trying to parry questions from Benghazi panel Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), Clinton sometimes strained her own credibility in an apparent effort to downplay the importance of Blumenthal's role.\n\"Did the president -- the same White House that said you can't handle him, and can't hire him -- did he know that he was advising you?\" Gowdy asked, noting that Blumenthal appeared to have emailed Clinton more often about Benghazi and Libya than anyone else.\n\"He was not advising me,\" Clinton replied. \"I have no reason to have ever mentioned that or know that the president knew that.\"\nAnd despite ample evidence on the public record for months that Clinton repeatedly asked Blumenthal to keep sending her updates on Libya and other matters, she repeated previous assertions that his advice was unsolicited.\n\"I did not ask him to send me the information that he sent me,\" Clinton said. \n\"You wrote to him, 'Another keeper, thanks' and 'Please keep them coming....Greetings from Kabul and thanks for keeping this stuff coming,'\" Gowdy shot back.\nClinton then shifted slightly, conceding that she urged Blumenthal to keep up the flow. \"They started out unsolicited and, as I said, some were of interest,\" she said.\nGowdy noted the concession, but acknowledged it wasn't exactly earth-shattering\n\"I don't want to be hypertechnical, because it's not a huge point, but it is an important point. You didn't say they started off unsolicited. You said they were -- you said they were unsolicited,\" the chairman said.\nWhile Clinton minimized the significance of what Blumenthal sent along, she did not dismiss it entirely, and she defended forwarding the information to aides who sometimes scrambled to respond to the unusual dispatches.\n\"Some of it I found interesting, some of it I do not. Some of it I forwarded, some of it I do not,\" Clinton said.\nClinton went out of her way to note that Stevens said one report Blumenthal relayed seemed plausible. Stevens \"actually said it rang true and it was worth looking into,\" she said.\nIn many ways, Blumenthal seems an improbable figure to suddenly find himself at the center of Washington discourse. Hiss decision to became a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton in 1997 confirmed suspicion among many journalists that as Washington editor of the New Yorker, he was already toeing the White House line.\n\nPhoto gallery\n\n            By \nDiana D\u2019Abruzzo\n\nDuring his White House stint, Blumenthal sometimes made news, but usually as a result of bizarre storylines. In 1999, journalist Christopher Hitchens delivered an affidavit to Congress recounting a lunchtime conversation in which Blumenthal repeatedly called Bill Clinton paramour Monica Lewinsky \"a stalker\" and charged that Clinton was a \"victim\" of Lewinsky's advances.\nBlumenthal also filed a defamation suit against online news impresario Matt Drudge, accusing him of publishing a false account claiming Blumenthal physically abused his wife.\nAfter leaving the Clinton White House,, Blumenthal worked for a time as the Washington bureau chief for Salon.com. He also spent time as a freelancer and wrote books. He joined Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign as a senior adviser in 2007.\nAllegations relating to Blumenthal's role in that campaign are what kept him from joining the State Department in 2009. Obama aides were convinced that Blumenthal spread false personal and policy rumors about Obama during the battle between Clinton and Obama for the Democratic nomination. While Clinton had more authority to name State Department personnel than any other Obama Cabinet member, Blumenthal was blacklisted--effectively banished by the White House.\nWhen Gowdy asked about Blumenthal's rejection, Clinton didn't dispute it, but said she couldn't remember or didn't know who at the White House put the kibosh on her regular correspondent.\nIn a tweet marveling at Blumenthal's prominent role in Thursday's Benghazi hearing, former Obama campaign strategist and White House adviser David Axelrod still seemed to remember the Obama team's grudge against Blumenthal.\n\"Ironic that career kibitzer and conspiratorialist Sidney Blumenthal should be elevated to epic heights in GOP Benghazi conspiracy theory,\" Axelrod wrote.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Republicans hone in on her relationship with informal adviser.", "title": "Clinton&apos;s emails from Blumenthal spark tension", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/hillary-clinton-sidney-blumenthal-emails-benghazi-hearings-215083", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "trade"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Eric Schultz", "Kyle Cheney", "Sidney Blumenthal", "David Kendall", "Trey Gowdy", "Rachael Bade", "Henry C.
