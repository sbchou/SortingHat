The firm\u2019s Daniel Tate, Jeff Strunk, Frank Steinberg, Libby Greer and Jeff Sadosky will be lobbying on behalf of the hedge fund. Elliott Management has significantly decreased its spending on lobbying in recent years. It spent $230,000 on lobbying the federal government last year and has spent only $20,000 so far this year. The firm has Malkin & Ross on retainer.\nStory Continued Below\nCOVINGTON CELEBRATES EDUCATION BILL PASSAGE: Lobbyists at Covington & Burling who pushed for the passage of Need-Based Educational Aid Act of 2015, which President Barack Obama signed into law last week, highlighted the legislation as a rare example of Congress functioning the way it\u2019s intended to in an interview with PI. The firm\u2019s Richard Hertling and Aaron Cooper worked on behalf of American Council on Education and the 568 Presidents\u2019 Group to extend an exemption from federal anti-trust laws for private universities giving students need-based aid from the universities\u2019 own funds. The exemption was due to expire on Sept. 30. \u201cWhen congress is working together, they can work together in a bipartisan and bicameral way. The process on this legislation really emulates that and shows that things can still happen on Capitol Hill,\u201d Cooper said.\nSCALISE GETTING THE CONVENIENCE STORE EXPERIENCE: House Majority Whip Steve Scalise will work behind the counter at On the Run (Lard Oil Company) in Hammond, La., Tuesday as part of the National Association of Convenience Stores' \"In Store\" project. NACS has organized more than a dozen events in 2015 with lawmakers so they can \"experience firsthand the community experience that takes place at their local convenience stores,\" according to the group. \u201cConvenience stores are the anchor of communities across the country, and they are also where community conversations take place,\u201d said Henry Armour, NACS president and CEO. \u201cMore than half of the country visits a convenience store on a daily basis, whether to buy fuel, use the ATM, wash their cars or quickly buy snacks, drinks or meals. The NACS In Store program gives elected officials a perfect opportunity to experience how these stores serve the public in their home districts.\u201d\nGOOD MONDAY AFTERNOON, where it\u2019s been 67 years since \"Candid Camera\" with Allen Funt debuted on television.

The group is renting the pro-Clinton super PAC\u2019s list and has been able to raise over $2 million so far. The political action committee\u2019s ultimate goal is to pass a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision, but in the meantime, the group will also advocate for other campaign finance reform measures.\nIt plans to create a super PAC arm next year and spend between $25 million and $30 million in the 2016 election cycle. Richard Carbo, spokesman for the group, told PI that they are approaching the issue differently than other reform groups and believe the partnership with Ready PAC provides them legitimacy in an early stage. \u201cWe're bringing a different approach and a different style, but the more the merrier,\u201d Carbo said. \u201cWe are just doing things a little bit differently and engaging some of the grassroots activists who are involved in the issue. The staff here has also been battle-tested in campaigns.\u201d\nThe group\u2019s senior advisers are Valerie Martin, who worked for Sen. Claire McCaskill\u2019s 2006 campaign, and Reed Adamson, who worked for Rep. Brad Schneider during the 2012 cycle.\nSPINA TO COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION: Christopher Spina, most recently communications director for the House Committee on Financial Services, is leaving the hill to serve as senior adviser for public affairs with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, he told friends and colleagues in an email.\nNEW DEMS PLAN \u2018ASSERTIVE\u2019 NEW PRESENCE: Via POLITICO\u2019s Lauren French, \u201cIn the hierarchy of the House, moderate Democrats \u2014 a minority in a party already deep in the minority \u2014 should be totally powerless. But a group of pro-business Democrats, who allied with President Barack Obama and Republicans to pass landmark trade legislation, are angling to cut more deals with the GOP and White House as a way to assert themselves \u2014 and force the Democratic Caucus to the center. Led by Rep. Ron Kind of Wisconsin, the New Democrat Coalition of some 50 members sees opportunities this fall on taxes, trade, Medicare and government spending. Those are all areas where House Republicans have struggled to fashion 218-vote majorities from within their own party, with a cadre of restive conservatives often rejecting leadership\u2019s compromises with Senate Democrats and Obama.\u201d Full story: http://politi.co/1EjEQil\nELSEWHERE IN THE INFLUENCE WORLD:\nINVESTMENT FIRM TO HOLD RUBIO EVENT: Sen.
