But overall, with its much stronger emphasis on the environment and welcoming immigrants, and relatively brief and opaque references to stopping gay marriage and abortion, it is much more likely to cheer Democrats than Republican -- not a surprise given the left-leaning reputation of the hugely popular pontiff.\nFrancis, who is the first pope to ever address a joint meeting of Congress, invoked four figures from American history -- former President Abraham Lincoln; the late Martin Luther King Jr.; Catholic social justice leader Dorothy Day; and the Cistercian monk Thomas Merton -- to both praise the United States but also urge it to live up to its global challenges.\nHe warned against not just religious extremism but factionalism in general, saying the world \u201cdemands that we confront every form of polarization, which would divide it into two camps.\u201d In calling for greater political cooperation, Francis also appeared to ever-so-subtly rebuke the U.S. campaign finance system, saying, \u201cIf politics must truly be at the service of the human person, it follows that it cannot be a slave to the economy and finance.\u201d\n\nPhoto gallery\n\n            By \n                    POLITICO Staff\n\nThe House chamber was packed with lawmakers and their guests, while outside, thousands of people gathered on the West Lawn of the Capitol to hear the 78-year-old Roman Catholic leader, who is on his first-ever trip to the United States. The enthusiastic reception he has received in political circles would have been unthinkable just decades ago when anti-Catholicism was much more common.\nThe Argentine-born Francis spoke in English, a language that he is not that familiar with, reading through spectacles from a prepared paper text. He wore his customary white robes and skullcap and enunciated every word carefully.\nHe devoted significant sections of his speech to the need to protect and respect migrants and asylum seekers, reminding his influential audience that they, too, are descended from immigrants who helped build America. Amid ongoing debates in Congress and on the 2016 presidential campaign trail about immigration -- a discussion that, thanks to Republican candidate Donald Trump, has prompted calls for a border wall and mass deportations -- Francis urged compassion for Latin Americans who head to the United States in search of greater opportunities.\n\u201cWe must not be taken aback by their numbers but rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, trying to respond as best we can to their situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to avoid a common temptation nowadays: to discard whatever proves troublesome.\u201d\nFrancis also emphasized the need to battle climate change, another issue that has put Republicans and Democrats at loggerheads, saying he had \u201cno doubt that the United States -- and this Congress -- have an important role to play\u201d in averting \u201cthe most serious effects of the environmental deterioration caused by human activity.\u201d But, as if responding to conservative critics who say Francis doesn\u2019t understand the economics and technology involved, the pope made it clear he believes all necessary tools must be brought to bear to help protect the environment.\n\nKGB File\n\n            By \nKate Bennett\n\nCiting his recent encyclical on the environment, Francis said it was possible to put technology \u201cat the service of another type of progress, one which is healthier, more human, more social, more integral.\u201d He added, \u201cI am confident that America\u2019s outstanding academic and research institutions can make a vital contribution in the years ahead.\u201d\nThe pope, who has criticized \u201ctrickle-down economics\u201d and unbridled capitalism in the past -- only to be accused by Republicans and other conservatives of knowing nothing about Western capitalism because he grew up in Argentina -- acknowledged the tremendous progress the United States has made in lifting people out of poverty, noting \u201cit goes without saying that part of this great effort is the creation and distribution of wealth,\u201d and that \u201cbusiness is a noble vocation.\u201d But he also encouraged his audience to \u201ckeep in mind all those people around us who are trapped in a cycle of poverty.\u201d\nIn his discussion of the Golden Rule, Francis briefly alluded to abortion by mentioning \u201cour responsibility to protect and defend human life at every stage of its development.\u201d But from there, he quickly pivoted to his goal of abolishing the death penalty, \u201csince every life is sacred.\u201d\nIn describing the importance of promoting dialogue over war, Francis obliquely referenced the recent rapprochement between the U.S. and Cuba, which he helped broker but which has left many Republicans fuming. He then turned pivoted to the need to stop the arms trade, wondering, \u201cWhy are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society? Sadly, the answer, as we all know, is simply for money: money that is drenched in blood, often innocent blood.\u201d\n\n\n\n            By \nNahal Toosi\n\nFrancis spent much of the end of his speech discussing the importance of the family, using only veiled references to the growing legal and cultural acceptance of gay marriage as a cause of concern for him. But in discussing threats \u201cfrom within and without,\u201d he made it clear that he had broader concerns about the disintegration of the traditional family than just who is marrying who.\n\u201cAt the risk of oversimplifying, we might say that we live in a culture which pressures young people not to start a family, because they lack possibilities for the future. Yet this same culture presents others with so many options that they too are dissuaded from starting a family,\u201d the pope said.\nToward the end, he exhorted the U.S. to live up to its ideals that allow people to dream, defend liberty, help the oppressed and sow peace. \u201cIt is my desire that this spirit continue to develop and grow so that as many young people as possible can inherit and dwell in a land which has inspired so many people to dream,\u201d he said, before ending with \u201cGod bless America!\u201d \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Francis also appeared to ever-so-subtly rebuke the U.S. campaign finance system.", "title": "Pope to Congress: \u2018Do unto others...\u2019", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/pope-francis-addresses-congress-214008", "topics": ["economy", "abortion"], "people": ["De Blasio", "Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Erin Mershon", "Karen G.
