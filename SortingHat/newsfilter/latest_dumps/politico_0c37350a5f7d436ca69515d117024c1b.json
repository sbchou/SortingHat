Steve King (R-Iowa) implored fellow GOP lawmakers to back long-shot candidate Rep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.), a former Florida House speaker who\u2019s earned the support of some of the House\u2019s most conservative members. \n\u201cThe best candidate, Daniel Webster, is gaining momentum for his demonstrated leadership,\u201d King wrote in the letter, obtained by POLITICO. \u201cDan is arguing for a principled member-driven approach that will transform the culture of the House. His approach will bridge the divides currently running through our Conference.\u201d\nKing -- who has said he would not back House GOP leadership candidates who have supported immigration reform efforts -- made clear where Webster stands on the issue, telling lawmakers that Webster has an \u201cexcellent record opposing amnesty.\u201d The conservative House Republican also touted Webster\u2019s policy credentials as \u201cstaunchly pro-life, pro-traditional marriage and a defender of the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\n\u201cNo one in the Conference has raised concerns to merit opposing Daniel or the demonstrated principled leadership at the foundation of his candidacy,\u201d King wrote. \u201cTo bring the Conference together in support of the cause of conservatism, I hope you will join me in announcing your support for Dan Webster for Speaker so the momentum behind his race will continue to grow.\nAnd though he doesn\u2019t mention Ryan\u2019s name, King wrote: \u201c[N]o candidate running or rumored to run has matched [Webster\u2019s] commitment to conservatism or bottom up governing.\u201d\nThe House Freedom Caucus, a hardline group of GOP lawmakers credited with helping to oust Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and derailing the speakership bid of House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), has also formally endorsed Webster. Webster earned 12 votes on the House vote for speaker in January.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "King made clear where Webster stands on the issues.", "title": "Steve King says House should elect Webster as speaker", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/the-gavel/2015/10/steve-king-wants-daniel-webster-house-speaker-214835", "topics": ["immigration", "trade"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Katy O'Donnell", "Daniel Webster", "Anna Palmer", "Hadas Gold", "Carla Marinucci", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "Marc Caputo", "Danny Vinik", "Austin Wright", "Jose Andres", "Jenny Hopkinson", "Theodoric Meyer", "Brian Mahoney", "John Boehner", "Josh Gerstein", "Annie Karni", "Aaron Schock", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Matt Friedman", "Steve King", "Jeb World", "Lis Smith", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Michael D'Antonio", "Seung Min Kim", "Jeb Bush", "Dennis Hastert", "Jeremy Herb", "John Bresnahan", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Paul Ryan", "Brianna Ehley", "Ivanka Trump", "Tim Starks", "Dan Webster", "Janosch Delcker", "Adam Sneed", "Adam Behsudi", "Rachana Pradhan", "Matthew Karnitschnig", "Ben White", "Eric Wolff", "Darius Tahir", "Ben Carson", "Caitlin Emma"], "orgs": ["FERC", "Defense Department", "Congress", "What Works", "CBO", "FCC", "College", "Dems", "TPP", "House GOP", "FBI", "Pentagon", "GOP", "House Freedom Caucus", "WTO"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30849, "fullname": "seung min kim", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-10-15 18:23:48", "org": "politico", "article_id": "0c37350a5f7d436ca69515d117024c1b", "date_access": "2015-10-15 17:30:06.971205"}
