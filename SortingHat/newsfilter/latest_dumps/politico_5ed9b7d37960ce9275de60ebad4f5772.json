{"body": "POLITICO\nPolitical intelligence on the intersection of Washington and Wall Street\nBy Ben White\n7/27/15 8:00 AM EDT\nBy Ben White\nCHINA STOCKS TANK AGAIN \u2014 Reuters/Shanghai: \u201cChinese shares tumbled more than 8 percent on Monday amid renewed fears about the outlook for the world's No. 2\u00a0economy, reviving the specter of a full-blown market crash that prompted unprecedented government intervention earlier this month. \u2026 Major indexes suffered their largest one-day drop since 2007, shattering a period of relative calm in China's volatile stock markets since Beijing unleashed a barrage of support measures to arrest a slump that began in mid-June.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cThe CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen plunged 8.6 percent, to 3,818.73, while the Shanghai Composite Index\u00a0.SSEC\u00a0lost 8.5 percent, to 3,725.56 points. While the falls followed lackluster data on profit at Chinese industrial firms on Monday and a disappointing private factory sector survey on Friday, there was little to explain the scale of the sell-off. Some analysts said fears that\u00a0China\u00a0may hold off from further loosening of monetary policy had contributed to souring investor sentiment.\u201d http://reut.rs/1LMpfiW\nSO MUCH FOR THE BRIEF CALM \u2014 Bloomberg: \u201cChina\u2019s stocks tumbled \u2026 amid concern a three-week rally sparked by unprecedented government intervention is unsustainable. \u2026 PetroChina Co., long considered a target of state-linked market support funds, tumbled by a record 9.6 percent. The rout dented investor confidence from Hong Kong to Taiwan and Indonesia, helping send the MSCI Emerging Markets Index to a two-year low. \u2026\n\u201cMonday\u2019s retreat shattered the sense of calm that had fallen over mainland markets last week and raised questions over the viability of government efforts to prop up prices as the economy slows. China\u2019s industrial profits fell 0.3 percent in June from a year earlier, the statistics bureau reported on Monday. The International Monetary Fund has urged China to eventually unwind its support measures, according to a person familiar with the matter.\u201d http://bloom.bg/1Jp5pIO\nEX-IM RISES AGAIN \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Victoria Guida and Kathryn A. Wolf: \u201cThe Senate \u2026 voted to close debate on an amendment that would reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, as part of a multiyear surface transportation bill. The Senate voted, 67-26, to bring debate to a close on the amendment by Sen. Mark Kirk; there will now be 30 hours of post-cloture debate time before proceeding to a vote on the amendment itself, likely some time Monday night assuming all the post-cloture debate time is used.\n\u201cThe amendment contains the text of a bill Kirk sponsored with Sen. Heidi Heitkamp to extend Ex-Im\u2019s charter for four years and lower its lending cap from $140 billion to $135 billion. The measure would also raise the percentage of the agency\u2019s operations that must go toward supporting small businesses from 20 to 25 percent. It deals with the Obama administration\u2019s controversial restrictions on coal financing by prohibiting discrimination against any energy sources.\u201d http://politi.co/1VHP5I4\nFED PREVIEW \u2014 HFE\u2019s Jim O\u2019Sullivan: \u201cFed officials will end their meeting before seeing the GDP \u2026 Of course, there was virtually no chance that Fed officials would be raising rates this week anyway. Instead, the focus will be on the extent to which they encourage expectations for a move in September.\n\u201cWe expect they will encourage such expectations with their tone on labor market improvement in particular; we don\u2019t expect an explicit signal in the forward guidance part of the statement. Fed officials will likely avoid including anything in the FOMC statement that could be construed as calendar-based forward guidance\u201d\nWHAT DOES DONALD TRUMP BELIEVE? \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Timothy Noah with a team of POLITICO Pro reporters: \u201cWill the real Donald Trump please stand up? Over the past two decades he was a Republican, then an independent, then a Democrat, then a Republican \u2026 Voters are drawn to Trump more for his I'll-say-anything style than for his policy views. But a close inspection of Trump's two published policy tomes, 'The America We Deserve' (2000) and 'Time To Get Tough' (2011), along with Trump's public statements in interviews, on Twitter and in public appearances, indicate that Trump's policy preferences are eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory.\n\u201cSome of his policy stances\u00a0are flat-out disqualifying to the Republican establishment, but that doesn't seem to matter. The inconsistencies may even be an asset in assembling a coalition. \u2026 In 1999, Trump quit the Republican Party,\u00a0saying 'I just believe the Republicans are just too crazy right.' \u2026 In 2001, Trump quit the Reform Party to register as a Democrat. \u2026 Trump once endorsed a massive surtax on the rich. But he now wants the top income tax rate cut in half. \u2026 [H]is campaign will identify no policy director, he has no \u201cissues\u201d tab on his campaign website and he hasn\u2019t given any substantive policy speeches on the campaign trail.\u201d http://politi.co/1S3CHD1\nTRUMP-MENTUM STILL THERE (FOR NOW) \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Steven Shepard: \u201cDonald Trump has surged to the lead in the New Hampshire GOP presidential primary and virtually erased Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s advantage in the Iowa caucuses, according to new NBC News/Marist polls \u2026 In Iowa, Walker still tops the field with 19 percent, the poll shows \u2014 only two points ahead of Trump, who garners 17 percent. Interviews for the poll began on July 14 \u2014 the day after the Walker campaign\u2019s launch event in Wisconsin. The only other candidate in double digits is former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, at 12 percent.\n\u201cThose lagging behind include a number of candidates banking on strong finishes in Iowa. Neurosurgeon Ben Carson is in fourth place, at 8 percent, followed by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee at 7 percent, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul at 5 percent, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 4 percent and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at 4 percent. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, for whom a super PAC has spent more than $600,000 on ads on Iowa television supporting him over the past six weeks, is at just 3 percent.\u201d \u2026\n\u201cMeanwhile, in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire, Trump is in the lead at 21 percent. Bush, the second-place candidate, is at 14 percent. Walker is third, at 12 percent, followed by a surprise fourth-place finisher: Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who announced his campaign on the last day the poll was in the field, is at 7 percent\u201d http://politi.co/1HTjoV6\nGOOD MONDAY MORNING \u2014 For early risers, M.M. is on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d at 6:20 a.m. talking politics and what have you.\nDRIVING THE WEEK \u2014 President Obama continues his Africa trip today in Ethiopia \u2026 Hillary Clinton is in Iowa today talking renewable energy \u2026 Inaugural Playbook New Jersey event this morning in Newark with Mike Allen, Matt Friedman and Sen.

It is unlikely to send negotiators until later in the week, officials said. Opening talks on an IMF programme must first be approved by the fund\u2019s board. \u2026 The decision to send lower-level negotiators on Monday is the latest sign of concern among Greece\u2019s creditors that, despite the summit agreement two weeks ago to restart talks, there remain deep differences on the way forward that could still derail negotiations before an August 20 deadline.\u201d http://on.ft.com/1GSuhCu\nBIG HURDLES FOR TRADE DEAL REMAIN \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Doug Palmer: \u201cThe Obama administration is closer than ever on a breakthrough on the biggest trade deal in world history. But years of delicate negotiating could be undone by Canadian milk. Or Japanese rice. Or U.S. pharmaceutical patents. \u2026 Top trade officials from 12 countries scattered around the Asia-Pacific region descended on the island of Maui on Friday for a week of meetings, where they will sit in hotel conference rooms negotiating a free trade zone that would cover about 40 percent of world economic output.\n\u201cAnd while they could leave with a breakthrough deal, the talks could just as easily be blown up by petty and not-so-petty grievances over everything from cheese labels to auto tariffs. \u2026 The administration sees the Trans Pacific Partnership as a major part of President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy, and his top trade representative, Michael Froman has visited four countries and met with most of the others in Washington, D.C., over the past several weeks urging them to be prepared to close the deal\u201d http://politi.co/1Jp4E2t\nTHIS MORNING ON POLITICO\u00a0PRO\u00a0FINANCIAL SERVICES\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u00a0Jon Prior on Jeb Hensarling's\u00a0latest call for reforms at the Federal Reserve\u2026\u00a0For\u00a0Pro's subscriber-only coverage -- and to get Morning Money every day before 6 a.m. -- please contact\u00a0Pro\u00a0Services at (703) 341-4600 or\u00a0info@politicopro.com\nSIX STOCKS THAT RULE THE WORLD \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Dan Strumpf: \u201cJust a few companies are driving the gains in major U.S. stock indexes this year, raising fresh concerns about the health of the market\u2019s advance. Six firms: Amazon, Google, Apple\u00a0Inc.,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0Inc.,\u00a0Netflix\u00a0Inc.\u00a0and Gilead Sciences\u00a0Inc. \u2014 now account for more than half of the $664 billion in value added this year to the\u00a0Nasdaq\u00a0Composite Index, according to data compiled by brokerage firm JonesTrading. Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook, Gilead and\u00a0Walt Disney\u00a0Co.\u00a0account for more than all of the $199 billion in market-capitalization gains in the S&P 500.\n\u201cThe concentrated gains are spurring concerns that soft trading in much of the market could presage a pullback in the indexes. Many investors see echoes of prior market tops \u2014 including the 2007 peak and the late 1990s frenzy \u2014 when fewer and fewer stocks lifted the broader market. The S&P 500 is up 1 percent this year while the Nasdaq has gained 7.4 percent. Other indicators are also flashing yellow. In the Nasdaq, falling stocks have outnumbered rising stocks this year, sending the \u201cadvance-decline line\u201d into negative territory, a phenomenon that has come before market downturns in the past, investors and analysts said.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1LKULy3\nCLINTON DENIES EMAIL STORY \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Hadas Gold: \u201cHillary Clinton said she is confident none of the emails she sent using her private email server while secretary as state contained information that was classified when she sent them. Clinton, speaking to reporters Saturday after a presidential campaign event here, said she has \u2018no idea\u2019 which are the four emails an inspector general review has determined were classified \u2018secret\u2019 at the time. \u2018I am confident I never sent nor received any information that was classified at the time it was sent and received,\u2019 Clinton said. \u2018What I think you\u2019re seeing is a very typical kind of discussion to some extent, disagreement among various parts of the government over what should or what should not be publicly released.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cClinton went on to say that she turned over 55,000 pages of emails to help the State Department, which had asked all living former secretaries to do the same in order to help with their record-keeping efforts. Clinton then said it was her own desire for transparency that had led to the arguments over levels of classification. \u2018Then I said, \u2018Well let\u2019s make it public.\u2019 If I just turned it over, we would not be having this conversation, but when I said, \u2018Hey I want this to be public\u2019, it has to go through the FOIA process.\u201d\nU.S. INFRASTRUCTURE: CRUMBLING \u2014 NYT\u2019s Emma G. Fitzsimmons and David W. Chen: \u201cIn Maryland, a century-old rail tunnel needed emergency repairs this winter because of soil erosion from leaks, causing widespread train delays. In Connecticut, an aging swing bridge failed to close twice last summer, shutting train service and stranding passengers. And last week,\u00a0New Jersey Transit\u00a0riders had\u00a0a truly torturous\u00a0experience. There were major delays on four days because of problems with overhead electrical wires and a power substation, leaving thousands of commuters stalled for hours. \u2026\n\u201cThese troubles have become all too common on the Northeast Corridor, the nation\u2019s busiest rail sector, which stretches from Washington to Boston and carries about 750,000 riders each day on Amtrak\u00a0and several commuter rail lines. The corridor\u2019s ridership has doubled in the last 30 years even as its old and overloaded infrastructure of tracks, power lines, bridges and tunnels has begun to wear out. And with Amtrak\u00a0and local transit agencies struggling to secure funding, many fear the disruptions will continue to worsen in the years ahead.\u201d http://nyti.ms/1gY35gM\n** A message from MetLife: Building on a nearly 150-year legacy of excellence, MetLife is committed to ensuring a future in which we can continue helping people, families and communities around the world get the most out of life.
