Often, the subject of a presidential run comes up. He remains open to a run, they say, but some who spoke to POLITICO on the condition of anonymity said he is not close to making a decision.\nAlso on POLITICO\nMARC CAPUTO\nNonetheless, speculation flared anew after a Maureen Dowd column in Sunday\u2019s New York Times reported that Beau towards the end of his life had advised his father to run, and that the vice president was giving it serious consideration, in a sign of possible vulnerability on Clinton\u2019s part.\nThe news was not a surprise to Clinton\u2019s inner circle. It\u2019s no secret, some supporters said, that Biden wants to be President \u2014 he\u2019s run twice. For months he\u2019s left the door open, saying he\u2019ll make a decision about whether or not to seek his party\u2019s nomination by the end of the summer.\nPutting out feelers to measure support is perfectly responsible, Democrats note, and having Biden in the wings if Clinton for some reason implodes would be a good insurance plan for the party.\nPublicly, Clinton\u2019s top aides have expressed only support for the grieving veep.\n\u201cWe love the vice president,\u201d Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri said last month at a breakfast event in Washington, D.C. \u201cAmen,\u201d added Jake Sullivan, Clinton\u2019s top policy aide who has also worked as Biden\u2019s national security adviser.\n\u201cI have known them both for well over twenty years,\u201d said New Hampshire power broker Terry Shumaker, who is supporting Clinton\u2019s bid and served as New Hampshire chairman of Bill Clinton\u2019s two presidential campaigns. \u201cIf Hillary Clinton were not running, I would be supporting Joe Biden.\u201d\nBut many top Democrats remain doubtful that he will actually take the plunge.\nWhile there are real vulnerabilities, like Clinton\u2019s exposure on the left, an enthusiasm gap for her candidacy, and some weakness in her latest poll numbers, Democrats raise questions about Biden\u2019s ability to deal with the practical matter of building an organization of donors, operatives and other constituencies necessary to win. And few expect Biden to run as a spoiler, or just because it would be his last chance to mount a bid.\nBiden has also made few moves to show that he\u2019s serious about a bid. His chief of staff has been kept in the loop on debate planning by the Democratic National Committee as a courtesy, sources said, but the Biden team has not engaged or attended any meetings or raised any questions to show it is interested or plans to participate.\nSo far, Biden\u2019s camp has given no signal to Clinton\u2019s campaign in either direction, a source told POLITICO.\nBut Clinton supporters said in the unlikely event that Biden did enter the race, he would have a hard time eating away at the support she has built up in the early voting states.\nAlso on POLITICO\nALI BRELAND\nIn 2007, Biden drew less than 1 percent in the Iowa caucuses before dropping out. But that was before he saw his stature grow in the role of vice president. Last month, Biden saw his highest favorability rating \u2014 49 percent \u2014 since taking the office, while Clinton\u2019s polls numbers in the swing states show her unfavorability numbers on the rise. Even so, he would face an uphill battle.\n\u201cIf Biden runs, I believe that Hillary\u2019s New Hampshire supporters will stick with her,\u201d said Shumaker.\nClinton insiders cast the Dowd column \u2014 which reported that Biden was talking to friends, family members and donors about entering the race \u2014 as merely a continuation of speculation that has surrounded Biden in the wake of Beau\u2019s death.\nIn an appearance on CNN Sunday morning, Palmieri said she anticipated more \u201cwill he or won\u2019t he\u201d coverage about Biden\u2019s plans \u2014 his allies have said since June that he would make a decision by the end of the summer. \u201cWe\u2019ll let him make his decision,\u201d Palmieri said.\n\u201cEveryone expected him to seriously consider running,\u201d said Robert Zimmerman, DNC national committee member, and a longstanding Clinton supporter who serves on her finance committee.\nShumaker added, \u201cWe fully expected to have credible opponents in the primary. Having opposition in the primaries makes far better nominees.\u201d\nBut a Biden run would offer little upside for Clinton. Even though a primary fight could make her stronger, no leading candidate would choose a serious challenge from the sitting vice president of his or her party, which could cause an intra-party civil war.\nRepublicans were quick to seize on Biden\u2019s latest flirtation as a sign of Clinton\u2019s weakness as her party\u2019s standard-bearer. \u201cIf you wanted to know how concerned Democrats are about Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and his coordinated trial balloon just told you,\u201d said Jeff Bechdel, spokesman for America Rising PAC.\nBut Clinton supporters said they\u2019re comfortable in the position they are in.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it in any way changes the focus and mission for those of us supporting Hillary Clinton,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cWhether Joe Biden or anyone else gets in the race, it\u2019s not going to change the sense of purpose we all feel about Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u201d\nHe explained that this time around, Clinton supporters \u201cfeel a sense of history and excitement about her campaign. The mission is strengthening the middle class and keeping our country moving forward. And she represents the strongest alternatives to what the Republicans represent.\u201d\nA Clinton campaign spokesman declined to comment.\nGabriel Debenedetti contributed to this report.\nBy JAMES HIGDON\nBy MICHAEL HIRSH\nBy DAVID MCRANEY\nBy JOSH ZEITZ\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "As the VP weighs his options, the front-runner's team offers only deference and respect.", "title": "Clinton backers skeptical of Biden run", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/hillary-clinton-backers-skeptical-of-joe-biden-run-120918.html", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Beau Biden", "Robert Zimmerman", "Bill Clinton", "Joe Biden", "Jennifer Palmieri", "Hillary Clinton", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Maureen Dowd", "Jeff Bechdel", "Jake Sullivan", "Terry Shumaker", "Annie Karni"], "orgs": ["America Rising PAC", "Democratic National Committee", "DNC"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30726, "fullname": "annie karni", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-08-02 22:52:46", "org": "politico", "article_id": "348b3a19dd13ad0b688e746211b970c3", "date_access": "2015-08-02 22:20:09.677662"}
