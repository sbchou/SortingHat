Trump yesterday and the parties mutually agreed that it is in the best interest of all not to conduct the 2015 PGA Grand Slam of Golf at Trump National -- Los Angeles,\" the PGA said in a statement.\u00a0\nThe competition had been scheduled for Oct. 19-21 at the course. The move is only the latest backlash the Republican presidential candidate has faced since making disparaging remarks about Mexican illegal immigrants during his campaign kickoff.\u00a0\nOn the latest decision, Trump said in a statement, \"I have great respect for the PGA of America and everything they stand for.

They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\"\u00a0\nESPN will now hold its charity excursion at the Pelican Hill Golf Club in Los Angeles.", "byline": "", "description": "The fallout from Donald Trump's controversial immigration remarks has extended to the fairways, with first ESPN and now the PGA of America pulling out of contests at his Los Angeles golf course.", "title": "PGA moving tournament from Trump golf course in latest fallout", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/uZG8dcOoPuE/", "topics": ["immigration", "mexico"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Donald J.
