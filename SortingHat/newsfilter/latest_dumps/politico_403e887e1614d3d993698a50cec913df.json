This is Donald Trump\u2019s universe.\nStory Continued Below\nSo instead, on Aug. 6, in Cleveland, the GOP hopefuls will appear stage right and stage left, flanking a real estate mogul and reality television star who is all but certain to steal the spotlight, go on the offensive and thwart their hopes for a peaceful debate.\nTrump\u2019s presence at center stage \u2014 his reward if he maintains his lead in the polls \u2014 is likely to transform the first Republican debate into a major media event, bringing big ratings to Fox News, the debate sponsor. By the same token, however, it will likely turn the traditionally policy-focused event into a pageant of personality, which is a potential nightmare for other candidates.\n\u201cI think you have to assume he\u2019ll be loud and aggressive and do everything he can to stay on offense,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who gave the most commanding debate performances of the 2012 primary cycle, told POLITICO. \u201cTrump is very smart, he has lots of TV experience and is absolutely uninhibited.\u201d\nConsidered almost unthinkable just five weeks ago, Trump\u2019s appearance at center stage is now the most inconvenient of truths for the would-be Republican front-runners. From Milwaukee to Miami, campaign aides are already wrestling with the Trump factor \u2014 strategizing on how to engage with him (if at all) and how to stave off his attacks.\n\u201cHe might be the only person on that stage with nothing to lose,\u201d said one senior Republican campaign adviser, \u201cand he isn\u2019t going down alone.\u201d\nAt the same time, candidates will be eager to ensure that they aren\u2019t just playing bit parts in a two-hour Donald Trump show. That will be especially challenging given the feverish media attention surrounding the notoriously braggadocious front-runner.\n\u201cUnless everything changes in the next two weeks, which is always a possibility, I imagine Trump will be pretty much the top five stories of the debate just by showing up,\u201d said Mark Leibovich, the chief national correspondent for The New York Times Magazine.\n\u201cThere\u2019s the \u2018Will the other candidates attack Trump?\u2019 story, the \u2018Will Trump hold his own as a serious candidate?\u2019 story, the \u2018Will Trump have a grasp of the issues?\u2019 story, the \u2018What attention-getting thing did Trump say?\u2019 story and the \u201cDid you hear what Trump said about Candidate X?\u2019 (or \u2018What did Candidate X say to Trump?\u2019) story, etc,\u201d he continued. \u201cMaybe someone like Jeb can sneak into the top six.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s influence on the debate isn\u2019t just a headache for candidates, it\u2019s a headache for the Republican National Committee, which had sought to gain greater control over the debate process after the chaos of the 2012 cycle. Despite the party\u2019s effort to distance itself from Trump\u2019s litany of controversial comments, there\u2019s nothing it can do to prevent his appearance on stage in Cleveland. Given his current standing atop the GOP pack, he would have to shed almost all of his supporters over the next week to fall out of the top 10.\nBut the real challenge rests with the candidates. The stakes are particularly high for Bush, who has been the target of much of Trump\u2019s verbal assault over the past month. How Bush responds \u2014 or doesn\u2019t \u2014 could determine how conservative voters who have been skeptical of his candidacy view him. Other candidates, meanwhile, are hoping that Trump-Bush skirmishes leave the Floridian bloodied.\nFor Bush and other top-tier candidates like Walker and Rubio, anticipating Trump\u2019s approach to the debate is of paramount importance.\nPerhaps no one is better suited to offer advice on the subject than Gingrich, who surged to the front of the 2012 GOP field \u2014 twice \u2014 in large part because of his dramatic performances at the debates. Indeed, Gingrich saved his campaign from ruin by attacking a debate moderator who dared to ask for his reaction to the negative press reports that were commanding the day\u2019s headlines. CNN\u2019s David Gergen called it \u201cone of the most explosive moments \u2026 in debate history.\u201d\nFor Gingrich, taking on Trump is a matter of understanding the enemy: \u201cAvoid anger, because I don\u2019t think anybody on that stage can out-anger Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cHis natural style is aggressive. It\u2019s not like he has to become aggressive. He wakes up and he\u2019s aggressive.\u201d\nTrump might be more susceptible to humor, the former speaker offered: \u201cIf you remember, Reagan used \u2018There you go again\u2019 with Jimmy Carter to enormous effect. He used \u2018My opponent\u2019s youth and inexperience\u2019 with Mondale to great effect,\u201d Gingrich said, referencing two of Ronald Reagan\u2019s most famous quips. \u201cSomething closer to Reagan-esque humor could be very formidable.\u201d\nBut the best strategy, Gingrich added, is to ignore Trump altogether \u2014 at least, to the degree that that\u2019s possible.\n\u201cCandidates ought to focus on communicating with the American people, not focusing on Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cThe candidates who do the best will be the candidates who talk most directly to the American people, rather than getting sucked into fighting with Trump.\u201d\nSteven Shepard contributed to this report.\nBy ADAM WREN\nBy MATT CAROTENUTO and  KATHERINE LUONGO\nBy REP.
