Thomas/AFP/Getty Images  A super PAC backing Rand Paul's presidential candidacy raised $3.1 million in the first half of 2015, with two-thirds of the total coming from just two donors. The sum reported Friday afternoon by Paul's supporters is among the smallest reported from the dozen or so presidential candidate super PACs that have so far revealed their fundraising figures. Paul's total puts him behind Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett Packard CEO, whose supporters reported raising $3.4 million for a super PAC. Allies of former Florida governor Jeb Bush raised nearly $103 million for the Right to Rise super PAC. Supporters of Democratic presidential hopeful Martin O'Malley, the former Maryland governor, reported raising just $289,000 for his super PAC during its first month. Paul, the Kentucky senator and son of former Texas congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul, reported raising nearly $7 million for his official campaign account -- a more respectable number, but still in the lower tier of candidate totals. Supporters of other GOP presidential hopefuls, including Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, have yet to disclose totals for \u00a0super PACs backing them.
