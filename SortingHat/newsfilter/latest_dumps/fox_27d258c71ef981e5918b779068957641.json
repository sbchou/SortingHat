{"body": "\t\t\t\n\t\t\t Republican Party officials in Iowa have voted to cancel the decades-old Iowa Straw Poll, amid waning interest from GOP presidential candidates.\u00a0 \nJeff Kaufmann, chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa's State Central Committee, said in a statement: \"I've said since December that we would only hold a straw poll if the candidates wanted one, and this year that is just not the case.\" \nThe Iowa straw poll has been lauded by conservative activists in the state for decades but in recent years hasn\u2019t been widely embraced by GOP candidates both inside and outside the state. \nThe Iowa poll has been held every election cycle since 1979 without a Republican incumbent in the White House. It was initially used to gauge a candidate\u2019s electability, and over the years has brought in thousands of dollars for Iowa\u2019s GOP. \nHowever, winning the Iowa straw poll has often not translated to winning the party\u2019s nomination.\u00a0 \nThree of this year\u2019s Republican presidential hopefuls -- former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee -- have all said they\u2019ll skip the straw poll this year.", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "BREAKING NEWS: Iowa Republican Party cancels presidential straw poll", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/12/iowa-gop-officials-cancel-straw-poll/", "topics": ["immigration", "personality", "terrorism"], "people": ["Mike Huckabee", "Jeb Bush", "Jeff Kaufmann", "Marco Rubio"], "orgs": ["Republican Party of Iowa", "Republican Party", "Iowa Republican Party", "GOP", "State Central Committee"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-06-12 16:07:07", "org": "fox", "article_id": "27d258c71ef981e5918b779068957641", "date_access": "2015-06-12 15:23:43.000815"}
