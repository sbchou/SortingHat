{"body": "President Obama generally refrains from talking about the candidates vying to succeed him in 2016, but when it comes to Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, he\u2019s made a couple of exceptions.\n\nAsked about Mr. Walker\u2019s declaration last week that, if elected president, he would revoke the nuclear deal with Iran on his first day in office, Mr. Obama took the bait.\n\n\u201cI am confident that any president who gets elected will be knowledgeable enough about foreign policy and knowledgeable enough about the traditions and precedents of presidential power that they won\u2019t start calling into question the capacity of the executive branch of the United States to enter into agreements with other countries,\u201d Mr. Obama told NPR in an interview that ran on Tuesday. \u201cIt would be a foolish approach to take, and, you know, perhaps Mr. Walker, after he\u2019s taken some time to bone up on foreign policy, will feel the same way.\u201d\n\nThe dig at Mr. Walker comes about a month after Mr. Obama criticized the governor for signing a right-to-work law that he called \u201canti-worker.\u201d \n\nSo what\u2019s Mr. Obama\u2019s issue with Mr. Walker?\n\n\u201cI assure you that there\u2019s nothing personal,\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, said Tuesday at the daily press briefing. \u201cThere is no doubt, as I\u2019m sure that even Governor Walker himself would be happy to tell you, that there are some significant policy differences between the two men.\u201d\n\nMr. Earnest said there would be \u201cample opportunity\u201d over the next year and a half to \u201cdiscuss those differences at some length,\u201d but added, \u201cI\u2019m not going to start that today.\u201d\n\nMr. Walker was happy to flesh them out. In a statement released by his political committee, he derided Mr. Obama for what he called \u201cfailed leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmericans would be better served by a president who spent more time working with governors and members of Congress rather than attacking them,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cWhether it is cutting a bad deal with Iran, calling ISIS the J.V. squad, or touting Yemen as a success story, Obama\u2019s lack of leadership has hurt America\u2019s safety and standing in the world.\u201d", "byline": "JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS", "description": "President Obama generally refrains from talking about the candidates vying to succeed him in 2016, but when it comes to Gov.
