Marco Rubio defended his immigration stance Thursday, denying he had flip-flopped in backing away from comprehensive immigration legislation.\u00a0 \n\u201cWe do have to address this issue,\u201d he said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cOutnumbered.\u201d \u201cThe only thing I am arguing differently than what I did three years ago is that we can\u2019t do it in one single step.\u201d\u00a0 \nRubio has come under attack by some who say he bent to political pressure in 2013 and wound up abandoning immigration legislation he once supported.\u00a0The Florida senator, though, argues the country's flawed immigration system still needs to be fixed, just in a different way.\u00a0 \nRubio and his Florida rival former Gov. Jeb Bush -- set to announce his presidential bid later this month -- have both voiced support for comprehensive immigration reform. Both have endorsed allowing some illegal immigrants already in the country to attain \u201clegal status.\u201d\u00a0 \nDuring his appearance on \"Outnumbered,\" Rubio also took Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton to task about avoiding questions from the media and said her hesitation could harm her in the long run. \n\u201cI think for the average voter over time it will become an issue. Maybe not today but certainly over time,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are going to begin to wonder why is it she is not holding herself up to the same standards [as the people on the other side of the aisle].\u201d \n\u201cHer advisers are putting her in a very delicate position,\u201d he said. \nRubio also said Clinton needed to come clean with Americans about her time as secretary of state. \n\u201cHow do you answer for the abysmal foreign policy approach that this White House has taken \u2026 whether it\u2019s the reset in Russia or pulling out of Iraq too early, mismanaging the Libya experience?\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI think they have a lot to answer for and it\u2019s one of the reasons why she doesn\u2019t want to be exposed so early to these questions.\u201d \nDuring the Fox News interview, Rubio also discussed the crowded Republican field and shared personal stories about his life. The self-professed hip-hop super-fan seemed at a loss, though, when asked to identify his favorite member of Wu-Tang Clan.", "byline": "", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Sen.
