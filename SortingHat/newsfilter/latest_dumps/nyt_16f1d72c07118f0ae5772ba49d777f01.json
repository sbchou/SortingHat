{"body": "A young woman berated Jeb Bush in Reno, Nev., on Wednesday for his brother\u2019s bungled war in Iraq, saying it had spawned the group calling itself the Islamic State. \u201cYour brother created ISIS,\u201d she declared. Mr. Bush said he \u201crespectfully\u201d disagreed.\n\nA middle-aged man pressed Mr. Bush to answer whether he would have supported the 2003 Iraqi invasion given the intelligence known today. Mr. Bush acknowledged mistakes but sprinkled in praise. \u201cI give him credit,\u201d he said of his brother, for the 2007 troop surge.\n\nBy the morning\u2019s end, when a wary-sounding Mr. Bush told reporters, \u201cIf I run, it will be 2016, not 2000,\u201d it almost came across as wishful thinking.\n\nMr. Bush began exploring a presidential run by declaring that he would be his own man. But he is struggling to navigate his relationship with George W. Bush and his legacy. He has fumbled the most basic, predictable questions about the Iraq war \u2014 while behind the scenes, he has assured skeptical conservatives that he draws wisdom and important counsel from the former president.\n\nThe uneasiness stems in part from the two men\u2019s own awkward relationship, which was never close and was often competitive. But it also reflects Mr. Bush\u2019s challenge in trying to deal with a fractured electorate in which some conservatives cling to the former president, but he remains a focus of anger across much of the rest of the political spectrum.\n\nAs he strains to win over Republican activists, particularly in crucial early-voting states like Iowa and South Carolina, Mr. Bush is being confronted with a distressing realization: He may now need to lean on his brother to survive the Republican primary \u2014 despite the damage that could do to Mr. Bush in a general election.\n\nIn private conversations, Mr. Bush\u2019s allies have often taken note that his brother\u2019s approval ratings among likely primary and caucus voters are sky high. A Quinnipiac University survey this month showed George W. Bush\u2019s favorability at 81 percent among likely Republican caucusgoers in Iowa. People familiar with Republican polling in South Carolina say the former president\u2019s numbers are similarly strong among primary voters there.\n\n\u201cI think in a Republican primary, especially, his brother is a tremendous asset,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, who was a White House press secretary during George W. Bush\u2019s tenure.\n\nIn both states, conservative Christians, who were among the most devoted members of George W. Bush\u2019s coalition in 2000, are major factors. Jeb Bush, whose positions on immigration reform, education standards and other issues have cost him, could benefit from his brother\u2019s reflected glow with evangelicals.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Bush has sought to inherit his brother\u2019s support among neoconservatives. But his difficulty in measuring up to his brother in the eyes of those opinion-makers and donors was much in evidence over the past six weeks: In late March, his allies fielded angry calls from Sheldon Adelson, the casino billionaire who is a staunch supporter of Israel and gave tens of millions of dollars to \u201csuper PACs\u201d in 2012, over a speech given by one of Mr. Bush\u2019s foreign policy advisers, James A. Baker III. But Mr. Adelson gave the former president a lavish reception when he delivered the keynote address in late April to a gathering of the Republican Jewish Coalition, for which Mr. Adelson is a major benefactor.\n\nMatthew Dowd, a strategist who worked on George W. Bush\u2019s 2004 campaign, warned that his popularity was not easily transferable to Jeb Bush.\n\n\u201cHis brother having high favorables is different than voters saying, \u2018I like George W. Bush, so I want someone to follow the path of George W. Bush,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Dowd said.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s the quandary that Jeb\u2019s now got himself in. It\u2019s more incumbent on him to say, \u2018He\u2019s my brother, I love my brother, but this is how my presidency would look differently,\u2019 and show that.\u201d\n\nMr. Bush seemed to be approaching his brother\u2019s foreign policy record delicately from the first: In a major speech in Chicago in February, he articulated a recognizably muscular approach to global affairs, but still declared himself \u201cmy own man.\u201d\n\nYet in recent weeks, as he strove to soothe supporters of Israel who questioned his commitment in closed-door meetings, Mr. Bush used his brother\u2019s record on Israel as evidence of his own reliability \u2014 and went on to describe his brother as the person he listens to the most on Mideast issues.\n\nIt was a surprise to several of those who heard Mr. Bush say it \u2014 and to a number of people close to George W. Bush who learned of Mr. Bush\u2019s remarks after the fact.While the former president is said to be in touch with Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign from time to time, the two brothers do not speak frequently, according to people close to both men.\n\nYet even as Mr. Bush seeks to present a forward-looking vision, he can count on having to answer questions about \u2014 if not answer for \u2014 his brother\u2019s two terms in office.\n\nIf he is successful in winning the Republican nomination, Mr. Bush would likely be pressed on the issue of same-sex marriage \u2014 which his brother used as a wedge issue to boost conservative voter turnout in his 2004 re-election campaign. He could also face revived complaints about how his brother\u2019s administration responded to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nBut first Mr. Bush must win over Republicans, whose economic views have grown increasingly populist since George W. Bush\u2019s last year in office.\n\nAnger over the bank bailouts of 2008 and the former president\u2019s approach to government spending were important ingredients in the rise of the Tea Party movement, which has made the Republican Party vastly less hospitable to candidates seen to represent the party\u2019s establishment.\n\nBut no issue is as fraught for Mr. Bush as the Iraq war. During a television interview this week, Mr. Bush suggested that he still supported invading Iraq even with hindsight knowledge about intelligence failures. He later said he had misunderstood an interviewer\u2019s question.\n\nSome of Mr. Bush\u2019s allies complain that he is in a no-win situation: Just as he will be faulted for embracing his brother, if he distanced himself from the former president he could be called disingenuous.\n\nAt the town hall in Reno on Wednesday, where one attendee showed up clutching an article, cut out from the local paper, about Mr. Bush\u2019s latest remarks on the Iraq war, Mitch Brust, 72, and his wife, Pam, said they admired Mr. Bush\u2019s loyalty to his brother, no matter what private differences they may harbor.\n\n\u201cIf they were not supportive of each other, I\u2019d be concerned,\u201d said Mr. Brust. \u201cThat would fly in the face of their family values.\u201d\n\nMrs. Brust, who said she had read George W. Bush\u2019s book about his time in office, \u201cDecision Points,\u201d nodded in agreement.\n\nAddressing a sizable crowd in a community center\u2019s gymnasium, Mr. Bush began by saying, \u201cFirst and foremost, I am proud to be George W.\u2019s brother.\u201d\n\nHe added,\u201d I can\u2019t deny the fact that I love my family.\u201d", "byline": "MAGGIE HABERMAN and MICHAEL BARBARO", "description": "Jeb Bush is being confronted with a distressing realization: He may now need to lean on his brother to survive the Republican primary, despite the damage that could do to Mr. Bush in a general election.", "title": "Family Ties Prove Tricky in Jeb Bush\u2019s Path", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/14/us/politics/family-ties-prove-tricky-in-jeb-bushs-path.html", "topics": ["immigration", "terrorism"], "people": ["Mitch Brust", "Jeb Bush", "Matthew Dowd", "Sheldon Adelson", "Ari Fleischer", "George W.
