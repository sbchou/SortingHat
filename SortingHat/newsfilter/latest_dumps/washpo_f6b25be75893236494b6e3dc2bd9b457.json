(AP Photo/John Minchillo)  Teachers around the country were watching the Aug. 6 debate in Cleveland in which 10 candidates for the Republican presidential nomination sparred and posed questions on Twitter that they would like to see them answer. The next GOP debate is scheduled for Wednesday, Sept. 16, at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California, and here are some of the questions that teachers tweeted to the hashtag #BATSask, a reference to the BATS, the Badass Teachers Association, a group founded in 2013 by educators sick and tired of being blamed for whatever woes exist in the public education system. Here are some of the tweets. If you have questions to add the list, put them in the comments and I\u2019ll do an update before the next debate. \u00a0 \u2014  #BatsAsk #GopDebate will Christie address foreign dignitaries like he does teachers? @bretbaier \u2014 Maria Glass (@mariaglass7) August 7, 2015 \u2014  #BATsAsk @BadassTeachersA Can any candidate explain this? pic.twitter.com/T7HxKjetVw \u2014 Karen Adlum (@twitturbug9) August 7, 2015  \u2014  What kind of choice is it when there aren\u2019t ANY public schools left? #BATsAsk #GOPDebate \u2014 PennBat (@PennBat) August 7, 2015 \u2014  I want to know who will actually get rid of high stakes testing and CCSS? #BATSask #GOPDebate @BadassTeachersA https://t.co/sAaD0ichow \u2014 Ohio BATs (@OhioBATs) August 7, 2015 \u2014  #BATSask do you understand teacher tenure is due process, not a job for life?
