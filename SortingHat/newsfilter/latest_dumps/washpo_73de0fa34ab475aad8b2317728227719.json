{"body": "   Republican 2016 U.S. presidential candidate businessman Donald Trump answers a question at the first official Republican presidential candidates debate of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign in Cleveland, Ohio REUTERS/Brian Snyder/Files  I was there for the \u201cpeasants with pitchforks\u201d speech. Pat Buchanan was holding forth in a crowded room at the Sheraton Hotel in Nashua, N.H., a couple of days before the 1996 GOP primary. The Republican Establishment\u2019s favorite for the nomination was Bob Dole, but Dole, for all his solid credentials and admirable history as a war hero and congressional leader, was never someone to incite a political fever, never one to tap the more visceral emotions of the rowdy electorate. So here came Buchanan, the TV pundit and unapologetic nativist, and in the icy environs of the New Hampshire primary he was a glowing coal of anti-Establishment fury. But he was also having a ball, relishing every moment, improvising the whole thing \u2014 a guy with nothing to lose. Toward the end of his stump speech, he uttered what became his most famous line: \u201cWe shocked them in Alaska. And stunned them in Louisiana. And then stunned them again in Iowa. And they are in a terminal panic in Washington. They are frightened. They hear \u2014 ha ha \u2014 they hear the shouts of the peasants from over the hill. You watch the Establishment, all the knights and barons will be riding into the castle, pulling up the drawbridge in a minute. And they\u2019re comin\u2019! All the peasants are comin\u2019 with pitchforks after them! So we\u2019re going to take this \u2014 we\u2019re going to take this over the top.\u201d [This is quoted imprecisely on Buchanan\u2019s Wikipedia page. I have transcribed it from the C-SPAN coverage; see minute 34.] Buchanan edged Dole in New Hampshire, but Dole\u2019s superior financial and organizational strength put him on top on Super Tuesday. But even if these peasants-with-pitchforks insurrections eventually sputter out, they signal changes taking place in the electorate. The Republican Party is far more conservative than it was just two decades ago. This isn\u2019t Bob Dole\u2019s GOP anymore. Four years ago, when Establishment favorite Mitt Romney was struggling to polish off a right-flank challenge from Rick Santorum, E.J. Dionne explained a simple truth about primary-season politics \u2014 and you could substitute \u201cClinton\u201d or \u201cBush\u201d or \u201cDole\u201d in this passage and come up with a parallel dynamic: One senses that the conservative ultras are resigned to having to vote for Romney in November against President Obama. They are determined not to vote for him twice, using the primaries to give voice to their hearts and their guts. They will keep signaling their refusal to surrender to the Romney machine\u2026. So now we have Donald Trump as the current leader of the GOP peasants. The loathing of Trump by the Republican Establishment is his foremost credential. In the recent debate in Cleveland, Trump offered a remarkably full-throated endorsement of political incivility. Now is not the time to worry about \u201ctone,\u201d he declared. Dave Weigel\u2019s latest dispatch quotes a woman at a Trump rally: \u201cPeople want a real person now because we\u2019re tired of the politicians.\u201d Though \u201creal person\u201d is perhaps not the first term many of us would produce when trying to describe the mogul, the point is still clear: He\u2019s an outsider, a bomb-thrower, someone who can claim he\u2019s leading a charge on the drawbridge. If and when Trump implodes, his followers will find someone else, similarly apoplectic and rebellious, to rally behind. It won\u2019t be Jeb Bush. And then over on the left, here\u2019s Bernie! He got 27,500 people to show up at a rally in Los Angeles, and 28,000 in Portland. He\u2019s leading Hillary Clinton in the polls in New Hampshire. He\u2019s the Howard Dean of Campaign 2016. What\u2019s it mean? It means at the very least that the Democratic Establishment needs to listen to what Sanders is saying. He\u2019s no fluke. The electorate will not follow a script dictated from Washington. Didn\u2019t someone once say that democracy is messy? Next time maybe we\u2019ll talk about Shays\u2019s Rebellion in 1786-87.
