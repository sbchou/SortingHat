{"body": " Famed California pollster Joe Shumate was found dead in his home one month before Election Day 2010, surrounded by sheets of polling data he labored over for the flailing Senate bid of Carly Fiorina. Upon his death, Fiorina praised Shumate as \u201cthe heart and soul\u201d of her team. She issued a news release praising him as a person who believed in \u201cinvesting in those he worked with\u201d and offering her \u201csincerest condolences\u201d to his widow. But records show there was something Fiorina did not offer his widow: Shumate\u2019s last paycheck, for at least $30,000. It was one of more than 30 invoices, totaling about $500,000, that the multimillionaire didn\u2019t settle \u2014 even as Fiorina reimbursed herself nearly $1.3\u00a0million she loaned the campaign. She finally cleared most of the balance in January, a few months before announcing her run for president. \u201cOccasionally, I\u2019d call and tell her she should pay them,\u201d said Martin Wilson, Fiorina\u2019s former campaign manager, who found Shumate after the pollster collapsed from a heart attack. \u201cShe just wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Fiorina has emerged in recent weeks as a top-tier candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, impressing voters with a pair of crisp debate performances and a promise to put her bottom-line inclination as a Fortune 50 chief executive to fix a broken Washington.   Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina took on Trump and his comment regarding her \"persona.\" Hear her other memorable moments from the second GOP debate. (CNN)   But that fiscal sensibility was largely absent from Fiorina\u2019s other run for office \u2014 a quixotic and unsuccessful attempt to unseat longtime Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.).  [What a difference a debate makes: Carly Fiorina surges]  In more than two dozen interviews, staff members, friends, contractors and operatives who worked on Fiorina\u2019s 2010 campaign singled out one big problem: how the team managed its cash. Many said Fiorina spent too much on television ads with narrow appeal, while others said she was an anemic fundraiser who did not keep close enough tabs on her coffers. There also were concerns that some events were too lavish. At the 2010 state Republican convention, Fiorina spoke on a stage in the round, surrounded by bright lights and big screens, before debuting an elaborately produced eight-minute video of Boxer being transfigured into a talking blimp. The whole thing was far more TED talk than stump speech. \u201cIt had to be in the six figures for that speech alone,\u201d said one longtime California Republican official, who was not authorized to talk to the media and spoke anonymously. \u201cEven Reagan did not have so many bells and whistles.\u201d Those who waited the longest to be paid were small businesses with a few dozen employees who did the grunt work of the campaign: building stages, sending out mailers, selling polling data. And at least one is still waiting. Jon Seaton, the managing partner of East Meridian Strategies, confirmed that his group billed Fiorina\u2019s campaign for $18,000 on Oct. 6, 2010, for printing 21,290 mailers. A Fiorina staff member wired money for the postage immediately and promised the remaining $9,000 \u201cearly next week,\u201d according to e-mails obtained by The Washington Post. Six weeks went by and nothing came. So Seaton asked again. Then again. As of last week, he said he was still waiting. Jan van Lohuizen, whose small firm did surveys for Fiorina, said he wasn\u2019t paid the $7,500 he was owed until this year. Van Lohuizen said he assumed Fiorina was running for Senate again because her campaign reached out to settle up days after Boxer announced she was retiring. \u201cTurns out my instinct was right, but I got [the] office wrong,\u201d van Lohuizen said. Fiorina, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment. Her supporters say the criticism was misplaced. \u201cPeople are just upset and angry and throwing her under the bus,\u201d said Jon Cross, Fiorina\u2019s operations director for her Senate campaign. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t win, why do you deserve to get paid? If you don\u2019t succeed in business, you shouldn\u2019t be the first one to step up and complain about getting paid.\u201d Her supporters cautioned that little could be gleaned from her California campaign. They maintain that Fiorina\u2019s corporate experience is more akin to managing a presidential campaign than a bid for office in one of the nation\u2019s most liberal states. \u201cWe know many people didn\u2019t win their first election, so I think you should never overstate that fact,\u201d said Sue Ellspermann, Indiana\u2019s lieutenant governor and a Fiorina supporter. \u201cAnd I wonder if that fact would be a perceived disqualifier if she was not female. Ben Carson and Donald Trump have never run for anything.\u201d \u2018She had the resources\u2019 Fiorina first waded into politics as a surrogate for Republican Sen. John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, and she drew immediate respect for her innate political instincts. She was a warm spirit when shaking hands with voters and a sharp-tongued critic of Democrats behind the lectern. One big gaffe \u2014 saying that neither McCain nor his vice presidential running mate, Sarah Palin, could run a corporation \u2014 led to her being pulled off television. But California Republicans were still eager to recruit her to run a campaign of her own. Democrats were worried, particularly about Fiorina\u2019s money. If she self-financed her campaign, her opponents said they feared it would embolden the argument that Boxer was a longtime senator beholden to special interests. \u201cEveryone was talking about how she had the resources to spend to win and was willing to spend it,\u201d said Rose Kapolczynski, Boxer\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cThankfully, she didn\u2019t.\u201d When Fiorina opted not to fully finance her own campaign, two members of the National Republican Senatorial Committee said they weren\u2019t worried. They figured that Fiorina\u2019s relationships in corporate America would enable her to court the $50\u00a0million or so she would need to win. In the end, she raised about $23\u00a0million \u2014 nearly $7\u00a0million of which was her own. Rather than raise money, staff members said, the corporate executive wanted a more grass-roots campaign. Forty-five percent of the money she brought in came from small donors online, said Becki Donatelli, president of Campaign Solutions, who managed Fiorina\u2019s digital presence. It was a specific strategy crafted alongside a team that included many who worked with another successful outsider-turned-Republican politician, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Unlike the famous actor, Fiorina did not electrify massive crowds, but she did not have to be intensely coached on policy ideas either, said Wilson, her campaign manager. She was also fun, unafraid to sing along to \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d and craft songs about her Yorkshire terriers, Snickers and Max, while cruising along the freeway. Early polls showed Fiorina with a shot. Her campaign thought the winning votes she needed could be found in the struggling communities in the state\u2019s agricultural heartland, where she felt she could charm Democrats and independents with in-person visits. The Central Valley had been wrecked by drought, which farmers thought was made worse by a water policy that favored endangered fish over their irrigation needs. Robert Silva, the Democratic mayor of the city of Mendota, invited Fiorina to campaign there to see the policy\u2019s effect on his small town, where drug use had spiked and farmworkers had lost work. \u201cSometimes, the politicians can forget the Central Valley exists,\u201d Silva said. \u201cSo we thought very highly of her that she even came by.\u201d Fiorina walked along dusty streets and shuttered grocery stores, listening to farmworkers in T-shirts and ripped jeans lament how government policy hurt their livelihoods. \u201cWhat she saw in Mendota haunted her,\u201d said Mason Harrison, Fiorina\u2019s former field director. \u201cShe made a pledge at every single stop after that she will never forget the people who sent her to Washington.\u201d Still, as a political strategy, many inside her camp and outside questioned whether her focus on the Central Valley was a waste of time and money, in such a big and expensive state. \u201cThe more time she spent talking about agriculture in the Central Valley, the better it was for us,\u201d said Kapolczynski, adding that their concerns were too distant and specific to resonate with swing voters hundreds of miles away. She added: \u201cYou would think a former CEO would have thought of this.\u201d  [This is the ad that could sink Carly Fiorina's campaign]  On election night, Fiorina carried Mendota, indeed. But she lost across the state by 10 points. \u201cIn the end, we could not overcome the registration advantage that Democrats had, particularly in L.A. county,\u201d Fiorina said at a news conference. Declining to pay after loss As the race came to a close, Fiorina was unaware that her campaign was out of money, said three people who worked for her. They said Fiorina had delegated responsibilities for finances to staff members, who decided to advertise heavily on TV, including ads highlighting the plight of the Central Valley. When Fiorina learned that the campaign was in debt, she was furious. But she also refused to pay up, saying the problem belonged to the campaign itself \u2014 Carly for California. Many campaigns end up in debt, including that of Hillary Rodham Clinton, who did not close out the $20\u00a0million she owed from her 2008 presidential campaign until January 2013. Struggling campaigns often set up payment plans or hold fundraisers to pay their bills. Fiorina\u2019s staff members said they asked her to do the same. She declined. In a meeting the day after, campaign workers said, she thanked her professional staff and shared a meaningful memory with each of them. \u201cCarly\u2019s focus is a strength, and it can be her biggest weakness sometimes,\u201d said Deborah Bowker, her chief of staff and one of Fiorina\u2019s closest friends. \u201cWe designed the campaign as a broad critique of Barbara Boxer \u2014 not as a way to defend Carly \u2014 and I think she became so entrenched in the critique she was giving that she missed some of the political realities of our campaign.\u201d Returning to Silicon Valley, Bowker said the two appreciated how unrealistic their quest might have been. They considered how hard it was for a conservative to win in California. And how hard it was to deal with unexpected complications on the trail. One week before the election, Fiorina was hospitalized to deal with an infection related to her breast cancer. \u201cIt was a moment of, \u2018What were we thinking?\u2019\u2008\u201d Bowker recalled. \u201cBut it was fun.\u201d  Alice Crites contributed to this report.
