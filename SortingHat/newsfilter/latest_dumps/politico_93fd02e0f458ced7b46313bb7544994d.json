There will be 11 candidates on the main stage for the primetime GOP presidential debate next week, CNN announced Thursday evening, and once again, Trump will be at center stage.\nDonald Trump, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina will be on stage for the 8pm EDT debate. For the earlier, 6pm EDT debate, the participants are Rick Perry, Bobby Jindal, Rick Santorum, George Pataki and Lindsey Graham. \nJust like with the Fox debate in August, CNN used poll standings to determine the order the candidates would appear on stage. Trump will once again be center stage, flanked by Carson to his right and Bush to his left. Walker, Fiorina, Kasich and Christie, in that order, will stand to Bush's left, while Cruz, Rubio, Huckabee and Paul will appear to Carson's right.\nIn the earlier debate, Perry will stand center stage, with Jindal and Graham to his left and Santorum and Pataki to his right.\nOur colleague Steve Shepard has more on the line up and how it all came together here. \nHadas Gold is a reporter at\u00a0Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "It's official.
