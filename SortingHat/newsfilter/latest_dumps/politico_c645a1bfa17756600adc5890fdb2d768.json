It is all of our people, and there are a couple of things Donald Trump doesn\u2019t understand, two of them,\u201d O\u2019Malley said, flanked by employees of the real-estate magnate\u2019s gold-plated Trump International Hotel and leaders of Culinary Workers Union Local 226, which has a large contingent of Latino members.\n\u201cNo. 1, that if we want our economy to grow, we need to treat our workers with dignity and respect, pay them better and respect their right to organize. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d O\u2019Malley said, to cheers and applause.\nAlso on POLITICO\nNICK GASS\nOn his second point, O\u2019Malley pointed to new immigrants that have made the U.S. economy stronger and better \u201cin every generation.\u201d\n\u201cThe hard truth of our times, though, is still this, that 70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 10 years ago. And that\u2019s not the way our economy is supposed to work,\u201d he said, adding that it should be easier to join unions and bargain collectively, as well as pass comprehensive immigration reform.\n\u201cThat is the very concrete promise that\u2019s at the very heart of the American dream that we share,\u201d he said.\nOver the past 30 or 40 years, however, O\u2019Malley remarked, the U.S. economy has worked \u201cvery, very well for Trump, but it doesn\u2019t work well for the rest of us.\u201d\n\u201cI want to say that all of these workers here have a lot more guts\u201d than the Republicans running for their party\u2019s nomination, he said. \u201cThey have the courage to stand up to the hate, to the division, to the sort of rhetoric that makes it harder for us to make our economy grow and work well for all Americans.\u201d\nBy JOSH ZEITZ\nBy MATTHEW MILLER\nBy JACK SHAFER\nBy MATT LATIMER\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "\"Our economy is not money, our economy is people,\" says O'Malley.", "title": "Martin O'Malley trolls Trump in Vegas", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/martin-omalley-donald-trump-las-vegas-121526.html", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Donald Trump", "Martin O'Malley"], "orgs": ["Trump International Hotel", "Culinary Workers Union Local"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30728, "fullname": "nick gass", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-08-19 19:35:41", "org": "politico", "article_id": "c645a1bfa17756600adc5890fdb2d768", "date_access": "2015-08-19 20:20:13.456183"}
