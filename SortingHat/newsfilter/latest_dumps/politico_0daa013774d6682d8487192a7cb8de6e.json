Jeb Bush attends the first taping of \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert\" on Sept. 8 in New York City.   | Getty\nAfter being routinely ridiculed as \"low energy\" by GOP polling leader Donald Trump \u2013 and after a painfully funny video of a woman nodding off as he talked health policy \u2013 Jeb Bush is taking a huge risk, willingly venturing onto a stage where politicians are often skewered.\nHe\u2019s going on television with Stephen Colbert, who debuts Tuesday night as the new host of The Late Show on CBS.\nThe risk-averse Hillary Clinton was first offered the guest slot on Colbert\u2019s opener and turned it down, eschewing an interview on a show millions will watch because of the host\u2019s known ability to deflate big egos and make his guests the butt of his jokes. She opted to appear instead on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, who offers a friendlier foil to would-be guests.\nBush jumped at the opportunity to sit in the guest\u2019s chair on Colbert\u2019s premiere. (He was initially offered an appearance sometime later in the show's first week.)\n\u201cVoters want to get to know the person running for president. This is a unique opportunity to do it,\u201d said Tim Miller, a Bush spokesman. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a ton of interest in it, compared to your average late night show \u2013 there\u2019ll be more eyeballs. It was tough to pass up.\u201d\nWhile fraught with risk for a candidate who has already made his share of unforced errors, the appearance also offers Bush an opportunity for a spontaneous, unscripted moment that could help the one-time frontrunner break out of his slump.\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\n\u201cThe stakes are getting higher for Jeb because more people are beginning to question whether he\u2019s got it, whether he\u2019s a viable candidate for the presidency,\u201d said Guy Benson, a conservative pundit and author. \u201cWith everyone else but Donald Trump starved for media oxygen, an interview like this will probably attract more scrutiny. It will benefit him if he does well, but could further a negative narrative if he bombs or if he\u2019s just boring.\u201d\nIn 1992, Bill Clinton\u2019s sunglasses-wearing, saxophone-playing performance on The Arsenio Hall Show solidified his appeal to minority and young voters. Hall, however, was not known for routinely mocking the guests who appeared on his show. Since then, it's become increasingly commonplace for politicians to appear on late-night television shows and even YouTube channels in an effort reveal a lighter, less-scripted side. And to reach younger voters.\nBut it can hurt too. No one knows the sting of Colbert\u2019s satire better than Jeb Bush\u2019s brother, former President George W. Bush, who the then-Comedy Central star, in the persona of the conservative pundit character he played on The Colbert Report, mocked for a good 20 minutes at the 2006 White House Correspondents Association dinner with the president seated just beside him on stage. \nIn the searing routine, Colbert ripped the president over his response to Hurricane Katrina and his declaration of victory in Iraq aboard an aircraft carrier in 2003. \u201cI stand by this man,\u201d Colbert said that night with Bush seated a few feet away. \u201cI stand by this man because he stands for things. Not only for things, he stands on things. Things like aircraft carriers, and rubble, and recently flooded city squares. And that sends a strong message: that no matter what happens to America, she will always rebound\u2014with the most powerfully staged photo ops in the world.\"\n\n\n\n            By \nMarc Caputo\n\nLast week, after Bush\u2019s campaign launched a raffle, offering a ticket to Tuesday\u2019s taping to anyone who gave $3 to his campaign, Colbert gave Bush a taste of what may be in store, releasing a video in which he appeared to be miffed over the raffle. \n\u201cNo one from Jeb\u2019s campaign asked if this was okay with me to raise money off my first show,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cWhere\u2019s my cut of that sweet three bucks, Governor? Huh?\u201d\nBush, who riffed on the exchange during a town hall last week, has said that his campaign did receive permission, hinting that the host\u2019s video shtick was a joke. With Colbert, of course, it\u2019s not always clear what is and isn\u2019t a joke \u2013 or who\u2019s the butt of it.\nOver the last two months, Trump has done everything in his power to turn Bush into a laughing stock, antagonizing the former Florida governor by criticizing his speaking Spanish, dismissing him as \u201clow energy\u201d and taunting him about their opposite trajectories in the GOP field \u2013 Trump rising in the polls as Jeb drops.\nAP Photo\n On Tuesday, Trump posted another video to his Instagram account showing video of the factory worker who nodded off last Thursday during Bush\u2019s town hall in Hampton, New Hampshire and referring to Bush as a \u201ccure for insomnia.\u201d\n\u201cWake up Jeb supporters!\u201d Trump wrote alongside the post.\nEven as Bush has shifted his strategy and willingly engaged Trump, who he criticizes now almost every time he grabs a microphone, his campaign continues to search for a spark and a way to break out of his campaign's tendency to be programmatic.\n\u201cHe keeps insisting that he is running a joyful campaign,\u201d Benson said. \u201cPerhaps on a comedy show, he\u2019ll have an opportunity to showcase a joy that\u2019s been less than apparent to many voters of late.\u201d \n\nEli Stokols is a national politics reporter.\n\n                                            By \nJohn Culhane\n\n\n                                            By \n                                                    Julian E.
