{"body": "As we move from the slow weeks of summer into the furious fall of politics, the season of Trump rolls on.\u00c2\u00a0Donald Trump has consistently led in national polls since the Fourth of July. He leads in every state that doesn\u2019t have a hometown favorite (and even in Florida, Mr. Trump is polling ahead of former Gov.\u00c2\u00a0Jeb Bush and sitting Sen. Marco Rubio). Mr. Trump has had a consistent lead in Iowa. In the most recent poll out of New Hampshire, he is in the mid-thirties and looks to be rising further; Ohio Gov. John Kasich, in second place, is 24 points behind. In Monmouth University polling published Tuesday, Mr. Trump is in first place South Carolina, with 30% support; the second-place candidate, Ben Carson, has half that, at 15%.\nAs I wrote recently, Republican primary voters, at least at this early stage, seem to be prioritizing their frustration with politics as usual and valuing outsider status over candidates\u2019 conservatism and national electability.\u00c2\u00a0Mr.\u00c2\u00a0Trump\u2019s unconventional style and his name-calling (most recently, Megyn Kelly of Fox News again and Sen. Lindsey Graham) don\u2019t seem to be a liability; in fact, among his supporters right now his style appears to be an asset. When I talked to Trump supporters in Iowa this month and with voters in other states, the message I heard is consistent: They like that he will take on folks in the media and other politicians.\nThe question is: Will this continue as the race develops and voter engagement becomes more intense? It\u2019s possible that he may at some point cross a line in how he talks about public officials, though presumably he would not directly insult voters. Right now, at least, it seems that the Summer of Trump is not turning into his fall but, rather, the continuing fall of the GOP establishment\u2013and the rise of controversial rhetoric.\nMatthew J.
