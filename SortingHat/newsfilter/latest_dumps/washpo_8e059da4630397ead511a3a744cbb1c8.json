{"body": " GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump will sign a pledge Thursday to support the Republican nominee in next year\u2019s general election, effectively ruling out a third-party or independent run, according to two Republicans familiar with the move. The promise, which Trump has long avoided making, brings him closer to a party whose rank-and-file activists he has thrilled this summer but whose leadership has at times viewed his rapid ascent with alarm, especially the prospect of an outside bid that could siphon away votes from the eventual standard-bearer. The Republicans familiar with Trump\u2019s decision requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. They also said that Trump may have caveats or conditions upon signing that have not yet been shared beyond the businessman\u2019s tight-knit inner circle. These Republicans said that even as Trump wants to be a team player and plans to abide by the pledge, his priority is to be treated with he often refers to as \u201crespect\u201d by the national GOP. If that relationship should ever sour, he could consider changing his mind. But for now, Trump\u2019s embrace of the Republican Party is a victory for the officials who have been unsure about his political intentions. Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, declined to comment about whether Trump would put pen to paper later today, and cautioned that the billionaire contender can be unpredictable. \u201cOnly DJT speaks for DJT,\u201d Lewandowski wrote in a text message to The Washington Post, referencing the candidate. Trump will make the announcement at an afternoon news conference at Trump Tower, his campaign headquarters in New York, where he will sign the loyalty statement alongside its author, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus. That appearance will follow a meeting with Priebus. One of the Republicans who has been briefed said Trump believes that pledge provides him with two political assets: increased pressure on his many rivals to give assurance that they will back him should he be the nominee, and possible new support from Republicans who so far have been wary of his reluctance to commit to supporting the GOP through the end of the 2016 race. For months, Republican leaders have been trying to prevent Trump, the real-estate mogul who has rocketed to the top of GOP polls, from running as an independent candidate if he does not win the Republican nomination. In the Aug. 6 debate in Cleveland, Trump memorably refused to rule out a third-party run, though he has since signaled a possible change of heart as some state parties are requiring loyalty oaths as a condition of appearing on their state\u2019s primary ballots. RNC staffers reached out this week to campaigns requesting that their candidates sign a sheet pledging loyalty to the party\u2019s eventual nominee, according to campaign officials. The one-page pledge is not a legal contract or binding. Rather, it is a political document and a symbol of Republican fealty. \u201cI [name] affirm that if I do not win the 2016 Republican nomination for president of the United States I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is,\u201d reads the document. \u201cI further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party.\u201d Former RNC chairman Jim Gilmore, who is one of 17 GOP presidential candidates, said he supports the national party\u2019s push for candidates to pledge loyalty. \u201cIf someone is going to go to the party and ask for their support, if they\u2019re going to ask the rank and file for their vote, that comes with an obligation for loyalty, in my mind,\u201d said Gilmore, a former Virginia governor. \u201cGenerally speaking, if you want the party\u2019s support, that loyalty should be there.\u201d Michael Steele, another former RNC chairman, said Priebus had wanted to get Trump\u2019s flirtation with a third-party run \u201ccleared up\u201d before the next debate, scheduled for Sept. 16 on CNN. \u201cI appreciate what he is trying to do, trying to bring some level of order to this situation,\u201d Steele said. \u201cThe expectation should be if you\u2019re running to be nominee of the party, you should support the nominee of the party.\u201d Steele added that Trump may have calculated that \u201cthere is no real upside to poking the party in the eye. He doesn\u2019t want people to peel off from him because they don\u2019t see him as being a team player. I think that\u2019s the way he sees it.\u201d  Philip Rucker contributed reporting.
