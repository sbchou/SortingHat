The online ad says, \u201cIf fences don\u2019t work, why does Barack Obama use one?\" The image shows a close-up of the White House fence, with #MakeAmericaGreatAgain.\n\u201cThis image highlights the remarkable hypocrisy of the Obama Administration in refusing to approach border security seriously and build a wall. If President Obama is not confident in the efficacy of fences, why does one protect him at the White House?\u201d the PAC said in a statement.\nGallegos and Vlahakis are both from the Chicago area. \u201cOver the last decade, we have become increasingly distraught with the direction of the country and the lack of any substantive changes in Washington regardless of who is elected. Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy excites us because he is serious about solving the challenges we face,\u201d the founders told Fox News.\nBoth say this online ad will be the first of many. They hope to expand their footprint beyond Drudge in the coming months.\nGallegos and Vlahakis started laying the ground work for their PAC in early July and filed their Statement of Organization with the FEC at the end of the month. They were officially recognized Aug. 7.\nThe Art of the Deal PAC isn\u2019t the first pro-Trump group to organize.\nIn July, the Make America Great Again PAC was launched. At the time, the group\u2019s legal counsel Jon Anderson said: \u201cAmerica requires proven and successful leaders who will return our country to excellence.\u00a0 Make America Great Again is supporting leaders who will answer that charge, including Donald Trump.\u201d\n\u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "A pro-Trump, independent PAC has announced their first wave of online advertising in support of Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 run the White House.", "title": "Pro-Trump PAC launches first online ad wave", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/DP0FvxKAOwU/", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Barack Obama", "Dan Gallegos"], "orgs": ["Art of the Deal PAC", "America Great Again", "PAC", "America Great Again PAC", "FEC"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-08-18 13:35:42", "org": "fox", "article_id": "2036736b9df27fba952a3df1c3c3910f", "date_access": "2015-08-18 13:00:08.062097"}
