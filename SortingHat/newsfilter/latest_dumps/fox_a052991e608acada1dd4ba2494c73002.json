The way she was seen as controversial, you know, on the edge of corruption, not trustworthy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s an impression that, even though the details aren\u2019t known, it\u2019s going to be very hard for her to overcome.\u201d", "byline": "", "description": "Syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer said on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d Friday that Hillary Clinton has squandered a chance to start fresh with her presidential campaign, instead allowing \u201cself-inflicted\u201d wounds to redefine her as someone not to be trusted.", "title": "Krauthammer: Clinton's 'self-inflicted wounds' have redefined her", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/PGbIkA7JZXk/", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "women"], "people": ["Clinton Cash", "Peter Schweizer", "Bret Baier", "Hillary Clinton", "Charles Krauthammer"], "orgs": ["Chelsea Clinton Foundation", "Hoover Institution"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-04-25 02:35:24", "org": "fox", "article_id": "a052991e608acada1dd4ba2494c73002", "date_access": "2015-04-25 01:55:07.219274"}
