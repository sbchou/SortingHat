She also briefly previewed her forthcoming salvo on drug costs.\n\u201cIt is time to deal with skyrocketing out-of-pocket costs and runaway prescription drug prices,\u201d she said. She referred to a Sunday New York Times report on how a 62-year-old medicine jumped from $13.50 a pill to $750 after a company bought it last month. She added: \u201cNobody in America should have to choose between buying their medicine and paying their rent.\u201d\n\n2016\n\n            By \nGabriel Debenedetti\n\nRecent polls have found that high drugs costs are the No. 1 health care priority of Americans, eclipsing Obamacare even among Republicans and independents. Clinton follows her chief rival for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, who released a similar plan earlier this month. New drugs with high price tags \u2014 like $14,000 a month cholesterol drugs and $100,000-plus cancer treatments \u2014 have caught the public's attention.\nOne of her ideas would target insurers, setting a monthly limit of $250 on out-of-pocket costs for covered drugs, as has been done already in Maine and for Obamacare exchange plans in California.Clinton\u2019s policies also include some that the Obama administration has repeatedly pushed but have fallen flat on Capitol Hill, like lowering the monopoly marketing period for a costly new class of drugs called biologics from 12 to seven years.\nLike most Democrats, including Sanders, Clinton calls for empowering Medicare to leverage its massive negotiating power to lower prices for seniors. That's an idea that's been around since the Medicare drug law passed early in the George W. Bush administration, but the GOP has consistently opposed it.\nClinton and Sanders would let Americans re-import drugs from other countries, where they are often sold at half the price. And they would outlaw so-called pay-for-delay settlements in patent litigation in which brand name companies pay their generic competitors to hold off on marketing a cheaper copycat drug.\nClinton would require deeper rebates on drugs for low-income people on the Medicare program \u2014 the same provided to those on Medicaid. That's the source of the estimated $100 billion in savings. \nClinton\u2019s plan includes some less familiar proposals as well, which were aired last week in a policy paper by the liberal Center for American Progress. Those include requiring companies that benefit from federal spending on basic research, such as through NIH, to spend a certain amount on research and development. \n\n\n\n            By \nJosh Gerstein\n\nThat's fashioned after an Obamacare requirement that insurers spend a fixed percentage of the premiums they collect on medical care, or else pay rebates to consumers. The think tank last week also recommended giving an independent organization the authority to assess how a new drug compares to existing treatments, and recommend a price range to help insurers negotiate. Clinton is backing a similar proposal.\nGabriel Debenedetti contributed to this report.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "She is unveiling a plan to drive down the cost of prescriptions.", "title": "Hillary Clinton taking on drug industry", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/hillary-clinton-prescription-drugs-health-care-213910", "topics": ["abortion", "health"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Amy Chozick", "Kenneth P.
