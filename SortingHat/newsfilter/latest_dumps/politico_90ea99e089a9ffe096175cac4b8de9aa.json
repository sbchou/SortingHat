{"body": "Campaigns\nThe latest POLITICO scoops and coverage of the 2016 elections.\nBy Henry C. Jackson\n8/13/15 8:24 PM EDT\nBy Henry C. Jackson\nTHE CLOCK: 454 days until Election Day 2016 \u2026\nStory Continued Below\nTHE DEBATE CLOCK: 34 days until the next Republican debate ... 61 days until the first Democratic debate.\nARE THE POLLS SKEWED?: POLITICO\u2019s Steve Shepard reports: DONALD TRUMP is on top in Iowa, BEN CARSON is on his heels, and BERNIE SANDERS has flown past HILLARY CLINTON in New Hampshire.\u00a0That\u2019s the snapshot polls captured this week. It\u2019s a far cry from the Bush-Clinton horse race that many had predicted going into the 2016 campaign season \u2014 and it belies conventional wisdom that predicted Trump\u2019s demise after he attacked Fox News host Megyn Kelly after last week\u2019s GOP presidential debate. The numbers have skeptics asking: Are these numbers the real deal?\nSome Republicans have insisted for months that Trump\u2019s meteoric rise in the polls vastly overstates his standing in the race because the polls are surveying people who \u2014 despite what they tell pollsters \u2014 won\u2019t actually cast ballots in their state\u2019s primary or caucus. That argument reached a new crescendo Wednesday, after a CNN/ORC poll showed the real estate magnate with a significant lead in Iowa, trailed by neurosurgeon Ben Carson.\nWhat nearly everyone can agree on is that Trump\u2019s dominance in the polls is impressive. He has led the last 26 independent polls of national Republicans \u2014 counting all surveys conducted by live telephone operators, automated phone calls and over the Internet. Yet focusing on the polls released over the past five days \u2014 essentially just a few scattered data points \u2014 is where things get dicey. Overlooked in the clamor is the fact that no national poll conducted by live interviewers has been released since the debate. Instead, most of the polling action was in the small states that vote first, Iowa and New Hampshire, where polling can be more volatile. http://politi.co/1L9IXoU\nTGIT, you\u2019re doing it wrong if you\u2019re not headed to the Iowa State Fair.

SCOTT WALKER gets detailed about when he\u2019ll give details. MIKE HUCKABEE kicks off the descent of hungry candidates to the Iowa fairgrounds. \nTHE DAILY CLINTON \nEMAIL DRIP DRIP: Fox News: \u201cThe latest revelations about top secret information traversing HILLARY CLINTON's private email server have triggered accusations that someone in her \u2018inner circle\u2019 likely stripped the classification markings, illegally. The claims come after the Clinton campaign stuck to the argument that the Democratic presidential candidate, while secretary of state, never dealt with emails that were \u2018marked\u2019 classified at the time. \u2018Hillary only used her personal account for unclassified email. No information in her emails was marked classified at the time she sent or received them,\u2019 campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement to supporters Wednesday.\u201d http://fxn.ws/1P9qKG7\nHUMA HUNT: POLITICO\u2019s Rachel Bade reports: \u201cHuma Abedin, HILLARY CLINTON\u2019s most trusted confidante, is increasingly becoming a central figure in the email scandal that\u2019s haunting her boss \u2026 as Republicans and federal judges seek information about Clinton\u2019s communications while she was running the State Department. The 2016 Democratic front-runner on Monday told a federal judge that Abedin \u2026 had her own email account on Clinton\u2019s now infamous home-brewed server, \u2018which was used at times for government business,\u2019 Clinton acknowledged. That\u2019s an unusual arrangement, even for top brass at the State Department.\u201d http://politi.co/1N64HCA\n2016 MVP: @BillKristol tweets: \u201cMost valuable Republican of the 2016 election cycle so far: @TGowdySC.\u201d http://bit.ly/1L9i4kV\nTHE MAP OF HILLARY\u2019S MONEY: POLITICO\u2019s Daniel Lippman: \u201cBeverly Hills. West Hollywood. Georgetown. The Upper East Side. Chicago\u2019s Lakefront. Not exactly hot spots for the \u2018everyday Americans\u2019 HILLARY CLINTON says she\u2019s running to represent. But these are the cities and exclusive neighborhoods where Clinton is raising gobs of the big-dollar donations that help make up the $45 million she raised in the second quarter.\u201d http://politi.co/1L9eW8A\nCHUG! In a Time Q&A, Claire McCaskill is asked if she\u2019ll shotgun a beer if Clinton is elected. \u201cI\u2019ve done it once at the urging of my kids. But electing the first woman President? Hell, yes, I\u2019m down. Maybe I could talk her into doing one with me, huh?\u201d http://ti.me/1MpzZEc\nTHE PROGRESSIVE RESISTANCE \nTHINKING ABOUT RUNNING: NBC: JOE BIDEN \u201cis spending part of his South Carolina vacation calling close friends to discuss a potential 2016 run \u2026 Biden is not calling people asking \u2018if\u2019 he should run, but saying, \u2018I am thinking about it but I\u2019m also thinking about Beau,\u2019 according to a source close to Biden \u2026 The source who got a call from Biden this week said, \u2018I think he is doing the analysis and the homework.\u2019\u201d http://nbcnews.to/1J2xUXP\nOBAMA\u2019D: On The Nightly Show, Larry Wilmore explored the possibility that BERNIE SANDERS could overtake HILLARY CLINTON. \u201cShe\u2019s about to get Obama\u2019d by an old white man. It is one thing for a cool brother to just burst into the scene and all that brotherness just fills out on the campaign trail. That\u2019s just science. But when people are more inspired by a guy who looks like the about-to-retire dean of students at Oberlin, I gotta ask: What the hell is going on?\u201d http://on.cc.com/1ILrQGb\nWHY BERNIE WILL FALTER: Washington Post: \u201cHow is it possible that the chattering classes are still giving them almost no chance \u2014 not only to win the presidency, but even their parties' nominations? There\u2019s actually a very good reason: It\u2019s because people do care about electability. They just don\u2019t care about it yet.\u201d http://wapo.st/1h79kzd\nTRUMP ON THE STUMP \nI-O-W-A: Washington Post: \u201cWhen the hulking vehicle with thick white block letters that spell T-R-U-M-P pulled into a Wal-Mart parking lot in Fort Dodge this week, people flocked to it \u2026 For many Americans the [DONALD] TRUMP presidential campaign amounts to a billionaire talking endlessly, and entertainingly, on television. But here in Iowa, it\u2019s another story. Trump is trying to beat the politicians at their own game, building one of the most extensive field organizations in the Republican field.\u201d http://wapo.st/1h75je9\nBAD DINNER GUEST: Time: \u201c\"GOP prayers for his departure from the race remain unanswered, and the prospect of his sticking around ... seems high. [DONALD] TRUMP is the dinner guest who will not leave. ... there\u2019s no incentive for Trump to go away. As long as he stays in the news, owns the debates and floats at the top of the polls, he\u2019s ahead. He books television interviews and sends tweets to his 3.7 million followers for free, which means he doesn\u2019t need ads.\u201d http://ti.me/1N645ww\nTHE ROAD TO $10 BILLION: The Wall Street Journal: \u201cOver the past decade, DONALD TRUMP has earned millions of dollars for extolling ACN Inc., a multilevel marketing firm that has weathered regulatory investigations in three countries. Trump not only endorsed ACN, he twice featured the company on his former reality TV show, \u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice.\u201d Both episodes featured teams of entertainment figures competing to promote versions of a video phone sold by the North Carolina firm. \u201cI think the ACN video phone is amazing,\u201d Trump said in an ACN news release just before a two-hour, prime time Sunday night Celebrity Apprentice episode on the product in 2011. \u201cI simply can\u2019t imagine anybody using this phone and not loving it.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1h6jjoH\nYOU\u2019RE (STILL) FIRED: POLITICO\u2019s Dylan Byers reports: \u201cDONALD TRUMP will not return to NBC's \"Celebrity Apprentice\" following his presidential campaign, NBC Entertainment Chairman Bob Greenblatt said Thursday. In a Q&A at the Television Critics Association Press Tour, Greenblatt described Trump as a \"lovely guy\" to work with ... But when asked if Trump might return to \"The Apprentice,\" \u2026 Greenblatt was defiant: \"Absolutely not.\" http://politi.co/1Pa8NXQ\nWALKER\u2019S WORLD: \nROLLOUTS COMING: Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel: SCOTT WALKER \u201csays he will soon begin unveiling policy positions on health care, national security and other issues expected to play major roles in the 2016 presidential race \u2026 speaking to reporters after addressing the DuPage County GOP \u2026 \u201cWe\u2019ve been in this race for just a month. Literally a month ago, today, we got in the race, but we\u2019ll be laying out the specifics out in hopes that in the next debate we talk about that, as opposed to just talking about attacks on any of the candidates.\u201d http://bit.ly/1J31IUp\nGOVERNOR TRASH TALK: WMUR: \u201cSCOTT WALKER said Thursday he knows and likes JOHN KASICH and CHRIS CHRISTIE, but the Wisconsin governor said \u2026 he didn\u2019t accept Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion dollars.\u201d http://bit.ly/1gEgWsi\nWHAT ARENA?: In the same WMUR interview, Walker says, \u201cI don\u2019t know the owners\u201d of the Milwaukee Bucks. But as, @reidepstein notes, \u201cOne of them is national finance co-chair of his campaign.\u201d http://bit.ly/1Paa3KF\nWILEY\u2019S TAKE: Walker\u2019s campaign manager, Rick Wiley, appearing on CNN today, and played down a perceived slip in the polls for his candidate: \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of time to go in this race \u2026 This nomination has to be earned.\u201d\nKASICH\u2019S CASE \nFLORIDA SQUEEZE: POLITICO\u2019s Kyle Cheney reports: \u201cThere\u2019s a fresh face in New Hampshire and his name is JOHN KASICH. The Ohio governor \u2026 was a late entrant to the 2016 Republican race with limited name recognition and plenty of ground to make up against JEB BUSH, whose establishment lane Kasich has been trying to horn in on. He\u2019s been storming New Hampshire, on TV and in person, with vigor, hoping for a meeting of the moderate minds and spirits in the state will help him catch fire.\u201d http://politi.co/1J2e4ft\nMODERATE APPEAL: The New York Times: JOHN KASICH \u201cunabashedly promotes his expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare, shows little appetite for relitigating culture-war battles like same-sex marriage and offers not much more than a shrug when asked about HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON\u2019S turning over her email server to the F.B.I. \u2026 At a moment when many of his Republican rivals are vying to criticize President Obama and Mrs. Clinton most sharply ...\u00a0 Kasich is taking the opposite approach. And it is paying off \u2014 at least in New Hampshire, a \u201cquirky but crucial state where answers to questions about transportation funding can become applause lines.\u201d http://nyti.ms/1L9bgRx\nCONSERVATIVE SKEPTICISM: Hot Air post: \u201cKasich: Yes on possibly allowing illegals to become citizens, no on attacking Hillary Clinton.\u201d http://bit.ly/1J2LIl9\nJEB\u2019S JOURNEY\nSTILL THE TARGET: USA Today: \u201cSure, DONALD TRUMP has the lead and most of the public's attention. But another candidate with a well-known name and a big bank account \u2014 JEB BUSH \u2014 remains the primary target for other Republicans seeking their party's 2016 presidential nomination. In some cases echoing the attacks of Democrats, Republicans have criticized Bush over immigration, Common Core, gaffes on the campaign trail and his status as the \"third Bush\" to seek the presidency in 30 years.\u201d http://usat.ly/1hzZVQF\n\u2018LIVES\u2019 DISRUPTION: POLITICO\u2019s Daniel Strauss reports: \u201cProtestors from the grass-roots movement disrupted a town hall event featuring former Florida Gov. JEB BUSH in Las Vegas late Wednesday, expanding their targets after having focused in recent weeks on the Democratic presidential contenders.\u201d http://politi.co/1DbK280\nFIREFIGHTER FRIEND: National Journal: \u201cWhile a major union for firefighters has donated largely to Democratic presidential candidates, there is one other candidate who they are open to looking at: JEB BUSH\u2026.a large chunk of the International Association of Fire Fighters' political giving went to Priorities USA Action, a super PAC supportive of HILLARY CLINTON, clocking in at $50,000, while also giving $5,000 to Hillary for America. IAFF general president Harold Schaitberger said along with the four Democratic candidates, IAFF had donated to Bush, and an FEC midyear report shows that IAFF FIREPAC had\u00a0made\u00a0a $5,000 contribution to Bush's Right to Rise PAC.\"\nhttp://bit.ly/1HJ3s49\nJUST CHECKING: NJ.com: \u201cPassaic County Republican Chairman John Traier and Monmouth County Republican Chairman Shaun Golden were among the folks who attended the one of Bush's two fundraisers on Christie's turf, The Auditor has learned. Both local GOP leaders are part of Christie's 200-member leadership team. Traier told The Auditor he didn't donate to Bush's campaign and still supports Christie. Instead, he went to the event as someone's guest, he said.\u201d http://bit.ly/1PnFi5E\nSURVEYING THE 2016 LANDSCAPE\n\u2018FAIR\u2019 SOAP BOX: Des Moines Register: \u201cRepublican presidential candidate MIKE HUCKABEE stuck with his main campaign trail themes Thursday during his appearance at The Des Moines Register\u2019s State Fair Soapbox \u2026 He was the first presidential candidate to appear at the Soapbox during the fair, which began Thursday ... \u2018Right now, we\u2019re designing things, we\u2019re creating things, but we\u2019re making them in China,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what we need to be doing is making them here but we can\u2019t because there\u2019s 22 percent embedded tax in everything we make here. The Fair Tax changes that and gives us the competitive edge so we bring those manufacturing jobs back.\" http://dmreg.co/1ILtBTS\nCUBA FOCUS: Miami Herald: MARCO RUBIO \u201cwants \u2026 Secretary of State John Kerry to turn over the drafts of the (human trafficking report), the names of who in his department signed off and a copy of Cuba\u2019s plan to combat trafficking \u2014 all because Rubio thinks the report was politicized.\u201d http://bit.ly/1JWf7mj\nCARLY\u2019S PIECE: Taking to Huffington Post, CARLY FIORINA writes that the \u201cstatus quo isn\u2019t working for women in America.\u201d \u201cIt has been 95 years since women got the right to vote. Fifty years since The Feminine Mystique. Sixteen years since I was named the first female CEO of a Fortune 50 company. Yet, there are only 23 female CEOs in the S&P 500 today \u2026 The status quo isn't working for women. It isn't working for most Americans \u2014 unless you are part of the political class that is wealthy and well connected.\u201d http://huff.to/1L95aAM\nBOGEY: POLITICO\u2019s Daniel Strauss reports on a RAND PAUL attack on DONALD TRUMP -- that was met with a \u201clengthy, typo-ridden statement attacking Paul and, oddly, describing a time Trump beat him at golf.\u201d http://politi.co/1PlR8x3\nSANTORUM ON THE RADIO: RICK SANTORUM's campaign is holding a contest to see which radio ad supporters want to go on the air \u2014 a positive one that talks about securing the border and ending common core, or a negative one that attacks President Barack Obama\u2019s Iran deal. The winning ad will get run on satellite and conservative talk radio. http://bit.ly/1PnGh5D\nNEXT NEWS CYCLE\nDEMOCRATS IN IOWA: HILLARY CLINTON, BERNIE SANDERS, MARTIN O\u2019MALLEY, LINCOLN CHAFEE.\nREPUBLICANS IN IOWA: CARLY FIORINA, JEB BUSH, MIKE HUCKABEE.\nMARCO RUBIO is fundraising in New York.\nTHE DAILY NUMBER\n12.
