{"body": " SPOKANE, Wa. \u2013 Rand Paul was 2,487 miles away from the Beltway journalists who had written off his campaign, and he was loving it.  A riverfront hotel ballroom had filled early, latecomers grabbing chairs from the hallway to add more rows. Seven hundred people stood for a prayer, then the Pledge of Allegiance, then the Star-Spangled Banner, then for two amen-filled endorsements from local legislators, then a video message from the senator\u2019s wife Kelley \u2014 and then, finally, for Rand Paul.  \u201cLooks like the liberty movement is alive and well and packing itself into the room!\u201d said Paul.  He wore a dress shirt and tie atop jeans and cowboy boots, his uniform for the week. He delivered a 34-minute speech, touching on everything from the Middle East to land rights to racial sentencing disparities to a rival with \u201corange hair\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump \u2013 who benefited from eminent domain. \u201cIf I\u2019m president, there\u2019ll be no incident of anyone having their private property taken and given to another owner,\u201d said Paul. Only one line drew louder applause: The one about defunding Planned Parenthood. Paul\u2019s five-day run was taking him through Western states far from the key battlefields of 2016, drawing him out on issues that don\u2019t resonate in Iowa and New Hampshire. That played to Paul\u2019s strengths. He was far more comfortable whaling on the feds for owning so much Idaho land than he was gabbing about Iowa ethanol. His stump speech, peppered with stories of lives ruined by bureaucrats, was tailor-made for people who wore hunting gear downtown or kept legal marijuana prescriptions in their hemp wallets.   As other candidates headed to Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, Rand Paul, here in Idaho, made a swing of Western states this week. (Kyle Green/Idaho Statesman via AP) LOCAL TV OUT (Kyle Green/AP)  Yet Donald Trump\u2019s speeches were running live on cable news; Paul was covered only by local media and The Washington Post. The discrepancy was felt most in Fairbanks, Alaska, where Paul spoke to around 350 people in one room while the hotel turned up the Trump speech \u2013 covered live by CNN \u2014 in another. None of that affected Paul\u2019s strategy. He was barnstorming the West because its Republican voters would cast votes in March 2016. Each of them had a large cache of delegates, and no one else was campaigning for them. New Hampshire would send 12 delegates to the next Republican convention. Alaska, where only 14,130 people participated in the last caucuses, would send 27 delegates. \u201cIt is easier to organize caucuses,\u201d Paul said in an interview on the small and noisy plane from Anchorage to Fairbanks. \u201cThey\u2019re smaller than primaries. Those who are better organized will do better in caucuses.\u201d The focus on these March contests would take Paul to Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Vermont and Maine.  The tactic was devised by his father, former Texas Rep. Ron Paul. In his 2008 and 2012 runs for the Republican nomination, the elder Paul put up some of his best numbers in those states. Rural, libertarian-minded white voters emerged, and stuck around, with Paul backers taking over some of the local Republican organizations. The \u201cliberty movement\u201d out West and in the rural Northeast was not lining up behind Paul like he expected \u2013 but who else had a potential base like that? \u201cMy dad did excite a whole generation of new people who came into the Republican Party,\u201d said Rand Paul. \u201cIt was extraordinary what he did. You can look at the glass full or half empty, and I choose to look at it half full. He started a movement.\u201d Polling has been sparse or nonexistent in the states that will hold mid-March caucuses, despite the fact that they hosted some of 2008\u2019s and 2012\u2019s biggest upsets. President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign flooded Western caucuses to gain a delegate advantage that Hillary Clinton never overcame. Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum won third place or worst first four contests after Iowa. He only became a threat to Mitt Romney after he took the Colorado and Minnesota caucuses. Paul, who is currently polling in the low single digits, is hoping that sleepy frontrunners and passionate local support will let him repeat history. Interviews with local Republicans suggested only a few campaigns had engaged so far. Only Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has an Alaska chairman. Only Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) has also campaigned in Wyoming.  \u201cThe model is what we\u2019re doing in the SEC primaries in the South,\u201d said Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler, referring to the bloc of Southern states that will vote on March 1. \u201cWe\u2019ve done more extensive travel than anyone else there; we\u2019ve got 186 leaders backing us in Southern states. The idea that you can go and win one of the early three states and just hope to cash in on that and convert it in terms of momentum and money in March has never worked out. You need to build long before that.\u201d Art Hackney, the longtime Republican strategist who is heading up the Rubio operation in Alaska, agreed with Tyler. He had watched Alaska go for an insurgent candidate \u2014 Pat Buchanan, in 1996 \u2014 after a frontrunner ignored the state. He had helped George W. Bush win a five-vote victory in the 2000 caucuses \u2014 \u201cmy office looks like a Bush temple,\u201d he joked \u2014 but had become convinced of Rubio\u2019s skills. The senator only needed 50 signatures to make the ballot, so Hackney was getting eminent Alaska Republicans to sign, and finding that Rubio was \u201cat least the second choice\u201d of most.  \u201cWe understand the need to be successful in February for the March groundwork to bear fruit,\u201d said Jeb Bush spokesman Tim Miller. Still, Paul\u2019s single trip up West represented the most time on the ground of any 2016 candidate so far. He never drew less than 300 people to a speech, and each one put him back in touch with Ron Paul superfans. Many wore shirts from the 2012 campaign, some of it home-made.  In Seattle, one 22-year-old supporter wore a loose sweater with \u201cGod Bless Rand Paul\u201d sewed on the back, and two state legislators credited \u201cliberty\u201d politics with the party\u2019s growth in the suburbs. In Fairbanks he was shuttled around in the black H1 Hummer of two-time U.S. Senate candidate Joe Miller. In Anchorage he was shown the \u201cAlaska Liberty flag,\u201d sewn by 2012 Ron Paul delegate Barbara Anderson, the stars of the Last Frontier meshed with the Stars and Stripes. For all her enthusiasm, Anderson represented a problem unique to Rand Paul: She was working with the far-right Constitution Party, not the GOP, and she wore a pin with the slogan \u201cRemember the Maine.\u201d That slogan, borrowed from the public outrage over the 19th-century sinking of the U.S. Navy ship that helped fuel passion for the Spanish-American War, referred here to the aftermath of 2012\u2019s caucuses in that state.  Paul voters that year lost the \u201cbeauty contest\u201d stages of the Western caucuses, the ones heavily reported by the media. But they knew those battles hadn\u2019t ended. \u201cMy dad\u2019s campaign had the secret weapon of sticking around for eight or ten hours, after most people thought it was over,\u201d said Rand Paul.  They came to county caucuses. They swarmed state conventions. When the final delegations for the convention were decided, Paul\u2019s supporters had conquered Iowa, Nevada, Minnesota, and Maine. An annoyed Romney campaign managed to replace the Maine delegates, sparking a mini-protest on the convention floor. More importantly, the RNC changed caucus rules so that the \u201cbeauty contests,\u201d the events most people showed up for and covered, would decide the delegate counts. That decision alienated the liberty movement. It wasn\u2019t enough that their party rejected them. The party had decided that Paul\u2019s painstaking, grassroots organizing was essentially illegitimate, and could never be repeated. Since 2013, the Republican parties in Iowa and Alaska had been wrested back from Paul supporters. Russ Millette, a Ron Paul fan, won the Alaska GOP chairmanship but was never allowed to serve. In 2015, he would not even bother to organize for Rand. \u201cWe got burned last time, and for what?\u201d asked Millette in an interview. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the strength of persona that Ron does. Ron is a very deep, deep thinker when it comes to libertarian philosophy. Rand may be, too, but he doesn\u2019t project it that well. If he gets the nomination, I probably would vote for him, I guess.\u201d Paul\u2019s endorsers were acutely aware of the fall-off. In Spokane, county treasurer Rob Chase asked supporters to see the Washington caucuses as an opportunity to make the West matter. \u201cWe can\u2019t do much about Iowa or New Hampshire but we can affect the inland empire,\u201d he said. In Fairbanks, Joe Miller served as a living embodiment of what the establishment could do. He had won a 2010 Senate nomination, only to watch the GOP endorse a write-in campaign for Sen. Lisa Murkowski. He had ran again in 2014, and nearly won a nomination again. \u201cApathy is the problem here,\u201d said Miller. \u201cThere\u2019s been some structural crumbling of the Ron Paul movement \u2014 that\u2019s probably the best way to put it. There\u2019s a high degree of skepticism, about why you should vote at all, that is particularly pronounced in the interior of Alaska. What we need people to understand is that if we lose America, that\u2019s it. We can\u2019t let that happen. We have to participate.\u201d Even then, there was a possibility that the national or state parties would keep limiting the number of events that could be dominated by the hardcore. Last week, Colorado Republicans opted to end their caucuses. Idaho had already abandoned the caucuses for a primary. In Seattle, outgoing local GOP vice-chairman Matt Dubin speculated that Washington might scrap the most delegate-rich contest in the northwest. \u201cBinding all of the delegation to vote a certain way would really be a way to disenfranchise the most dedicated activists,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we could win most if not all of the congressional districts for Rand Paul in the caucuses. If that\u2019s the way the wind is blowing, I\u2019d be in favor of doing away with the caucus altogether.\u201d Paul, who had no say over any of that, offered no protest. There would never again be a sneak-attack caucus strategy. In order to win, he would need to reconnect with the ornery libertarian vote of the plains and mountains. And then, he\u2019d need to get more votes than the other guys. \u201cYou know, my dad didn\u2019t lose because of dishonesty,\u201d said Paul. \u201cHe lost because he didn\u2019t get enough votes. Ultimately, you do not have a winning strategy unless you win primaries. It\u2019s a great ancillary strategy to win caucuses, but we will work very hard in February to win or place very high in the first four primaries. If you don\u2019t score very high, it\u2019s hard to go on.\u201d  ", "byline": "", "description": "Lose the low-delegate, high-profile contests \u2014 and win where it matters most to the bottom line.", "title": "Rand Paul\u2019s sneak attack strategy", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rand-pauls-sneak-attack-strategy/2015/08/27/fc82d466-4ccb-11e5-bfb9-9736d04fc8e4_story.html", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "personality"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Rick Santorum", "Jeb Bush", "Mitt Romney", "Ron Paul", "Pat Buchanan", "Hillary Clinton", "Rick Tyler", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Barack Obama", "Lisa Murkowski", "Tim Miller", "George W.
