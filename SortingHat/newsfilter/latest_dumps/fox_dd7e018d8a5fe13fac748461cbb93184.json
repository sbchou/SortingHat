Why is Hillary Clinton running for president, and what policies would she pursue if elected?ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT\n\nPundits across the political spectrum have mocked the lack of a rationale for Clinton\u2019s candidacy.\u00a0Is she running for president because it\u2019s \u201cher turn,\u201d because she\u2019s the only Democrat with a truly national profile and near-universal name recognition, or because it\u2019s the next logical thing to do in her political career?\u00a0 None of these are sufficient rationales for a candidacy, but in the absence of a cogent explanation from Clinton or her campaign, it\u2019s natural for observers to make assumptions about why she\u2019s seeking the highest office in the land.\u00a0\n\nA presidential candidate is generally expected to articulate policy priorities at a relatively early point in his or her candidacy. In Clinton\u2019s case, the expectations should be even higher since she has been in public life for the better part of the last two decades.\u00a0 Thus far, however, she and her campaign have given us no substance on which to judge her candidacy.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA related problem is the Clinton campaign\u2019s failure to articulate even the broad strokes of a policy agenda that she would pursue if elected.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA presidential candidate is generally expected to articulate policy priorities at a relatively early point in his or her candidacy. In Clinton\u2019s case, the expectations should be even higher since she has been in public life for the better part of the last two decades.\u00a0 Thus far, however, she and her campaign have given us no substance on which to judge her candidacy.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nVague statements about wanting to be a \u201cchampion\u201d for \u201ceveryday Americans\u201d don\u2019t shed any real light on how she would grow our nation\u2019s economy or improve our nation\u2019s standing in the world.\u00a0 The lack of a policy agenda is particularly troubling given the fact that Clinton\u2019s record on so many significant issues has been murky at best.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n2. How damaging will the business dealings of the Clinton Foundation prove to be for Hillary\u2019s campaign?\n\nVery damaging, if last week\u2019s revelations in the New York Times are representative of the activity that the Clinton Foundation has engaged in during and since Clinton\u2019s time as Secretary of State.\u00a0The Times reported that the Clinton Foundation received millions in previously undisclosed donations from a Canadian mining executive who sold uranium-mining stakes in the United States, with the approval of then-Secretary of State Clinton, to the Russian atomic energy agency.\u00a0\n\nIt is inconceivable that Clinton and her team did not know that these donations would be a political liability.\u00a0 The way they responded to the allegations was indicative of how the Clinton machine usually responds when politically problematic issues are raised against them: they attacked the messenger and sought to frame all of the revelations as part of a conservative witch-hunt.\u00a0 But the magnitude of the allegations, as well as the outlet that the allegations were published in, make this strategy a problematic one.\n\nWe may never know the exact nature of the relationship between donors to the Clinton Foundation (which included foreign governments) and policy made while Clinton was Secretary of State.\u00a0 Her unwillingness to turn over all of the private emails from her time in the Obama administration makes a full accounting of these matters unlikely.\u00a0 But the circumstantial evidence alone is sure to cause nightmares for Clinton and her campaign.\n\n3. How will Hillary Clinton draw distance from the unpopular elements of President Obama\u2019s time in office?\n\nThis is the big question that has, thus far, gone basically unanswered.\u00a0Clinton has been reticent to attack President Obama or any of his policies.\u00a0Her unwillingness, for example, to address how she would distance herself from the failures of Obama\u2019s foreign policy or how she would deal with ObamaCare if elected president, raise both political and substantive concerns.\u00a0\n\nHer public statements thus far suggest that Clinton hasn\u2019t yet figured out how to navigate the terrain between the more progressive and conservative members of her party.\u00a0 In that sense, she will not be immune from the kind of intraparty sniping that is sure to appear in the crowded Republican primary field over the next several months.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis ankle-biting within Democratic ranks will become even more acute when others considering presidential runs, like former Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley or former Virginia Senator Jim Webb, begin to sense that there is some political gain to be had by attacking Clinton\u2019s obfuscation on key parts of the Obama record.\u00a0\n\nUltimately, Hillary Clinton is going to have to decide what kind of Democrat she wants to be as she seeks the presidency.\u00a0 And that\u2019s a choice that she hasn\u2019t exhibited an interest in making thus far.\u00a0Lanhee J.
