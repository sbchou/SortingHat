National political debates over the senator from Vermont have generally focused on whether he is too far to the left, but the question asked instead by the conferencegoers\u2014which included thousands of socialists, communists, anarchists, Marxists, Social Democrats and sundry others whose politics place them a country mile to the left of the American middle\u2014was whether Sanders is too conservative to warrant their support.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAs a socialist myself, the question of partisan politics has always been a vexing one. The first presidential campaign I voted in, I pulled the lever for Al Gore\u2014not out of a belief that he would be anything resembling a president who would represent my interests, but out of a fairly clueless sense that voting for Democrats was what you did. (Living in Connecticut, my vote meant little, anyway.) Then came 9/11, and the days after it, when Democrats jumped enthusiastically into ultrapatriotism and militarism. When the Barack Obama campaign rose out of the ashes of the George W. Bush presidency, I allowed myself to believe in its transformative potential, writing endlessly in support of his candidacy. That, in turn, led to the days of drones, compromises on austerity and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nThat\u2019s been the cycle, for me: always knowing that Democrats would never really represent my interests, but nevertheless perpetually ready to believe that the next Democrat might make some sort of a difference. I have grown to envy those purer Marxist peers of mine who simply washed their hands of the whole thing long ago. It has left me in a state of permanent agnosticism towards Sanders: I\u2019m pleased that someone who calls himself a socialist is in the race, but I will not invest myself in his campaign, not in terms of energy, effort, time or emotion.\nThough Sanders speaks with more candor and vitriol about inequality and corporatism than most Democrats, he is more likely to call for more a more muscular social safety net and higher taxes than for the nationalization of the banks. Sanders is not Zell Miller, but neither is he Eugene V. Debs. This has created a split in socialist circles: some see the Sanders campaign as an opportunity to popularize socialism with the public at large while others fear that it is a trick to bring socialists back into the Democratic fold.\nI can\u2019t help but respect those who see support for Sanders as a strategic move for the far left, and who can engage with his campaign without the kind of emotional investment I\u2019ve always fallen prey to. Socialists enthusiastic about Sanders emphasize that he and his campaign are clearly of more relevance to contemporary socialist politics than any major presidential run in recent history. \u201cSanders is moving the discussion to the left, and mobilizing an absurdly high number of people,\u201d says socialist Bhaskar Sunkara, the editor and publisher of the explicitly Marxist-socialist Jacobin magazine, in an interview. \u201cI want to take the risk of reaching out to all these people comfortable with supporting a self-described socialist candidate.\u201d Sunkara sat on a panel at Socialism 2015 focused on the Sanders campaign and its relationship with the socialist left.\nAshley Smith, a board member of the International Socialist Review who also sat on the Sanders panel, has criticized Sanders not only for his generally conventional policy preferences but also for the likely political outcome of his campaign. \u201cSanders refused to consider an independent presidential campaign not because he had little chance of winning, but because he didn't want to compete for votes with the Democrats' eventual nominee,\u201d Smith wrote in an article for the Socialist Worker, pointing out that insurgent Democratic campaigns frequently end up merely corralling critics of mainstream Democratic politicians into support for the eventual mainstream candidate. As Smith writes, \u201cby steering liberal and left supporters into a Democratic Party whose policies and politics he claims to disagree with, Sanders\u2014no matter how critical he might be of Hillary Clinton\u2014is acting as the opposite of an \u2018alternative.\u2019\u201d\nThis phenomenon is often referred to as \u201csheepdogging,\u201d a term suggesting that candidates like Sanders simply function to capture left-wing unhappiness within the party and subdue it. (Indeed, it isn\u2019t difficult to find images depicting Sanders as a literal sheepdog, herding voters toward Clinton, in online left-wing communities.) In a scathing piece for Black Agenda Report, the essential journal of radical black politics, Bruce A. Dixon writes, \u201cBernie Sanders is this election\u2019s Democratic sheepdog\u2026. Sheepdogs are herders, and the sheepdog candidate is charged with herding activists and voters back into the Democratic fold who might otherwise drift leftward and outside of the Democratic party.\u201d The Sanders candidacy, according to Dixon, will simply redound to the benefit of inevitable nominee Clinton, and in so doing turn activist energy into just more politics as usual.\nFredrik deBoer is a writer and academic.
