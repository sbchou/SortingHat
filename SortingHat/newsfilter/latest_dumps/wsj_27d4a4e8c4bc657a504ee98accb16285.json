{"body": "As the first official Republican debate approaches on Thursday, several candidates are filing mandatory disclosures of their assets and income with the Federal Election Commission, offering more insight into how the crowded field stacks up in terms of wealth.\nPresidential candidates are required to file personal financial disclosure statements showing their income, assets and liabilities in the year leading up to their campaigns. The numbers are disclosed in broad ranges.\nNo candidate who filed a disclosure this week is wealthier than Donald Trump, whose disclosure showed he is worth at least $1.5 billion. (He has said he is worth $10 billion.) Former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina has a net worth of $59 million.\nHere is what we know about the wealth of six other GOP contenders, in order of the size of their assets:\nJeb Bush: At least $19 million\nThe reports reveal Jeb Bush drew income from a variety of sources in 2014 and the first half of 2015, ranging from speeches to private companies. Two partnerships\u2014Britton Hill Advisors and DeSoto Partners LLC\u2014paid him about $1.2 million, while the Coral Gables, Fla., consulting business, Jeb Bush & Associates, brought him about $7.1 million. The report also shows that Jeb Bush & Associates paid his wife, Columba Bush, a salary of \u201cover $1,000.\u201d\nSpeeches were among the biggest source of income for Mr. Bush, according to the reports. Between January 2014 and March 2015, he delivered 47 speeches, some at colleges and others at companies, and raked in about $1.8 million. Those fees are collected by Jeb Bush & Associates.\u00a0At the higher end, he was paid $75,000 for a speech at Julius Baer Bank in Punta del Este, Uruguay.\nMr. Bush previously released 33 years of tax returns and he revealed then that his net worth was between $19 million and $22 million, 14 times what he reported when he left the Florida governor\u2019s office in 2007. Mr. Bush has earned more than $29 million since leaving office\u2014making him one of the wealthiest Republicans in the presidential race.\nGeorge Pataki: At least $6.8 million\nRepublican presidential candidate George Pataki and his wife, Libby, have investments in holdings as diverse as a Hungarian winery and a herd of cattle at a farm he owns in upstate New York.\nThe former New York governor listed income of more than $1.3 million across six companies. He also listed more than $1.4 million in debt including four mortgages, a home equity line, and at least $100,000 in business debt.\nMr. Pataki\u2019s assets scattered across 40 holdings included a number of limited liability companies, a parcel of vacant land and financial investments.\nMike Huckabee: At least $7 million\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and his wife are worth more than 10 times as they were the last time he ran for president, in 2008, when he had just left the Arkansas governor\u2019s mansion. Since then, he has hosted a syndicated radio show and a weekly Fox News program, in addition to publishing five books since 2008.\nMr. Huckabee reported between $4.3 and $6.4 million in income in 2014 and the first half of 2015.

At least $400,000 is investments in Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., where his wife, Heidi, is a managing director. His disclosure does not include her income there.\nMr. Cruz\u2019s largest single source of income was royalties from HarperCollins, which earned him between $100,000 and $1 million.
