{"body": "ANKENY, Iowa \u2014 At a recent ice cream social here, Jim Hallihan liked what he heard from Senator Marco Rubio.\n\nHe praised the Florida senator\u2019s youthful optimism and his eloquent testimony to the opportunities America offered.\n\nBut there was something larger that drew Mr. Hallihan, a former Iowa State basketball coach, to Mr. Rubio, 43, the son of poor Cuban immigrants.\n\n\u201cThe day of the older white guy is kind of out,\u201d said Mr. Hallihan, a 70-year-old white guy.\n\nAs Mr. Rubio has introduced himself to curious, and overwhelmingly Caucasian, Republican audiences from Iowa to New Hampshire, he has vaulted to the front ranks of the early pack of likely presidential candidates, partly because of his natural political talent. But it may owe just as much to the combination of his personal story and the balm it offers to a party that has been repeatedly scalded by accusations of prejudice.\n\nHe says he is highlighting his background only to share his own twist on the American dream \u2014 not out of any desire to make history on behalf of Hispanics. But Mr. Rubio and those around him are also acutely aware of the sometimes raw tensions in his party, between those unsettled by an increasingly diverse society and those who say Republicans must embrace the multihued America of 2015.\n\nTo the party operatives and donors who have placed long bets on him, and to the rank-and-file primary voters he has impressed, Mr. Rubio\u2019s candidacy seems to affirm the idea that, in a free market, anyone can rise without the benefit of connections or wealth. That he did so as the child of Latin American parents who fled an autocratic government and toiled in the humblest of jobs \u2014 maid and bartender \u2014 has sent some Republicans swooning.\n\n\u201cThe identity politics people in the party want a champion who looks like him to mitigate accusations of racism,\u201d said Ben Domenech, a conservative writer. \u201cAnd the classical conservatives look at him and say, \u2018This is somebody who can sell our ideas to the public.\u2019\u201d\n\nConservatives have long had a philosophical contempt for politics driven by gender, racial or class designations. But those sentiments are giving way as the party tries to compete with Democrats, who galvanized support among targeted demographics to decisively win consecutive presidential elections.\n\nRepublican voters are overwhelmingly white: The composition of the electorate in almost every contested state during the 2012 party primary was about 90 percent or more non-Hispanic white, according to exit polls.\n\nA New York Times/CBS Poll this week found that 68 percent of Republicans think America is ready to elect a Hispanic president. And after nearly eight years in which Republicans have angrily disputed charges that their opposition to President Obama was rooted in racial animus, Mr. Rubio could serve as an unspoken, but forceful, rebuttal.\n\n\u201cThe same things that ignited Democrats about Obama are what will ignite Republicans for Rubio,\u201d said Ed Failor Jr., an Iowa Republican strategist.\n\nOr, as Mr. Domenech put it, \u201cIf we look to politicians to make us feel good about ourselves, do you want to go with just another Republican caricature, or somebody who has this unique appeal?\u201d\n\nAndrea Szewczyk, 51, a Republican and a schoolteacher in Romeo, Mich., who was surveyed in the Times poll, said she believed that Mr. Rubio\u2019s ethnicity could excite the electorate, much as she said Mr. Obama\u2019s identity did. \u201cWe\u2019d get some Democrats voting Republican because of it,\u201d she said.\n\nIndeed, much as many white liberals treasured the opportunity to support Mr. Obama, white conservatives may welcome a Bible-quoting, handsome Hispanic capable of evangelizing the gospel of American exceptionalism in two languages.\n\nMr. Rubio disputes suggestions that he is capitalizing on the history-making potential of becoming his party\u2019s first nonwhite nominee.\n\n\u201cThe presidency is too important to say we\u2019re going to share it among ethnicities,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nMuch as Mr. Obama avoided running expressly as a black candidate, Mr. Rubio is uneasy about explicitly invoking his ethnicity in the primary of a party that can seem split between tapping into and trying to overcome white-resentment politics.\n\nInstead, just as Mr. Obama\u2019s talk of \u201chope and change\u201d in 2008 allowed voters to project their own vision onto the candidate, Mr. Rubio\u2019s campaign is its own Rorschach test.\n\nHis advisers assert that Mr. Rubio\u2019s background is compelling to voters across racial lines, many of whom are themselves only a few generations removed from Ellis Island narratives. But they have also studied the voter rolls to see how Mr. Rubio might spur Hispanic turnout in some heavily white states \u2014 say, by delivering him as few as 5,000 Hispanic votes in Iowa.\n\nStill, if some Republicans love the idea of what Mr. Rubio\u2019s race represents, others are wary. \u201cEight years of one demographically symbolic president is enough,\u201d said Wayne R. LaPierre, chief executive of the National Rifle Association, at its annual conference last month.\n\nMr. LaPierre was referring to Mr. Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who, if elected, would be the first female president. (The Republican field includes another Latino, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, whose father emigrated from Cuba.)\n\nBut Mr. Rubio seems mindful of the risks of confronting the most conservative elements of his party over delicate racial issues.\n\nAt a candidate forum in New Hampshire last month, he passed up the chance to offer even a gentle reproach to a woman who, citing bilingual store signs and automated phone lines, complained that immigrants were not \u201ccoming here and learning English.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, here\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d Mr. Rubio told her. \u201cIf you don\u2019t speak English, you\u2019re not going to prosper economically in America.\u201d\n\nAt a similar gathering recently in Iowa, Mr. Rubio recounted vowing to his dying grandfather, in Spanish, that he would study hard and not squander opportunities. But Mr. Rubio told the story in English.\n\nAsked if he was comfortable speaking Spanish on the campaign trail, Mr. Rubio seemed to grow momentarily defensive. \u201cSure,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t want to make Spanish illegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ultimately saying that you have to have a unifying language where your schools are taught, what your laws are written in and how others communicate with each other,\u201d he continued. \u201cEvery nation needs a unifying language; our unifying language is English.\u201d\n\nAs for those with dial-1-for-English gripes, Mr. Rubio said, \u201cI know Hispanics that complain about that, especially people in the second or third generation.\u201d\n\nMr. Rubio has met with some pushback in his party from people who see the country changing and want to stop placating those who are unhappy about it.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t allow yourself to be pushed back into \u2018English only, English only,\u2019 \u201d said former Representative Henry Bonilla of Texas, a Republican and Mexican-American. \u201cThis is the U.S.; our language is English. But we\u2019re in a global economy now, so why wouldn\u2019t you want to know more than one language?\u201d\n\nMr. Rubio does not entirely avoid speaking Spanish: He frequently gives interviews to Spanish-language journalists, especially in Florida. And in his announcement speech in Miami last month, he shared a benedictionlike saying of his late father\u2019s: \u201cEn este pa\u00eds, ustedes van a poder lograr todas las cosas que nosotros no pudimos,\u201d Mr. Rubio said. Then he translated it: \u201cIn this country, you will achieve all the things we never could.\u201d\n\nBut he is careful about how he presents his dual identity. In a video his campaign released shortly after he entered the race, Mr. Rubio was shown answering the questions about him posed in frequent Google searches. \u201cWhat nationality is Marco Rubio?\u201d he said, reading one. \u201cI\u2019m an American \u2014 of Hispanic descent.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Jeb Bush, whose wife is Mexican and often refers to their \u201cbicultural\u201d children, is not so torn: He delights in opportunities to demonstrate his fluent Spanish, and last week he courted voters in Puerto Rico. \u201cI know the power of the immigrant experience because I live it each and every day,\u201d he said there.\n\nThe legislative embodiment of the conflicting forces tugging at Mr. Rubio was the effort to overhaul American immigration laws. He helped write a comprehensive bill including a path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country. But it died in the Republican-controlled House, and provoked outrage from the party\u2019s most reliable primary voters.\n\nLast month, when Mr. Rubio made his first trip to Iowa after announcing his campaign, he was confronted at a closed-door meeting by Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a former congressional candidate, who pointedly urged him not to retreat from an immigration overhaul.\n\n\u201cMy advice to Senator Rubio was to be honest with people, be yourself,\u201d Ms. Miller-Meeks said afterward, \u201cbecause that will carry a lot of weight.\u201d", "byline": "JONATHAN MARTIN and ASHLEY PARKER", "description": "Mr. Rubio says his background presents a new twist on the American dream, but some Republicans hope it offers a balm to a party that has been scalded by accusations of prejudice.", "title": "Marco Rubio Campaigns on His Immigrant Story, Cautiously", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/us/politics/marco-rubio-campaigns-on-his-immigrant-story-cautiously.html", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Jeb Bush", "Mariannette Miller", "Jim Hallihan", "Ben Domenech", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Marco Rubio", "Barack Obama", "Henry Bonilla", "Ed Failor Jr.", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": ["National Rifle Association", "Rorschach"], "authors": [{"author_id": 713, "fullname": "ashley parker", "primary_org": "nyt"}, {"author_id": 793, "fullname": "jonathan martin", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-05-07 15:46:35", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "cb8dcbca10cabce4c08390cfa831805b", "date_access": "2015-05-07 15:05:21.999763"}
