Bobby Jindal says.\n\"I think we need to insist that folks who come here come here legally, learn English, adopt our values, roll up our sleeves and get to work,\" the Republican governor and presidential hopeful said in an interview aired Sunday on ABC's \"This Week.\"\nJindal, whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from India to attend college, reiterated his call for the country to move away from hyphenated Americans.\n\"We don\u2019t make people come here. If they want to come here, they should want to be Americans,\" Jindal said. \"Millions of people across this world want to come here. A smart immigration policy allows people to come here legally that make our country stronger. That\u2019s just common sense.\"\nHost Martha Raddatz also asked Jindal about Donald Trump's latest comments about Democrat Hillary Clinton's longtime aide, Huma Abedin, whom Trump alleged shared classified information with her husband, former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.).\n\"The real issue here is that she\u2019s not above the law. The real issue is that if any private in the military, if any other government official, had handled classified information the way she is said to have handled classified information, there would have been a court martial, there would have been even criminal prosecution. There would have certainly been consequences,\" Jindal said. \"She shouldn\u2019t be above the law. There shouldn\u2019t be a different set of rules for our elected leaders than for the rest of us.\"\n\"That\u2019s one of the reasons voters are so angry,\" Jindal went on. \"One of the things Donald Trump has tapped into, and other candidates have tapped into, is the frustration the American people have against this permanent political elite who think the rules don\u2019t apply to them.\"\n\n                                            By \nAaron MaK\n\n\n                                            By \nPOLITICO Magazine\n\n\n                                            By \n                                                    Mitch Landrieu\n                                             and \n                                                    Judith Rodin\n\n\n                                            By \nBen Wofford\n\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Jindal: Immigrants to the U.S. must 'get to work'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/bobby-jindal-abc-immigration-213169", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Sean Parnell", "Jake Sherman", "Jennifer Shutt", "Henry C.
