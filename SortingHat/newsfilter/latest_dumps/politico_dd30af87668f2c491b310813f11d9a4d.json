His Iowa campaign co-chair is a reality television star who says politics is \u201cnot my lane.\u201d He hired a self-described \u201crabid tea party activist\u201d who proved too rabid for like-minded activists and resigned. And that\u2019s not the half of it.\u00a0\nThis is Donald Trump\u2019s political machine.\nStory Continued Below\nFrom the grassroots base to the burnt-orange top, Trump\u2019s hastily assembled operation is not the typical presidential campaign. Rarely in American politics has such an unlikely gang of misfits, rogues and loose cannons helped a candidate climb to the top of the heap.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a different kind of campaign,\u201d said Michael Cohen, executive vice president of the Trump Organization. \u201cThat\u2019s for sure.\u201d\nCohen, the frowning face and baritone voice of Trump world in so many media interviews, has helped make it so.\nDescribed in Trump family materials as one of the mogul\u2019s \u201cprimary troubleshooters,\u201d Cohen attracted unwelcome attention last month after threatening a Daily Beast reporter who uncovered allegations of marital \u201crape\u201d made under oath by Trump\u2019s first wife, Ivana. Cohen told him, \u201cI will come after your Daily Beast and everybody else that you possibly know \u2026 So I\u2019m warning you, tread very fucking lightly, because what I\u2019m going to do to you is going to be fucking disgusting.\u201d\nCohen, a lawyer, also fueled controversy by claiming that rape is impossible within a marriage. Both Ivana and Cohen later retracted their claims.\nSince then, campaign representatives have directed inquiries about rape to Cohen, saying he is separate from the campaign. Cohen has directed inquiries about the campaign to campaign representatives, saying he is not part of the campaign.\nAlso on POLITICO\nJENNIFER SHUTT\nBut it would be a mistake to think Cohen, a former intern for Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Joe Moakley, is walled off from from the political operation, said one Trump insider.\n\u201cMichael is in the room for everything. Whether he offers an opinion or not, he\u2019s in the room for everything \u2026 without exception,\u201d said the insider. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t make any claim to being a political operative or having political experience. But he listens, and he\u2019ll occasionally offer an opinion.\u201d\nDuring the 2012 cycle, Cohen aided Trump\u2019s presidential exploratory efforts, including a March 2011 trip to Iowa to feel out local Republicans. Cohen\u2019s trip reportedly prompted a Federal Election Commission complaint by a Ron Paul supporter over the source of the trip\u2019s funding.\nThis cycle, others are taking the lead on the political side. In the meantime, Cohen has not ceased his role as media surrogate for Trump.\n\u201cFor a guy who\u2019s not part of the campaign, you seem to be on TV and in print more than anybody,\u201d Cohen said of himself and his own ambiguous role in Trump\u2019s world. Because of the global furor surrounding Trump\u2019s run, he explained, \u201cThere\u2019s an overlap\u201d between the campaign and Trump\u2019s business interests and personal brand.\nTrump\u2019s longtime political adviser, Roger Stone, on the other hand, has ceased his work for the businessman.\nStone, who cut his teeth on political chicanery as a staffer on Richard Nixon\u2019s Committee to Re-Elect the President, and then signed up for the campaigns of Ronald Reagan and Bob Dole, publicly embraces his \u201cdirty trickster\u201d image and was the most seasoned political operative advising Trump.\nAlso on POLITICO\nJENNIFER SHUTT\nBut he clashed with campaign manager Corey Lewandowski over the campaign\u2019s direction. The conflict reached a crescendo when racist Facebook posts surfaced, linked to the personal account of Stone\u2019s young associate Sam Nunberg, another Trump adviser. Nunberg was fired.\nAfter a high-profile blow-up last weekend in which Trump says he fired Stone and Stone insists that he quit, Stone is on the outs with the campaign, at least for now. He has parted ways with Trump in the past but eventually reconciled \u2014 Trump called Stone a \u201cstone cold idiot\u201d in a 2008 New Yorker profile and condemned a con he allegedly tried to pull on Eliot Spitzer\u2019s aged father.\nAnd the Trump insider who spoke on the condition of anonymity said he believes Stone will soon be back in the fold. \u201cFor all of his aggressiveness, Roger is the only adult and he\u2019s been doing this longer than the rest of us, and I think Donald knows that.\u201d\nWith Stone sidelined, campaign manager Lewandowski now holds the most sway over the campaign, which he is managing to keep running and atop the Republican field in the face of nonstop controversy.\n\u201cHe reminds me a lot of Bob Haldeman,\u201d Stone said earlier this month of Lewandowski, comparing him to Nixon\u2019s chief of staff, who went to prison for his role in the Watergate scandal. \u201cAnd he\u2019ll probably end up the same way.\u201d\nBut Lewandowski has already evaded jail once, after being arrested in 1999 for carrying an unloaded gun and ammunition into the Longworth House Office Building, where he worked as an aide to Rep. Bob Ney. Lewandowski\u2019s charges were dismissed (which is more than can be said for Ney, who went to prison on federal corruption charges in 2007 over his entanglement with the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, despite a letter to the judge from Lewandowski calling Ney a \u201csurrogate father\u201d).\nAfter his acquittal, Lewandowski adopted a common Trump tactic. He sued the property clerk of the Metropolitan Police Department, asking for $50,000 and his gun back.\nAlso on POLITICO\nELI STOKOLS\nThe suit was dismissed. Lewandowski said he does not recall it, though he admits carrying the gun.\nTrump Arizona operative Aaron Borders brought the campaign a Facebook scandal. His tenure ended over racially charged Facebook posts, only to have the campaign deny he had ever worked for it. (It is the kind of campaign where the severing of ties over racist Facebook posts is not a one-time occurrence.)\nBorders released to Buzzfeed an audio recording of Lewandowski offering to hire him, another of Lewandowski dumping him, and a third in which Lewandowski threatened to \u201csue your fucking ass to next year\u201d over the recordings.\nTrump\u2019s rogue\u2019s gallery extends from New York headquarters into the early states.\nIn New Hampshire, where Lewandowski worked for the Koch brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity before joining Trump, the operation includes many loyalists.\nOne is Trump\u2019s Belknap County chairman, businessman Josh Youssef.\nLewandowski earned the ire of the Granite State GOP in 2o12 when AFP funding propelled Youssef\u2019s successful state Senate primary bid over an establishment-backed candidate. Reports surfaced that Yousseff owed back taxes and child support, and he was accused of violating election law by stealing the identity of local officials, prompting State Republican leaders to demand an explanation. He lost the general election to a Democrat.\nJerry Delemus, a New Hampshire tea party activist, made headlines in June when he unveiled his plans to hold a \u201cdraw Muhammad\u201d contest in protest of sharia law. A month later, he signed on as a Trump supporter and joined the campaign\u2019s veterans committee.\nIn Iowa, one of Trump\u2019s three state co-chairs is Tana Goertz, a former contestant on Trump\u2019s reality show, \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s just a former reality show contestant and that\u2019s it,\u201d said Pat Rynard, who writes the caucus-focused Iowa Starting Line blog. \u201cShe has no clue. She doesn\u2019t really know about politics. She kind of just gets up and speaks at events.\u201d\nAlso on POLITICO\nM. SCOTT MAHASKEY\nThat\u2019s Goertz\u2019 self- assessment as well. \u201cWe do not talk politics, because that\u2019s not my lane,\u201d she recently told Yahoo of her relationship with Trump \u2014 an unusually candid disclosure from the co-chair of a presidential campaign in a crucial early nominating state.\nGeortz is known as a spokeswoman for the Bedazzler, a tool that attaches rhinestones to clothing. She\u2019s also married to a popular local weatherman.\nThen there\u2019s Trump\u2019s self-appointed Iowa grassroots guru, Ken Crow.\nCrow, a founding activist of the national tea party movement, found himself estranged from a large part of it after his role in a botched 2011 Sarah Palin appearance in Iowa forced him to resign as chairman of the Tea Party of America.\n\u201cI\u2019m the dumb cowboy. I\u2019ve been a rodeo cowboy my whole life, and I don\u2019t know how to be anything different,\u201d he told the Iowa Republican, an influential publication in the state\u2019s GOP circles, in explaining the debacle. The mishap involved the event invitation, de-invitation and re-invitation of failed Delaware Senate candidate Christine O\u2019Donnell \u2014 best known for denying that she is a witch.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to a bloodbath next November,\u201d Crow told POLITICO before being asked any questions, adding \u201cmetaphorically of course,\u201d and then adding, \u201cDemocrats\u2019 blood hopefully,\u201d then also adding \u201cpolitical blood. I\u2019m joking. You know what I mean.\u201d (It is the kind of campaign where a comment about blood that requires clarification is not a one-time occurrence.)\nCrow said he was impressed by Trump\u2019s kindness and patience during a recent appearance at the John Wayne museum in Winterset.\nNow, he\u2019s planning to barnstorm on Trump\u2019s behalf. Earlier this month, he and a partner launched citizensfortrump.com, to organize a sort of grassroots paramilitary organization of \u201ctea party warriors,\u201d as Crow conceives of their role.\n\u201cWe are building a one million-man army for Mr. Trump,\u201d he said.\nCrow said he keeps in frequent contact with the campaign\u2019s deputy state director, Ryan Keller, and regularly informs state director Chuck Laudner of his activities.\nLaudner, as a sought-after operative in Iowa\u2019s religious conservative circles, is among the odd men out in this colorful campaign.\u00a0\nIn February, when most of the political class assumed Trump intended to run as a short-lived publicity stunt, if at all, Laudner\u2019s hiring was an early hint that the billionaire businessman was sprinkling his organization with enough straight-laced, established political hands to create a winning team.\nMultiple Iowa politicos used the word \u201csurprised\u201d in reaction to news in February that Laudner, the architect of former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum\u2019s wing-and-a-prayer caucus victory in 2012, had joined Trump.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a well-respected guy,\u201d said Carroll County Republican Chairman Craig Williams. \u201cWe kind of thought it was interesting that he and Trump got together off the bat. I\u2019m not saying Trump\u2019s not a religious guy.\u201d\nAnother hint was the July hiring of Michael Glassner, a former Palin adviser. He also advised both of Bob Dole\u2019s presidential campaigns.\nAs of last week, Lewandowski has further signaled the campaign\u2019s intentions, embarking on a multi-state hiring spree to try to build out a winning political machine. On Wednesday, he flew to Nevada to interview operatives. He declined to provide details but said he plans to eventually hire in all 50 states.\nDon\u2019t expect too many straight-laced types to slip through. Lewandowski confirmed that Trump\u2019s campaign is different. \u201cIf that is to intimate that he\u2019s not surrounding himself with high-priced, over-compensated, under-qualified consultants, yeah that\u2019s probably true,\u201d he said.\nBy MATT LATIMER\nBy JACK SHAFER\nBy ADAM WREN\nBy SEN.
