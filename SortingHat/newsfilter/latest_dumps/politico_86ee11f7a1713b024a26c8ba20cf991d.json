(Yes, that Mars.) Mars \u2014 who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge after a fatal car crash a few years ago \u2014 recently committed $10 million of her estimated $23 billion fortune to the Kennedy Center\u2019s massive overhaul, which blew past its budget and won\u2019t be completed until 2018. David Rubenstein, who serves as Kennedy Center chairman, as well as CEO and founder of Carlyle Group, kicked off donations in 2013 with a record-breaking $50 million gift to the cultural institution and performing arts center. New York-based Stephen Schwarzman, a big gun in finance and CEO of The Blackstone Group, joins Mars at the $10 million level. Not to be overlooked, Washington socialite and philanthropist Adrienne Arsht, who like Mars attends several local charity galas on the social circuit each year \u2014 and who is rumored to have the best jewelry collection in town \u2014 pledged $1 million.\nKate Bennett is a Reporter-Gossip Columnist.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "D.C.'s 1 percent comes through for the Kennedy Center", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/kgb-kennedy-center-scores-donors-213978", "topics": ["personality", "trade"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Jesse Rifkin", "Rachael Bade", "Henry C.
