{"body": "Donald Trump doesn\u2019t sound like most Republican candidates\u2014and not just because he uses unusually pointed language. It\u2019s also due to his policies. One prominent example: He\u2019s talked about raising taxes on some\u00a0wealthy Americans and corporations.\nThe idea\u00a0of raising taxes is anathema to most GOP politicians. Many sign a pledge promising not to increase them.\nHow can Mr. Trump lead the Republican presidential field while calling for higher taxes? A look at poll data suggests that a constituency exists for raising taxes on the wealthy\u2014even within the Republican Party.\nA plurality of Republicans\u2013some 42%\u2014say they\u2019d think less favorably of a candidate who supports raising taxes on the wealthy, Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling found in March. But nearly 3 in 10 said that proposing such a tax increase would make them feel more favorable toward a candidate.\nAmong lower-income Republicans, a small plurality actually says they would feel\u00a0more\u00a0favorable toward a candidate who supports raising taxes on the wealthy.\nThat support fades at higher incomes levels.\nThe above offers a glimpse of the populist wave that Mr. Trump is riding in the polls. A substantial part of the party, particularly in rural America, is on the lower end of the income spectrum. Some 37% of the party is made up of people from households earning $50,000 or less, the WSJ/NBC News survey found.\nAt the same time, supporting tax increases on the wealthy is a risky strategy for a Republican. The idea is unpopular with a group of Republicans that will be critical in 2016: People who say they\u2019ll vote in the GOP primaries.\nThat 51% unfavorable number shows that the views of primary voters are different than those of Republicans overall. Opposition to tax increases is even higher for self-described primary voters who are also members of the tea party movement.\nMuch is likely to change as the race unfolds. Mr. Trump has given only hints to his tax policy rather than a full plan. So far, he has suggested that he would tax the compensation of hedge fund managers as ordinary income rather than at its current, lower rate. He has also suggested he would act against mergers that cut a corporation\u2019s U.S. tax bill by moving operations overseas. As he fleshes out his plan, the willingness of GOP voters to stay with him will be clarified.\nPolitics Counts\u00a0is a regular Capital Journal feature.
