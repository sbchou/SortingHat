Bernie Sanders has also urged the DNC to add more debates, while Clinton \u2014 who Steyer has not formally endorsed \u2014 has simply said she is open to participating in more.\nBut since O\u2019Malley railed against the DNC leadership over its debate plan at the committee\u2019s summer meeting in Minneapolis last month, new voices have popped up on both sides of the discussion. While House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi joined O\u2019Malley, DNC Vice Chair Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, and DNC Vice Chair R.T. Rybak in urging the addition of more, a pair of close Clinton allies \u2014 Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter \u2014 said that would be overkill.\n\u201cClimate change is an urgent threat to our economy, health, and national security, and requires immediate and bold action from our next president,\u201d explained Steyer. \u201cThe Democratic presidential candidates understand this and have acknowledged the urgency of the climate crisis. Now it\u2019s time for them to tell us exactly what they\u2019d do about it.\"\nSteyer, whose wallet would be significant to any presidential candidate, recently praised Clinton over her opposition of the Keystone XL pipeline. But without formally throwing her his support, he has maintained political leverage over the party\u2019s field.\nThe first Democratic debate is currently set for October 13 in Las Vegas.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Billionaire Steyer calls for more Democratic debates", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/tom-steyer-more-democratic-debates-2016-214085", "topics": ["economy", "immigration"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Todd Lighty", "Joe Pompeo", "Debbie Wasserman Schultz", "Elena Schneider", "Anna Palmer", "Hadas Gold", "R.
