(Photo by Mike Stone/Reuters)  The campaign of Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders said Monday that it had apologized to a group of pro-Palestine college students who were threatened with arrest Saturday night for displaying a sign in an overflow area at a large rally in Boston. According to an account on the Web site The Intercept, activists from Boston Students for Justice in Palestine sought to hold up a large sign asking: \u201cWill Ya Feel The Bern 4 Palestine??!\u201d A video posted on the student group\u2019s Facebook\u00a0site shows a woman telling activists that the \u201cBernie team\u201d would like them to take down the sign if they want to stay. Moments later, a police officer tells an activist he is trespassing and will be arrested if he doesn\u2019t leave.  It appears the video was shot outside the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center, where more than 20,000 people were gathered inside to hear the senator from Vermont on Saturday. Sanders\u2019s speech was being shown outside on a large screen. Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, said Monday that the instructions to take down the pro-Palestine sign came from a \u201crogue\u201d low-level campaign employee. \u201cThat person has been excluded from working on any of our future events,\u201d Weaver said, adding that the campaign had apologized to the student group. [Sanders draws more than 20,000 in Boston, building on a strong week] Sanders, who has been largely supportive of Israel and would be the United State\u2019s first Jewish president if elected, has long advocated for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Saturday night\u2019s rally in Boston was one of the largest of Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign, which is mounting a serious threat to that of Hillary Rodham Clinton.
