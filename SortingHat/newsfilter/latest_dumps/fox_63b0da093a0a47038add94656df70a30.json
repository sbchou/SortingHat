Here\u2019s what he told Fox News at a Club For Growth event in March: \u201cIf I go beyond the consideration of the possibility of running, to becoming a candidate \u2026\u201d\n\nThe former Florida governor is using very specific language to describe his current status for two reasons.\u00a0One, remaining undeclared allows him the latitude to road-test messages and campaign themes in private that would be impossible if he were on the actual campaign trail.\u00a0Two, it allows him the ability to coordinate fundraising and spending for his Right To Rise PAC and super PAC. The moment Bush declares, he must divorce himself from the PACs, and there can be no coordination between the committees and the campaign.\n\n\u201cIn this early phase, before a public announcement, people are able to do things that become more difficult to do afterwards,\u201d said Karl Rove, former deputy chief of staff for President George W. Bush and a Fox News contributor.\n\nBut with three Republican candidates already in the race \u2013 including home state rival Sen. Marco Rubio \u2013 how much longer can Bush stay aloof from the campaign?\u00a0\n\nRove reminds that in the last presidential race, Newt Gingrich was the first candidate to declare \u2013 and that wasn\u2019t until May 11, 2011.\u00a0Rubio, Sen. Rand Paul and Sen. Ted Cruz, he says, have moved the calendar way ahead, and he says Bush has plenty of breathing room.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s early, historically, for major contenders to get in the race, so we\u2019re slightly ahead of the power curve here. But I wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all to see him do it in late May or early June,\u201d Rove told Fox News.\n\nRove is confident that despite the perceived delay, Bush will join the fray. So is Vin Weber, a Bush family loyalist who is advising Jeb.\n\n\u201cI think that Governor Bush is right on track in terms of how he\u2019s been thinking about this potential race and when he needs to get into it and what needs to happen,\u201d Weber told Fox News.\n\nBarry Wynn, the former chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party \u2013 and a Bush supporter \u2013 said during his time in the \u2018exploratory phase,\u2019 Jeb has wisely and meticulously built a national operation that can easily carry him through the primaries as a top-tier candidate.\u00a0Wynn calls it \u201cthe best I have ever seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing has been spared in building this foundation,\u201d Wynn told Fox News. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible organization, and it\u2019s nationwide. And I think when you see a rollout \u2013 if you do see a rollout -- you will see that that foundation is incredibly strong.\u201d\n\nWhile Bush has yet to disclose how many paid staffers he has, or how much money his PACs have raised, his base of financial support is deep and wide \u2013 and according to people in the know, includes not only Republicans, but some people who previously supported President Obama.\n\n\u201cParticularly in California,\u201d Wynn told Fox News. \u201cA lot of the Silicon Valley support [that] was very instrumental in electing President Obama is taking a real strong look at Jeb Bush and we\u2019re seeing a lot of anecdotal evidence that a lot of that support will be moving to him.\u201d\n\nSo, how close is Bush to throwing his hat in the ring?\u00a0Indicators point to sometime in the next few weeks.\u00a0A summit of supporters that Bush is holding at his Miami home Sunday and Monday is being seen by attendees as one of the final pieces of the puzzle before he pulls the trigger.\n\nWynn and Weber are among those who will be there.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve having a big conference next week,\u201d Weber told Fox News.\u00a0\u201cAnd my guess is that at that point, you\u2019re gonna be able to see sort of a countdown to an announcement in the not too distant future.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe governor would obviously like to see that there is enthusiastic and widespread and diverse support for his campaign,\u201d Wynn said. \u201cI would say that you\u2019re doing very well in South Carolina, and I would certainly encourage him to run.\u201dJohn Roberts joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in January 2011 as a senior national correspondent and is based in the Atlanta bureau.", "byline": "", "description": "With three Republican candidates already in the race \u2013 including home state rival Sen.
