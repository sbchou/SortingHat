{"body": "Short of support and cash, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, saying he had been \u201ccalled to lead by helping to clear the field,\u201d announced Monday that he was suspending his bid for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nIn a brief news conference in Madison, Mr. Walker referred sharply to Donald J. Trump\u2019s influence on the primary contest, saying he hoped his exit would make it possible for \u201ca positive conservative message\u201d to take hold in the crowded race. \n\n\u201cI encourage other Republican presidential candidates to consider doing the same, so that the voters can focus on a limited number of candidates who can offer a positive conservative alternative to the current front-runner,\u201d Mr. Walker said in the short appearance, at which he took no questions. \u201cThis is fundamentally important to the future of the party and, more importantly, to the future of our country.\u201d\n\nMr. Walker\u2019s withdrawal is a humiliating climb down for a Republican governor once seen as leading a charmed political life. He started the year at the top of the polls but has seen his position gradually deteriorate, amid the rise of Mr. Trump\u2019s populist campaign and repeated missteps by Mr. Walker himself.\n\nIn the most recent CNN survey, Mr. Walker drew support nationally from less than one-half of one percent of Republican primary voters. He faced growing pressure to shake up his campaign staff, a step he was loath to take, according to Republicans briefed on his deliberations.\n\n\u201cThe short answer is money,\u201d said a supporter of Mr. Walker\u2019s who was briefed on the announcement. \u201cHe\u2019s made a decision not to limp into Iowa.\u201d\n\nThe supporter said that Mr. Walker\u2019s fund-raising had dried up after his decline in the polls and that campaign officials did not feel they could risk going into debt with the race so uncertain. The governor, who was scheduled to be in New York and Washington this week, partly to raise money, had built up an expansive staff, bringing on aides and consultants detailed to everything from Christian conservative outreach to Super Tuesday states. But his fund-raising did not keep pace with the money needed to sustain such an infrastructure.\n\nIn recent weeks the Walker campaign\u2019s fund-raising has been in a downward spiral, with the candidate undertaking a heavy travel schedule of political events but spending far less time raising money. Two top Walker donors said on Monday that potential backers who had been leaning toward Mr. Walker had started expressing strong misgivings about the direction of his campaign after his middling performance in the Republican debate last week. The two donors were helping to organize a fund-raiser for Mr. Walker on Thursday in New York at the apartment of Todd Ricketts, a national finance co-chairman of the Walker campaign, but were struggling to lock in people to attend.\n\n\u201cDonors have totally dried up for Walker, and getting people to come on Thursday was unbelievably hard,\u201d one donor said. \u201cEveryone I know was just totally stunned by how difficult the fund-raising became, but the candidate and the campaign just couldn\u2019t inspire confidence.\u201d\n\nMr. Walker burst into attention in late January with a fiery speech in Iowa, where he upstaged other 2016 Republican hopefuls before a conservative crowd, speaking of how he had withstood angry protesters and threats as Wisconsin\u2019s governor.\n\nCourting Republican primary voters who are more conservative than the Wisconsin electorate, Mr. Walker moved to the right, taking hawkish positions on immigration, signing an anti-union bill in Wisconsin and asking the state Legislature to send him a bill banning abortions after 20 weeks.\n\nHe continued to lead the Republican pack in Iowa all spring, and roared over the open road on a Harley-Davidson to a seven-candidate political fund-raiser in the state in June.\n\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s surge as a political outsider galvanized grass-roots Republicans who are angry at all conventional politicians, and he drew more support from Mr. Walker than from any other candidate.\n\nMr. Walker\u2019s own shortcomings on the campaign trail, too, seemed to emerge in the close glare of a national race.\n\n\u201cScott, for whatever reason, didn\u2019t connect on TV,\u201d said Stan Hubbard, a Minnesota-based television station owner and a major donor to Mr. Walker. \u201cAnd if you can\u2019t make it on television today in national politics, you\u2019re dead.\u201d\n\nAt the first Republican debate in early August, he appeared lackluster and short of charisma. He staked out and then revised positions on birthright citizenship and on building a barrier on the Canadian border.\n\nRobert F. List, the former Nevada governor who was the chairman of Mr. Walker\u2019s campaign in that state, said Mr. Walker had suffered in a primary season dominated by charismatic outsider candidates, including Mr. Trump, Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson.\n\nThose three, Mr. List said, \u201chave been surging, and it dilutes the strength of the balance of the rest of the field.\u201d\n\nMr. List, who hosted Mr. Walker in a campaign swing through Nevada last week, said other campaigns had already reached out to solicit his support, as Mr. Walker\u2019s campaign flagged. \u201cMy phone,\u201d he said, \u201cis ringing.\u201d\n\nJonathan Martin and Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting.", "byline": "ALEXANDER BURNS, PATRICK HEALY and TRIP GABRIEL", "description": "Gov.
