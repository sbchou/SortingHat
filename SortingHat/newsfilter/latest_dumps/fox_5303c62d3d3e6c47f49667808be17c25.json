Democrats look unable to turn the rudder from the candidacy of Hillary Clinton, who, despite more than a decade of practice, is really bad at running for president.  How bad? Her campaign network is dropping $20 million to start \u201cwar on women\u201d attacks on the GOP 15 months before the election and seven months before there\u2019s any chance that Republicans could pick a nominee. The money will do damage, but without an actual target, it sounds more like bleating.  Hillary has plenty to worry about with her own party before she can start making the argument that voting Republican and opposing her return to the White House is explicitly sexist. (Though, perhaps part of the intent of the campaign is to remind Democrats that her rivals have been identified as straight, white males. Indeed.)  Clinton\u2019s rapid, vast and ethically questionable building of a fortune that rivals Mitt Romney\u2019s was the topic of the spring. That matter concluded with her assertion that the money showered on her and her husband by those with business before the government simply did not affect her judgment. Oh, in that case\u2026  Now, the topic of the late summer is an FBI investigation of her unhygienic email practices as secretary of state. And given Clinton\u2019s failed evasions, that topic may be around long after the first frost. When you\u2019ve managed to exasperate Eugene Robinson, you\u2019ve found a special way to fail as a Democratic candidate.  So Republicans ought to be doing the Carlton. They can take their pick from a cornucopia of candidates \u2013 as many as a half-dozen of which are potentially viable \u2013 and, thanks to a sped-up primary calendar, be ready to take the fight to Clinton. After two presidential defeats and the endless hazing by the Obama administration, the Republican Party gets its moment. Clear hearts, full eyes, can\u2019t lose, or something.  But in a new poll out today from CNN, the Republican Party is neither fired up nor ready to go. The poll found Republicans actually trailing Democrats in voter intensity. While GOP primary voters are overall more enthusiastic than their Democratic counterparts, those who identified themselves as \u201cextremely enthusiastic\u201d held steady from last month at 28 percent.  But extreme enthusiasm among Democrats shot up from 18 percent in July to 33 percent this month. How much of that is the Democratic base finally feeling their feels with Bernie Sanders? Hard to say, but optimism for keeping the White House in 2016 certainly has something to do with it.  And Republicans would seem to agree with their rivals on how things are shaping up. In the same survey, 58 percent of Republican primary voters said they would have a better chance at the presidency if the nominee were someone other than frontrunner, Donald Trump.  And look at the favorability scores for Trump and second-place Jeb Bush in the poll: nearly identical. Both are known to nearly every registered voter and Trump has a net score of negative 20 and Bush has a score of negative 22. By comparison, Hillary Clinton has a net negative rating of about 8 in an average of recent polls.  The standard bearers for the insurgency and for the establishment in the GOP are both a shambles when it comes to public sentiment and, worst of all, they are already household names. Changing perception of people so famous wouldn\u2019t just be expensive, it would be nearly impossible.  So the table is set for a costly, ugly war between rival factions of the Republican Party, this one perhaps more vitriolic than any before and on behalf of candidates broadly detested outside of their own regimental lines. What\u2019s ahead could make the face-meltingly awful attacks of 2012 look like a brony convention by comparison.  Yes, it is possible that the two could pin each other down and allow the chance for a candidate with better numbers to sprint through the opening. But those chances are rare and with so much ordinance exploding all around, surviving in no-man\u2019s land would be tricky indeed.  For right now, anyway, Hillary Clinton can say that the FBI may have her server, but at least she\u2019s got the GOP.  Ignatius: Intel anger over Hillary\u2019s \u2018disrespect\u2019 - Free Beacon: \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as Secretary of State to send classified information made the national security community nervous and angry for her \u2018disrespect for the system,\u2019\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0columnist David Ignatius said Tuesday. Appearing on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, Ignatius was asked by host Joe Scarborough what his sources in the intelligence field felt about the revelation that more than 300 emails on Clinton\u2019s unsecured server have been flagged for potentially having top-secret information. \u2019I think people are genuinely upset,\u2019 Ignatius said. \u2026\u2019You have to remember we just have had a CIA director, David Petraeus, one of the most decorated generals in our modern history, who had to plead guilty to a criminal charge involving this question of unauthorized use of classified information. It\u2019s not a trivial issue. Secretary Clinton wandered into this with her email server. She\u2019s been scrambling ever since.\u2019\u201d  WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026 Eva Holland, a Canadian freelance writer who covers extreme sporting events delivers for SB Nation a soul-searching account of her trip with seven other women through the Yukon Quest: a 445 miles endurance race by canoe from Whitehorse down the fast-moving Yukon River.\u00a0\u201cI wanted to know what it felt like to hallucinate from exhaustion. I wanted to push my body to a point where I didn\u2019t recognize it anymore. Most of all, I wanted to know: Could I do it?\u201d Several times Holland had her doubts: \u201cI was abruptly, violently angry, but I was also mortified, and both feelings were amplified, distorted by my exhaustion \u2013 they banged and crashed around inside me like I was a teenager going through puberty again. I didn\u2019t want to be the one dragging my ass towards the finish line while the others soldiered on, I thought. I didn\u2019t want to be a liability.\u201d It\u2019s a ripping read.

Ted Strickland incumbent GOP Sen. Rob Portman \u2013 Americans for Prosperity, part of the network founded by brothers Charles and David Koch is jumping in the race early. Like really, really early. The group is dropping more than $1 million on a testimonial ad knocking Strickland on job losses. \u201cWhen Ted Strickland governed Ohio, the state actually fared worse than many of its neighbors,\u201d said the group\u2019s president Tim Phillips in a statement. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the economic downturn that hit the nation, it was tax-and-spend policies that sent companies fleeing to other states with more reasonable business environments.\u201d  WALKER RAISES STAKES ON OBAMACARE REPEAL Fox News: \u201cWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is rolling out his first big policy proposal Tuesday in Minnesota as he unveils his plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare. Walker says ObamaCare\u2019s backwards approach has driven up health care costs and reduced access to medical care for too many people. The GOP contender's \u2018Day One Patient Freedom Plan\u2019 consists of five steps: repealing ObamaCare in its entirety, ensuring affordable and accessible health insurance for everyone, making health care more efficient, effective and accountable by empowering the states, increasing quality and choice through innovation, and providing financial stability for families and taxpayers.\u201d  Rand, McConnell look to save ballot double billing - AP: \u201cRepublican Rand Paul says he has contributed $250,000 and pledged another $200,000 to pay for a proposed GOP presidential caucus in his home state of Kentucky next year. State GOP officials are scheduled to vote Saturday on rules for the proposed March 5 caucus. The state party's proposed switch from a primary to a caucus would allow Paul to run for president and re-election to his U.S. Senate seat simultaneously without violating a state law banning candidates from appearing on the ballot twice. In a letter to party officials, Paul says he transferred $250,000 to a state GOP account. He pledged to raise or transfer another $200,000.\u00a0 \u2026 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday that Paul is sticking to his commitment to defray caucus costs. McConnell has endorsed the caucus.\u201d  SOUND OFF: READERS RESPOND TO 2016 POWER INDEX \u201cTrump is far ahead, and the pundits say, \u2018well he has reached his limit\u2019\u00a0 I say BS.\u00a0 Take out 8-9 lousy candidates at the bottom, who have numbers, and trump will gain more.\u00a0 There is 17 people being listened to, so take out the dead wood, and you have lumber.\u00a0 Then Trump goes to 40 % , and then what will you make excuses for?????Where are your brains????\u00a0 The pundits that Fox uses are as dumb as black holes in space., and Fox doesn\u2019t question their answers.\u00a0 Wow.\u201d \u2013 Larry Hulshoff  \u201cJeb Bush, Rubio, Walker, Kasich, Cruz, Fiorino, Carson, Trump, Paul, Christy\u201d \u2013 Karen\u00a0 Morrow  \u201cThe Donald Trump sideshow is a huge distraction in selecting the actual GOP nominee. Early exits now by little supported Gilmore, Pataki, Graham, Santorum, Jindal and Perry would be \u2018for the good of the party\u2019 ---\u00a0 thereby helping\u00a0 GOP voters to focus on their realistic alternatives.\u201d \u2013 Jim Hartman  \u201cAfter watching all of the candidates up to now I am most impressed with Ben Carson and\u00a0Carly Fiorina.\u00a0 I am glad to see Trump stir things up...the republicans needed that.\u00a0 We don\u2019t need another Bush in the White House even though they are a likeable family.\u00a0 I also believe that Ted Cruz would be a good president...a very bright guy.\u00a0 The rest of the field are not as impressive with the exception of Rubio...he needs to get a few more years under his belt first, but would also make a good president.\u201d \u2013 Martha Bruggeman  \u201cCarly #1 or #2. Pair with Rubio or Walker to\u00a0defeat the Hillary beast.\u201d \u2013 Trevor Roe  \u201cAs pressure mounts on certain candidates to suspend their bids for the good of the party, and they run out of money, the field will sort\u00a0itself out for\u00a0the stronger candidates - - not Bush, Walker or Rubio, but Cruz and Fiorina. If establishment Republicans want to stop Trump, then they better get behind Cruz now!\u201d \u2013 Ed Vidal  \u2018I DON\u2019T KNOW MUCH ABOUT TIGER LOGISTICS\u2019 Detroit Free Press: \u201cBritish photographer David Yarrow booked a two-day photo shoot at Detroit\u2019s Packard Plant. Only problem was, he apparently didn't tell anyone at the plant that he was bringing a tiger, two wolves and a bobcat with him. \u2026 \u2018I got a call from a friend who asked me to help them get this tiger out of a staircase,\u2019 said Andy Didorosi, 28, of Detroit. \u2018He asked me if I had a leafblower, and I said I had a weedwhacker, so he told me to bring that. ... I stopped what I was doing, grabbed my tools and hopped in my truck, because, you know, tiger. ... I don't know much about tiger logistics, but we were told to be this huge blue tarp monster with the weedwhacker and try to be scary and make loud noises. That just made him angry. You could say he got tiger rage, so we retreated.\u2019\u201d And yes, there is video.  AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026 \u201c[I]t shows you once again, if you needed repetition, how bad a candidate [Hillary Clinton] is.\u00a0That attempt at self-deprecation about Snapchat\u00a0is groan-worthy, cringe-worthy, it doesn\u2019t work, and it shows how ham-handed she is. If she had the charm of her husband it might work, but it doesn\u2019t.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d Watch here.
