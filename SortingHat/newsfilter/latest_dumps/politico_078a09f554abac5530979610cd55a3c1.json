The network had prepared a sixth lectern in case the vice president declared his candidacy at the last minute and wanted to take part. \n\u201cUpdate: VP Biden will join @POTUS and @LorettaLynch in their Oval Office meeting at 2:45 PM,\u201d his Twitter account posted late Tuesday morning.\nEven if President Obama lent Biden his faster Air Force One, it\u2019d still take just over four hours for the vice president to get to Vegas from Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington. Tack on time to get to Andrews, a bit more time to get to the Wynn Hotel, and it looks just about impossible for Biden to both attend a meeting with the attorney general at the White House and make it to Vegas in time for CNN\u2019s 9 p.m. ET debate.\nA dramatic McCarran International Airport landing, speeding motorcade (or yellow corvette, depending on which version of the fantasy you\u2019re catching) and aviator glasses imagined by CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta look increasingly unlikely. \n\u201cThat would be fascinating political television,\u201d Acosta says in a segment pilloried on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. \nThe vice president\u2019s office has not shared what he\u2019ll be doing during the debate, and didn't immediately respond to an email seeking confirmation of his schedule.\nOn the other hand, CNN has not ruled in or out the possibility that Biden could participate via Skype or satphone. \nSarah Wheaton is a White House reporter for Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "It doesn&#39;t look like CNN&#39;s extra lectern will get its moment under the lights.", "title": "Biden to be a no-show", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/what-happens-in-vegas/2015/10/joe-biden-no-show-democratic-debate-las-vegas-214705", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "personality"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Paul Dallison", "Joe Pompeo", "Kenneth P.
