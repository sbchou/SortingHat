{"body": "", "byline": "", "description": "\nScott Olson / Getty Images\nWASHINGTON \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m for Trump,\u201d conservative talk radio host Michael Savage told listeners last month. \u201cPoint blank, best choice we have.\u201dRight now, the lead video on the radio host\u2019s YouTube channel is an \u201cexciting, must-see compilation set to music\u201d of Trump moments from this summer.The symbiotic relationship between Donald Trump and cable news is well established. But what\u2019s gotten less attention this summer beyond frustrated conservative circles online is the another media engine driving Trump: good old-fashioned talk radio.For weeks, some of the biggest names in conservative talk radio \u2014 Rush Limbaugh, Mark Levin, Laura Ingraham, Sean Hannity, and Savage \u2014 have praised Trump and his bashing of the politically correct left and Republican establishment.But the conservative talkers are also pushing his rhetoric on immigration and his vow to revoke birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants \u2014 and delivering that content straight to their millions of listeners.Unlike cable news, conservative talk radio speaks directly to the disaffected conservative base fueling Trump\u2019s rise. Rush Limbaugh\u2019s is still the most-listened-to talk radio program in the country, pulling in 13 and a quarter million weekly listeners, according to estimates in Talkers magazine, an industry publication (Limbaugh himself has estimated it in the past at 20 million). Talkers puts Sean Hannity in second, with 12.5 million. Mark Levin ties with Glenn Beck (a Trump critic) for fourth, with 7 million. Savage has more than 5 million, according to Talkers\u2019 estimates.And if you\u2019re someone who listens to a lot of talk radio, you can go from Ingraham to Limbaugh to Hannity or Savage to Levin in a day and hear nary a word of displeasure with Trump.\u201cI liken the bond between hosts and their listeners to a friendship,\u201d said Brian Rosenwald, a University of Pennsylvania professor who has studied conservative talk radio. \u201cPolitically, the result of this bond is that when hosts talk to listeners about a candidate or bill it\u2019s like having your brother-in-law or best friend tell you about the candidate or bill.\u201dThough many hosts have avoided a formal endorsement, they\u2019ve heaped praise on the candidate and signaled to their listeners that Trump is their guy.\u201cI\u2019m not endorsing anybody as you well know, but the fact of the matter is I like the way this guy talks,\u201d Levin said this week on Hannity\u2019s Fox News show. Ingraham has framed her posture towards Trump as \u201canalyzing Trump\u2019s appeal.\u201dThe praise is often couched as praise of Trump\u2019s supporters and of Trump\u2019s connection with them.\u201cI watched this thing last night,\u201d Limbaugh said on Wednesday\u2019s program. \u201cI happened to get on the airplane to catch maybe the last 30 minutes of it on the way home, and the last 10 minutes of what Trump did last night sealed the deal,\u201d Limbaugh said, referring to Trump\u2019s appearance in Dubuque, Iowa.\u201cI mean, the sincerity, the appreciation for the audience that showed up. He gave every indication. He left no doubt how much he loved those people that showed up, how much he respects them, how much their presence means to him. All the braggadocio aside, all of the showmanship and the flamboyance, all of that aside, Donald Trump let them know at the end of everything else he said how deeply touched and moved he is by their support, by their belief in him.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to tell whether the hosts actually really like Trump, whose conservative bona fides fall apart the minute the discussion goes beyond immigration, or whether they\u2019re more concerned with pleasing their audience and with keeping the focus on the immigration debate that fires up the base. Trump, after all, has supported many positions antithetical to conservative orthodoxy over the years \u2014 universal health care, a pro-choice approach to abortion (since reversed), banning assault weapons, and so forth.That inconsistency hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed in conservative circles, where it\u2019s vexed the vocal Trump opposition.Rick Wilson, a Republican strategist who has come under attack from fellow conservatives for opposing Trump, said that he thought conservative talk radio\u2019s focus on Trump is a ploy to please listeners and keep them tuned in. The conservative media is more crowded than ever with sources of information, and though they still command large audiences, talkers don\u2019t have the same kind of hegemony they once did.\u201cThe get out of jail free card of \u2018I'm not with Trump but isn't he awesome about The Wall/Those Damn Dirty Mexicans/Bush/Megyn Kelly/the media/topic du jour\u2019 is a mighty tiny fig leaf,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cOf course, they're in the phase where they've monetized Trump mania, so they have to keep stoking the story and stirring their audiences with ever-more-grandiose paeans to Trump's godhood.\u201d\u201cFealty to Trump demands the broadcasters fully buy in to the Trump Reality Distortion Field, or be cast into the outer darkness,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI mean, this isn't a new observation, but Fox News is no longer conservative enough in their eyes. I heard a Newsmax promo this week that said, \u2018Tune in to Newsmax TV to get the real story from Ted Cruz... without the Fox News filter.\u2019\u201dFox News has been supplanted as the voice of the base, if it ever was. For all the hemming and hawing in recent years about talk radio\u2019s supposed decline in influence, there\u2019s still no purer media ecosystem for the ideas that animate conservatives. If Rush Limbaugh or Mark Levin or Sean Hannity or Laura Ingraham decide that birthright citizenship is going to be a big issue, then lo, it becomes the issue of the week, or month. Ingraham was one of the biggest voices championing Rep. David Brat before his upset win over Eric Cantor. Limbaugh especially has a proven record of this; in a New York Times story in 2008, Karl Rove said he thought Limbaugh\u2019s \u201cOperation Chaos\u201d may actually have tipped the Texas primary Hillary Clinton\u2019s way.And Limbaugh positions himself as no unaware actor. On his program on Aug. 18, he gave a representative pr\u00e9cis of the talk radio position in response to a caller who called in and implied that Limbaugh is supporting Trump:\u201cDo you understand that I always have a purpose?\u201d Limbaugh said. \u201cDo you realize nothing is haphazard? You're wondering why I'm supporting Trump. Who says I am? Have I announced specifically that I am, or are you perceiving it? A better question would be: If you think that, why? And I can't go any further. I did with my brother last night. It's on record, if I have to go back and prove this, and I told Snerdley this morning about this. But I can't go any further here. It is what it is. I know it's a cliche.\u201dLimbaugh\u2019s show is less generation of the policies themselves than a mechanism for spreading the ideas far and wide. \u201cIn truth, Limbaugh is less a theoretician than a popularizer of what he regards as the correct conservative responses to contemporary issues,\u201d that same 2008 Times story, by Limbaugh and Roger Ailes biographer Zev Chafets, argued.And right now, Trump\u2019s embrace of hardline immigration ideas like ending birthright citizenship matches up perfectly with the policies that some of these hosts have been promoting for some time. The Trump-inspired debate over immigration is allowing them to mainstream ideas that once didn\u2019t have much purchase, the birthright citizenship question being a notable recent example. Both Levin and Limbaugh have seized on a quote by Sen. Jacob Howard, the original sponsor of the Citizenship Clause, that they\u2019re using to bolster their case that the 14th amendment doesn\u2019t guarantee citizenship to the children of people in the country illegally. Laura Ingraham has also referenced it.Talk radio hasn\u2019t totally been a monolith for Trump. Several of the major hosts, most notably Glenn Beck, have been either skeptical or downright hostile to the frontrunner. Beck in particular has gone after Trump early and often, calling him a \u201cflaming body part\u201d after his announcement and a \u201cson of a bitch\u201d after the first primary debate earlier this month in Cleveland. Beck has also criticized his peers in the conservative media for supporting Trump.\u201cWhy are big name \u2018conservatives\u2019 supporting him?\u201d Beck asked on his Facebook page earlier this month. \u201cI am not talking about the average Joe, I am talking about Sean Hannity or Ann Colter [sic]. How about Savage or Rush? These are smart people. What am I missing? Just based on his favorability ratings he could never win in a general. Research shows that he may be near his ceiling now. Are they just trying to hold on to those disenfranchised republicans and keep them in the fold?\u201dAnd for Hannity, the situation has been complicated by Trump\u2019s war with Fox News following the Fox moderators\u2019 tough questioning of him in the debate. Though Hannity is positive on Trump, he\u2019s stood up for his colleague Megyn Kelly who has borne the brunt of Trump\u2019s attacks. He told his \u201cfriend\u201d Trump to \u201cleave Megyn Kelly alone\u201d on Twitter this week and later expanded on the criticism, saying on his radio show on Tuesday that Trump needs to focus more on the issues.There\u2019s also a case to be made that Trump is famous enough that he didn\u2019t need talk radio in the first place. Hugh Hewitt, who has been skeptical of Trump and asked him tough questions but hasn\u2019t declared war like Beck, said he thought that Trump would have reached this level even without talk radio\u2019s help.\u201cDonald Trump is a ratings phenomenon that would exist even if every talker in America suddenly went silent for the next year,\u201d Hewitt said. \u201cHe has a built-in audience by virtue of his decades in the spotlight, his television and publishing success, and of course his overall profile as a deal-making maestro. Yes, we all talk about him \u2014 I'd gladly open every show with him if he was available, and all four times he has appeared with me have been great \u2014 but his appeal is independent of talk radio.\u201d\n", "title": "The Real Media Machine Behind Trump: Conservative Talk Radio", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/the-real-media-machine-behind-trump-conservative-talk-radio", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Roger Ailes", "Laura Ingraham", "Karl Rove", "Scott Olson", "Jacob Howard", "Michael Savage", "Mark Levin", "Hillary Clinton", "Donald Trump", "Zev Chafets", "David Brat", "Rick Wilson", "Glenn Beck", "Megyn Kelly", "Rush Limbaugh", "Eric Cantor", "Sean Hannity", "Hugh Hewitt", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": [".There", "University of Pennsylvania"], "authors": [{"author_id": 8663, "fullname": "rosie gray", "primary_org": "buzzfeed"}], "date_written": "2015-08-28 04:47:18", "org": "buzzfeed", "article_id": "bfe21c10f1f562b755fb0bb15f7a0bb2", "date_access": "2015-08-28 04:50:46.205282"}
