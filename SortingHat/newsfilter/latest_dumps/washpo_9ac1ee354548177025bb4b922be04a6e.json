{"body": "   Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump after Thursday's political debate. (AP/John Minchillo)  ATLANTA \u2014 Conservative commentator Erick Erickson on Friday night disinvited GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump from speaking at an activist conference he is hosting here this weekend, citing disparaging remarks Trump made hours earlier on CNN about Fox News Channel anchor Megyn Kelly. In an interview with The Washington Post, Erickson said Trump had been scheduled to speak at his RedState gathering on Saturday at the College Football Hall of Fame, but he told Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, about an hour before midnight that Trump was no longer welcome. Trump\u2019s campaign said in a statement that Erickson\u2019s decision was \u201canother example of weakness through being politically correct. For all the people who were looking forward to Mr. Trump coming, we will miss you. Blame Erick Erickson, your weak and pathetic leader. We\u2019ll now be doing another campaign stop at another location.\u201d Trump\u2019s CNN interview Friday evening instantly drew controversy and criticism after he said Kelly, one of the moderators of Thursday\u2019s Republican presidential debate in Cleveland, \u201chad blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.\u201d Erickson, a Fox News regular and face of the popular RedState blog, has long been a foe congressional GOP leaders and an ally of conservative grass-roots organizers. He has also drawn criticism for saying impolitic things, once calling retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter an \u201c[expletive] child molester\u201d and First Lady Michelle Obama a \u201cMarxist harpy.\u201d He has since apologized for both comments. Trump\u2019s words about Kelly simply went too far, Erickson said Friday, making him, someone who enjoys and appreciates barbed political rhetoric, uncomfortable and queasy. And with his invited guest dominating the 2016 race, and few if any conservatives reining him in, Erickson thought he\u2019d try. The following is a transcript: Why did you disinvite Trump? I think there is a line of decency that even a non-professional politician can cross. Suggesting that a female journalist asking you a hostile question is hormone related, I think, is one of those lines. Have you spoken to Trump directly about your decision? No, I\u2019ve spoken with his campaign manager. And you know, we had a combative phone call when I asked him to clarify the remark. When they called back to clarify the remark, I didn\u2019t think it was a genuine clarification. So, I sent him an e-mail and said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry to have to do this, but I consider you disinvited. I think the comment was inappropriate. What was Corey Lewandowski\u2019s reaction to that? Well, when I first talked to him, he didn\u2019t want to even admit that Donald Trump made the remark. He focused on the \u2018blood in her eyes\u2019 and said that was all he was talking about. Despite my continuing to tell him that that wasn\u2019t the problem, that it was the \u2018wherever,\u2019 he told me that I\u2019d just have to put my concern in writing, to send a note about my seeking of an apology and clarification. I did and when he called me back, he said the clarification was \u2018Mr. Trump was trying to move beyond the question [in the CNN interview] by getting away from talking about her eyes or whatever.\u2019 I said, \u2018That wasn\u2019t how it was on the tape.\u2019 I didn\u2019t accept that he misspoke, based on the context of the video. How did the conversation end? Well, it ended very quietly and I said I\u2019d call him back. Then I thought it wasn\u2019t worth my time to do so based on the way they were framing the so-called clarification that wasn\u2019t a clarification, so I e-mailed him back and wrote that he\u2019s disinvited. Has Lewandowski responded to that e-mail? No, he has not. Do you think Trump will still come to Atlanta? I don\u2019t know. If he is, unlike most of his events, this is on my stage, the stage I paid for. If he wants on it, he\u2019s going to have to answer questions. That said, I\u2019m not sure he\u2019ll be invited into the room. It\u2019s my event, not his event. Do you see yourself as a referee for the conservative movement to keep Trump from riling the race? You know, no. I\u2019m trying to be lenient with him. I told his campaign manager a few days ago that there have been a lot of people in the party who refuse to treat him legitimately even though he\u2019s the front-runner. And I didn\u2019t want to give him a hard time. I felt bad that one of event\u2019s agendas didn\u2019t have his name on it and felt badly about that, let him know. I don\u2019t like that I have to disinvite him. But there are bounds of what\u2019s acceptable in our discourse and they\u2019re not different for you, or me, or someone else. I\u2019m not going to have a guy on stage with my wife and daughter in the crowd who thinks a tough question from a woman is because of hormones. What has the reaction been among conservative leaders and Republicans? I\u2019ve gotten a lot of people e-mailing me telling me thank you. Reporters, conservatives, other politicians. There have been lots of notes. Look, I really wanted Donald Trump to be here. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a bad guy. But I can\u2019t have a guy on stage who said Megyn Kelly was bleeding from her eyes or wherever. Bridge too far. Who now gets his speaking slot? I\u2019ve invited Megyn Kelly.", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Donald Trump disinvited to speak at RedState event; Megyn Kelly invited", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/08/donald-trump-disinvited-to-speak-at-redstate-event-megyn-kelly-invited/", "topics": ["immigration", "terrorism", "economy"], "people": ["Erick Erickson", "Corey Lewandowski", "Michelle Obama", "Donald Trump", "Megyn Kelly", "John Minchillo"], "orgs": ["Supreme Court Justice", "GOP", "Reporters"], "authors": [{"author_id": 31224, "fullname": "robert costa", "primary_org": "washpo"}], "date_written": "2015-08-08 06:30:51", "org": "washpo", "article_id": "9ac1ee354548177025bb4b922be04a6e", "date_access": "2015-08-08 05:50:02.869453"}
