{"body": "Wisconsin, vaccines and NBC. These are a few of Donald Trump's NOT favorite things. In fact, it's pretty easy to\u00a0round up a list of 25 people, companies, countries, states and things The Donald has denounced or come close to denouncing.\u00a0So, what and who does Donald Trump dislike? Let's get to it! 1) War heroes (at least the ones who got captured):\u00a0\"[John McCain]'s not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured, OK? I hate to tell you,\" Trump said Saturday in Iowa. 2) Conservative pundits who dare to criticize Trump: [Your next president, Donald Trump, basically tweets like a 12-year-old girl]   Dummy political pundit @krauthammer constantly pressed the crazy war in Iraq. Many lives and trillions of dollars wasted. U.S. got NOTHING! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2015    How does failed writer and pundit like @stephenfhayes, with no success and little talent, get away with criticizing candidates. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 20, 2015    Jonah Goldberg @JonahNRO of the once great @NRO #National Review is truly dumb as a rock. Why does @BretBaier put this dummy on his show? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 20, 2015  3)\u00a0This blog and its founder\u00a0   One of the dumber and least respected of the political pundits is Chris Cillizza of the Washington Post @TheFix. Moron hates my poll numbers \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2015  4)\u00a0Arianna Huffington   .@ariannahuff is unattractive both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man- he made a good decision. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 28, 2012  5) NBC: \"NBC is weak, and like everybody else is trying to be politically correct,\" he said after NBC dumped his show, \"The Apprentice,\" in June after he made derogatory remarks about\u00a0immigrants. 6)\u00a0All media, actually: Journalists are \"terrible people\" he said at a rally in Phoenix in July. 7) Most undocumented\u00a0immigrants from Mexico: \"They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people,\" he famously said\u00a0at\u00a0his June 16 campaign launch. 8) Hillary Clinton, who is \u201cthe worst secretary of state in the history of the country,\" he said\u00a0at a July \u00a0rally in Phoenix. 9) \u00a0Barack Obama, who is \"a divisive person,\" he said\u00a0in Phoenix. 10)\u00a0Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a\u00a0GOP 2012 and 2016 candidate, who criticized Trump last week: \"I thought he had a really bad run last time,\" Trump has said of Perry, later calling him \"a nice guy.\" 11) Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, another GOP 2016 candidate: \"Bobby Jindal was very vehement \u2013 oh, bah bah. I think he's at zero\" he told the New York Times last week. 12) Former Pennsylvania Sen.\u00a0Rick Santorum's electoral record. He's \"a nice guy\" but, \"I say, look, you were a sitting senator in Pennsylvania. You lost by 19 points, which is like a record,\" he told Bloomberg in\u00a0June. 13) Former Arkansas Gov.\u00a0Mike Huckabee's former Fox News show: \"I don't know that his show would have continued much longer, unlike 'The Apprentice,'\" Trump told Bloomberg. 14)\u00a0Mitt Romney:\u00a0\"Romney\u2014I have a Gucci store that\u2019s worth more than Romney,\" he told the Des Moines Register in June. 15) Pollsters:\u00a0I don\u2019t want a pollster. Because if a pollster\u2019s so good, why aren\u2019t they running?\" he told the New York Times. 16)\u00a0Presidential debates:\u00a0\"Whatever. I don\u2019t look forward or not look forward. It is what it is,\" he told The Washington Post's Robert\u00a0Costa in June. 17)\u00a0Richard Nixon and his use of the phrase 'silent majority': \"Oh, is that why people stopped using [the phrase]? Maybe. Nobody thinks of Nixon,\" Trump told Costa. 18) Drugs: \"They're a terrible thing,\" he told Bloomberg\u00a0in an interview\u00a0where he switched his policy on marijuana legalization from \"yes\" to \"no.\" 19) Wisconsin: \"Wisconsin has got tremendous problems,\" he told Bloomberg. 20) Mexico: Trump once called for a boycott of the country and has repeatedly said he'll make the country pay for a wall he wants to build along the U.S.-Mexico border. (He later said \"I like Mexico.\") 21)\u00a0American diplomats, especially those who negotiated the Iranian deal: \"We (America) have a bunch of babies negotiating,\" he told Washington Jewish Weekly in a July 2 interview. 22)\u00a0Black bankers: Trump told Rolling Stone in June the following comments an associate alleged he made were \"probably true\": \"Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are little short guys that wear yarmulkes every day.\" 23)\u00a0Vaccinations   No more massive injections. Tiny children are not horses\u2014one vaccine at a time, over time. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2014  24)\u00a0Communion: \"When we go in church and I drink the little wine, which is about the only wine I drink, and I eat the little cracker \u2014 I guess that\u2019s a form of asking forgiveness,\" Trump said in Iowa. 25)\u00a0God, himself, a little bit: \"If I do something wrong, I try to do something right. I don't bring God into that picture,\" Trump said in Iowa at the same conference. BONUS\u00a0Three people\u00a0Trump does like: 1. Bernie Sanders: \"Bernie Sanders is doing very well,\" he told Bloomberg. 2. Neil Young (who asked Trump not use his song in his campaign): \"I love Neil Young, and he loves me,\" he told Bloomberg. 3. Donald Trump: \"I\u2019m the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far. Nobody\u2019s ever been more successful than me. I\u2019m the most successful person ever to run,\" he told the Des Moines Register in June.", "byline": "", "description": "\"I have a Gucci store worth more than Romney.\"", "title": "25 people, places and things Donald Trump has denounced", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/07/20/25-people-places-and-things-donald-trump-has-denounced/", "topics": ["immigration", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Jonah Goldberg", "Richard Nixon", "Mitt Romney", "Rick Santorum", "Neil Young", "Chris Cillizza", "Robert Costa", "Hillary Clinton", "Rick Perry", "Donald Trump", "Donald J.
