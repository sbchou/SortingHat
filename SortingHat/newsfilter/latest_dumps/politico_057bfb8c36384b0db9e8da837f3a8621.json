(http://www.politicopro.com/proinfo)\nStory Continued Below\nFIGHT NIGHT \u2014 \u201cAre voters ready to tune out Donald Trump?\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Ben Schreckinger: For the candidates, the moderators and the audience, this was the Trump debate. \u201cFrom the opening bell, the Fox News moderators and his Republican rivals made Trump the center of attention, hammering him with contentious questions \u2014 which he would complain afterward were \u2018not nice\u2019 \u2014 and frontal attacks. So far, the mogul has thrived on the attention, positive or negative, and he made no catastrophic mistakes on Thursday. But the debate raised the question of whether exposure alone can keep propelling his candidacy. \u2018Those that supported him found much to like in his forcefulness, conviction and disdain for political correctness,\u2019 said Bruce Haynes, a South Carolina Republican strategist and co-founder of the moderate political consulting firm Purple Strategies. \u2018Those who dislike him were reminded why.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/1MVx3hT\n\u2014 \u201cGOP insiders: Trump is biggest loser,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Katie Glueck: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s first presidential debate was a disaster. That\u2019s the assessment of Republican insiders in this week\u2019s POLITICO Caucus, our weekly bipartisan survey of the top strategists, activists and operatives in Iowa and New Hampshire. They offered their reactions immediately after watching Thursday\u2019s 9 p.m. prime-time debate in Cleveland. Forty-four percent called the controversial real estate mogul the biggest loser of the evening, critiquing everything from his refusal to rule out a third party run, to perceived misogynistic comments to his acceptance of single-payer health care in other countries. \u2018Trump is an egomaniacal thug and everyone who never watched The Apprentice now knows that, too,\u2019 an Iowa Republican charged.\u201d http://politi.co/1UsMU9S\n\u2014 Seven takeaways from POLITICO\u2019s Glenn Thrush: \u201cIf the nearly three hours of two-tiered GOP hopefuls proved anything, it was that the 17-candidate field is not only historically huge but uncommonly deep. It\u2019s not clear if Republicans are getting tired of The Donald\u2019s every-man-for-himself campaign (he kicked off the evening by saying he\u2019d consider a third-party bid if he lost the GOP nomination fight) but beneath his overbearing presence the contours of a more conventional race, with lots of compelling characters jockeying for position in an unpredictable campaign, began to take shape.\u201d His takeaways: Jeb was meh. Trump is getting old, especially for women. Cruz played nice. Not much policy. Kasich looked like a top-tier candidate. Paul was aggressive. And Walker gave a so-so performance \u2014 but his zinger on Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server was the best line of the night. http://politi.co/1OUFBE0\n\u2014 More analysis from The Atlantic\u2019s Molly Ball: \u201cThe night\u2019s surprise standout was Ohio Governor John Kasich, who had the advantage of a hometown crowd that ardently cheered his every answer. (The other sitting governors in the race \u2014 Walker, Christie, and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, who did not poll well enough to qualify for the main debate \u2014 do not enjoy Kasich\u2019s popularity in their home states.) ... Kasich repeatedly articulated an inclusive vision for the GOP \u2014 a vision starkly different than Trump\u2019s Mexican-bashing, screw-the-losers mentality. It\u2019s clear that a large swath of the GOP is responding to Trump\u2019s call, but on Thursday, another segment seemed to be responding to Kasich\u2019s. It\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess whose party this is. It will take the next few months of fighting to find out.\u201d http://theatln.tc/1W52EkV\n\u2014 Curious about the gay wedding Kasich mentioned attending? The nuptials were those of Steven George, a former Kasich aide, and Jeff Gatwood. The Plain Dealer has the details: http://bit.ly/1RUunA7\nDays until the 2015 election: 88. Days until the 2016 election: 459.\nThanks for joining us.

Fiorina faces an uphill battle to earn a primetime promotion for next month\u2019s CNN debate, however. Unlike Fox News, which only factored in the five most recent polls when it made its cut this week, CNN will consider all qualified polls from mid-July through Sept. 10. That means that eight of the polls that will be factored into CNN\u2019s calculations have already been released \u2014 including the five that Fox used to relegate her to the undercard Thursday night. She will need to surge significantly in the upcoming polls; she\u2019s currently in 14th place in the CNN average, according to a POLITICO analysis.\u201d http://politi.co/1MRQUiW\n\u2014 The Democratic reaction, by POLITICO\u2019s Gabriel Debenedetti: \u201cWhile the candidates on the Fox News-hosted stage Thursday night focused plenty of their derision at Obama and Clinton, enough of the personal attacks came in the form of direct Republican-on-Republican squabbling that few of those individual lines caught national Democrats\u2019 eyes as gaffes or campaign fodder. There was Huckabee vs. Christie. There was Christie vs. Paul. There was Paul vs. Trump. There was Bush vs. Trump. There was almost Huckabee vs. Trump. There was Trump vs. the moderators. There was Trump vs. the world.\u201d http://politi.co/1EcQThb\n\u2014 Democrats set their own debate schedule on Thursday, starting Oct. 13: http://politi.co/1SWBxJY\n\u2014 By the numbers: How many times did the candidates invoke Reagan? How many times did the out-of-time buzzer sound? Campaign Pro\u2019s Elena Schneider breaks it down. http://politi.co/1MVxxV6\n\u2014 The New York Times also has a handy graph showing how long each candidate got to speak \u2014 Trump got 11:14, by their count, and Paul got 5:28 \u2014 and in what increments. http://nyti.ms/1Meu8BL\nTACIT APPROVAL \u2014 NRCC chairman credits Trump with \"firing people up\": National Republican Congressional Committeeman Chairman Greg Walden of Oregon, whose success is tied in no small part to who the Republican presidential nominee is, had this to say when local radio station KBND asked about Trump's run: \"He has certainly found his voice and fired up a group of people that maybe weren\u2019t fired up before. Doesn\u2019t mean I agree with everything he says, mind you, or how he says it. What he is, is kind of a barometer of the intensity of this electorate going into this election cycle.\" http://bit.ly/1KU1N36\nCODA \u2014 QUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cBlah. blah. Blah. Blah. #GOPdebate\u201d \u2014 Herman Cain, the pizza magnate turned Republican presidential candidate who was a fixture of the primary debates four years ago, seemed less than impressed with this year\u2019s crop of candidates in a tweet. http://bit.ly/1MUZo7U\nBy ADAM WREN\nBy POLITICO MAGAZINE\nBy JONAH SHEPP\nBy GLENN THRUSH and  ALEX ISENSTADT\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "NRCC chairman credits Trump with \"firing people up.\"", "title": "POST-DEBATE SPECIAL EDITION \u2014 Winners \u2014 Losers \u2014 Whither Trump?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/morningscore/0815/morningscore19494.html", "topics": ["trade", "campaign_finance", "women"], "people": ["Ben Schreckinger", "Manu Raju", "Daniel Strauss", "Greg Walden", "Molly Ball", "Steve Shepard", "Kevin Robillard", "Hillary Clinton", "Donald Trump", "Theodoric Meyer", "Elena Schneider", "Glenn Thrush", "Herman Cain", "Bruce Haynes", "Bobby Jindal", "Eli Stokols", "John Kasich", "Carly Fiorina", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Katie Glueck"], "orgs": ["Purple Strategies", "GOP", "NRCC"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30738, "fullname": "theodoric meyer", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-08-07 15:02:33", "org": "politico", "article_id": "057bfb8c36384b0db9e8da837f3a8621", "date_access": "2015-08-07 14:10:23.732133"}
