Hit the snooze button and roll back over.\nWhat if I told you that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz absolutely lit up fellow Republican and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky, in an extraordinary floor speech and accused him of lying about reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank?\nBetcha don\u2019t need a couple of cups of Dunkin\u2019 Donuts\u2019 Arabica bean coffee infused with a Turbo Shot now, do you?\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine an issue as lethargic to the general public as renewing the Export-Import Bank.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean the future of the so-called \u201cEx-Im\u201d Bank hasn\u2019t touched off a feisty debate in the business community and on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe bank offers loans to U.S. businesses to sell products overseas. Supporters argue the institution is essential for the U.S. to compete because many other nations operate similar banks and that extinguishing the bank robs U.S. firms of that essential boost.\nConservatives decry the bank. They argue that companies should stand and fall on their own. They\u2019ve converted the doom of the bank into a cause celebre. Congress failed to reauthorize the bank. Its charter to extend new lines of credit ceased at the end of June. However, the bank still operates, managing about 18 years\u2019 worth of outstanding loans.\nMcConnell maneuvered on the Senate floor Friday morning to tee-up a vote that could lead to reauthorization. That\u2019s what forced Cruz\u2019s temper to flare as he incinerated the majority leader in a blistering floor speech.\n\u201cI cannot believe that (McConnell) would tell a flat-out lie,\u201d seethed Cruz. \u201cWe now know that when the majority leader looks us in the eyes and makes an explicit commitment that he is willing to say things that he knows are false.\u201d\nWhoa.\nFour things made Cruz\u2019s oratory extraordinary:\nIt featured a prominent Republican senator running for president taking on the majority leader of his own party.\nThere are internal party disagreements all the time. But it\u2019s almost unprecedented for internecine warfare to be laid bare on the Senate floor.\nThe chamber is usually a more genteel place, devoid of such verbal fisticuffs.\nIt is extremely rare for one senator to accuse another of being a liar -- let alone the majority leader.\nOn Friday morning, the Senate completed a procedural vote to launch debate on a bill to renew federal highway programs set to expire at the end of the month.\nAs is Senate custom, the majority leader gets first dibs to speak. The leader also functions as something of a parliamentary arborist. So when the Senate finished the vote, formally summoning the highway measure up for debate, McConnell seized control of the floor first and began a process of \u201cfilling the Senate amendment tree.\u201d\nUnlike the House, the Senate features an open amendment process. That means any senator can offer an amendment at any time. That is, unless the majority leader gets to the amendment tree first. Think of the bill at hand as the \u201ctrunk\u201d of the tree. Under most circumstances, only one branch sprouts from this tree -- and a sprig extends from that limb.\nBoth the branch and sprig are available to have amendments deposited on them. The Senate can accommodate only two amendments at a time. The chamber must first dispense with those issues, then it gets a new tree. So McConnell filled up both of the available boughs. On one, he set up a vote to end debate on an amendment to renew the bank. On the other offshoot, he arranged a vote to halt debate on an amendment to repeal ObamaCare.\nUnder Senate rules, most votes to end debate on an issue (called invoking cloture) require an intervening day before they ripen. That means the Senate couldn\u2019t conduct the procedural votes on the bank nor health care until Sunday. Both require 60 ayes.\nAnd with that, McConnell had \u201cfilled the tree.\u201d\nFor the record, McConnell and Republicans routinely railed against Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, when he commandeered the floor during the Democrats\u2019 majority -- and often \u201cfilled the tree.\u201d The GOP moaned that Reid had \u201ccut off all amendments\u201d and that Republicans never had a chance to offer their proposals.\n\u201cDid I just hear the legislative tree being filled?\u201d asked Reid sarcastically once McConnell finished his parliamentary pruning, drawing laughter in the chamber.\nBut McConnell explained his gambit in an effort to finish the highway bill in the next few days.\n\u201cPerhaps the most-challenging issue now relates to amendments,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cSupporters of the Ex-Im Bank are demanding a vote to reauthorize it. They\u2019ve made clear they\u2019re ready to stop all other amendments if denied that opportunity. They\u2019ve already proven they have the votes to back up that threat, too.\u201d\nSo McConnell thought it was only fair to allow for two amendments at this stage: one on Ex-Im, which he and other conservatives abhor. But to sate the appetite of the right, he also ordered up an amendment to repeal ObamaCare.\n\u201cIt allows a vote on an amendment to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank, something nearly every Democrat wants,\u201d he explained. \u201cSecond, it allows a vote on an amendment that would repeal ObamaCare, something nearly every Republican wants.\u201d\nHis idea was equity, balancing an item for Democrats -- though Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., is the author of the Ex-Im amendment -- with something for Republicans.\nRewind momentarily to mid-May.\nThe Senate struggled to advance President Obama\u2019s trade package. In the middle of a vote that could have killed the entire trade pact, McConnell huddled with lawmakers who wanted to renew the Ex-Im Bank.\nThe measure didn\u2019t have enough votes to advance. Suddenly Democratic Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, North Dakota; Chris Coons, Delaware; Claire McCaskill, Missouri; Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire, and Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray, both of Washington, sprung from the scrum and voted yes -- salvaging the trade accord for the moment.\n\u201cMitch gave a commitment\u201d to vote on the bank, Murray said later.\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, also signaled there was an agreement on Ex-Im when he spoke to reporters after the trade vote.\nKeep in mind that in December, McConnell and Reid thought they arranged a Friday night agreement to avoid a weekend session on funding the government.\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, later objected, even though McConnell had left for the night, thinking the Senate wouldn\u2019t return until Monday.\nCruz backed Lee\u2019s effort. When the Senate convened on Saturday, McConnell conceded he was surprised that conservative members went behind his back. But in an interview, Cruz asserted there was no agreement in that instance.\nSo back to Cruz on Friday and his argument that McConnell lied to him about engineering a vote on the Export-Import Bank. Cruz invoked scripture and the ternary denial of Jesus.\n\u201cLike St. Peter, he repeated it three times,\u201d thundered Cruz, recounting a conversation he purportedly had with McConnell over the future of the bank. \u201cThe majority leader looked at me and said there is no deal, there is no deal, there is no deal.\u201d\nCruz then ripped McConnell for filling the amendment tree, just like Reid did when he ran the Senate.\n\u201cNow we have the Republican leader behaving like the senator from Nevada,\u201d Cruz said.\nHe also went on to characterize Sunday\u2019s procedural vote on ObamaCare as \u201can exercise in meaningless political theatre\u201d since it requires 60 \u2018yeas\u2019 and the Republicans are short of that threshold.\nCruz noted that the GOP had a chance to actually upend the Affordable Care Act during his filibuster prior to the government shutdown two years ago.\n\u201cThe American people were told, if only we get a Republican majority in the Senate and retire Harry Reid as majority leader, then things will be different,\u201d Cruz continued.\n\u201cThe first thing we did in December is we came back and we passed a $1 trillion \u2018CRomnibus\u2019 plan filled with pork and corporate welfare\u201d Cruz bellowed. Then this Republican majority voted to fund ObamaCare, voted to fund President Obama\u2019s unconstitutional executive amnesty and then the leadership rammed through the confirmation of Loretta Lynch as attorney general.\n\u201cWhich of those decisions would be one iota different if Harry Reid were still majority leader? Not a one. Not a one. This Senate still operates exactly the same.\u201d\nLevying such charges on the Senate floor is not only uncommon but may violate Senate rules.\nSenate rule XIX states that in debate, no senator \u201cshall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another senator or to other senators any conduct or motive unworthy of becoming a senator.\u201d\nFurthermore, the Senate requires another senator to call out Cruz if they felt his language crossed the line. That could prompt a vote to determine whether the speech was appropriate. But no senator raised the issue Friday morning.\nCruz\u2019s decision to lash out at McConnell certainly did violate the GOP\u2019s so-called \u201c11th Commandment.\u201d\nPresident Reagan popularized the precept of \u201cThou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican.\u201d\nThis postulate came after Republican-on-Republican attacks on then-Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater during his 1964 presidential bid.\nSome GOPers had beefs with Reagan himself in his 1966 California gubernatorial bid. Yet it\u2019s ironic that Cruz himself invoked the 11th Commandment twice in recent days.\nAfter Donald Trump made disparaging remarks about the war record of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., Cruz refused to criticize his GOP presidential opponent.\nHe told Bloomberg News he would not \u201cgo into the gutter with personal attacks impugning character.\u201d\nCruz reiterated this in another chat with scribes.\n\u201cI recognize that folks in the press love to see Republican-on-Republican violence and so you want me to say something bad about Donald Trump,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI am not going to do it.\u201d\nBut that didn\u2019t stop Cruz on Friday.\nTrust is a key part of the Senate nomenclature. The majority and minority leaders must forge trust to make the Senate work. Trust and collegiality are coins of the Senate realm.\nThat dictum doesn\u2019t always apply on the campaign trail.\nIn his presidential bid, it\u2019s probably good politics in conservative circles for Cruz to upbraid McConnell on the Senate floor -- even if some won\u2019t view it as sound Senate politics.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "Texas GOP Sen.
