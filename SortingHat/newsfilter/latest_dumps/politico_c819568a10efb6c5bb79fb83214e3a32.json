Chris Christie suggested seven months ago, at the height of the Disneyland measles outbreak, that parents should have \u201ca measure of choice\u201d about whether to vaccinate their children, he was widely condemned \u2014 and quickly reversed himself. \nOn Wednesday, two GOP presidential candidates who are both medical doctors, Ben Carson and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), waded into similar territory. This time, the fury rained down from a medical establishment that felt betrayed by its own. \nWhile personal liberty is an important value, \u201cit\u2019s well-established in our society that we don\u2019t allow you to do things that put others at risk,\u201d said infectious disease specialist Mark Sawyer of the University of California at San Diego. \u201cThat\u2019s where we draw the line.\u201d \nThe notions that vaccines are linked to autism, or should be given in small doses over longer periods of time \u2014 both scientifically discredited \u2014 appear to be seeping into the Republican mainstream, potentially undermining a long consensus around the role of government in protecting populations from disease.\n\nCongress\n\n            By \nBurgess Everett\n\nFor decades, only those on the fringes opposed vaccination, citing reasons such as a contamination of the body, government mind control and, more recently, concerns about autism. The vast majority in both political parties saw campaigns to widely vaccinate children as healthy and wholesome as mother\u2019s milk. \nNow, though, a significant portion of GOP voters are skeptical. An April CBS poll found that only 59 percent of Republican voters thought parents should be legally required to vaccinate their kids. Among Democrats, the percentage was 75 percent. \n\u201cWe\u2019re at a low point of trust in government, especially among Republicans,\u201d said Robert Blendon, a professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a politician like John Kasich doesn\u2019t believe in mandatory vaccination, but because of that anti-government feeling, they aren\u2019t going to leap at a debate and defend it.\u201d\nMany viewers expected a ringing endorsement for vaccines when CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper asked Ben Carson \u2014 a retired pediatric neurosurgeon \u2014 what he thought of Donald Trump\u2019s claim that vaccines cause autism.\nCarson disputed the autism link, but then pulled back and offered what doctors considered a confusing and misleading equivocation. \n\u201cCertain ones\u201d are important, he said. \u201cThere are others, there are a multitude which probably don't fit in that category. \u2026 A lot of this is pushed by Big Government, and I think that's one of the things that people so vehemently want to get rid of, Big Government.\u201d \nA University of Michigan physician who studied under Carson in the late 1980s expressed dismay. \u201cTrump is a buffoon but I respect Dr. Carson, and he should know better,\u201d said Howard Markel. \u201cYou take the Hippocratic Oath, which is to first do no harm.\u201d \nTrump, meanwhile, insisted children were over-vaccinated \u2014 \u201cyou take this little beautiful baby, and you pump \u2014 I mean, it looks just like it's meant for a horse, not for a child.\u201d \nCarson agreed: \u201cIt is true that we are probably giving way too many in too short a period of time.\u201d \nHe went on to say that pediatricians were \u201ccutting down on the number and the proximity in which those are done, and I think that's appropriate.\u201d \nThat statement is false, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Doctors are not changing vaccine schedules because \u201cdelaying vaccines only leaves a child at risk of disease for a longer period,\u201d said Karen Remley, the group\u2019s executive director. \u201cIt does nothing to make vaccines safer.\u201d\n\n2016\n\n            By \nBen Schreckinger\n\nRand Paul, for his part, praised smallpox vaccinations, which eradicated that disease in the 1970s. He claimed \u2014 falsely \u2014 that smallpox vaccination was \u201call done voluntary.\u201d \n\u201cSo I'm all for vaccines,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I'm also for freedom.\u201d\n\u201cWhen they talk about \u2018freedom\u2019 they should finish the sentence,\u201d responded pediatrician Paul Offit of Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cThey mean freedom to allow their children to catch and transmit a fatal infection.\u201d\nIn response to queries Thursday from POLITICO, the Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) campaigns both issued endorsements of mandatory childhood immunization. None of the other candidates responded. \nMany doctors had thought vaccination as a political issue had been put to rest last winter, when the phrase \u201cmeasles in Disneyland\u201d sent terror through parents and led several states to begin tightening their vaccination requirements for school-aged kids.\nAt the time, both Christie and Paul raised doubts about vaccination but retracted their comments under a hail of recrimination.\nBut vaccines didn't go away as a libertarian issue. In June, when California\u2019s Legislature voted to prohibit unvaccinated children from entering school without valid medical justification, 44 Democratic lawmakers but only two Republicans supported the measure. \nMost of the 25 dissenting GOP assembly members said that they had nothing against vaccination in principle, but thought parents had the right to \u201cfreedom\u201d \u2014 even if it endangered the health of their kids and the rest of their community.\nThe current GOP mindset is fueled by anti-establishment attitudes that extend to scientific experts, as well as to the government, Blendon says. \n\u201cThe GOP candidates have such dislike for federal regulation and the way the establishment pushes things, they are saying, \u2018Let parents make some choices,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nTHE POLITICO CAUCUS\n\n            By \n                    Katie Glueck\n\nAlthough it did not come up during the debate, some GOP followers have also opposed vaccination because a few of the formulations \u2014 the measles-mumps-rubella shot, for example \u2014 were originally grown in fetal cells, a fact that potentially ties vaccines to the uproar over Planned Parenthood\u2019s alleged sale of fetal tissue. \nSome Christian conservatives also oppose vaccinating their teenage daughters against the HPV virus because it is sexually transmitted. \nThe anti-vaccine rumble on the right could be just another \u201cblunt tool used to try and beat the current administration,\u201d said vaccine expert Jon Temte of the University of Wisconsin. Republicans vilified the CDC during the Ebola outbreak, he pointed out, although its performance was excellent in retrospect.\nYet even some on the libertarian wing of the party who defend the comments of Carson and Paul say they accept the need for at least some vaccine mandates.\n\u201cOn the science, Trump is in La-La land \u2014 there\u2019s no link between autism and vaccines,\u201d said Michael Tanner, a senior Cato Institute fellow. But \u201cthe question of individual choice I think is a tougher balance. There\u2019s always a slippery slope in terms of how much you impinge on people's choice.\u201d\nStill, \u201cgiven the risk of epidemics, requirements for vaccines are a reasonable position,\u201d he said. \u201cMost libertarians would grumpily accept a vaccine mandate.\u201d \nArthur Allen is eHealth editor at POLITICO.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Physicians blast fellow doctors Carson, Paul for failing to refute autism claim in GOP debate.", "title": "Vaccine phobia infects GOP race", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/vaccines-2016-republicans-213811", "topics": ["terrorism", "campaign_finance", "abortion"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Sara Solovitch", "Burgess Everett", "John Yob", "Kyle Cheney", "Robert Blendon", "Rachael Bade", "Nicholas G.
