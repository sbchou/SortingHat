It\u2019s also a show of force in Iowa where recent polls show Clinton\u2019s favorability numbers dropping, and where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has enjoyed surging popularity \u2014 the single ad buy is almost as large as Sanders\u2019 total campaign spending of $3 million in the first quarter, and more than any top-tier Republican candidate has spent so far on ads.\u201d http://politi.co/1DjNqmm\n\u2014 Watch \u201cDorothy\u201d: https://youtu.be/kNLwH8AEa7Q\n\u2014 Watch \u201cFamily Strong\u201d: https://youtu.be/NdKsA4q-FFA\nSUPER PAC SMACKDOWN \u2014 \u201cGOP Senate super PAC outclasses Dem competitors,\u201d by Campaign Pro\u2019s Theodoric Meyer: \u201cA new Republican super PAC dedicated to helping the GOP hold the Senate next year raised nearly four times as much as its Democratic counterpart, according to Federal Election Commission reports filed on Friday. The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC started by allies of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in January, pulled in more than $4.9 million in the first half of the year. ... Senate Leadership Fund\u2019s haul far outstripped the $1.3 million raised by Senate Majority PAC, the flagship Democratic super PAC with ties to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). Senate Majority PAC had $916,000 in cash on hand on June 30 \u2014 roughly $65,000 less than what the group had in the bank at this point two years ago.\u201d http://politi.co/1KGT1FP\n\u2014 \u201cDemocratic House candidate\u2019s unusual bank loan raises questions,\u201d by Campaign Pro\u2019s Theodoric Meyer: http://politico.pro/1MyNosB\n\nTANGLED LOYALTIES \u2014 \u201cFeud in Florida over Hillary Clinton backer,\u201d by POLITICO Florida\u2019s Marc Caputo: Supporters of Democrat Annette Taddeo, who\u2019s challenging GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a freshman, in Florida\u2019s 26th District, \u201cwant Hillary Clinton to punish a top Hispanic media consultant and fundraiser\u201d who\u2019s endorsed Curbelo. The consultant, Freddy Balsera is a \u201cClinton campaign surrogate who was President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 Hispanic media manager and served as a national finance committee member for both of his presidential campaigns. ... Taddeo\u2019s supporters complained about Balsera\u2019s endorsement to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, where executive director Kelly Ward raised the issue with the office of Clinton\u2019s political director.\u201d http://politi.co/1hdKe1z\nDays until the 2015 election: 91.

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) using a faked image of President Obama shaking hands with the Iranian president? Wonder who was funding it? The group\u2019s Federal Election Commission filing reveals that Richard Uihlein, the chief executive of a Wisconsin freezer company, has provided most of its funding. Uihlein, who gave $300,000, has previously given to FreedomWorks for America and Club for Growth Action super PACs. Peter Huizenga, an investor, chipped in another $10,000.\nODD TURNS \u2014 \u201cAt Fancy Farm, Bevin takes an unusual turn while Conway brings the heat,\u201d by The Lexington Herald-Leader\u2019s Sam Youngman in Fancy Farm, Ky.: \u201cThe annual political picnic here has long been a partisan battle of wits and one-liners, where the politicians trade barbs and laughs and the crowd eggs them on. But apparently nobody told Matt Bevin, the Republican candidate for governor. ... In a sharp departure from the theme of the picnic, Bevin said he was glad to be at the event, which primarily serves as a fundraiser for St. Jerome's Parrish, but said that the people there \u2018literally are celebrating the very worst elements of the political process.\u2019 ... The more Bevin called for unity \u2014 bypassing attempts at humor altogether \u2014 the more the boos from the Democratic side of the pavilion intensified, until the University of Kentucky Wildcats fight song came on and Bevin's microphone cut out, signifying that his allotted time had lapsed.\u201d http://bit.ly/1Szk89R\nIN FOR THE LONG HAUL \u2014 As House Democrats embark on the August recess \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Lauren French reported on their messaging strategy last week (http://politi.co/1SMDLWV) \u2014 they are also playing the long game. According to a DCCC memo, the committee \u201cis working now to conduct a serious and brand new analysis of mid- and long-term demographic and geographic trends, including migration, age and ethnicity\u201d that is designed \u201cto harness that potential in districts that may not yet be competitive for us in 2016.\u201d That effort also includes \u201ca keen focus on data and information sharing for the 2016, 2018, and 2020 elections.\u201d\nPRESIDENTIAL SPEED READ \u2014 \u201cGOP gets ready to rumble,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Eli Stokols: \u201cSince the start of the year, 17 Republicans have announced their intention to run for president. They\u2019ve logged more than a million miles across the early states and held more than 100 town halls between them. Combined, they\u2019ve raised $302 million for their campaigns and accompanying super PACs. But all of that is prologue to this week, when a handful of forums and debates will begin the next stage of the 2016 GOP primary: the winnowing. On Monday night, 14 of the 17 GOP contenders will gather in Manchester, New Hampshire, and take the stage, one at a time, for a candidate forum that will be broadcast live on C-SPAN and in three early states. Then on Thursday, attention shifts to Cleveland, where Fox News Channel will host the big show \u2014 the first prime-time, nationally televised debate featuring the top 10 candidates, determined by an average of recent national polls.\u201d http://politi.co/1KLgEwP\n\u2014 \u201cTrump is cash cow for GOP state parties,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Kyle Cheney, Katie Glueck and Eli Stokols: \u201cDonald Trump sends shudders through the GOP establishment each day he remains atop a volatile presidential pack, but in reality, local Republican parties have courted him and his polarizing brand for years, eagerly slotting him atop prominent party functions and fundraisers \u2014 and happily lapping up the dollars he draws. ... Now, a small, growing handful of Republican state party leaders are calling for a Trump detox, worried that all the easy cash is exponentially outweighed by damage he\u2019s doing to the GOP image. Several party chairs who spoke with POLITICO say they\u2019re leaning more heavily on their colleagues to shun associations with Trump, arguing that inviting him to speak \u2014 even for a quick buck \u2014 sustains his rise.\u201d http://politi.co/1M6mQQo\n\u2014 \u201cBiden considers his future amid pressure to make a bid for president,\u201d by The Washington Post\u2019s Karen Tumulty, Dan Balz and Paul Kane: Speculation that Vice President Joe Biden might yet run for the White House flared up again this weekend after Maureen Dowd\u2019s column in The New York Times reported that Beau Biden had urged his father to run shortly before his death in May. Biden \u201cand his closest advisers have spoken to some of those who have suggested that he run. But there is no indication that he has taken any serious steps toward launching what would be a challenging campaign to deny Hillary Rodham Clinton the Democratic nomination.\u201d http://wapo.st/1OWzwrt\n\u2014 Clinton aides have done nothing publicly to dissuade Biden from running, POLITICO\u2019s Annie Karni reports. \u201cSo far, Biden\u2019s camp has given no signal to Clinton\u2019s campaign in either direction, a source told POLITICO But Clinton supporters said in the unlikely event that Biden did enter the race, he would have a hard time eating away at the support she has built up in the early voting states.\u201d http://politi.co/1LZMZ1F\n\u2014 Meanwhile, Josh Alcorn, a senior adviser to Beau Biden, is joining the Draft Biden super PAC, MSNBC\u2019s Kasie Hunt reports, lending \u201clegitimacy to a group that\u2019s built an email list of 170,000 potential Biden supporters.\u201d \u201cWith Josh\u2019s help, we\u2019ll be able to expand our fundraising to show the VP the country is ready for him to enter the race,\u201d Will Pierce, the super PAC\u2019s executive director, told MSNBC in a statement. http://on.msnbc.com/1IdQm2E\nCODA \u2014 QUOTE OF THE DAY: \"All of these guys are dicks. And Mark can be a dick with the best of them.\" \u2014 An anonymous \u201ctop GOP official\u201d tells National Journal that Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) can still be as dickish as his colleagues, despite the stroke he suffered in. http://bit.ly/1LZxeI3\nBy PAUL GOLDMAN  and  MARK J.
