The group, chaired by Rep. Bill Flores of Texas, is also asking candidates to fill out a \"RSC\u2019s 2015 Republican Leadership Survey\" that asks contenders to outline their opinions on a series of contentious issues facing the GOP caucus.  \nThe survey, which was obtained by POLITICO, asks candidates if they support a continuation of a ban on earmarks, their position on the Export-Import Bank and their vision for House procedures and process. \nAdhering to \"regular order\" has become a major point of contention for conservatives who rebelled against Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio).\n\u201cThe full lunch will be dedicated to this important conversation about how House Republicans can advance the conservative principles embodied in the RSC agenda: growing America\u2019s economy; fixing Washington\u2019s fiscal nightmare; restoring our national security; protecting American values of life, family, marriage, and religious freedom; and restricting the federal government to its constitutionally limited role,\u201d the RSC email says.\nThe Republican Study Committee is a longtime conservative group within the House that includes the majority of the caucus. It was designed to push the conference to the right on policy. Members of the RSC split from the group earlier this year to create the House Freedom Caucus, which has generally adopted a more aggressive posture with Republican leaders.\n HFC members are planning endorsement hearings for the next two weeks.\n The RSC lunch is Oct. 7.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Candidates for speaker, majority leader and majority whip were invited to address the group\u2019s weekly lunch meeting.", "title": "Republican Study Committee invites leadership candidates in for debate", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/the-gavel/2015/09/republican-study-committee-leadership-debates-214209", "topics": ["economy", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Trevor Noah", "Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Kate Tummarello", "Heather Samuelson", "Elena Schneider", "Anna Palmer", "Hadas Gold", "Tim Starks", "Janet Yellen", "Ben Nimmo", "Brian Mahoney", "Jeremy Herb", "Will Perkins", "John Boehner", "Caitlin Emma", "Annie Karni", "Brianna Ehley", "Chris Backemeyer", "Nick Gass", "Trey Gowdy", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Rob Portman", "Jeb Bush", "Seung Min Kim", "Andrew Glass", "Donald Trump", "John Bresnahan", "Bill Flores", "Jake Sherman", "Chase Purdy", "Sarah Wheaton", "Toby Eckert", "David Pittman", "David Baron", "Lauren French", "Rachael Bade", "Al Gore", "Adam Behsudi", "Daniel Strauss", "Vince Chadwick", "Hillary Clinton", "Ben White", "Eli Stokols", "Lauren Dezinski", "Darren Samuelsohn", "Eric Wolff", "Jason Chaffetz", "Nehisi Coates", "Tom Brady"], "orgs": ["House Benghazi Committee", "Congress", "Senate", "State Department", "House Republicans", "NEA", "SCHUMER", "House GOP", "Taliban", "Benghazi Committee", "TPP", "FAA", "GOP", "House Freedom Caucus", "Republican Study Committee"], "authors": [{"author_id": 31395, "fullname": "anna palmer", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-09-29 16:39:32", "org": "politico", "article_id": "0aae7bbc6685a6a8cbac19cb7029c819", "date_access": "2015-09-29 16:00:04.876227"}
