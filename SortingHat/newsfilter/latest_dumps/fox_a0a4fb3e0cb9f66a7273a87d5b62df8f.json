In turn, that authority could help expedite two deals: the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.\n\nThe former, known as the TPP, is a significant deal with 11 Pacific Rim nations, and one Clinton supported while secretary of state.\n\nBut Clinton\u2019s camp is now leaving the door open. Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said Clinton wants the final legislation to benefit American workers and she has concerns about such issues as currency manipulation and the impact on national security.\n\n\u201cWe should be willing to walk away from any outcome that falls short of these tests,\u201d Merrill said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cThe goal is greater prosperity and security for American families, not trade for trade\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\nBut Clinton\u2019s fuzzy position on the new legislation has resulted in an array of critics -- from conservative PACs to potential primary challenger former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley -- suggesting she\u2019s staying mum to gauge the political winds.\n\nThey argue Clinton has already changed her positions on gay marriage and immigration reform, and coming out against the trade deal would be a clear reversal just days into her fledgling White House campaign.\n\n\u201cShe will soon have to decide whether she will continue standing with the sitting Democratic president on trade, or whether she will flip flop and join the union activists who are vehemently opposed to this bipartisan deal,\" said Jeff Bechdel, spokesman for the conservative America Rising PAC.\n\nFrom Clinton\u2019s left flank, Democrats have needled her on the issue.\n\nSanders called on Clinton to \u201cmake it clear\u201d that TPP should be rejected.\n\nO\u2019Malley also sent out an email blasting the Trade Promotion Authority bill, claiming it would give Congress the power to immediately vote on the TPP.\n\n\u201cWe must stop entering into bad trade deals that hurt middle class wages and ship middle class jobs overseas,\u201d O\u2019Malley said in the message.\n\nLast week, O\u2019Malley during a speech at the Institute of Politics at Harvard needled Clinton over other recent positions.\n\n\"I'm glad Secretary Clinton's come around to the right positions on these issues,\" O'Malley said, after Clinton expressed support for giving drivers\u2019 licenses to illegal immigrants and urged the Supreme Court to rule that gay marriage is constitutional.\n\n\"I believe that we are best as a party when we lead with our principles and not according to the polls,\u201d O\u2019Malley continued. \"Leadership is about making the right decision and the best decision before sometimes it becomes entirely popular.\u201d\n\nWarren, while denying any interest in a White House run, has been particularly critical of a clause in the new trade bill for disputed trade deals, saying it could tilt \u201cthe playing field further in favor of multi-national corporations\u201d and would force American taxpayers to \u201ccough up millions even billions of dollars in damages.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the White House defended Clinton, saying all observers should reserve judgment for now.\n\n\u201cShe is going to make up her own mind about what policy positions that she\u2019ll take,\u201d White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. \u201cAfter all, TPP is something that\u2019s still being negotiated. She, as we\u2019re encouraging everybody to do, is going to withhold judgment.\u201d\n\nThe legislation, which is scheduled for a vote Wednesday in the Senate Finance Committee, was hammered out by Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the panel\u2019s top Democrat, along with House Ways and Means Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell last week said he would bring the TPA legislation to the floor \u201cvery soon\u201d -- a good indication that the bill has enough bipartisan support in the GOP-led chamber to pass.\n\nHatch\u2019s office points to World Bank data that finds the two pending trade agreements would further open markets to encompass nearly 1.3 billion customers and about 60 percent of global gross domestic product.\n\n\u201cThis bipartisan bill creates what\u00a0I\u00a0expect to be unprecedented transparency in trade negotiations, and ensures future trade deals break new ground to promote human rights, improve labor conditions, and safeguard the environment,\u201d Wyden said last week after reaching the bipartisan deal.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "Hillary Clinton is hedging on whether she will\u00a0back a bipartisan trade agreement gaining steam on Capitol Hill, fueling accusations that she\u2019s playing politics as she courts liberal voters.", "title": "Clinton hedges on hot-button trade deal, amid pressure from left", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/nGkZMZKNj4M/", "topics": ["trade"], "people": ["Josh Earnest", "Paul Ryan", "Martin O'Malley", "Nick Merrill", "Hillary Clinton", "Elizabeth Warren", "Jeff Bechdel", "Martha Coakley", "Bernie Sanders", "Orrin Hatch", "Ron Wyden"], "orgs": ["TPA", "Congress", "PACs", "Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership", "Trade Promotion Authority", "Supreme Court", "Senate Finance Committee", "Institute of Politics", "Senate", "TPP", "America Rising PAC", "World Bank", "GOP"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-04-21 08:15:23", "org": "fox", "article_id": "a0a4fb3e0cb9f66a7273a87d5b62df8f", "date_access": "2015-04-21 10:00:07.552244"}
