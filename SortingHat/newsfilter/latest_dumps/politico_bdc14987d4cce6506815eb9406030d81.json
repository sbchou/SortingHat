When will those rules come? Rumor has it it\u2019ll come today, if not later this week. With fewer than 90 days left in the calendar year, providers are wondering whether the late release will affect their ability to meet meaningful use standards in 2015 under the 90-day period CMS promised. \nStory Continued Below\n\u2014 CMS hints that something will drop during National Health IT Week, which kicks off today. The agency said, \u201cCMS will share guidance throughout the week to help providers and industry members successfully participate in ongoing CMS health IT initiatives.\u201d We'll see if that includes meaningful use. In the meantime, there\u2019s a slew of events this week. Details below. \nCISA DELAY IS LIKELY, BUT THE FIGHT CONTINUES \u2014 The latest intel from on and off the Hill suggests that the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act probably isn\u2019t going to the Senate floor this week and isn\u2019t likely to return until at least Oct. 19. Once again, the bill is a victim of the Senate calendar and items that have leaped ahead of it in line, this time the annual defense authorization bill. There\u2019s still a solid chance the bill will come to the floor this month, notably because it\u2019s National Cybersecurity Awareness Month and Congress likes passing cybersecurity bills timed to the occasion. The bill is supported by HIMSS, CHIME, HITRUST and the Federation of American Hospitals. \neHealth tweet of the day: @jayhancock1: Cute. What is the ICD-10 code for injury sustained while entering ICD-10 codes? From http://bit.ly/1jJwoFf\nWelcome to Monday morning eHealth where, as much rain as we\u2019ve received in Washington the last few days, we\u2019re grateful not to be in the parts of South Carolina where TWO FEET fell this weekend (http://wapo.st/1PTdciw).

For starters, the 18 health information exchange initiatives the congressional watchdog interviewed for the report did not make up a random sample, Jacob Reider, former deputy national coordinator, told Morning eHealth. \u201cMany very successful organizations are quietly succeeding \u2014 and in fact it is because they are quietly successful that we've never heard of them,\u201d he said. \u201cThis report is little more than an interesting collection of anecdotes. Nothing more. Certainly not worthy of the headlines that it's generated.\u201d \n\u2014 Arien Malec, vice president at RelayHealth, likened the report to a high school research paper; it didn\u2019t get specific enough on issues. He was disappointed that the GAO didn\u2019t focus more on patient as the vehicle to sharing records between providers.\nEXITS, LIKE FUNDING, PICKING UP PACE: The digital health pipeline is flowing; as is well-documented, venture capitalists are funding the sector aggressively. And it seems the results they'd like to see \u2014 initial public offerings on the stock market, or acquisitions \u2014 are increasing, per a blog post from research company CB Insights. That means the prominence of the sector should remain elevated. \nHELP, HELP, WITH DECERTIFIED EHRS: Ten health IT-focused organizations wrote the Senate HELP Committee Friday to offer their thoughts on decertification as lawmakers ponder the issue. They argue that legislation should create a hardship exemption for providers whose EHRs are decertified by ONC. A \"hardship fund\" should also be created to help providers switch EHRs when their original system is decertified. \"Vendors should provide all the data, not just a summary of a patient's medical record, when a provider transitions to a new product regardless of whether the product is decertified,\" the letter states. \"Vendors should also be held accountable for translating the data into a usable format.\" The letter signed by Health IT Now, athenahealth, Samsung, Oracle and others: http://politico.pro/1PYdIvz \nSENATORS LIKING FSMB COMPACT: Thirteen senators wrote the Federation of State Medical Boards applauding its efforts to implement an interstate licensing compact. The compact is seen as a way to facilitate licensing in multiple states and expand the reach of telemedicine. \u201cIn the coming months, we encourage you to continue to work with your member medical boards and states to consider participation in the compact, which will simultaneously facilitate multi-state practice while ensuring states\u2019 ability to regulate medicine and ensure patient safety,\u201d the letter stated. It was signed by Sens. John Barrasso of Wyoming, John Thune of South Dakota and others.
