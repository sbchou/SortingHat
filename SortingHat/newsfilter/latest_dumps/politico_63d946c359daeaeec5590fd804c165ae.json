Jerry Brown\u2019s decision on Monday to sign a \u201cright to die\u201d bill into law could carry outsized influence in the country because of the state\u2019s sheer size, say supporters of the measure. Advocates hope California will spur other states to approve similar bills so terminally ill patients can choose to receive life-ending medication from a doctor. \u201cThis is the biggest victory for the death-with-dignity movement since Oregon passed the nation\u2019s first law two decades ago,\u201d said Compassion & Choices President Barbara Coombs Lee, which lobbied heavily for the California legislation. \u201cEnactment of this law in California means we are providing this option to more than 1 in 10 Americans.\u201d Pro's Rachana Pradhan has the full story.\nStory Continued Below\n\u2014 But while the death last year of 29-year-old Brittany Maynard helped renew momentum for the effort in California, physician-assisted suicide is still encountering strong resistance elsewhere. According to the Death with Dignity National Center, which advocates for such laws, 25 state legislatures and the District of Columbia considered \u201cright to die\u201d bills during the 2015 legislative session, but only California\u2019s took hold this year. California is now the fifth state to authorize the practice, joining Oregon, Montana, Vermont and Washington.\nHAPPY TUESDAY and welcome to PULSE, where we are giving a belated shout out to Nobel Prize winner Youyou Tu for her work on the malaria parasite \u2014 work that's enabled your PULSEr's baby brother, who's in the middle of NIH fellowship focused on malarial transmission in primates.

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch is already saying he'll have a hard time supporting a deal without a dozen years of protection for the drugs \u2014 despite wins he got on currency provisions. The winner in all the kerfuffle? The Generic Pharmaceutical Association, which is pleased as punch that negotiators secured \"trade provisions that facilitate both the development of innovative, life-saving medicines and the availability of affordable generic medicines.\" Another big loser was Big Tobacco, which was prevented from challenging other member countries' tobacco control measures.

The report will analyze how CHIP plans stack up against exchange plans, and the lawmakers point out that it's now all the more pressing, since states were allowed to start enrolling CHIP kids in exchange plans as of Sept. 30. The lawmakers are giving HHS two weeks to update them on the status of the report.

Ed Markey is also calling it \"historic.\" Advocates hope it will transform the perception and understanding of substance abuse the way the 1964 Surgeon General's report on smoking launched the public health war against tobacco.\n** A message from the American College of Rheumatology: More than 63 million Americans are living with doctor-diagnosed arthritis, autoimmune diseases or inflammatory rheumatic diseases, and are at risk for chronic pain, disability and even death.

Patients who used nursing home care or home health care were much more likely to switch away from Medicare Advantage than the other way around \u2014 and this effect was magnified among the dual eligible population, the researchers from Brown and Vanderbilt universities found. \"Our findings raise questions about the role of Medicare Advantage plans in serving high-cost patients with complex care needs, who account for a disproportionately high amount of total health care spending,\" they wrote.

But lesbian, gay and bisexual adults still face greater challenges accessing and affording care, according to another Health Affairs study. Though, researchers said the Supreme Court\u2019s gay marriage decision this year could open access to coverage by employers, Medicaid, Medicare and the VA, and marriage equality could also reduce social stigma, improve discrimination rates and even improve physical and mental health for gay adults, they write.
