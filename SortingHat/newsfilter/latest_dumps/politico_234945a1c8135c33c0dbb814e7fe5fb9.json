{"body": "Campaigns\nThe latest POLITICO scoops and coverage of the 2016 elections.\nBy Jonathan Topaz\n6/17/15 8:04 PM EDT\nBy Jonathan Topaz\nTHE CLOCK: 510 days until Election Day 2016...\nStory Continued Below\nBERNIE CLOSES IN ON CLINTON: POLITICO\u2019s Jonathan Topaz and Glenn Thrush report: HILLARY CLINTON and her staff have always said they wanted a competitive primary. Now maybe they have one.\u00a0Clinton faces a growing threat from BERNIE SANDERS in the once-safe haven of New Hampshire, but her campaign has no intention of attacking or even name-checking the white-tufted democratic socialist \u2014 yet.\u00a0\nTwo polls this week showed the Vermont Independent polling over 30 percent in his neighboring New England state, just 10-12 percentage points behind frontrunner Clinton \u2014 a big leap from his 15-18 point showing in various polls in recent weeks.\u00a0\nTo some Sanders advisers, it\u2019s no surprise that the senator would be pulling in close to a third of the Democratic vote. Senior adviser Mark Longabaugh argued that Clinton\u2019s appeal as the establishment candidate wouldn\u2019t wash in insurgent-loving New Hampshire. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a small state and you can reach and touch every voter, I think that establishment support for Clinton in New Hampshire is much less significant for her there than in other places,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why insurgents have always had an ability to emerge there, because there isn\u2019t any kind of machine or organizational barrier.\u201d\u00a0Thus far, Clinton has refused to acknowledge Sanders by name in her speeches \u2014 or even during a press conference in Concord earlier this week.\u00a0 Read more at POLITICO http://politi.co/1HV5Fyw\nGood Wednesday afternoon, and welcome to The 2016 BLAST. Your guide for the campaign is Jonathan Topaz (@JonathanTopaz). Send tips, ideas and gripes to jtopaz@politico.com.\nThe 2016 field was hard at work on the campaign trail today. HILLARY CLINTON was in South Carolina, where she was overshadowed by BERNIE SANDERS. JEB BUSH made a rare visit to Iowa, while JOHN KASICH and DONALD TRUMP were in New Hampshire. And guess who\u2019s running strongest against Clinton in some crucial swing state match-ups? MARCO RUBIO.\nTRAIL MIX: A look at what's popping on the campaign trail\nTHE DAILY CLINTON\nHILLARY CLINTON was in South Carolina today to introduce a new plan to give businesses tax credits for hiring apprentices \u2014 a proposal aimed at combating high youth unemployment. Not that anyone\u2019s counting, but the new plan comes after BERNIE SANDERS unveiled his own youth jobs bill, which proposes $5.5 billion in new funding for states and local governments who employ young citizens.\nOVERSHADOWED: POLITICO\u2019s Gabriel Debenedetti reports from South Carolina: \u201c[HILLARY] CLINTON\u2019s Wednesday stop in the first-in-the-South primary state is exposing her to an unwelcome dose of Bernie-mentum, giving the Democratic front-runner a first-hand look at the grass-roots fervor Sanders is generating on the left. Over the weekend, the state chapter of the AFL-CIO jumped the gun and effectively backed the Vermont senator\u2019s candidacy before being forced to walk back its message. Last night, on the eve of Clinton\u2019s arrival, Sanders\u2019 campaign said it had to change the venue for his upcoming swing through Charleston due to overwhelming local interest.\u201d http://politi.co/1JV1VPg\nWELCOME WAGON: The front page of The State in South Carolina: \u201cClinton must make case to S.C. women\u201d bit.ly/1d1sNOT\nBIG PICTURE: Tom Edsall in The New York Times: \u201cHILLARY RODHAM CLINTON\u2019s presidential campaign is based on the assumption that voters are angrier at the rich than they are at the poor. Her strategy poses a dilemma for Democrats, who are\u00a0arguing among themselves\u00a0about whether targeting the rich is an approach that will work.\u201d nyti.ms/1KYS1Ly\nSID VICIOUS UPDATE: POLITICO\u2019s Kenneth P. Vogel and Rachael Bade report: \u201cRepublican members of a special congressional committee spent hours on Tuesday grilling Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal about the inner workings of the Clinton\u2019s philanthropic and political operations, going well beyond the 2012 Benghazi attacks that the committee is charged with investigating, according to sources familiar with the hearing. A particular focus during Tuesday\u2019s closed-door deposition was a network of groups founded by Clinton enforcer David Brock that \u2014 POLITICO has learned \u2014 paid Blumenthal more than $10,000 a month as they defended HILLARY CLINTON against conservative attacks, first while she was Secretary of State and then as she prepared for and ultimately entered the presidential campaign.\u201d politi.co/1fi3LNg\nTHE PROGRESSIVE RESISTANCE\nO\u2019MALLEY\u2019S NH DIGS: MARTIN O\u2019MALLEY opened up his first Granite State office today in Manchester, his campaign said in a release.\nBERNIE\u2019S BLIND SPOT: NBC News on how HILLARY CLINTON is doing far better than BERNIE SANDERS with non-white voters. \u201c[A] divide has emerged that favors Clinton: white versus non-white Democrats. In a new Washington Post/ABC News survey, 56 percent of white Democrats backed Clinton, while 14 percent supported Sanders. Among self-described liberals, Sanders had 17 percent support, compared to 63 percent for Clinton. (Vice President Biden, who has given no indication he will run, polled in double-digits among both groups.) But among non-white Democrats (the survey did not break them down by ethnicity), Clinton had 72 percent support, compared to 5 percent for the Vermont senator.\u201d nbcnews.to/1JVpI1l\nJEB IN IOWA\nJEB BUSH was in Iowa today for two events \u2014 a morning meet-and-greet at a private home in Washington and an early evening town hall in Pella. It was his first trip as a declared candidate in the early state \u2014 one that he has rarely visited and is struggling in the polls with its more conservative electorate.\u201d\nJEB\u2019S KILLER ANGELS: Buzzfeed: \u201cThe super PAC tied to \u2026 JEB BUSH has raised $17 million so far in the New York-area alone, according to a conference call between the super PAC officials and donors on Wednesday. Mike Murphy, the longtime Jeb Bush confidant and consultant who is heading the Right to Rise super PAC, told a group of donors on a conference call Wednesday that they had so far raised $17 million in the Tri-State area to support Bush\u2019s campaign for the presidency. Telling the donors on the call they were \u2018killers\u2019 who he was going to \u2018set loose,\u2019 Murphy said the number the SuperPAC would be filing by the next July reporting deadline would give opponents \u2018heart attacks\u2019 and discourage their rivals\u2019 donors from opening their wallets.\u201d http://bzfd.it/1BowKsz\nMEH: Ahead of his visit, the JEB BUSH campaign announced more than 15 endorsements from Iowa Republicans, including 2014 Senate candidate Mark Jacobs, top Cedar Rapids activist Joni Scotter and Iowa state Sen. Charles Schneider.\nMAILING IT IN: AP: \u201cJEB BUSH\u00a0boasts blue chip donors, some of the best advisers in the campaign business and, of course, a famous political name. But when it comes to first-to-vote Iowa, he's practically starting from scratch \u2026 he has just three employees and has made only two visits this year. That's far less time and resources than most of his rivals for the GOP nomination have invested in Iowa.\nCOURTESY DODGE: \u201cAsked this week if Bush was spending enough time in Iowa, Republican Gov.\u00a0Terry Branstad\u00a0\u2014 a cheerleader for Iowa's outsized political influence \u2014 was telling in his answer. He spoke about someone else. \u2018I would certainly compliment Gov. [RICK] PERRY.\u2019\u201d abcn.ws/1LfEO2f\nROOM FOR RIVALS: POLITICO\u2019s Katie Glueck and Kyle Cheney report: \u201cDespite the prodigious fundraising, the widespread name recognition and the substantive executive experience, it\u2019s becoming increasingly obvious: for all JEB BUSH\u2019s assets as a presidential candidate, establishment Republicans aren\u2019t yet on board \u2026 party luminaries say the combination of unshackled political giving, Bush\u2019s own stumbles and GOP desperation to take back the White House has led to a surprisingly unsettled field and a wait-and-see attitude among Republicans.\u201d politi.co/1GOEqot\nTRUMP ON THE STUMP\nINTERNATIONAL INCIDENT: Forbes: \u201cThe government of Mexico and a number of Latino leaders wasted no time in lashing out against billionaire DONALD TRUMP\u2018s accusation that Mexico is sending drugs, criminals and rapists to the U.S. and his promise to build a \u2018great, great wall\u2019 on the U.S.-Mexico border. After Trump entered the Presidential race on Tuesday with a 45-minute kick-off at the Trump Tower in New York City, Mexico\u2019s Minister of Government Miguel \u00c1ngel Osorio Chong called his diatribe against Mexico \u2018biased and absurd.\u2019 http://onforb.es/1fi35HL\nCELEBRITY APPRENTICE:\u00a0 US Weekly: \u201cCher\u00a0may believe in life after love, but one thing she isn't banking on is\u00a0DONALD TRUMP's political future. The iconic performer, 69,\u00a0took to Twitter\u00a0on Tuesday, June 16, to rant against Trump, also 69, and his recent decision to run for President in the 2016 election.\u00a0\u2018Donald Trump can't come up with a hairstyle that looks human, how can he come up with a plan to defeat ISIS,\u2019 the Grammy winner wrote, addressing\u00a0Trump's announcement on Tuesday\u00a0that he was adding his name to the laundry list of political hopefuls vying for the GOP nomination.\u201d http://usm.ag/1dL6NbE\nWELCOME TO THE SHOW:\nFactCheck.org: \u201cTrump Tramples Facts\u201d http://bit.ly/1IPGD2j\nNPR: \u201cThe Problem With Donald Trump's One-Page Summary On His Wealth\u201d http://n.pr/1Ilouqp\nSURVEYING THE 2016 LANDSCAPE\nDEBATE PRESSURE: Union Leader: Another top New Hampshire Republican asks the Republican National Committee and Fox News to change its debate criteria \u2014 Sen. Kelly Ayotte. bit.ly/1d1rkIl\nHUNTSMAN\u2019S CLIMATE COUNSEL: POLITICO\u2019s Ben Schreckinger reports: Former Utah governor and 2012 Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman has been privately advising Republican presidential campaigns that they can\u2019t duck climate change, he said today at a luncheon for the centrist group No Labels: \u201cThey don\u2019t want to touch this one, but I told a couple of the campaigns, \u2018This is an issue you\u2019re going to have to talk about at some point. You can\u2019t hide. You can\u2019t fudge. You can\u2019t obfuscate. People care too deeply in different parts of the country and particularly among the millennials, who will be a big turnout group, you\u2019re going to have to talk about it, and when you talk about it don\u2019t sound like a whack job. Let facts, and let science guide you.\u2019\u201d\nNEW SWING-STATE POLL: A new Quinnipiac poll out today shows MARCO RUBIO running strongest against HILLARY CLINTON in three key swing states \u2014 Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania. The poll is a bit of a blow for RAND PAUL, whose campaign has made the case for months that he\u2019s running strongest against the Democratic front-runner. bit.ly/1BkcuZc\nCHRISTIE\u2019S PENSION HEADACHE: NJ.com: \u201cCHRIS CHRISTIE\u2019s controversial pension reform plan could cost New Jersey school districts hundreds of millions of dollars each year, according to a new report commissioned by school and municipal lobbyists, but those who crafted the governor's plan have said those costs would be offset by reducing public employee health benefits.\u201d bit.ly/1J4pMMa\nGLAD THAT\u2019S FIXED: The Wall Street Journal reports that the FEC has cracked down on CARLY FIORINA\u2019s super PAC, initially called \u201cCarly for America,\u201d because it uses the candidate\u2019s name in the title. The committee has now changed its name to Conservative, Authentic, Responsive Leadership for You and for America \u2014 CARLY for America, for short. on.wsj.com/1GeZxLT\nHEADSCRATCHER: Vanity Fair on LINDSEY GRAHAM: \u201cThe Republican\u2019s Don Draper.\u201d vnty.fr/1JTVGv0\n\u00a0\nNEXT NEWS CYCLE\nHILLARY CLINTON has two events in Nevada tomorrow \u2014 a speech at the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointment Officials conference in Las Vegas and a veterans roundtable in Reno.\nENJOY THE WEATHER: From the Las Vegas Review Journal: \u201cIt\u2019s probably going to be 111 degrees all weekend\u201d http://bit.ly/1dL8hmr\nJEB BUSH will hold a veterans town hall meeting in Charleston, South Carolina, tomorrow morning, a day after Clinton\u2019s visit to the state.\nD.C.
