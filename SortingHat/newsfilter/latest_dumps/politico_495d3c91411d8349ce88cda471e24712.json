{"body": "Getty\nWith Donald Trump tossing incendiary rhetoric on the campaign trail, Republicans promise tough enforcement legislation this fall.\nBy Seung Min Kim\n7/23/15 7:04 PM EDT\nAs Donald Trump rides a stridently anti-immigration message to the top of GOP presidential polls, House Republicans are rushing to reopen the immigration debate with legislation that would crack down on so-called \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d the hundreds of localities that give safe harbor to those here illegally.\nIt\u2019s the first sign that the furor stoked by Trump \u2014 after the shooting death of a woman allegedly by an undocumented immigrant \u2014 and his oft-ridiculed campaign is having a ripple effect off the trail. And Democrats are seizing the moment to try and brand the GOP as in the thrall of the real estate mogul \u2014 trumpeting a sanctuary cities bill passed by the House Thursday as the \u201cDonald Trump Act.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\nUndeterred, Republicans pressed forward on legislation that would block funding for sanctuary cities \u2014 where local law enforcement shields undocumented immigrants from federal directives \u2014 as an opening salvo in a broader immigration fight. GOP leaders have promised the rank-and-file that more enforcement legislation is coming, though they haven\u2019t picked specific bills.\nStill, while Thursday\u2019s bill \u2014 which passed the House 241-179 \u2014 was narrowly focused and won broad support from Republicans, some GOP lawmakers warned against pursuing an enforcement-only path.\nAlso on POLITICO\nADAM B. LERNER\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it helps us politically to deal simply with enforcement,\u201d said Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), a leading moderate in his party. \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna be able to claim that we\u2019ve fixed the \u2026 illegal immigration problem by simply dealing with a border security bill or an interior enforcement bill.\u201d\nThough they resisted immigration reform for much of the last two years, House Republicans are responding to the national outcry over sanctuary cities after the shooting death of Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco \u2014 allegedly at the hands of an immigrant here illegally who was released by local authorities, even though the feds had asked him to be detained. Trump\u2019s surge, they say, is an illustration of the same rising tide of public concern.\n\u201cThe appetite for amnesty has diminished dramatically after we see the carnage in the streets of America at the hands of criminal aliens that should\u2019ve been removed from the country,\u201d said Rep. Steve King of Iowa, a leading hardliner. \u201cThat means that now, the climate is much better to try to move down the line on enforcement.\u201d\nBut pushing forward on an enforcement-focused strategy could trigger a political backlash and risk further alienating minorities \u2014 who voted in droves against the Republican Party in the last presidential election \u2014 ahead of the 2016 race. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has already seized on previous immigration votes from Hill Republicans \u2014 a clear attempt to replicate, if not broaden, the margin of Latino voters who voted against Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\u201cHe let himself get painted as the anti-immigrant candidate,\u201d said Jeremy Robbins, the executive director of the Partnership for a New American Economy, said of Romney. \u201cAnd when Dems started hammering home on that, he won 27 percent of the Hispanic vote.\u201d\nRepublicans on both ends of the Capitol are still rolling out legislation in response to Steinle\u2019s death. For instance, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a member of the Gang of Eight that wrote the Senate\u2019s immigration bill in 2013, unveiled legislation Thursday that would create a notification system between federal and local law enforcement to be used when immigrants here illegally with criminal records are released from custody.\nAlso on POLITICO\nBEN SCHRECKINGER\nKing \u2014 who also wields influence as a Republican politician in Iowa, which holds the nation\u2019s first presidential nominating contest \u2014 is shopping around a bill that would ban all federal aid to sanctuary cities, force localities to comply with federal immigration requests and mandate other tough enforcement measures.\nMeanwhile, the GOP has significant ground to recover among Hispanic voters from the last cycle. According to an analysis from the polling firm Latino Decisions released last week, the Republican nominee would have to secure 47 percent of the national Latino vote to win the popular vote. That would amount to a 20 percent increase from Romney\u2019s performance in 2012, according to exit polls.\nSensing an opening, Democrats made an aggressive push this week to tie congressional Republicans to the fiery Trump, who has drawn considerable criticism since his controversial remarks about Mexican immigrants.\n\u201cJust a few weeks into his campaign and Donald Trump has a bill on the floor of the House,\u201d said Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) during the floor debate Thursday. \u201cThat is better than some of the senators he is running against.\u201d\nStill, the national scrutiny over Steinle\u2019s July 1 death has also put Democrats on the defensive.\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a former San Francisco mayor, has drawn fire from immigration advocates for drafting legislation that would require cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration officials \u2014 particularly if the case involves an undocumented immigrant with a criminal background. And six Democrats supported the House GOP bill Thursday: Reps. Ami Bera of California, Jim Cooper of Tennessee, Henry Cuellar of Texas, Bill Keating of Massachusetts, Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Krysten Sinema of Arizona.\nIt even drew support from GOP lawmakers who\u2019ve long been for immigration reform.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have drafted this,\u201d said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) of the sanctuary city legislation the House passed Thursday. But \u201ca couple of things I\u2019ve always insisted on. One is, zero tolerance to serious criminals. And the second thing is to adhere to the law, to the rule of law.\u201d\nCalifornia Rep. Jeff Denham, another GOP lawmaker who has bucked his party on immigration reform, said flatly: \u201cI\u2019m against sanctuary cities.\u201d\n\u201cI think each of our cities needs to follow federal law,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this is a difficult vote for many of us because it doesn\u2019t address the core problem, but it is a step in the right direction.\u201d\nBoth King and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), whose panel oversees immigration policy, said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has promised more action on enforcement legislation in the future.\nDepending on what that legislation looks like, it could draw more internal Republican opposition \u2014 particularly from the handful of GOP lawmakers who opposed Thursday\u2019s bill written by Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.).\nAlso on POLITICO\nELI STOKOLS\n\u201cHad it been the law of the land before this terrible crime, it would not have prevented it,\u201d said Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a Republican from swing district in southern Florida who voted against the sanctuary cities bill. \u201cThis is an exercise. This is not a solution. This may generate a headline, but it\u2019s not gonna solve a problem.\u201d\nRep. Bob Dold (R-Ill.), who represents the Chicago suburbs and is a top target of Democrats, said he opposed the bill because it was counterproductive to punish local law enforcement officials by withholding federal funding from them.\nOther Republicans who voted against the sanctuary cities legislation included New York Reps. Dan Donovan \u2014 the former Staten Island district attorney \u2014 and Peter King, as well as Washington Rep. Dave Reichert, a former King County sheriff.\nEven as tougher immigration bills gain traction in Congress, these Republicans and others are likely to push for a middle ground. For instance, Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.) said he has pressed McCarthy and Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) about having more votes to overhaul immigration laws, not just to crack down on enforcement.\nHe voted for the sanctuary cities bill on Thursday, but has split from his party on other immigration issues. For instance, he backed a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act earlier this year that would have opened the door to allowing young undocumented immigrants to serve in the military.\nThat May vote prompted criticism from Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve now taken a number of votes this year that are more on the law-and-order side,\u201d MacArthur said. \u201cWe also need to discuss the compassion side.\u201d\nBy JEFF GREENFIELD \nBy DANIEL J.
