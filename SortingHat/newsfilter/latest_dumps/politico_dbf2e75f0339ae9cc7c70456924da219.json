The full list: http://politi.co/1MFPpnt\nHILLARY CLINTON has $33 million in the bank most of anyone in the race: http://1.usa.gov/1Lnup0c\nStory Continued Below\nTHE CLINTON MACHINE \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Shane Goldmacher: \u201cRepublican and Democratic presidential candidates hauled in an enormous $144 million in the third quarter of 2015 but the vast majority of the money flowed into only a handful of campaigns, leaving the 2016 race distinctively stratified into the haves, the have-notes and the hopeless.\n\u201cHillary Clinton paced both parties, ending September with $33 million in the bank. But her chief challenger, Bernie Sanders, was close behind with $27.1 million on hand, and he touted raising another $3.2 million since this week\u2019s debate. No other Democrat had as much as $1 million in their coffers.\u201d http://politi.co/1G8HE8s\nDEMS LEADING MONEY RACE \u2014 WP\u2019s Matea Gold, Philip Rucker and Anu Narayanswamy: \u201cThe Democratic presidential contenders dramatically outpaced their Republican counterparts in the race for campaign cash last quarter, spotlighting how the parties are taking divergent paths in their pursuit of 2016 funding. \u2026 The emphasis by \u2026 Clinton and Bernie Sanders on raising money directly for their campaigns has helped them amass large donor pools that will be critical to generate the estimated $1 billion that each party\u2019s candidate will need to raise by Election Day.\n\u201cWhile GOP candidates put an intense focus early in the year on raising huge sums for independent groups, many have had less success in attracting smaller donations that are the lifeblood of campaign operations, campaign finance reports filed Thursday show. The risk of the big-money approach was underscored by the modest $13.4 million raised over the summer by former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who earlier this year was expected to be a financial powerhouse.\u201d http://wapo.st/1Pwlqzb\nTHE CONSERVATIVE CASE ON THE DEBT LIMIT \u2014 Heritage Action\u2019s Dan Holler emails: \u201cAt this point, John Boehner is essentially a rogue agent beholden to no one \u2014 especially the conservatives that delivered him the gavel in 2011. Any debt limit negotiations should include a new speaker, and given the latest CBO estimate there is no urgency to act before October 29.\u201d\nHRC ON BIG BANKS, TAKE II \u2014 Graham Fisher\u2019s Josh Rosner emails on Thursday\u2019s M.M. item from an industry veteran defending Hillary Clinton\u2019s focus on shadow banks: \u201cYour veteran's comments are inaccurate and miss the larger point. All of the activities of the shadow banks, during the lead-up to the crisis, could have been regulated, through the Fed, OCC or OTS given that the activities were each tied to their regulated institutions. \n\u201cFirst, the aggressive leveraging of bank balance sheets, the creation of faulty MBS & CDO products, the failing to respect the representations and warranties on those products, the selling those products to investors globally, the failure to assess counterparty risk, the improper servicing of loans and pushing the rating agencies to loosen their modeling of CDOs were all direct actions by regulated financial institutions and not only shadow banks.\u201d\nBUDGET DEFICIT FALLS \u2014 Per Treasury: \u201cThe deficit in FY 2015 fell to $439 billion, $44 billion less than the FY 2014 deficit and $144 billion less than forecast in President Obama\u2019s FY 2016 Budget. As a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the deficit fell to 2.5 percent, the lowest since 2007 and less than the average of the last 40 years. In dollar terms, the FY 2015 deficit was the lowest since 2007 as well.\u201d \nRUNNING ON EMPTY \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Rebecaa Ballhaus: \u201cThe 2016 presidential candidates in both parties are burning through their cash about 25% faster than in prior elections, despite the expanded role of super PACs that have collectively raised hundreds of millions of dollars to back their campaigns, new disclosures show. \u2026 For current and former candidates who had released fundraising details as of Thursday evening \u2026 their campaigns had spent an average of 67% of the funds they raised this year through Sept. 30. During the same period in the past two elections, the average burn rate was 54%, according to analysis by research firm Echelon Insights.\n\u201cHow campaigns manage their money influences the decisions of wealthy donors. The departure of former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker from the Republican race earlier this year leaves several billionaires and other wealthy donors looking for a new candidate. At least two GOP candidates have dangerously low accounts. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s report shows he has less than $2 million in cash, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has a little more than $1 million\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1RdK4CS\nGOOD FRIDAY MORNING \u2014 Congrats to the New York Metropolitans who took down the Dodgers 3-2 and move on the face the Chicago Cubs who have not been to the World Series since 1826.

At issue is whether CNBC, which is hosting the debate, to be held in Boulder, Colo., will allow candidates to give opening and closing statements.\n\u201cA day earlier, the RNC and CNBC held a conference call to discuss logistics that turned heated - with CNBC saying it wouldn't allow opening and closing statements, and several campaigns saying they wanted them. On Thursday's call - which the RNC abruptly scheduled earlier in the morning - Corey Lewandowski, Trump's campaign manager, said that if the debate does not include opening or closing statements and is longer than two hours total \u2026 the real estate mogul would have to drop out\u201d http://politi.co/1hGYNKt\n**A message from the Independent Community Bankers of America: Now is the time for Congress to put down partisan differences and unlock the community banking industry\u2019s potential to spur economic growth.

Republican senators said in a series of interviews they're more likely to agree to higher funding levels if they can slow down mandatory spending on Social Security and Medicare.\n\u201cBut congressional Democrats are making clear that there will be no changes to those benefits as part of a deal intended to eliminate the threat of a government shutdown from the presidential primary season, as well as stave off budget cuts from sequestration, which are restricting both military and domestic spending. Democrats do not believe there is a realistic scenario to find more than about $80 billion in new spending for the military and domestic programs, potentially restricting budget negotiators to a deal that does not last through the election. That would mean lawmakers would have to strike another spending deal in the fall of 2016\u201d \nHILLARY BANK STANCE WON\u2019T CUT IT ON THE LEFT \u2014 Rolling Stone\u2019s Matt Taibbi: \u201c[S]he gave an answer that to me sums up her candidacy and the conundrum of the modern Democratic Party in general.

It is perhaps the most significant setback yet for a booming unregulated industry that has spent the past two weeks in the midst of a firestorm of allegations that have prompted federal and state investigations into the alleged predatory practices of its employees who, armed with inside information, may have exploited its paying customers \n \u2026 \u201cDraftKings and FanDuel, each valued at more than $1 billion, have operated under an exemption to the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, which outlawed online poker and sports betting. Five states have prohibited them from operating, but none are as powerful and influential as Nevada, which has long been a bastion of legal gambling, operates under strict regulation and has the nation\u2019s only active sports betting \u2026 In 2006, Congress tried to crack down on illegal online sports betting. Today, Internet wagering is thriving, and a new business that resembles gambling, fantasy sports, is winning millions of players and stoking controversy\u201d http://nyti.ms/1PkMjH8\nDUDLEY: U.S. SLOWING \u2014 FT\u2019s Sam Fleming in Washington and Robin Wigglesworth in New York: \u201cThe U.S. economy may be slowing, a top Federal Reserve policymaker conceded, as investors have ratcheted back bets on when the US central bank will finally begin to tighten monetary policy \u2026 William Dudley, president of the New York Fed, said he was still open to the possibility of an interest rate increase this year and stressed that the US economy was performing 'pretty well.' But he highlighted weaker jobs and retail sales rises, and argued that growth was being held back by the dollar\u2019s appreciation and swings in inventories. \u2026 .\n\u201cInterest rate futures now indicate that most traders do not see any rate increases this year, and about half think the central bank may have to wait beyond March next year. Fed Funds futures signal that there is about a 10 per cent chance that policymakers will sit on their hands until 2017. As a result, the 10-year Treasury yield has dipped back to the 2 per cent mark, confounding predictions of a gentle rise this year. A spate of underwhelming economic data, turbulent financial markets, still-subdued inflation and mounting signs that the global economy is also going through a soft patch has spurred traders to pare back their expectations\u201d http://on.ft.com/1Oy1EnN\nALSO FOR YOUR RADAR \u2014 \nCARRIED INTEREST TAXATION, DEFENDED \u2014 Carlyle\u2019s Mary Petrovich in The Hill: \u201cCarried interest is not a tax loophole. \u2026 The law appropriately recognizes that carried interest is a share of profits from a capital asset \u2014 e.g. an operating business \u2014 owned for years, and bears with it the risk that the company will not generate a profit. Changing the tax treatment of carried interest would deprive certain partnerships of the same long-term capital gains treatment available to other kinds of businesses that make long-term investments\u201d http://bit.ly/1LnuVLK\nGOLDMAN HIT BY TRADING SLOW DOWN \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Justin Baer: \u201cWall Street traders took a thumping over the summer, and no firm was left with deeper bruises than Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Goldman delivered a disappointing earnings report that reminded investors how dependent it is on buying and selling stocks, bonds and commodities like oil \u2014 and how heavily those trading businesses rely on hedge funds and other professional money managers whose jitters about the global economy can make or break results \u2026 The results show the downside of Goldman\u2019s strategy of sticking to its guns on trading amid a broader bank retrenchment from the business. Regulators have cracked down on trading since the financial crisis with tougher capital rules and curbs on risk taking. \n\"Goldman \u2026 reported a 36% drop in third-quarter profit. The firm\u2019s revenue in fixed income, currencies and commodities trading fell 33% \u2014 10 to 22 percentage points deeper than the declines at the other big banks that reported earnings this week. Goldman\u2019s larger peers have more diverse lines of business, including consumer banking. Analysts say they also draw more revenue from corporate-lending customers whose hedges provide a steady flow of income. \u2026 Third-quarter net income fell to $1.43 billion, or $2.90 a share, from $2.24 billion, or $4.57, a year earlier\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1hHM0Ym\nAFR FIRES BACK ON CFPB \u2014 Americans for Financial Reform on the Sinema/Neugebauer WSJ op-ed in MM on Thursday: \u201cThe Consumer Bureau has been making financial markets fairer, safer and more transparent - doing its job, in other words, and proving that its current structure makes sense if your goal is consumer protection. That hasn\u2019t stopped some people from cloaking their arguments for a clunkier, financial industry-dominated Commission in pro-consumer, anti-gridlock rhetoric. But it certainly doesn\u2019t make that rhetoric plausible.\u201d \n** A message from the Independent Community Bankers of America: Now is the time for Congress to put down their partisan differences and unlock the community banking industry\u2019s potential to be catalysts for economic growth. ICBA and America\u2019s more than 6,400 community banks urge lawmakers to secure meaningful regulatory relief. Community banks in every Congressional district across the nation are the backbone of local economic growth nationwide and support our communities one loan at a time. But excessive and unnecessary regulation is thwarting their ability to fully meet the needs of local economies. We need lawmakers to enact sensible regulatory relief to allow community banks to do what they do best: serve their communities. Community banks: big where it matters \u2014 our communities. www.icba.org **\nBen White is POLITICO Pro's chief economic correspondent and author of the \u201cMorning Money\u201d column covering the nexus of finance and public policy.\nPrior to joining POLITICO in the fall of 2009, Mr. White served as a Wall Street reporter for the New York Times, where he shared a Society of Business Editors and Writers award for breaking news coverage of the financial crisis.\nFrom 2005 to 2007, White was Wall Street correspondent and U.S. Banking Editor at the Financial Times.\nWhite worked at the Washington Post for nine years before joining the FT.
