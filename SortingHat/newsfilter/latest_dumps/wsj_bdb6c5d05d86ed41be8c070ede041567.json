{"body": "It is election season, and attacks on China over its foreign exchange policy are in full swing. Some U.S. lawmakers are against the recently concluded Trans-Pacific Partnership trade talks because the deal did not include strong language on \u00e2\u0080\u009ccurrency manipulation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nPresidential candidates haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been shy in attacking China for supposedly giving its exporters an unfair boost. But how much truth is there behind an accusation that is now well-entrenched in the psyche of the American public?\nBashing China over the value of the renminbi\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u008aor the yuan, as it is commonly referred to\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u008ais nothing new. In an August CNN interview, Republican front-runner Donald Trump declared: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey keep devaluing their currency until they get it right. They\u2019re doing a big cut in the yuan, and that\u2019s going to be devastating for us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sen. Bernie Sanders, the surprise challenger to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, said in a post on his website: \u00e2\u0080\u009cChina is manipulating its currency, giving it an unfair trade advantage over the United States and destroying decent paying manufacturing jobs in the process.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHowever, a look at the data shows Beijing has allowed the currency to appreciate against the U.S. dollar in recent years.\nAs the graph shows,\u00c2\u00a0China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s renminbi rose steadily against the greenback from the middle of 2011, flirting with levels below RMB 6.10 to US $1 last year.\u00c2\u00a0According to the International Monetary Fund, the value of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s currency rose by about 10% between last year and the first seven months of 2015.\nThat ended with China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprise move on Aug. 11 when it changed how it determines the daily reference rate of its exchange rate regime. Since then the yuan has depreciated by 2.3% against the U.S. dollar through September,\u00c2\u00a0according to the U.S. Treasury\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest semiannual international foreign exchange report.\nBut for those reaching for a stick to bang the currency manipulation drum, it is important to consider all factors. Just three days after Beijing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s FX policy tweak, the IMF\u00c2\u00a0noted in a report\u00c2\u00a0that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe substantial appreciation of the renminbi in real effective terms this year has brought the exchange rate to a level that is no longer undervalued.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nFurthermore, as the Treasury said in its aforementioned currency report: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSince June\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 many central banks have been intervening not to depreciate\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u008abut rather to support their currencies.\u00c2\u00a0After relatively little intervention in either direction in the second quarter of 2015, China appears to have intervened heavily in the third quarter to prevent RMB depreciation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe yuan has appreciated nearly 30% in real effective terms since June 2010, according to the Treasury, and it believes that the \u201ccore factors\u201d behind that appreciation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 namely the sizable current account surplus and improved terms of trade \u00e2\u0080\u0093 remain in place.\nThis is why the Treasury concluded that the yuan \u201cremains below its appropriate medium-term valuation,\u201d a softening of language from the prior report that declared China\u2019s currency to be \u201csignificantly undervalued.\u201d\nIt is important to acknowledge the downward pressure on the yuan from capital leaving the country. Investors, spooked by the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slowing growth rate, are looking elsewhere in search of better returns. The U.S. Treasury estimates that $200 billion in capital left China in August alone, compared with $250 billion for the entire first half of 2015.\nSo rather than piling on the criticism, perhaps it is best to adopt the Treasury\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach and wait for clearer signals that show if the renminbi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movements are being manipulated by the state or come in response to market forces.\nBrai Odion-Esene is a senior director at Hamilton Place Strategies, a consulting firm.
