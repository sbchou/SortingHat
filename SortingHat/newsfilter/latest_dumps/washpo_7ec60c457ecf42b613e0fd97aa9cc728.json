{"body": "If you want to see social media\u2019s varied and growing role in presidential elections, just watch what happens during tonight\u2019s first Republican primary debate (the Post\u2019s liveblog starts continuing coverage with the first debate at 4:30p.m.). Remember, the last presidential election debate was on Oct. 22, 2012. Snapchat was just barely breaking into the mainstream. Instagram had only recently rolled out profiles for the Web. Medium was in its infancy. Genius was niche. Tumblr was an afterthought. Social media sites are taking advantage of the interest. On Snapchat, U.S. users will be able to peek in on the debate through a \u201cLive Story\u201d photo and video montage. On Instagram, a feature dubbed \u201cThe First Debate\u201d under the Explore tab is already aggregating candidates\u2019 photo feeds. [Sign up for The Daily 202, The Washington Post\u2019s new political tipsheet] \u201cEvery post they do is like a virtual postcard from the campaign trail,\u201d said Liz Bourgeois, communications manager at Instagram and a former Democratic National Committee aide. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way for them to pull back the curtain and take their followers along with them.\u201d A lot has changed in two-and-a-half years. Twitter might still be king in Washington circles, but campaigns are embracing virtually every platform they can wrap their heads around in order to reach voters with branded content or paid advertising. It\u2019s as true for Republicans as it is for Democrats, despite the GOP\u2019s reputation of staying behind the technological curve. Top Republicans like Scott Walker and Jeb Bush are making a concerted effort to stay engaged on social media, in part to add the suggestion of authenticity that Instagram and other platforms can provide. Tonight, as GOP candidates gather for two debates in Cleveland, their teams will be working furiously behind the scenes to maximize their impact across the Web. Nearly every major campaign is expected to place targeted ads during the debates on social media and efforts to take existing followers behind-the-scenes with photo and video are intensifying. For instance, Bobby Jindal\u2019s campaign posted this photo (below) of him doing a walk-through on the debate stage on Instagram to his 4,206 followers Thursday afternoon.  Bourgeois is Instagram\u2019s only staffer on the ground in Cleveland, she said, though the company has support from employees at Facebook, which is co-sponsoring Thursday\u2019s debate with Fox News. The Republican debate will be one of the first live events covered since Instagram revamped its Explore tab in June. Snapchat will also carry ads for John Kasich in Ohio (below) and Next Gen Climate in Iowa and New Hampshire.  Marco Rubio, meanwhile, posted a Snapchat video\u00a0 (below) on Twitter from his preparations on Wednesday night.

(Twitter also has the benefit of being journalists\u2019 network of choice, campaign aides said.) But they\u2019re also platforms for ads designed to reach outside a candidate\u2019s existing follower base and into specific demographics. \u201cWe\u2019ve prepared graphics and statistics that will help voters who are hearing Scott Walker\u2019s message for the first time get a clear picture of what he\u2019s accomplished in Wisconsin,\u201d a Walker campaign aide shared. \u201cContinuing to grow our lists and learn more about our supporters is important. We will work to promote the governor\u2019s message on a particular issue as well an offer an opportunity for engagement like signing a petition or pledging support.\u201d The variety of social media campaigns underscores the differences between the platforms and how candidates hope to benefit from them. The debate is also an opportunity for the networks themselves as they experiment with engaging more users on topics of the day. Facebook took the opportunity to tease the debate by posting videos of Republican candidates posing one another questions. Predictably, Donald Trump\u2019s 12-second clip (below) generated more than 19-times the number of clicks as his rivals\u2019 videos. (A spokeswoman for Trump declined to share any specific social-media plans from the campaign for the debate.)
