{"body": "The Capitol is witnessing a spectacle that would be hard to imagine just a few years ago: Rep. Paul Ryan (R., Wis.), long considered a conservative darling, is coming under fire from some in his party\u2019s right wing for being insufficiently conservative. At a time when many Republicans are clamoring for Mr. Ryan to agree to be the next House Speaker, a noisy band of conservatives \u2014 mostly talk-radio hosts and other media figures outside the Capitol \u2014 have been vilifying him for being too moderate.\nIt is a through-the-looking-glass political phenomenon that speaks volumes about how the Republican Party has changed in recent years. The fiscal issues Mr. Ryan has long championed have taken a back seat to social litmus test issues like immigration in activist circles. And his skills at negotiating big budget deals, once admired, are now regarded with suspicion by conservatives who shun compromise.\nMr. Ryan became a conservative icon over the last decade as the author of GOP budgets that broke new ground in defining Republicans as the party of small government. In what came to be known as\u00a0\u201cThe Ryan Budget,\u201d he called for deep cuts in spending, making Medicaid and welfare into state block grants and a far-reaching overhaul of Medicare to rein in costs.\nHis budget was so conservative that he became the star of Democratic political ads and campaign talking points portraying Republicans as out to \u201cend Medicare as we know it.\u201d One ad in 2012 featured a Paul Ryan impersonator pushing a wheelchair-bound elderly woman over a cliff. Democrats scored an upset victory in a 2011 special House election after making a major issue of the Republican candidate\u2019s support for the Ryan Medicare plan.\nHis stature among Republican conservatives was such that when GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012 picked Mr. Ryan as a running mate, it was widely praised and seen as a way to build bridges to the party\u2019s right flank.\n\u201cPaul Ryan is the largest step the GOP has taken towards solving the USA\u2019s problems since (Ronald) Reagan and (Jack) Kemp,\u201d gushed Newt Gingrich, the vanquished conservative presidential candidate, on Twitter.\nInfluential conservative commentator Mark Levin hailed the pick: \u201cRyan\u2019s articulate, he\u2019s confident, he\u2019s principled, he\u2019s knowledgeable and he\u2019s a conservative\u2026That\u2019s what Romney needed.\u201d\nNow, Mr. Levin is singing a different tune. \u201cNOT SO FAST!\u201d\u00a0he said on Twitter recently, as Republicans were begging Mr. Ryan to run for speaker after House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy dropped his bid to succeed House Speaker John Boehner. Mr. Levin\u2019s primary beef: Mr. Ryan has been among Republicans open to giving some illegal immigrants legal status in an overhaul of the immigration system. That made him \u201can amnesty advocate\u201d in Mr. Levin\u2019s eyes.\nJenny Beth Martin, head of Tea Party Patriots, said that his record is \u201canything but conservative,\u201d citing his support not just for immigration reform, but for an array of George W. Bush-era bills that were considered mainstream Republican measures at the time: the No Child Left Behind education law, the Medicare prescription drug benefit, and the Wall Street bailout in 2008. He has also taken flak for supporting international trade deals, once an article of faith in a Grand Old Party packed with free traders.\nThose issues have become litmus tests for the insurgent, antiestablishment wing of the GOP \u2014 especially the conservative activist groups, talk-radio hosts and other media outlets that have increasingly attacked the GOP establishment with almost as much fervor as Democrats.\nWhat is not clear is how far the anti-Ryan insurrection will reach into the ranks of House Republicans, the people who will be voting on the next speaker. Rep. Matt Salmon of Arizona, a member of the House Freedom Caucus \u2014 a conservative faction that pressured Mr. Boehner out of the job and threatened to block Mr. McCarthy\u2019s rise \u2014 said he was not concerned about Mr. Ryan\u2019s policy views or about the criticism of outside groups.\nMr. Salmon said his main goal is to press any potential speaker to open up the House\u2019s internal process and make it more inclusive. \u201cIt could very well be Paul Ryan,\u201d Mr. Salmon said Thursday.\nBut it is far from clear whether Mr. Ryan can be persuaded by party elders to take the speaker\u2019s job. He has said repeatedly he does not want it. And it is now clear that the job would surely expose him to even more to slings and arrows from an unaccustomed direction: his right flank.\n\u2013Kristina Peterson contributed to this report.\nMore:\nRace for Speaker of the House Could Get a Lot More Crowded\nRep.
