Yet the crowning achievement of her corporate career -- her tenure as a Fortune 500 CEO at Hewlett-Packard -- isn't central to her stump speech.\nRepeating the same lines from stop to stop, Fiorina rails against an \"inept, corrupt bureaucracy.\" She offers herself up as a leader who understands the intersection of business and technology, a \u201cfierce fighter\u201d resolved to tip the scales back toward average people in an economy overrun by \"crony capitalism.\"\nStory Continued Below\n\"Only someone who understands how a bureaucracy works can cut it down to size,\u201d she told a crowd of 200 people at a barbecue joint in Lexington Wednesday.\nThe details of her Hewlett-Packard story go mostly unmentioned -- and her audiences don't seem to mind. In five events in South Carolina over the last three days, she took more than a dozen questions but only once was she pressed about her HP service by someone other than a reporter.\n\n\n\n            By \nEli Stokols\n\n\"Yes, I've been widely criticized by Democrats and Donald Trump,\" Fiorina acknowledged Thursday to the questioner, deflecting the issue. Only when the questioner persisted did she paint a fuller picture of her view of her time at Hewlett-Packard, comparing HP to other companies that perished when the tech bubble burst. She likening herself to other innovators and executives \u2014 Oprah Winfrey, Walt Disney and Steve Jobs \u2014 who had all been fired at one point.\n\"I got fired in a boardroom brawl that lasted about two weeks,\" she explained. \"Why? Because when you lead and you challenge the status quo, you make enemies. Steve Jobs called me that day and said, 'Been there, done that, twice.'\"\nFor her surging candidacy, HP is nevertheless emerging as the elephant in the room, a subject of personal pride for the candidate but also an enormous political liability. In Fiorina's only prior run for office, Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer\u2019s campaign weaponized the issue to devastating effect, framing the former CEO's tenure as a time marked by the layoffs of 30,000 employees and the company loss of half its value before Fiorina left with a $100 million golden parachute.\nHer current rivals have zeroed in on her vulnerability, using Boxer's scorching attacks as a template. In last week's debate, Donald Trump told Fiorina he would never hire her to run one of his companies, citing a Yale business professor's indictment of her tenure at Hewlett Packard as \u201cone of the worst tenures for a CEO that he has ever seen.\u201d\nThat professor, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, weighed in with a scathing op-ed for Politico magazine this week, affirming Trump's characterization of his view. \"It was Fiorina\u2019s failed leadership that brought her company down,\" he wrote.\nHis assessment hit a nerve: Fiorina's campaign manager responded to Sonnenfeld's treatise with a personal attack of sorts, drawing reporters' attention to 15-year-old allegations of vandalism against the professor dating back to his forced resignation from Emory University's business school.\n\u201cI\u2019ll give Sonnenfeld this: He would know something about getting fired,\u201d wrote Sarah Isgur Flores, Fiorina's deputy campaign manager, in an email to reporters. \nIn a post on Medium Tuesday, Fiorina\u2019s campaign manager offered 10 data points pushing back at \u201carmchair CEO\u2019ing,\u201d arguing that Fiorina\u2019s decisions saved 80,000 jobs and led the company to double its revenues.\nOn the campaign trail, though, Fiorina's response to questions doesn't deviate much \u2014 boiled down to its essence, her argument is that she had to burn down Hewlett Packard in order to save it.\n\"I was recruited to Hewlett Packard to save the company and I did that and we saved a lot of jobs in the process,\" Fiorina said Wednesday afternoon during a press gaggle after she officially signed paperwork ensuring her place on South Carolina\u2019s Feb. 20 primary ballot.\n\"I look forward to people challenging me on my record because I'll run on it all day long,\u201d she continued.\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\nFiorina bristles at comparisons to Mitt Romney, whom Democrats pilloried in 2012 as an out-of-touch plutocrat by highlighting the wealth he amassed during his tenure at Bain Capital, the Boston-based global investment firm he founded.\nThe attacks against Romney mirrored Boxer\u2019s television ads from two years earlier, which portrayed Fiorina as a heartless executive who walked away with a huge severance deal. Boxer lambasted Fiorina\u2019s choice \u201cto become a CEO, lay off 30,000 workers, ship jobs overseas [and] have two yachts\u201d -- Fiorina didn\u2019t help matters when she responded by explaining that she and her husband had two yachts because they spent time in both California and Washington. Despite the GOP wave, Fiorina lost by 10 percentage points.\nCarly for America, the super PAC that is responsible for much of the political infrastructure undergirding Fiorina\u2019s actual campaign, has stepped in to shore up her defenses, releasing a film featuring interviews with Hewlett-Packard colleagues putting a positive gloss on her record as a CEO.\nOn Tuesday, when the \u201cCitizen Carly\u201d film premiered in Virginia, Fiorina pushed back at a reporter in Myrtle Beach who suggested a similarity between her record and Romney\u2019s.\n\"My business experience is quite different than Mitt Romney's,\u201d she said. \u201cBain Capital is not the same as running a company. I didn't have a basket of companies that I could look over; I had one company that I was asked to lead. In fact, I was recruited by the board to save a company and that's what we did in a very difficult time.\nFiorina's stiff spine has served her well thus far. But rival campaigns are circulating opposition research and readying new attacks. Now that she's nipping at his heels in the polls, Trump has continued to pick at her business record. This week, Politifact rated his statement dismissing Fiorina\u2019s boasting of raising revenues as the result of HP purchase of Compaq -- which Trump contends \u201cled to the destruction of the company\u201d -- mostly true.\n\u201cShe\u2019s riding high right now, but this can all end pretty quickly,\u201d said an adviser to another Republican campaign. \u201cWe saw the potency of this attack in California. There\u2019s no reason to think it won\u2019t be potent again.\u201d\nEli Stokols is a national politics reporter.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "On the campaign trail, the details of her time as a Fortune 500 CEO go mostly unmentioned.", "title": "Fiorina wrestles with the Hewlett-Packard ghosts", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/carly-fiorina-hewlett-packard-record-213993", "topics": ["economy", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Sarah Isgur Flores", "Kyle Cheney", "Steve Jobs", "Rachael Bade", "Matthew Karnitschnig", "Henry C.
