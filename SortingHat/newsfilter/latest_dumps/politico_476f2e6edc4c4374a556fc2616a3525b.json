{"body": "Nolan D. McCaskill | POLITICO\n\nThe Agenda\nA review of the GOP candidates' policy websites discovers big gaps at the top.\n\n            By \nDarren Samuelsohn\n\nPresidential campaigns once saw their websites as useful\u00a0tools to tell voters where they stood\u00a0on the big policy issues of\r\nthe day.\u00a0Sure, the information may have been a bit wonky, even\u00a0riddled with\r\nbullet points. But\u00a0Americans genuinely interested in the candidates' ideas could get some\r\ndetails straight\u00a0from each one\u00a0on what they\u2019d do if elected president on\r\neverything\u00a0from Social Security to NATO.\n\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s so 2008.\n\r\n\r\nA POLITICO Agenda analysis of the 17 GOP campaigns' websites found that\u00a0nearly half lacked\u00a0a specific \u201cissue\u201d page at all.\u00a0The absence of a clear, one-stop spigot of policy information was especially notable at the top of the field.\u00a0Front-runners Donald Trump, Jeb Bush and Scott Walker don\u2019t have\r\npolicy tabs of any kind. For the rest of the pack, the policy pages of their websites\u00a0are largely\r\nafterthoughts, light on\u00a0significant detail. There are some exceptions: Rand Paul, the libertarian idea maven, gets deep into the issues and pushes the bounds of where a Republican might go; Chris Christie offers\u00a0multi-pronged plans on education, the economy and entitlement reform.\r\nBut overall, what the Republican field has posted online on the policy front is far\u00a0more a jumble of talking points, previously-published op-eds and random topics \u2014 Marco Rubio has a page simply titled \"America\" \u2014 than the kinds of details once considered essential to a serious presidential candidacy.\r\n\r\nCampaign veterans say there are several reasons for the shift. For starters, websites are now used more as tools to\r\nraise money,\u00a0sell swag and collect email addresses and other vital information\r\nfrom\u00a0potential voters, donors and volunteers. As for all that nerdy policy? It can wait.\nIn part, that's because many of the candidates aren't well-funded enough to have\u00a0staff to develop\r\ndetailed\u00a0positions on foreign and domestic issues. (Hence the crucial fundraising role of\u00a0the website.) But cash is hardly a problem\r\nfor GOP heavy hitters like Trump and Bush. For them, it\u2019s probably more a\r\nmatter of being \"risk averse\u201d where they \"don\u2019t want a lot of\r\npolicy questions at this stage,\u201d said Doug Holtz-Eakin, a top economic policy adviser to John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. More than a year before the general election, when the big issues haven't all coalesced yet, it can be far more damaging to be associated with the wrong position than helpful to back an easy one.\u00a0\nIn time for the Republican field's first debate face-off Thursday in Cleveland, here\u2019s POLITICO\u2019s breakdown of the candidates' policy websites: both what they stand for, and how much they're putting out there for voters to consider.\nJeb BushIssue page? NoWhat's online:\u00a0The former Florida governor has a reputation as a policy wonk. His website? Not so much. Visitors will find a lengthy\u00a0bio page to \"Meet Jeb,\" as well as a feature spotlighting the candidate's latest tweets. He's also got blog posts recapping recent events where policy has been discussed, like last weekend's speech in South Florida to\u00a0the National Urban League and topical essays like his\u00a0\"6 steps\" on border enforcement and immigration. But there's no clearly marked spot where voters can learn details about\u00a0what Bush would do if elected.\n\u2028Ben CarsonIssue page? Yes\u00a0\u2014\u00a0'Ben on the\r\nIssues'What's online:\u00a0This is more like a list of 10 topics of interest to conservatives\u00a0\u2014 \"Stand by Israel, Our Bulwark Middle East Ally\" and \"Keep Gitmo Open\" \u2014\u00a0than an actual full-bore policy platform. The retired Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon keeps his explanations simple too. His education section is among the most detailed, coming in at\u00a0five paragraphs and a call that \"Common Core must be overturned.\"\u00a0On health care, Carson says he'd drop the Affordable Care Act; as a replacement he offers\u00a0health savings accounts, \"which empower families to make their own decisions about their medical\r\ntreatment.\" Each tab conveniently offers visitors a chance to \"stand with Ben\" by leaving their first and last name, email address and zip code.\n\nChris ChristieIssue page? Yes\u00a0\u2014 'Taking on the Tough Issues'What's online:\u00a0The New Jersey governor wins his party's policy primary by posting the most detailed ideas of any GOP presidential\u00a0candidate. Amid\u00a0town-hall videos of Christie paying tribute to Ronald Reagan and trashing the current leadership in Washington are sections on entitlement reform, including a\u00a012-point plan\u2028 that calls for\u00a0phasing out Social Security benefits for future retirees and raising the retirement age to 69; a 15-point plan\u00a0on education suggesting using his work in New Jersey as a \"model for reform to the nation\"; a\u00a0five-point plan\u00a0on the economy that includes corporate tax cuts and lifting the ban on crude oil exports; and a foreign policy\u00a0plan\u2028 that sticks to typically GOP safe ground like ending sequestration for the military and passing tougher anti-terrorism and surveillance laws.\r\n\r\n\u00a0Ted CruzIssue page? NoWhat's online:\u00a0The Texas senator's site does tout his \"proven record\" on several core conservative topics, like \"The Constitution\" and \"Life, Marriage & Family.\" But rather than spell out what Cruz would do as president, his site lists highlights from his political career in the Senate, as a Bush administration official and as Texas solicitor general. There's also a little bit of field research, asking visitors to rank nine issues in order of importance \u2014a doubly useful poll for the campaign, since it also collects names, email addresses and zip codes.\nCarly FiorinaIssue page: NoWhat's online:\u00a0Visitors to the former Hewlett-Packard executive learn plenty about who \"Carly\" is. What they don't get is much in the way of insight into her policies. There is, however, a petition\u00a0requesting email address and zip code as a way to register disgust with \"career politicians\" and to let it be known that\u00a0\"it's time to put a citizen leader in the White House.\"\nJim GilmoreIssue page? Yes\u2014'Jim's Growth Code'What's online:\u00a0A pretty straightforward page from the race's true long shot. The former Virginia governor offers up five steps that are \"simply,\u00a0squarely and precisely focused on the tax code and restoring America to a sustainable economic growth trajectory.\" Among his ideas: setting up a\u00a015 percent tax rate for all business income, and three tax rates for individual income.\u00a0\nLindsey GrahamIssue page? Yes -\u00a0'Prepared to be Commander in Chief on Day One'What's online:\u00a0The South Carolina senator's policy site is presented like a set of Russian nesting dolls. It starts with three very broad topics \u2014\"Securing Our Nation\", \"Securing our Future\" and \"Securing our Values\"\u00a0\u2014 that each come with general\u00a0overviews into why Graham is best equipped to be president. From there, visitors can keep clicking for more layers of information about Graham's foreign/military, economic and social policies. A couple examples: he'd put 10,000 U.S. troops in the Middle East to \"defeat forces of radical Islam\" and seek legislation that bans\u00a0abortions after 20 weeks unless the woman's life is in danger or she's the victim of rape or incest.\nMike HuckabeeIssue page? Yes\u2014'Where I Stand on Today's Issues'What's online:\u00a0There's a little bit of everything here. Some of the former Arkansas governor's\u00a0webpages are pretty simple. Under \"Tax Reform\" are two short paragraphs explaining why he'd abolish the\u00a0IRS and enact a \"FairTax.\" Under \"Spending & Debt\" are promises to get rid of Obamacare, \"secure the border & end illegal immigration\" and a general call to \"reject the failed Obama-Clinton politics that punish working families and encourage government dependency.\" A tab in the issue section for the \"Undecided Voter\" leads to a\u00a0page requesting vital info like name and email address \u2014promising\u00a0an email per week sharing insights on \"where Gov. Huckabee stands on the issues.\"\nBobby JindalIssue page? NoWhat's online:\u00a0The Louisiana governor is well-known in GOP circles for being something of a\u00a0policy wonk. His\u00a0website doesn't reflect that. While there is a\u00a0730-word bio offering visitors a chance to \"Meet Bobby,\" as well as a list of Jindal's \"top achievements\" in the statehouse,\u00a0there's nowhere to go to find out what he'd do as president. That said, his campaign\u00a0does have a number of petitions (requesting name, email, zip code) to signal displeasure with everything from Obamacare to Planned Parenthood.\u00a0John Kasich Issue page? NoWhat's online:\u00a0A late entry to the 2016 GOP sweepstakes, the Ohio governor has a website that still looks like a work in progress.\u00a0It has plenty of biographical information about his record\u00a0in Columbus and in Congress as the chairman of the\u00a0House Budget Committee. But the most a visitor would find here about Kasich's presidential plans is a brief note that he would\u00a0\"make balancing the federal budget a top priority\r\nand continue to fight for a Constitutional amendment to force Congress to do\r\nits job and balance the budget.\u201d\nGeorge Pataki\u00a0Issue page? NoWhat's online:\u00a0For starters, there's a\u00a0chance to \"Meet George\" and \"Meet Libby.\" Beyond that? No one-stop shop for the former New York governor's stance on the big issues of the day. For visitors willing to sift through video links, however, there are plenty of Pataki media hits, in which he\u00a0explains everything from\u00a0why Congress should nix the Iran deal to why he's not a big fan of the Common Core education standards.\r\n\r\n\u00a0Rand PaulIssue page? Yes\u2014'Rand Paul on the Issues'What's online:\u00a0The Kentucky senator gives Rubio some competition when it comes to the sheer breadth of areas he tries to cover online. At last count, Paul had 18 different subtopics, including a couple that break from the GOP norm, like \"criminal justice reform\" and \"civil liberties.\" Each click leads to a\u00a0brief explanation into why Paul thinks the item is important; several include\u00a0YouTube videos of the candidate himself.\u00a0As for solutions, the website mostly touts bills Paul has introduced, like the RESET Act, which would loosen some drug laws, and a proposal to impose term limits on all\u00a0members of Congress.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0Rick\u00a0Perry Issue page? Yes\u2014\u2018Expanding\r\nOpportunity for All\u2019What's online:\u00a0The former Texas governor whose 'oops' moment defined his ill-fated 2012 White House bid is going for the studious look this cycle, thanks to a series of policy briefings in Austin (and some snappy new eyeglasses). But when it comes to his website, it's all\u00a0about brevity. Four big picture topics are listed as his platform: \"Lower Taxes,\" \"Retire the Debt,\" \"National Security\" and \"Stop Special Interests & Big Government.\" But only the \"national security\" section is longer than one sentence. It's two.\nMarco Rubio\u00a0Issue page? Yes\u2014'See what\r\nMarco thinks about the issues'What's online:\u00a0The Florida senator earns extra credit for being the most creative with his policy tabs. A page titled \"America\" opens by asking: \"What kind of country will we be?\" Several other pages are specific to geographic locations, like Cuba, Europe and Iran. The latter actually gets two pages, \"Part 2\"\u00a0being a cut-and-paste excerpt from\u00a0a FoxNews op-ed Rubio wrote in late April as the Obama-led negotiations heated up. Like Paul, Rubio is trying to be seen as a candidate of ideas. But also like Paul, his website's policy tabs seems to be expressed in breadth more than specifics.\u00a0\nRick Santorum Issue page? Yes\u2014'Rick on the Issues'\u00a0What's online:\u00a0A short series of explainers that mostly recap where the former Pennsylvania senator has stood on some bedrock GOP issues like immigration and \"the sanctity of life.\" His economic plan is one paragraph long, though it\u00a0promises \u201cin a few short weeks\" to go into more details into on how he would \"end the IRS as we know it.\" It also asks for the visitor's email address to \"be the first to hear about Rick's Economic Plan.\"\nDonald TrumpIssue page? NoWhat's online:\u00a0Fancy fonts, video highlights from the current GOP front-runner's recent TV appearances and the latest tweets from @realDonaldTrump. Trump actually has talked about policy on and off over the years, though his actual positions have been hard to pin down\u2014a pattern that continues in\u00a0this campaign, and on his\u00a0website,\u00a0which\u00a0is void of specific plans.\r\n\nScott WalkerIssue page?\u00a0NoWhat's online:\u00a0There's a chance to \"Meet Scott\" via a bio page subtitled: \"Humble Beginnings. Bold Ideas.\" On his news page are links to campaign statements slamming President Obama's climate change regulations and Hillary Clinton's Cuba policy. Visitors can also pick up a $299 personalized autographed copy of Walker's latest book. But what they can't find is anything definitive or substantive about what the Wisconsin governor would do in the White House.\nHillary Clinton has a sharp insight on reforming CEO pay. The policy it could fix is her husband's.\n\n                    By \n                            Michael Dorff\n\n\n                    By \n                            Jim McNerney\n\nAn experiment in figuring out what Washington likes about outer space.\n\n                    By \nDarren Samuelsohn\n\n\n                    By \nDanny Vinik\n\n\n                    By \nMichael Grunwald\n\n\n                    By \nMichael Grunwald\n\n\n                    By \nMichael Grunwald\n\n\n                    By \n                            David Evans\n\nIt\u2019s true.
