{"body": "   Then-Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain talked to the media after a meeting with Donald Trump on Oct. 3, 2011. (Richard Drew/AP)  Herman Cain, I\u2019m sorry. Loyal readers during the 2012 presidential contest may recall that I used the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination as a political pinata. The former Godfather\u2019s Pizza executive could do nothing right. Cain was ill-prepared. He joked about putting an electric fence on the border with Mexico to thwart illegal immigration. He slammed critics with belittling jokes. And he was so unprepared for the intense spotlight on the main stage of American politics that I said his campaign was an insult to my mother. Four years later, Donald Trump makes Cain\u2019s candidacy seem like a sincere effort at leadership. My primary beef with Cain was that his \u201c9-9-9\u201d tax plan made absolutely no sense. Sure, the plan sounded great on the debate stage, and in the glib, showman-like manner he employed as he tried to sell it to GOP primary voters. Even under mild scrutiny, Cain\u2019s 9-9-9 proposal collapsed faster than a poorly stacked Jenga. But at least he had a plan. At least Cain respected the American people enough to put forth a proposal they could pick apart and debate. At least Cain submitted to editorial board interviews, in which he explained that his lack of foreign policy knowledge was due to all the stuff \u201ctwirling around in my head.\u201d\u00a0Trump has done none of that. Instead, at a rally in South Carolina yesterday, the billionaire Big Apple loudmouth gave credence to the lesson the Rev. Al Sharpton told me yesterday was imparted to him by James Brown. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between the lounge act and the acts that play the main room.\u201d the Godfather of Soul told him. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the lounge, you\u2019re competing with the bars and the barmaids and the slot machines and people gambling. So you do whatever you can to get attention. But when you\u2019re in the main room, they paid to see a show. You\u2019ve got to be ready. You gotta have choreography. You gotta be rehearsed. You gotta have polish.\u201d [Donald Trump \u201cis an Apollo act in Lincoln Center,\u201d says Al Sharpton] Despite the gleam of his buildings and the fixtures within them, Trump has no polish. None.\u00a0Giving out Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s private cell phone number and revealing a private conversation with him or snidely questioning Rick Perry\u2019s intelligence makes for a perfect lounge act. Actually, Trump\u2019s routine in South Carolina yesterday was more like a Friar\u2019s Club roast \u2014 without the booze and expletives. So thin-skinned is he that he seems to spend as much time berating critical journalists, including this one, as he does his rivals for the presidential nomination. But let\u2019s not forget, Trump\u2019s career in public shaming is quite long.    Donald Trump didn\u2019t like what this columnist wrote about him. (Jonathan Capehart/The Washington Post)  At some point, Trump will have to move from insults to ideas. He will have to tell his supporters and those watching warily from the sidelines what he would actually do as president. And he will have to present concrete proposals expected of frontrunners. Even Cain understood this. I\u2019m sorry it took me four years to realize it.
