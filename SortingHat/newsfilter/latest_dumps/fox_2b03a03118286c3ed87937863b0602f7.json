In fact, we can\u2019t imagine many Silicon Valley types are pleased with Jeb\u2019s latest declarations this week that as president he\u2019ll kill net neutrality rules while at the same time bulking up the data collection powers of the National Security Agency.\nMUST READ: Huge iOS 9 security flaw lets anyone see your photos and contacts without a PIN \u2013 here\u2019s how to stop it\nLet\u2019s start with the NSA, which earlier this year had its powers to collect cell phone metadata without a warrant curbed. Naked Security has looked over Jeb\u2019s tech-related proposals and has found that giving the NSA more power to sweep up information has a prominent spot on the agenda.\n\u201cThe National Security Agency and Cyber Command are on the front lines of defending the United States against cyberthreats,\u201d Jeb! states in outlining his policies. \u201cWe must stop demonizing these quiet intelligence professionals and start giving them the tools they need. The Federal Bureau of Investigation also needs more resources to fight back against the onslaught of cybercrime.\u201d\nJeb has also bashed companies such as Apple, Google and Microsoft for supporting encryption on their software platforms because \u201cif you create encryption, it makes it harder for the American government to do its job \u2013 while protecting civil liberties \u2013 to make sure that evildoers aren\u2019t in our midst.\u201d\nBut increasing NSA powers and killing encryption aren\u2019t the only goodies that Jeb is leaving under Silicon Valley\u2019s tree \u2014 he also wants to gut net neutrality protections and leave Netflix and its users at the mercy of Comcast, Time Warner Cable and other little-loved ISPs. Additionally, he wants ISPs to have the right to charge tech companies more money in exchange for delivering their traffic.\n\n\u201cRather than enhancing consumer welfare, these rules prohibit one group of companies (ISPs) from charging another group of companies (content companies) the full cost for using their services,\u201d Bush\u2019s campaign writes.\nGutting net neutrality and allowing for pay-for-priority Internet \u201cfast lanes\u201d would, of course, undermine the structure of the open Internet and would make ISPs the gatekeepers for the applications and services we use.\nAt any rate, Jeb had better hope that telecom companies reward him with big, fat donations from these proposals, because we can\u2019t see many tech companies enthusiastically signing on.", "byline": "", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush \u2014 or just \u201cJeb!\u201d as he\u2019s called in his campaign signs \u2014 probably won\u2019t win the endorsement of the Electronic Frontier Foundation given his positions on tech policy.
