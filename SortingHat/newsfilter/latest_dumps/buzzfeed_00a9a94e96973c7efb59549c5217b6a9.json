The ACLU has called on President Obama to give Snowden immunity, allowing him to return to the United States from Russia without facing charges.The idea has received little interest from the White House, and, after Tuesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate here, essentially zero interest on the presidential campaign trail.There were some nuanced differences between how the various candidates on stage approached Snowden when asked about him, but every one of them \u2014 with the exception of Lincoln Chafee, the low-polling former governor of Rhode Island \u2014 said the former NSA contractor needs to be prosecuted.Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was especially tough on Snowden, saying his tactics ignored existing protections he had before his leaks.\u201cHe could have been a whistleblower. He could have gotten all of the protections of being a whistleblower. He could have raised all the issues that he has raised. And I think there would have been a positive response to that,\u201d she said. \u201cHe stole very important information that has unfortunately fallen into a lot of the wrong hands. So I don\u2019t think he should be brought home without facing the music.\u201dOne by one, the five candidates on stage were asked if Snowden should be prosecuted and they all said yes. Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont and Clinton\u2019s top rival for the nomination, said that the reforms to the American surveillance state made after information leaked by Snowden caused outrage in the U.S. and abroad should be taken into account.\u201cSnowden played a very important role in educating the American people to the degree in which our civil liberties and our constitutional rights are being undermined,\u201d Sanders said.But he stopped short of saying Snowden deserves immunity.\u201cHe did break the law, and I think there should be a penalty to that. But I think what he did in educating us should be taken into consideration,\u201d Sanders said.Two of the other candidates on stage, former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, also called for prosecution of Snowden, with various degrees of condemnation for his crimes as well as his decision to flee the country and accept the protections of the Russian government.Chafee has been an outlier on the issue, saying that Snowden should be brought home, and though he has largely avoided saying whether Snowden deserves jail time (including in Tuesday's Democratic debate), he has tweeted that Snowden has \"done his time.\"Overall, it\u2019s been a similar situation on the Republican side of the presidential contest. Even Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has been among the most critical of the NSA following the Snowden leaks, has declined to offer Snowden the amnesty privacy advocates support.\u201cI know most people would want me to say yes [to pardoning Snowden] and part of me says yes and part of me says we cannot have no rules,\u201d Paul told an audience in New Hampshire last week. \"We do have secrets \u2014 maybe too many \u2014 but we do have secrets that need to be protected. We have operatives who try to risk our lives to defend our country and he [Snowden] didn\u2019t reveal that, but you don\u2019t want people to reveal things like that.\u201dPaul said he\u2019d support some kind of \u201caccommodation\u201d for Snowden that required him to \u201cserve some sentence\u201d for the leaks.Other Republican candidates are tougher on Snowden, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio called him \u201ctraitor\u201d in 2013. In July, Jeb Bush expressly ruled out any legal accommodations for Snowden in a tweet.\u201cSnowden broke the law, recklessly endangered nat'l security, & fled to China/Russia,\u201d Bush tweeted. \"He should be given no leniency.\u201d\n\n", "title": "Every Major Presidential Candidate Wants To Prosecute Edward Snowden", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/evanmcsan/every-presidential-candidate-wants-to-prosecute-edward-snowd", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Joe Raedle", "Martin O'Malley", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Marco Rubio", "Jim Webb", "Bernie Sanders", "Edward Snowden"], "orgs": ["NSA", "ACLU", "Lincoln Chafee"], "authors": [{"author_id": 6685, "fullname": "evan mcmorris-santoro", "primary_org": "buzzfeed"}], "date_written": "2015-10-14 06:30:42", "org": "buzzfeed", "article_id": "00a9a94e96973c7efb59549c5217b6a9", "date_access": "2015-10-14 17:18:06.414266"}
