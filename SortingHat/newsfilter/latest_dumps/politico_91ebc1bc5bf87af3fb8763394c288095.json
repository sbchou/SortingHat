Sure, it\u2019s still early, but he fell to 11th place in the latest CNN/ORC poll, at 3 percent support from national GOP voters. I\u2019d give his fav/unfav breakdown but the poll didn\u2019t bother to ask it for Christie. http://cnn.it/1Nizhsx\nQUOTE OF THE DAY:\u00a0\u201cI am beginning to wonder if Christie makes it to New Hampshire.\u201d \u2014 @dick_nixon http://bit.ly/1hncv5Z\nWHERE\u2019S CHRISTIE? \u00a0New Hampshire.

Chris Christie\u2019s administration during her time at the Star-Ledger, is joining Reuters to cover the 2016 campaign. Gibson announced it on Facebook. \u201cVery excited for the new adventures,\u201d she wrote. She\u2019s had many adventures. After the Star-Ledger, she covered Congress for POLITICO, followed by a short stint in PR and then as a reporter for The International Business Times. http://on.fb.me/1PlEGgc\nFUN FACT: Donald Trump\u2019s sister, seniors Third Circuit Court of Appeal judge MaryAnne Trump Barry, is in the news now. http://nyti.ms/1TU4t0a. Back in 1982, she was in the news in New Jersey a federal prosecutor in the corruption case against Union City Mayor William Musto. You know, the case where a young Musto mentee-turned-government witness named Bob Menendez wore a bulletproof vest to testify against him. http://bit.ly/1TU4Dou\nSTATE NEWS\nA FRAMEWORK. AKA NO REAL AGREEMENT \u2014 \u201cChristie says state, feds will find \u2018framework\u2019 for cross-Hudson tunnel,\u201d by POLITICO NJ\u2019s Ryan Hutchins: \u201c\u2018The state of New Jersey supports the Gateway project and is committed to developing a framework with the Federal government to begin it,\u201d the joint statement said. \u2018We all recognize that the only way forward is equitable distribution of funding responsibility a the active participation of all parties. As commuters can attest, we cannot afford further delay.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/1hnbQSb\nCUOM...NO \u2014 \u201cNot Cuomo\u2019s tunnel, but New York\u2019s problem,\u201d by POLITICO NY\u2019s Dana Rubinstein: \u201cThe fact that Cuomo has gotten away with that argument for as long as he has is partly a testament to the circus-like atmosphere surrounding the presidential candidate across the river \u2026 A prolonged tunnel outage would have profound consequences for New York State\u2019s finances, its economy, its future.\u201d http://politi.co/1K5vLQr\nWHO\u2019S COMPTROLLS THE COMPTROLLER? \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u201cFriend hired by N.J. comptroller raised cronyism concerns,\u201d by NJ Advance Media\u2019s Christopher Baxter: \u201cThe Comptroller\u2019s Office is intended to be an independent guard of the public's wallet, charged with calling out government waste, fraud and abuse throughout the state. Its findings often prompt new laws and significant changes to policies. But three sources familiar with the matter said the March hiring of Kenneth Van Deventer, a former senior partner in a high-powered New Jersey law firm, caused concern over the appearance of a double standard inside the office.\u201d http://bit.ly/1NizJHn\n\u201cI WILL NOT FLIP FLOP\u201d \u00a0\u2014 \u201cChristie\u2019s Shift on Common Core Turns Off Some Donors,\u201d by The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Heather Haddon: \u201cMike Lilley, a former Goldman Sachs bond trader who supported Mr. Christie in the past, said the governor\u2019s denunciation of Common Core was one of a number of reasons he is now backing Mr. Bush. \u2018The fact that he\u2019s stood there firmly while Walker, Jindal and Christie have walked back, matters more,\u2019 Mr. Lilley said of Mr. Bush. \u2018You should like people who stand up for their principles.\u2019\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1K5tXHk\nBOOK REVIEW: \u201cThe Prize\u201d by Dale Russakoff, about the $100 million Mark Zuckerberg donation to Newark schools. Review by The New York Times\u2019 Alex Kotlowitz: \u201cYou can begin to see where this story\u2019s headed. Booker shows more interest in his own political career than he does in running his city. Christie hires an ideologue as his point person on the Newark schools. And Zuckerberg, a newcomer to philanthropy, seems frustrated by the inability to negotiate a union contract that would quickly raise the salaries of promising young teachers and pay substantial merit bonuses for high performers.\u201d http://nyti.ms/1K5uV6c $12.99 pre-order on Amazon: http://amzn.to/1ECa4kK\nLIKE, YEAH, HE MUST HAVE \u2014\u00a0\u201cUh, Did Chris Christie Forget About the Time He Deleted Bridgegate Text Messages?,\u201d by Gizmodo\u2019s Kate Nibbs: \u201cIt\u2019s bad politics for Christie to voluntarily draw attention to \u2018the bridge investigation\u2019\u2014aka Bridgegate\u2014aka the time Christie\u2019s team deliberately caused a traffic jam for political gain. It\u2019s one of the most flagrant embarrassments of his career. It\u2019d make more sense if Christie never even uttered the word \u201cbridge\u201d again, but aside from that, arguing that he\u2019d be pilloried for deleting digital communications related to Bridgegate is a weirdo move for Christie because his team did delete digital communications related to Bridgegate.\u201d http://bit.ly/1NizXOB\nGOOD THING SHE WON\u2019T BE BURIED IN HUDSON COUNTY \u2014\u00a0\u201c'Don\u2019t vote for Hillary,\u2019 Gloucester Twp. woman asks in obit,\u201d by Alex Young for NJ.com: \u201cElaine Fydrych died on Aug. 13, at the age of 63 \u2026 In her obituary published in the South Jersey Times on Aug. 16, Fydrych requested, \u201cIn lieu of flowers, please do not vote for Hillary Clinton.\u201d http://bit.ly/1NiAeBc\nMOODY\u2019S GETTING MOODY \u2014\u00a0\u201cN.J.\u2019s credit rating may fall more if court rules against state in lawsuit challenging Christie\u2019s pension-reform law,\u201d by The Record\u2019s Salvador Rizzo: \u201dAnalysts at Moody\u2019s issued a rare warning on Monday. New Jersey\u2019s \u2018A2\u2019 credit rating, one of the lowest in the country for a state, could go down once again if Christie received \u2018an unfavorable court decision in the pension litigation regarding COLAs,\u2019 Moody\u2019s said.\u201d http://bit.ly/1hnbXgx\nSHOCKER \u2014 \u201cMenendez rejects Iran deal, proposes an alternative,\u201d by POLITICO NJ\u2019s David Giambusso: \u201cMenendez, a frequent critic of Obama's foreign policy, said the deal is far too conciliatory and allows Iran too much relief from crippling economic sanctions without proper verification of its nuclear program. \u2018Advocates of the deal argue that a good deal that would have dismantled critical elements of Iran's nuclear infrastructure isn\u2019t attainable \u2014 that the Iranians were tough negotiators \u2014 and that despite our massive economic leverage and the weight of the international community we couldn\u2019t buy more than 10 years of inspection and verification in exchange for permanent sanctions relief, and for revoking Iran\u2019s pariah status,\u2019 Menendez said in the 6,173-word address. \u2018I don\u2019t believe that.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/1hnbqLr\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -The Record\u2019s Mike Kelly: \u201cFor a moment, it was easy to forget that this was the same man who is preparing to fight a 14-count federal indictment on political corruption charges that could not only destroy his political career but also send him to prison.\u201d http://bit.ly/1K5uCbw\nIT WAS THE BEST OF TIMES (for developers) \u2014 \u00a0\u201cA sign of the times for \u2018two cities\u2019,\u201d by The Jersey Journal\u2019s Earl Morgan: \u201cNew restaurants, shops and other amenities welcome the mostly young new Jersey City residents. Mayor Steve Fulop, a tireless booster of the city (as he should be), can be seen constantly on the city\u2019s cable TV municipal channel, microphone in hand, interviewing one of the latest proud owners of a new shop, artist studio, eatery, etc., further enhancing the image of the city as being the new, hip place to be. But there is another Jersey City, west and south of Downtown, where gunfire and violence herald the everyday reality of the residents living there. There are no images of the mayor on the municipal channel interviewing optimistic entrepreneurs, anxious to show off the wares in their shops or the specialties on their menus.\u201d http://bit.ly/1NiAvEg\nYOU DON\u2019T SAY \u2014 \u201cNew Jersey Tops Rankings of State Property Tax Rates\u201d http://bit.ly/1NiAQXD\nCHRISTIE WOULD NEVER ALLOW 2016 TO DICTATE POLICY IN NJ.

Christie would likely have to lobby U.S. lawmakers for financial support at the same time he tries to convince voters he\u2019s fiscally conservative, and as riders blast him on social media for killing a tunnel in 2010 that would have doubled peak service to Manhattan. http://bloom.bg/1NiCAQy\nTHIS IS HEATING UP \u2014 \u201cTrenton teen shot by police charged with gun possession, assaulting officers,\u201d by Keith Brown for NJ.com: \u201cRadazz Hearns, who is recovering from gunshot wounds to his legs and buttocks from the the Aug. 7 shooting, was charged with a single count each of aggravated assault, possession of a handgun and possession of a defaced firearm.\u201d http://bit.ly/1NiyGXU\nI THOUGHT IN LYNDHURST THEY SETTLED DISPUTES THROUGH JOUSTING \u2014 \u201cLyndhurst, mayor sued over alleged harassment,\u201d by The Record\u2019s Linda Moss: \u201cA former executive director of the Bergen County Housing Authority has filed suit against Lyndhurst and Mayor Robert Giangeruso, claiming that he was the victim of harassment \u2014 including an intimidating visit from the township police \u2014 for cooperating with an investigation into alleged federal housing-subsidy violations by the mayor.\u201d http://bit.ly/1hnaQO1\nPUT OUT TO A VERY NICE PASTURE - \u00a0\u201cLikely $77K pension, lifetime benefits for departing Jersey City agency chief,\u201d by The Jersey Journal\u2019s Terrence T.

Until the terms of that agreement are nailed down to their satisfaction, borough officials said they won\u2019t be able to issue up to $675 million in bonds to help finance American Dream \u2026 The council\u2019s decision not to act on the resolutions came just days after American Dream took a big step forward, with the Sports Authority agreeing to issue its own set of bonds, for up to $350 million, for the massive project at the Meadowlands Sports Complex.\u201d http://bit.ly/1K5uuJ3\nA NAVY SEAL CHRISTIE WON\u2019T CALL AN IDIOT \u2014 \u201cRepublicans in county race unveil campaign platform,\u201d by The Burlington County Times\u2019 Kristina Scala:\u00a0\u201c(Kate) Gibbs formerly served as the county GOP committee\u2019s executive director and is on the Rowan College at Burlington County College board of trustees.
