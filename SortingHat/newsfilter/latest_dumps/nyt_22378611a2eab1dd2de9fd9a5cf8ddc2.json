{"body": "JERUSALEM \u2013 Staking out the most extreme position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the crowded field of Republican candidates \u2013 one to the right of even Israel\u2019s conservative government \u2013 former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas said Wednesday that the entire occupied West Bank was part of Israel, leaving no room for a Palestinian state there. \n\nActually, Mr. Huckabee rejected both the terms \u201coccupied\u201d and \u201cWest Bank,\u201d repeatedly calling the territory by its biblical name, \u201cJudea and Samaria,\u201d and said all Americans should visit the area, as he did the day before for a fund-raiser in the Israeli settlement of Shiloh.\n\nOther Republican candidates for president, including former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, have criticized the Obama administration for pressing Israel to negotiate a peace deal with the Palestinians. But Mr. Huckabee more clearly disavowed the two-state solution that has been the cornerstone of American foreign policy for years. \n\nThough Mr. Huckabee has previously said if Palestinians want a state of their own they should go elsewhere, on Wednesday he ducked the question of what should become of the 2.5 million Palestinian residents of the West Bank,, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s a question for the Israelis and the Palestinians to negotiate.\u201d\n\nMr. Huckabee, who is so far gaining less traction than in his 2008 presidential bid, is the latest in a series of Republican hopefuls to make the pilgrimage to Israel. It is, in a way, part of an invisible primary to win the heart \u2013 and wallet \u2014 of Sheldon Adelson, the megadonor who has questioned the existence of the Palestinian peoplehood. \n\nScore one for Mr. Huckabee on terminology. When Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey apologized to Mr. Adelson last year for referring to his helicopter ride over the \u201coccupied territories,\u201d he was using a phrase anathema to Zionist hawks.\n\nBefore answering a reporter\u2019s question Wednesday about whether the international community was wrong to consider the West Bank illegally occupied, Mr. Huckabee distanced himself from the terms \u201cWest Bank,\u201d \u201cillegal\u201d and \u201coccupied.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsrael has more of a connections to lands in Judea and Samaria \u2013 specifically Shiloh, where I was last night, 3,500 years of connections to that very piece of property,\u201d he argued in a news conference at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Jerusalem. \u201cIn America, we have about a 400-year relationship to Manhattan. It would be as if I came and said, \u2018We need to end our occupation of Manhattan.\u2019 I\u2019m pretty sure most Americans would find that laughable.\u201d\n\nMr. Huckabee, who first visited Israel as a 17-year-old more than four decades ago and has been back dozens of times, also made a security argument for Israeli control of the West Bank. \n\n\u201cI cannot imagine that any American who comes here would somehow feel that the Israelis are out of line in wanting to have as safe a barrier between them and their sworn enemies as possible,\u201d he said, though it was unclear exactly which \u201csworn enemies\u201d he was referring to. Jordan, which abuts the West Bank, has had a peace treaty with Israel since 1994.\n\nLike Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida before him, Mr. Huckabee got a photo-op and meeting with Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\u201cHe is a Churchill in a world full of Chamberlains,\u201d Mr. Huckabee posted on Twitter afterward. He told reporters: \u201cThe prime minister in no way by his meeting endorsed me, but I have no problem endorsing him as a true leader in the fight against the Iranian deal.\u201d\n\nMr. Huckabee repeated his vow to repeal the nuclear deal  with Iran if elected, and stood by his comment last month that President Obama\u2019s foreign policy \u201cwill take the Israelis and march them to the door of the oven,\u201d a Holocaust reference that many political rivals, American Jews and Israelis denounced as inappropriate.\n\nHe also inadvertently went back in time when denouncing Iran\u2019s plan to buy new defensive weapons \u201cfrom the Soviet \u2026\u201d before catching himself and correcting, \u201cfrom the Russian government.\u201d \n\nMr. Huckabee deflected a question about the popularity of Donald Trump \u2013 \u201cthe one thing I\u2019m not going to do is help Donald Trump get any more publicity\u201d \u2013 and said he said he was unconcerned with his low polling numbers.  \n\nNoting that those leading in polls in the Republican battles in 2008 and 2012 dropped out before the end of the winter contests, he quoted his campaign manager as advising,  \u201cIf you\u2019re hot when it\u2019s hot, you\u2019ll be cold when it\u2019s cold.\u201d", "byline": "JODI RUDOREN", "description": "Staking out the most extreme position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the crowded field of Republican candidates, former Gov.
