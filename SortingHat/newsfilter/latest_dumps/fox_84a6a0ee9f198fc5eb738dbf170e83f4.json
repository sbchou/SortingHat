Yes, we will spill endless barrels of ink on Rand and Ted and Scott and Marco and Mike and Chris, and one of them could catch fire and win the GOP nomination. Bush is stuck at 10 percent in the latest poll in Iowa, tied with Rand Paul, with less than half the support of Scott Walker, at 24 percent.\n\nBut media expectations are critical in the framing of a contest this early, and Bush is widely seen as the man to beat. His team showed its savvy by sending reporters excerpts of his big Chicago speech Wednesday, making this the obvious lead:\n\n\u201cI love my father and my brother. I admire their service to the nation and the difficult decisions they had to make. But I am my own man \u2013 and my views are shaped by my\u00a0own thinking and own experiences.\u201d\n\nThat sounded a heckuva lot better than Jeb ducking a question about Iraq by saying he\u2019s not going to \u201crelitigate\u201d the past. Iraq and ISIS loom too large in this campaign for that kind of dodge to work.\n\nBush went on to bash the Obama team\u2019s foreign policy \u2014 always a safe bet for a Republican \u2014 with such language as \u201cwith grandiosity, they announce resets and disengage. Hashtag campaigns replace actual diplomacy and engagement.\u201d\n\nJeb\u2019s hashtag here would be #I\u2019mNotEitherGeorge.\n\nHe did go there in a Q&A session, saying \u201cthere were mistakes made in Iraq, for sure,\u201d but offering this balancing sentiment: \u201cMy brother's administration through the surge which was one of the most heroic acts of political courage.\u201d Another way in which the Iraq war will loom over his campaign is Jeb\u2019s decision to tap foreign policy advisers who worked for the Bushes \u2014 though that would be somewhat hard to avoid, since those were the last two Republican administrations.\n\nHis family lineage, obviously, is both his greatest strength and greatest weakness. Jeb was a two-term Florida governor, but it\u2019s his family that gives him instant credibility and access to a vast fundraising and political network \u2014 along with the baggage of a brother who invaded Iraq and presided over a massive financial crisis.\n\nJeb\u2019s ability to convince voters that 45 would not be like 43 or 41 \u2014 that he is, in fact, his own person \u2014 is the first major test of his candidacy.\n\nOne sign that the press views Jeb as formidable is this tweet from Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Halperin: \u201cI'm not predicting this or putting out odds, but it is now not impossible that Jeb effectively locks up his nomination before Hillary does.\u201d Another is this How He Did It piece in Politico about the Bush camp\u2019s last year:\n\n\u201cTheir strategy was to publicly downplay his interest in the race and avoid media attention, while quietly laying the groundwork for a launch that would catch much of Washington \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0and many of his potential rivals \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0flat-footed. While the much of the political world focused on Chris Christie, Rand Paul and even Bush\u2019s fellow Floridian Marco Rubio, Bush was quietly collecting political chits, developing a cohesive platform, and preparing for a fundraising blitz intended to grab the front-runner\u2019s chair, scare potential competitors like Mitt Romney and Christie, and put Bush on such a firm financial footing that he could devote more time to retail politics when it really counted.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Hillary (who has her own asset and liability in Clinton 42) is keeping a low profile, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the pundits from analyzing and opining on the makeup of her rapidly growing campaign staff. Which led to this question in the Daily Beast:\n\n\u201cDoes Hillary Clinton need binders full of women?\u201d\n\nYes, the Beast is worried that the woman who would shatter the ultimate glass ceiling hasn\u2019t hired enough chicks and could be running a \u201cwhite dude fest.\u201d Unlike in 2008, when the likes of Patti Solis Doyle and Maggie Williams were in charge, the top strategists so far include the likes of John Podesta, Robby Mook, Joel Benenson and on and on. (There are some female members of the inner circle, such as Huma Abedin and Mandy Grunwald, and Obama aide Jennifer Palmieri just signed on as communications director.)\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Dana Milbank makes the most of this:\n\n\u201cThis surely wasn\u2019t Clinton\u2019s intent, but her decision to re-brand Obama\u2019s frat house as her own puts out a message quite at odds with her candidacy: that women can\u2019t run a presidential campaign\u2026\n\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, Clinton lieutenants were surprised by the reaction to the early slate of male hires. They say they blundered in putting out the names of several men at once and were not making a fundamental shift from the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pantsuit to the Obama towel snappers \u2026\n\n\u201cThe woman who would be the first of her gender to reach the presidency has decided that it takes a whole lot of testosterone to win the White House.\u201d\n\nThis is silly-season stuff. A more important issue, in my view, is the Wall Street Journal reporting that donations from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Austria and Germany are flowing to the Clinton Foundation now that it\u2019s lifted a ban on accepting money from foreign governments.\n\nThe average voter doesn\u2019t care who\u2019s working in Hillaryland. But she and Jeb are are going to draw flyspecking coverage as long as the media handicappers see them as leading the field.\n\nClick for more Media Buzz\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmedia-buzz\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMedia Buzz, hosted by Howard Kurtz, airs on Sundays at 11AM and 5PM ET on Fox News Channel.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore on this show\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t", "byline": "", "description": "Here\u2019s the state of play for the 2016 presidential campaign:Jeb says he\u2019s not a clone of his brother and father, and Hillary is surrounding herself with \u2026 men.", "title": "Playing defense: Jeb\u2019s family problem, Hillary\u2019s man problem", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/jrKYqCKDWKo/", "topics": ["women", "campaign_finance", "terrorism"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Mitt Romney", "Mark Halperin", "Chris Christie", "Howard Kurtz", "Hillary Clinton", "Maggie Williams", "Patti Solis Doyle", "Huma Abedin", "Mandy Grunwald", "Joel Benenson", "Robby Mook", "John Podesta", "Scott Walker", "Dana Milbank", "Jennifer Palmieri"], "orgs": ["Sisterhood of the Traveling Pantsuit", "Rand", "Clinton Foundation", "GOP"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-02-19 10:00:10", "org": "fox", "article_id": "84a6a0ee9f198fc5eb738dbf170e83f4", "date_access": "2015-02-20 09:38:44.208653"}
