{"body": "Alluding to his \u201cpersonal experience\u201d grappling with addiction in his family, Jeb Bush on Wednesday held forth at a round-table discussion on substance abuse in New Hampshire, a state devastated by heroin\u2019s toll.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a question of a loss of life or a loss of the potential of one person, which is phenomenal,\u201d Mr. Bush said at the Catholic Medical Center in Manchester, N.H., flanked by local officials and health professionals. \u201cI can go into meetings and I know the families who have suffered because of this. It\u2019s very easy to see. You can see it drained out of your face.\u201d\n\nDuring Mr. Bush\u2019s first term as the governor of Florida, his daughter, Noelle, then 24, was charged with a felony for trying to fill a fraudulent prescription for Xanax. She spent time in a drug rehabilitation center, but served stints in jail after she was found with pills and later with crack cocaine in a shoe.\n\nMr. Bush\u2019s wife, Columba, has long taken up substance abuse prevention and treatment as a cause.\n\nThe subject of addiction, and particularly the heroin epidemic gripping wide swaths of the country, has surfaced frequently on the campaign trail, including at events for Hillary Rodham Clinton and Carly Fiorina, who lost a stepdaughter to drugs.\n\nMr. Bush spent much of the gathering on Wednesday listening to the local experts beside him, nodding intently. He weighed in occasionally to describe efforts he undertook in Florida, including the expansion of \u201cdrug courts\u201d aimed at addressing low-level drug crimes through treatment rather than incarceration.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for their addiction, they wouldn\u2019t be committing crimes,\u201d he said of the drug offenders.\n\nAt one point, a volunteer at a recovery center, who is himself in recovery, was asked to describe his experiences. He made clear that the issue of addiction would continue to loom large this election season.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the third presidential candidate I\u2019ve met,\u201d he told Mr. Bush. \u201cI\u2019m 41 days sober.\u201d", "byline": "MATT FLEGENHEIMER", "description": "Alluding to his \u201cpersonal experience\u201d grappling with addiction in his family, Jeb Bush on Wednesday held forth at a round-table discussion on substance abuse in New Hampshire, a state devastated by heroin\u2019s toll.", "title": "First Draft: Jeb Bush Turns Personal in Confronting Heroin\u2019s Toll in New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/09/30/jeb-bush-turns-personal-in-confronting-heroins-toll-in-new-hampshire/", "topics": ["personality", "economy"], "people": ["Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Jeb Bush", "Carly Fiorina", "Columba Bush"], "orgs": ["Catholic Medical Center"], "authors": [{"author_id": 358, "fullname": "matt flegenheimer", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-09-30 19:25:41", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "6d21d2e54ee8797e95c69cadff1130b0", "date_access": "2015-09-30 19:01:59.599546"}
