I know that's important to you,\" Palin said.\n Palin mentioned Trump's recent confrontation with Univision's Jorge Ramos, using it as a segue into a conversation about \"gotcha\" questions from the press. Palin, who was on the 2008 GOP presidential ticket with Sen. John McCain, criticized some media outlets during that election cycle. \n During the interview, Trump highlighted his appreciation of both the bible, and one of his own books saying, \"It actually started when somebody held up my book, \"The Art of the Deal.\" I said, 'That's my second favorite book, but my first favorite book by far, is the bible.\u2019\"\n This is not the first time the two have expressed appreciation for each other publically. In July, Trump said that he would love to appoint the former Alaska governor to a cabinet post.\n\n                                            By \nPOLITICO Magazine\n\n\n                                            By \n                                                    Mitch Landrieu\n                                             and \n                                                    Judith Rodin\n\n\n                                            By \nBen Wofford\n\n\n                                            By \nMelinda Liu\n\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Palin praises a subdued Trump during interview", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/donald-trump-sarah-palin-interview-213159", "topics": ["personality", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Katy O'Donnell", "Burgess Everett", "Sean Parnell", "Jorge Ramos", "Arthur Allen", "Matthew Korade", "Jennifer Shutt", "Helena Bottemiller Evich", "Henry C.
