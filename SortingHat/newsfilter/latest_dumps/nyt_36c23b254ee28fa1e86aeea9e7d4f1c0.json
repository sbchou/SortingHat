{"body": "Donald Trump has no problem speaking his mind. His security detail, however, has had some difficulty allowing others to speak theirs, at least according to a recent lawsuit.\n\nOn September 3, a group of demonstrators\u00a0stood outside Mr. Trump\u2019s Manhattan headquarters to protest the candidate\u2019s criticisms of immigrants. They waved a sign that changed the Republican presidential candidate\u2019s slogan from \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d to \u201cMake America Racist Again.\u201d\u00a0 Some of the protesters wore white hoods, a reminder that David Duke, formerly the leader of the Ku Klux Klan, praised Mr. Trump and his comments on immigration earlier this year.\n\nHaving none of it, Mr. Trump\u2019s beefy security team arrived and Keith Schiller, his chief of security, grabbed one of the signs, tore it and then engaged in a scuffle with at least one of the protesters, according to a lawsuit the protesters later filed.\n\nAlan Garten, the executive vice president and general counsel for The Trump Organization, said Mr. Trump\u2019s security guards were only concerned that the sign was blocking access to the sidewalk, that they asked the protesters to move it before removing it themselves, and that Mr. Schiller only struck a protester when he felt the protester\u2019s hands on his waist, near his gun.\n\nNow a Bronx Supreme Court Judge has ordered the Trump team to allow protesters on the public sidewalk and refrain from interfering with their banners. As Judge Fernando Tapia wrote in Monday\u2019s decision, the sidewalk is a public space. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers argued that his team needed to defend that space for those arriving in car services or taxis. But by that logic, the judge wrote, property owners \u201cwhenever they wish, would be free to curtail all speech occurring on the sidewalk in front of their property which that particular owner finds offensive.\u201d\n\nOffensive speech, as all New Yorkers know, is a valuable part of the cityscape.\u00a0 Developers who don\u2019t use union workers often find a huge rat balloon facing their building site.\u00a0 Protesters usually know to stay on the public sidewalk, which Judge Tapia noted has traditionally been a \u201cquintessential public forum.\u201d\n\nMr. Garten said Mr. Trump\u2019s camp has no problem with the judge\u2019s order, or with lawful protests on the sidewalk. \u201cThis is not, for us, a First Amendment issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a safety issue.\u201d\n\nWith the judgement in hand, protesters can be expected to continue demonstrating in front of the Trump establishment, confined, of course, to the sidewalks.", "byline": "ELEANOR RANDOLPH", "description": "A judge says Donald Trump\u2019s security team must allow protesters on the sidewalk in front of Mr. Trump\u2019s headquarters.", "title": "Taking Note: A Win for Anti-Trump Protesters", "url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/a-win-for-anti-trump-protesters/", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "David Duke", "Alan Garten", "Keith Schiller"], "orgs": ["The Trump Organization", "Ku Klux Klan"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30403, "fullname": "eleanor randolph", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-10-21 03:06:56", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "36c23b254ee28fa1e86aeea9e7d4f1c0", "date_access": "2015-10-21 02:44:05.516844"}
