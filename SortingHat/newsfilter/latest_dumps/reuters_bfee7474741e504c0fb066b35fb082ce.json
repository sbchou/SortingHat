{"body": "(Repeats story with no change to text)\nBy Steve Holland\nWASHINGTON, July 31 (Reuters) - With Donald Trump sucking up\nthe oxygen on the campaign trail, these are stressful days for\nthe group of Republican candidates who, try as they might, may\nnot qualify for their party's first presidential debate in\nCleveland next week.\nUnder controversial rules laid down by debate host Fox News\nand backed by the Republican National Committee (RNC), only the\n10 top-polling candidates will share the prime-time stage on\nAug. 6. But which polls Fox News executives will use is unclear,\nleading some candidates and campaigns to question the process.\nWith the Republican field the largest in history, fitting\nthem on stage presents an unprecedented challenge. To have all\n17 Republican candidates in the 2016 race share the prime-time\nstage was deemed too many to let all get sufficient time to\nspeak, potentially leading to a bickering family collage of\nfinger-pointing and fulminating.\nReal-estate mogul Trump currently leads the field and, with\nhis out-sized personality, is getting the most media attention.\nFor the candidates at the bottom of the polls, being kept\nout of the big event could doom their chances and even\naccelerate their departure from the race.\nFormer Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina, the\nonly woman in the Republican field, is scrambling to reach as\nmany Republican voters as possible to increase her visibility in\na way that will get her on the prime-time debate stage.\nIt is an uphill battle and she is more likely to share the\nstage with her six low-polling rivals, who are to be relegated\nto an hour-long debate in an earlier time slot on Fox News that\nwill have fewer viewers. Her displeasure with how the debate is\nbeing shaped was evident in a conference call she did with\nsupporters on Thursday.\n\"Look, the debate process, who knows what it is anymore?\"\nFiorina said. \"I mean, the rules are unclear.\"\nSeveral officials from Republican campaigns said they are\nconcerned that Fox News has lacked clarity and transparency in\nits debate preparations, and that this could provide more reason\nfor complaints from the seven who don't make it.\nOne party source said the Republican National Committee\nshould have insisted on having two debates instead of one, and\nrandomly split the field so that everyone could have some\nprime-time exposure.\n\nTOP 10 MYSTERY\nFox News relaxed one criteria this week, removing a\nrequirement that its debate for the low-pollers have at least 1\npercent support in polling. This will allow all the announced\ncandidates to participate.\nA Fox spokeswoman had no comment on criticism of the\nselection process.\nRNC chief strategist Sean Spicer wrote in a Wall Street\nJournal opinion article this week that the \"Republican Party\nsuffers from an abundance of riches\" and that a way has been\nfound for all to get some debate time.\n\"Is the arrangement perfect? No. It is, however, the most\ninclusive setup in history,\" he wrote.\nFox News has yet to identify the five polls to be considered\nin choosing the top 10. A flood of new polls are expected in\ncoming days as news organizations and polling organizations seek\nto have a say in the process.\nThe identities of the top 10 are to be released publicly\nlate on Tuesday afternoon.\nThe most recent Reuters-Ipsos poll identified the bottom\nseven as Texas Senator Ted Cruz, former Pennsylvania Senator\nRick Santorum, Fiorina, former New York Governor George Pataki,\nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and South Carolina Senator\nLindsey Graham.\nThe survey was done before former Virginia Governor Jim\nGilmore entered the race on Wednesday, becoming the 17th. He is\namong the low-polling Republicans.\nOther polls have Cruz with enough support to gain entry to\nthe debate and that former Texas Governor Rick Perry would miss\nthe cut.\nFiorina said whatever happens, she will fight on. She noted\nthat previous presidents like Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan had\nbeen written off at early stages of their candidacies.\nThose in danger of being cut are trying to raise their\nvisibility enough to push their poll numbers higher. Many are\ndoing TV interviews to make their case.\n\"You only need a bump of a couple of points and you get in.\nThat's the absurdity of this thing,\" said Larry Sabato,\npolitical analyst at the University of Virginia.\n\n (Reporting By Steve Holland; editing by Stuart Grudgings)", "byline": "", "description": "WASHINGTON, July 31 (Reuters) - With Donald Trump sucking up\nthe oxygen on the campaign trail, these are stressful days for\nthe group of Republican candidates who, try as they might, may\nnot qualify for their party's first presidential debate in\nCleveland next week.", "title": "RPT-Stressful times for low-polling Republicans who may miss debate stage", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/cyclicalconsumergoodsNews/~3/Dk0QcsqLFSw/usa-election-republicans-idUSL1N10B01120150731", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "personality"], "people": ["Rick Santorum", "Sean Spicer", "Lindsey Graham", "Rick Perry", "Larry Sabato", "Ronald Reagan", "Donald Trump", "George Pataki", "Stuart Grudgings", "Steve Holland", "Bobby Jindal", "Carly Fiorina", "Jimmy Carter", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": ["RNC", "Republican Party", "Republican National Committee", "RPT", "Ipsos"], "authors": [{"author_id": 33346, "fullname": "reuters editorial", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-07-31 12:00:00", "org": "reuters", "article_id": "bfee7474741e504c0fb066b35fb082ce", "date_access": "2015-07-31 11:50:13.937932"}
