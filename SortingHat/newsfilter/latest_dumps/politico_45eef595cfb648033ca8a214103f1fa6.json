{"body": "Getty\nBy Daniel Strauss\n8/3/15 2:29 PM EDT\nWhat goes around comes around, as the saying goes.\nA cellphone number belonging to real estate mogul Donald Trump became public knowledge on Monday.\nStory Continued Below\nGawker.com published the number.\nTrump\u2019s campaign confirmed that it was indeed a cellphone number belonging to the Republican presidential candidate, albeit one that he doesn\u2019t use anymore.\nA call to the number immediately goes to voice mail after a voice says, \u201cPlease leave your name and message and we\u2019ll get back to you shortly.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very old number. This is not one he uses. Mr. Trump has several numbers so this is not an issue,\u201d the campaign said in a statement to POLITICO on Monday.\nThe release of Trump\u2019s cellphone number comes a few weeks after he publicly shared Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s own cellphone number. Gawker\u2019s rationale for releasing the number was what\u2019s fair is fair.\n\u201cSince Trump, in his considered political judgment, has decided that opening up a direct, personal channel of communications between his supporters and his primary opponents is a noble campaign tactic, we think it\u2019s only fair and right that Republican primary voters be able to reach out to Trump himself,\u201d Gawker.com\u2019s Sam Biddle wrote.\nAlso on POLITICO\nELIZA COLLINS\nPOLITICO was able to reach Graham after Trump shared his number.\n\u201cI wonder what caused that,\u201d Graham said at the time. \u201cWhen it comes to the Donald, nothing surprises me anymore. It\u2019s just too bad, really.\u201d\nGraham\u2019s campaign declined to comment on Gawker publishing Trump\u2019s cellphone number.\nBy PAUL GOLDMAN  and  MARK J.
