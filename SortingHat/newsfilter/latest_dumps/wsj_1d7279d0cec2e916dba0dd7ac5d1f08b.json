{"body": "Progressive New York Mayor  Bill de Blasio and Socialist Paris Mayor  Anne Hidalgo found common cause on a shared threat while attending a recent climate-change conference at the Vatican. \u201cThe people of our cities don\u2019t like the notion of those who are particularly wealthy and powerful dictating the terms to a government elected by the people,\u201d Mr. de Blasio declared. \u201cAs a multibillion-dollar company, Uber thinks it can dictate to government.\u201d\nBut before Mr. de Blasio could return from Rome, he learned that people really don\u2019t like when politicians try to take away their favorite app for getting around the government\u2019s taxi cartel. The mayor was forced to drop his plan to limit Uber to a 1% annual increase in cars, far below the current rate. \nIt\u2019s hard to see why Mr. de Blasio thought that would be good politics. Two million New Yorkers have downloaded the Uber app onto their mobile devices\u2014a quarter of the city\u2019s population and more than twice the number of citizens who voted for Mr. de Blasio. But it\u2019s easy to understand why he views Uber as an ideological threat. A tipping point is in sight where big-government politicians can no longer deprive consumers of new choice made possible by technology\u2014whether for car rides, car sharing or home rentals. Mr. de Blasio\u2019s experience should encourage other politicians to sign up for innovation.\nUber has become a wedge issue. The Conservative mayor of London,  Boris Johnson, took the opposite approach from Mr. de Blasio. \u201cYou are dealing with a huge economic force which is consumer choice, and the taxi trade needs to recognize that,\u201d he said recently. He told a gathering of taxi drivers in London: \u201cI\u2019m afraid it is a tragic fact that there are now more than a million people in this city who have the Uber app.\u201d When cabbies objected that Uber drivers were undercutting their prices, Mr. Johnson replied: \u201cYes, they are. It\u2019s called the free market.\u201d\nPresidential candidates are divided as well.  Hillary Clinton implicitly criticized Uber in her campaign speech on economic policy, saying the \u201cso-called \u2018gig economy\u2019\u00a0\u201d is \u201craising hard questions about workplace protections and what a good job will look like.\u201d \nBy contrast, Florida\u2019s Sen.  Marco Rubio has a chapter in his presidential campaign book, \u201cAmerican Dreams,\u201d titled \u201cAn America Safe for Uber.\u201d He describes explaining to a college class he taught how Miami had banned Uber cars. \u201cAs my progressive young students listened to me explain why government was preventing them from using their cell phones to get home from the bars on Saturday night, I could see their minds change,\u201d he writes. \u201cBefore I knew it, I was talking to a bunch of 20- and 21-year-old anti-government activists.\u201d\nFor its part, Uber hired  David Plouffe, who managed  Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, to help wage the political fight. Mr. de Blasio didn\u2019t know what hit him. He justified the cap on Uber cars by blaming the company for traffic congestion, citing a 0.84-mile-an-hour decline in Manhattan\u2019s average vehicle speed between 2010 and 2014. That took chutzpah, given that the mayor himself pushed through a reduction in the speed limit to 25 miles an hour from 30. It also ignored the numerous bike lanes and pedestrian roadblocks the city built during that period. \nUber made the fight personal by adding a \u201cde Blasio\u201d mode to its app, estimating how long the wait would be under the proposed law. Model  Kate Upton tweeted in Uber\u2019s support.  Errol Louis wrote in the Daily News that \u201cMayor de Blasio is leaving N.Y.ers stranded\u2014like a black man trying to hail a cab uptown.\u201d An Uber spokesman picked up the theme: \u201cThere is nothing progressive about protecting millionaire taxi [campaign] donors who mistreat drivers and discriminate against riders.\u201d\nNew York taxi medallions have plummeted in value due to competition. Their owners made the fatal miscalculation of assuming City Hall would always protect them by limiting the number of cabs. They failed to anticipate how new technology eventually disrupts every industry. Apps like Uber give consumers better protection, prices and services than regulators ever can.\nGovernment-enforced cartels fall faster and harder to disruptive innovation than most businesses. When change comes, it is more dramatic than in industries that already have competition. The fate of taxis is a warning to other regulated industries that new technologies always give consumers more choice. And citizens can always make the choice to vote for candidates who embrace innovation over regulations that protect entrenched interests.
