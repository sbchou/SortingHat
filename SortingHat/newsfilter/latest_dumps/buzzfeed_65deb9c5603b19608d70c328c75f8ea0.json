The first occurred at the Netroots Nation gathering in Phoenix last month.\n\nHere's the audio:\nw.soundcloud.com", "title": "Ted Cruz: If Bernie Sanders Can't Stand Up To BLM, How Can He Stand Up To Putin?", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/meganapper/ted-cruz-if-bernie-sanders-cant-stand-up-to-blm-how-can-he-s", "topics": ["economy", "campaign_finance", "personality"], "people": ["Bernie Sanders", "Michael Medved", "Charlie Leight", "Vladimir Putin", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": [], "authors": [{"author_id": 27651, "fullname": "megan apper", "primary_org": "buzzfeed"}], "date_written": "2015-08-20 18:08:00", "org": "buzzfeed", "article_id": "65deb9c5603b19608d70c328c75f8ea0", "date_access": "2015-08-20 17:10:57.714855"}
