{"body": "When Republican presidential candidates gather in California for their second debate next week, it could be a little awkward. The ability to deliver a well-crafted political insult is a necessary skill when it comes to running for office, but this week the zingers have rapidly zagged from the political to the personal to the nasty.\n\nIn 2008, then-Senator Barack Obama was criticized for being overly harsh when he said with a smirk that Hillary Rodham Clinton, his opponent for the Democratic nomination, was \u201clikable enough.\u201d\u00a0Such a jab seems like a pat on the back compared to the verbal fisticuffs displayed by this year\u2019s crop of Republican hopefuls, in large part thanks to the emergence of Donald J. Trump.\n\nIn an interview published Wednesday, Mr. Trump suggested\u00a0that Carly Fiorina was too ugly to be president. \u201cLook at that face!\u201d Trump told Rolling Stone magazine as Ms. Fiorina appeared on TV. \u201cWould anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president.\u201d\u00a0He later said that he was talking about her \u201cpersona.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also unloaded on Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who is gaining on him in several polls. On Wednesday, Mr. Carson said\u00a0that Mr. Trump did not appear to be humble enough to a God-fearing Christian. Mr. Trump responded by suggesting that Mr. Carson was an \u201cO.K.\u201d doctor had no business running for president and, slamming him and Jeb Bush at the same time, claimed\u00a0that Mr. Carson made Mr. Bush look like \u201cthe Energizer bunny.\u201d\n\nLooking to jump into the fray, and perhaps get some much needed publicity, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana delivered the toughest\u00a0attack on Mr. Trump to date. In a speech to the National Press Club, Mr. Jindal called Mr. Trump a \u201cnarcissist\u201d and an \u201cegomaniacal madman\u201d who had no principles. For good measure, he later went on CBS and said that Mr. Trump\u2019s hairstyle looks like a squirrel is sitting on his head.\n\nMeanwhile, Mrs. Clinton, who has avoided criticizing her Democratic opponents, was happy to mock Gov. Scott Walker, the Wisconsin Republican, this week. In a speech in his home state, she raised questions about his leadership and his choice of transportation and implied that his macho image was just an act.\n\n\u201cGovernor Walker thinks because he busts unions, starves universities, guts public education, demeans women, scapegoats teachers, nurses and firefighters, he is some kind of tough guy on his motorcycle \u2014 a real leader,\u201d she said.\n\nFiring back on Twitter, Mr. Walker pointed to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s affinity for the high life.\n\n\u2014 Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) September 10, 2015\n\n\n\nAlthough this week\u2019s exchanges might seem mean, they are far from unprecedented.\n\nA young Theodore Roosevelt once called former President Benjamin Harrison \u201ca cold-blooded, narrow-minded, prejudiced, obstinate, timid, old psalm-singing Indianapolis politician.\u201d\n\nWhen Gerald Ford faced off against Ronald Reagan for the Republican presidential nomination in 1976, he made Mr. Reagan\u2019s hair color a campaign issue, saying, \u201cRonald Reagan doesn\u2019t dye his hair, he\u2019s just prematurely orange.\u201d\n\nAnd in 1988, Ann Richards delivered a stinging blow to George H. W. Bush, then the nominee of the Republican Party, when she said during the Democratic convention, \u201cPoor George, he can\u2019t help it; he was born with a silver foot in his mouth.\u201d\n\nPolitical insults can sometimes backfire, and there were signs this week that Mr. Trump might be taking things too far. The conservative talk-radio host Rush Limbaugh, who has praised Mr. Trump\u2019s moxie, suggested that Mr. Trump should\u00a0get back to the issues. Some callers to the show suggested that the billionaire developer\u00a0was starting to sound like a schoolyard bully.\n\nBut Mr. Trump, the author of a book entitled \u201cThe Art of the Comeback,\u201d has so far shown little interest in tempering his responses.\n\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2015\n\n\n\n\u00a0", "byline": "ALAN RAPPEPORT", "description": "When Republican presidential candidates meet for their second debate next week, the gathering could get uncomfortable for the candidates firing off one zinger after another.", "title": "First Draft: A Week of Insults as Candidates Turn Nasty and Personal", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/09/11/a-week-of-insults-as-candidates-turn-nasty-and-personal/", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["Rush Limbaugh", "Benjamin Harrison", "Ronald Reagan", "George H.
