And until he flatly rules it out, the other potential candidates for the chamber\u2019s top job \u2014 a list nearly two dozen names long and growing \u2014 are forced to proceed gingerly. One breath they're gauging support, the next they're letting would-be backers know their interest could be temporary if the Ways and Means Committee chairman gets in. \nStory Continued Below\nThe best example, perhaps, is Texas Re\u00a6p. Bill Flores. The third-term Texas Republican who chairs the Republican Study Committee sent a letter to his House colleagues on Monday, indicating he was considering a campaign for speaker \u2013 only if Ryan doesn\u2019t run. \nFlores said he would \u201cwithdraw from the race if Paul Ryan elects to run for Speaker and I will throw my support to him for this position.\u201d And in a separate letter to the entire House Republican Conference, Flores reiterated that \u201cit is important for me to unequivocally state that I will not run for and/or I will withdraw from this race should Chairman Ryan elect to run; and, I will give him my full support in this effort.\u201d\n\nAnalysis\n\n            By \nDavid Rogers\n\nRyan (R-Wis.), the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is saying very little. Brendan Buck, his spokesman, preemptively tweeted Monday morning that this week will be quiet. \n\u201cBefore you ask, nothing has changed and I don't anticipate any news this week,\u201d he wrote. \nBuck is right. The race for speaker is practically frozen until Congress returns on Oct. 20 from a weeklong recess. The fact is it's impossible for the election to unfold with lawmakers fanned out across the country.\nContenders for the job will have to spend a lot of time cajoling support in meetings, candidate forums and phone calls. Nearly every caucus will hold its own candidate forum \u2013 leaders of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, for one, have said they expect Ryan to meet with them if he runs. \nAs Ryan mulls whether he should get in, several candidates are poking around, trying to measure potential support. Five Texans are considering a race: Flores, Mike McCaul, Mike Conaway, Mac Thornberry and Pete Sessions. All of them would drop their bid if Ryan got in the race. They all, too, currently hold leadership positions: Conaway chairs the Agriculture Committee, Thornberry heads the Armed Services Committee, Sessions is the Rules Committee chairman and Flores leads the Republican Study Committee.\n\nCongress\n\n            By \nJake Sherman\n\nTennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn has told people she\u2019d consider a run if Ryan takes a pass, and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo is also reaching out to test support across the conference. While Blackburn and Pompeo are both relatively junior compared to the rest of the potential field, they have upside in an internal race. Blackburn would likely be the only woman running. And Pompeo \u2013 a graduate of West Point and Harvard Law School \u2013 can position himself as a conservative who is strong on defense. He is on the Intelligence Committee, and while he\u2019s relatively junior, some Republicans say he could help bridge the gap between the Freedom Caucus and the rank and file. \nAs Flores made his interest in the job official on Monday, he reached out to members who supported his candidacy for RSC chairman, asking them if they would serve as his whips. His letter said the party should work to \"bridge our differences\" and called for \"rules that encourage all members to be fully empowered in the House\u2019s legislative processes.\"\nHe also asked for prayers during this turbulent time for the GOP.\n\"If we all spend enough time on our knees praying for each other,\" Flores wrote, \"we can heal our divisions and truly work together to restore America to the 'Shining City on a Hill' that Reagan frequently challenged us to become.\"\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Until he decides, other hopefuls for the job are proceeding very gingerly.", "title": "Ryan freezes race for speaker", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/paul-ryan-house-speaker-republicans-frozen-214683", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Henry C.
