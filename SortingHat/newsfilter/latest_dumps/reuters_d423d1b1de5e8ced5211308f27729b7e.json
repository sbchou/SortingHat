{"body": "(Adds background on drug companies, previous Clinton comments)\nBy Emily Stephenson\nWASHINGTON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Democratic presidential\ncandidate Hillary Clinton will unveil a plan this week to cap\nout-of-pocket costs for specialty drugs, her campaign said on\nMonday, as a tweet from Clinton accusing companies of \"price\ngouging\" sent biotech stocks tumbling.\nClinton was expected to allude to her plan in public remarks\non Monday and spell it out in more detail at a health-care forum\nin Des Moines, Iowa, on Tuesday, an official with her campaign\nsaid.\nClinton, who leads the field seeking the Democratic Party's\nnomination for president in the November 2016 election,\nmaintained her front-runner status with about 48 percent of\nsupport in a recent Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll.\nStill, she has been under pressure to take more populist\nstances to widen her lead over the current second-place\nDemocratic candidate, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. Clinton could\nface more hurdles if Vice President Joe Biden enters the race.\nSanders already has introduced legislation in the Senate to\ncrack down on what he called \"skyrocketing\" increases in\nprescription drug prices.\nOn Monday, shares in biotech companies such as Immunogen\n and Gilead Sciences dropped after Clinton\ntweeted that steep prices for specialty drugs were \"outrageous.\"\n\"Tomorrow I'll lay out a plan to take it on,\" she said. She\npointed to a New York Times story about a 62-year-old drug to\ntreat a deadly parasitic infection that soared in price to $750\na tablet from $13.50 after the drug was bought in August by a\nstart-up pharmaceutical company.\n\"Big Pharma\" companies have long been criticized for\nsteadily raising prices of prescription medicines in the United\nStates, unrestrained by price controls that are common in other\ncountries.\nAlso controversial has been a strategy of raising prices for\nolder drugs after being acquired by other companies. Examples\ninclude the heart medications Nitropress and Isuprel, which were\nbought by Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc this year.\nClinton's comments on Monday were her first about how to\ntackle high drug prices, but she has talked about the problems\nfacing consumers before.\nIn June, Clinton said drug companies that benefit from a\nPacific trade pact should offer bulk discounts on products to\nU.S. government programs such as Medicare.\nThe iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF, which tracks an\nindex of biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks, was down about\n4.3 percent at 341.48 on Monday afternoon. The Nasdaq biotech\nindex skidded 4.3 percent.\n\n\nFor more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters\nblog, \"Tales from the Trail\" (here).\n\n (Additional reporting by Ransdell Pierson in New York and\nAmanda Becker in Little Rock, Arkansas; Editing by Leslie Adler)", "byline": "", "description": "WASHINGTON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will unveil a plan this week to cap out-of-pocket costs for specialty drugs, her campaign said on Monday, as a tweet from Clinton accusing companies of \"price gouging\" sent biotech stocks tumbling.", "title": "UPDATE 1-Democrat Clinton to unveil plan to fight drug 'price gouging'", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/financialsNews/~3/oaOpdM0QZBs/story01.htm", "topics": ["trade", "campaign_finance", "economy", "immigration"], "people": ["Emily Stephenson", "Joe Biden", "Hillary Clinton", "Leslie Adler", "Bernie Sanders", "Ransdell Pierson", "Amanda Becker"], "orgs": ["Gilead Sciences", "Senate", "Democratic Party", "iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF", "Trail", "Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc"], "authors": [{"author_id": 33346, "fullname": "reuters editorial", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-09-21 20:40:57", "org": "reuters", "article_id": "d423d1b1de5e8ced5211308f27729b7e", "date_access": "2015-09-21 20:01:18.547788"}
