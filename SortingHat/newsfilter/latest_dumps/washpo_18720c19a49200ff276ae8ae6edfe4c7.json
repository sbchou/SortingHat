{"body": "  RICHMOND \u2014 Hundreds of people flocked to a state elections board meeting Tuesday to object to changing voter registration rules to make questions about citizenship and criminal history optional. Critics said the change would make it easier for felons and illegal immigrants to vote, although those in favor said those concerns were overblown. \u201cWe\u2019re opening up huge, huge doors for opportunity for fraud,\u201d said Charlie Judd, who was chairman of the Virginia State Board of Elections during the term of Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R). The board is considering allowing people registering to vote to skip several questions on the application, including those asking whether those registering are U.S. citizens or felons whose voting rights have not been restored. They would still have to affirm, by signing the form, that they are citizens and otherwise eligible. Currently, registrars can reject would-be voters if they do not check boxes to indicate their citizenship and felon status. The Department of Elections staff has proposed making responses to those individual questions optional, saying it would simplify the registration form. Elections officials said the change would mean they would not have to reject applications simply because someone forgets to check a box or two. The proposal met with nearly universal skepticism on Tuesday \u2014 from registrars and elections officials with practical concerns, and from politicians and ordinary Virginians with big-picture worries that play into the nation\u2019s fiercest political debates. Illegal immigration, voter fraud and the restoration of felons\u2019 right to vote \u2014 even the usurpation of legislative power by an overbearing executive branch \u2014 all loomed large over an hour-long hearing to discuss a seemingly arcane administrative matter. Republicans suggested that the proposed change was Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s way of inflating Democratic voter rolls ahead of the 2016 presidential election. McAuliffe (D) has kept a low profile on the issue, with his spokesman directing questions to the Department of Elections.  [Proposed changes to Virginia voter registration stirs fears among GOP]  Some Democrats said concerns over the proposed change were overblown and rooted in what they described as a broad GOP voter-suppression strategy. \u201cThe real threat to the integrity of our elections is politicians who throw up more barriers to voting,\u201d Anna Scholl, executive director of ProgressVA, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting any politician would throw around wild and unfounded accusations to hide their true motivation: opposition to any proposal to make it easier for every eligible Virginia voter to cast a ballot.\u201d Scholl was one of just a handful of people to testify in favor of the change. Some of the speakers, including Fairfax County Electoral Board Chairman Stephen M. Hunt wanted to resolve a puzzling inconsistency: The new form says the application can be rejected if the applicant does not answer certain questions marked with an asterisk. Those include the citizenship and felony questions, which would, in fact, become optional. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives a false message.\u201d Said Greg Riddlemoser, registrar for Stafford County: \u201cI would ask you to throw this whole thing away.\u201d The board could take action on the proposal as early as September. The public hearing took place at a suburban Richmond hotel, where registrars and elections staff from across the state had gathered for their annual convention. Hundreds more were drawn there by state Sen. Thomas A. Garrett Jr. (R-Buckingham) and Republican state Senate candidate Amanda Chase, who is seeking to represent an area on the outskirts of Richmond.
