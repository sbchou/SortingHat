{"body": "AP Photo\nBy Daniel Strauss\n7/8/15 1:46 PM EDT\nUpdated 7/8/15 2:09 PM EDT\nDonald Trump is almost completely shutting the door on the possibility of switching to a third-party presidential bid in the 2016 presidential cycle \u2014 almost.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had many, many people ask me about running as an independent,\u201d Trump said in an interview Tuesday with The Washington Examiner\u2019s Byron York. \u201cMy sole focus is to run as a Republican. I\u2019m a conservative Republican.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\nStill, Trump isn\u2019t ruling out running under a different party banner.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m not thinking about right now,\u201d Trump continued in the interview. He added that he\u2019s \u201cdoing well within the Republican ranks, and that gives us the best chance of defeating Hillary Clinton.\u201d\nThe media mogul\u2019s comments come as he continues to lead most of the 2016 Republican primary field in the polls even as he deals with the reaction to his comments that countries like Mexico are sending rapists and murderers to the U.S.\nNBC and Macy\u2019s have already stopped doing business with Trump. The latest company to break with him is PVH Corp., which partners with Trump to produce a clothing line.\nAlso on POLITICO\nALEX ISENSTADT\nIn a statement Tuesday, a PVH spokesperson said: \u201cMr. Trump and Macy\u2019s have both addressed the discontinuation of the Trump business at Macy\u2019s, which was the exclusive retail account for the Donald J. Trump Signature Collection dress shirt and neckwear collections produced under our license agreement for the brand. We are in the process of winding down this business. The license agreement was scheduled to run through 2018.\u201d\nHis brand woes aside, Trump has been bullish on his chances in 2016, even against former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Democratic front-runner Clinton.\n\u201cHillary will be a disaster as a president. Jeb will be very poor as a president. No energy,\u201d Trump said Wednesday in a combative interview with NBC.\nIn that same interview Trump, said he has a \u201cgreat relationship with Mexican people.\u201d\n\u201cI have many people working for me \u2014 you can look at the job in Washington \u2014 I have many legal immigrants working with me. And many of them come from Mexico,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cThey love me,\u201d he continued. \u201cI love them. And I\u2019ll tell you something, if I get the nomination, I\u2019ll win the Latino vote. I will win it, because I\u2019m going to create jobs.\u201d\nBy BILL SCHER\nBy ANNA BADKHEN\nBy JACK SHAFER\nBy LARA BAZELON\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "\"My sole focus is to run as a Republican.
