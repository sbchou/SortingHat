The event was unannounced and closed to reporters and came just one day after her testy standoff with press over her decision to destroy tens of thousands of emails from her time as Secretary of State. Who would make a cash dash in the midst of bungling the response to a foreseeable scandal that has supporters questioning their judgment? It couldn\u2019t really be greed that would drive a woman so wealthy to take such a risk in ducking reporters, especially to do the kind of buck raking that has already damaged her image. So it must be that Clinton doesn\u2019t understand the extremity of her situation.\n\nIn politics, professionals complain about \u201cundisciplined\u201d candidates. Those folks generally fall into one of two categories: The train wrecks who know what they\u2019re supposed to do, but lack the self-control to do it or those who can\u2019t or won\u2019t see what\u2019s going on. It would seem that Clinton is the latter. She doesn\u2019t \u201cget it.\u201d Some combination of bubble-wrapped obliviousness and willful ignorance seems to be keeping her from doing what it takes to win.\n\nNobody sees that more clearly than the members of Team Obama, who, aside from helping to deliver a drip-drip-drip of steadily negative news about the actual facts of Clinton\u2019s email scandal, are currently giving Clinton the Coakley treatment. That got crystal clear on Thursday with a blind-quote bonanza in Politico, the spirit of which is reflected here: \u201cThe Democratic nomination is all but hers, the Republican field still looking weak to them, and they\u2019re counting on her. And now? To sum up the feelings, all the way up to the highest levels: What. The. Hell.\u201d The tone here is one of concern, but also of building an, er, firewall against future foibles: \u201cThey\u2019re just hoping that this email server \u2013 \u2018the president 100 percent would not have done it this way,\u2019 the former aide said, \u2018this is such a clearly nontransparent way of going about it\u2019 \u2013 is the extent of the latitude she took that they didn\u2019t know about.\u201d\n\nThere are only a few weeks left for Democrats to decide whether or not to try to topple Clinton, and it seems highly unlikely that anyone with enough clout would make the leap in time. But as we watch Obamaland start to quarantine Clinton, lest an outbreak spread to the president\u2019s legacy project, the possibility of a real primary gets more real.\n\nIt is certainly true that President Obama has a great deal invested in having a Democratic successor, especially since he is using executive authority to keep a wobbly agenda in place. And it is also true that Clinton represents the most likely path to that objective. But, the Obamanauts hold themselves in such high esteem and take such a low view of Clintonian politics that it wouldn\u2019t take much more to tip the whole thing over. In the Politico piece, the White House crew speaks in disappointment, not anger, saying they thought Clinton had changed. And what did she need to change from? Consider this gem: \u201c\u2018You never feel like you\u2019re quite getting the full story, because everyone\u2019s got some side deal or some complicating factor,\u2019 said one former Obama aide, reflecting on dealing with Clinton and her circle. \u2018I don\u2019t think there was a conscious effort to watch out for scams. It was more just, you know who you\u2019re dealing with.\u2019\u201d Sounds marvelous\u2026\n\n[Watch Fox: Chief White House Correspondent Ed Henry has the latest on the Hillary email scandal.]\n\n#mediabuzz - This week Howard Kurtz welcomes a slew of guests including Ron Fournier to discuss the challenge of covering the Clintons for three decades.

WATCH HERE.\n\nWarren the \u2018escape valve\u2019 to help Hillary? - Jim O\u2019Sullivan of the Boston Globe writes: \u201cPerhaps the more interesting question is how tenderly Warren treats a nominee Clinton. She could function as a hard-line truth-teller who holds Clinton to account when her circle of advisers leans a little Wall Streety for Warren\u2019s taste. Or she could rank party politics above principle and give Clinton all the slack she needs. \u2018Is she a pain in the ass or an escape valve? I think she\u2019ll be more of an escape valve,\u2019 said one person who has known Warren since before she entered electoral politics. \u2018I think she will rally the left and explain to them the possibilities of a Clinton presidency.\u2019\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley tests Hillary hits - Politico:Former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley says if he were president, it would be important as commander in chief to have his secretary of state use the official server for business. \u2018Well sure, it would be important to me,\u2019 he said Thursday on MSNBC\u2019s \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 when asked about Hillary Clinton\u2019s email practices at the State Department. But he said getting the economy working would be more important. O\u2019Malley said he didn\u2019t \u2018feel compelled to answer\u2019 a follow-up question about Clinton\u2019s actions from Bloomberg Politics\u2019 John Heilemann. \u2018Secretary Clinton is perfectly capable of defending her own service in office,\u2019 he said.\u201d\n\nWebb seems to be going through with it - WTVR: \u201cFormer Virginia Sen.

Scott Walker, freshly arrived in Manchester, N.H. came out swinging against the frontrunner, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush: \"We had Bob Dole, John McCain, Mitt Romney. If it's just whoever's next up, that hasn't worked so well for the Republican Party in the past. ... Jeb\u2019s a good man. You\u2019re not going to hear me speak ill will of Jeb. He\u2019s a friend of mine, He called me two days before (announcing) his PAC, I think highly of him. I just think voters are going to look at this and say, \u2018If we\u2019re running against Hillary Clinton, we\u2019ll need a name from the future - not a name from the past -\u00a0 to win.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201c[Bush will] have by far the biggest [fundraising] report. There\u2019s a lot of people who are loyal to that family because of an ambassadorship or an appointment or something like that, so those people are going to show up big on his first report. What we\u2019re hoping going forward are not donors of obligation but donors of passion, people who are passionate about the reforms we bring to the table.\u201d \u2013 Scott Walker, from an interview with the Tampa Bay Times.\n\nVitriolic moderation - In his first visit to the Granite State in 15 years, Bush will make a two-day swing through the state, beginning with a business round table discussion today followed by a party at the home of Fergus Cullen, former chairman of the New Hampshire state GOP. Appearing with Cullen is not a move likely to endear Bush to New Hampshire conservatives. Cullen displayed his disdain for right-wing activists in a radio interview, explaining that Sen. Ted Cruz would not be welcome at his home because Cruz represents \u201ceverything that is wrong with the Republican Party in Washington these days.\u201d Cruz will attend a chili lunch with the Strafford County Republican Committee before he delivers remarks Sunday night at the Grafton County Lincoln-Reagan Dinner in Lincoln, New Hampshire. Cruz will return later this month to rally young conservatives.\n\n[AP: \u201cAmong the many thousands of emails Jeb Bush received as Florida governor are a string of notes from campaign donors asking for favors and making suggestions. Invariably, Bush responded quickly. Sometimes, he appointed a person a donor had recommended for a position. Other times, he rejected advice about a piece of legislation. It\u2019s an insight into Bush\u2019s work as governor that\u2019s possible only because his emails are open for review, something not yet available for those sent and received by Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state.\u201d]\n\nWalker working hard - Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., joins the party in New Hampshire with an aggressive campaign schedule including more than a dozen stops in two days. Walker is attending meetings with political and business leaders today as well as sitting down for interviews with local media outlets. Walker is also scheduled to participate in the grassroots training session in Concord on Saturday.\n\n[Could Walker\u2019s love of hunting and snowmobiling be a key to unlocking Granite State votes? Maybe so.]\n\nWho\u2019s \u2018we\u2019? - Bloomberg: \u201cThe Wisconsin governor and likely 2016 Republican candidate sounded downright bullish when asked this week\u00a0how it felt to be singled out for criticism by President Barack Obama after [Walker]\u00a0signed\u00a0so-called right-to-work legislation. \u2018It suggests maybe we\u2019re the front-runner, if somebody is taking an active interest in what a state governor is doing, particularly in light of the fact that we\u2019re not the only one,\u2019 Walker\u00a0told\u00a0Jon Fleischman of\u00a0Breitbart, a conservative online publication. \u2018Mitch Daniels in \u201912 signed this, Rick Snyder, my friend in Michigan, signed it later that year.

Security Council are quietly considering ending sanctions on Iran if a nuclear deal is struck, the one-upmanship battle between White House and Congress over the shape of any agreement with Tehran has reached new heights of confrontation.\u00a0 The move, the administration\u2019s latest effort to by-pass Congress\u2019s ability to undo a deal the president badly wants, has raised Republican hackles.\n\nCorker in it - AP: \u201cIn a letter, [Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn.] said letting the U.N. consider such an agreement, while at the same time threatening to veto legislation that would allow Congress to vote on it, is a \u2018direct affront\u2019 to the American people and would undermine the role of Congress. In exchange for signing onto a deal aimed at keeping it from developing nuclear weapons, Iran seeks relief from sanctions, including those imposed by the U.S. executive branch, the United Nations and Congress. Corker has introduced legislation requiring any final agreement with Iran to be submitted to Congress for review before any sanctions imposed by Congress can be eased.\u201d\n\nOutside game - David Drucker writes that despite blowback inside the Beltway, Republicans see a win in Senators\u2019 letter to Iran: \u201cNewspaper editorials rebuke its author, Sen.
