Here are five of the more unexpected nuggets:\nGood Monday afternoon, and welcome to The 2016 BLAST. Your guide for the campaign is Jonathan Topaz (@JonathanTopaz). Send tips, ideas and gripes to jtopaz@politico.com.\nStory Continued Below\nWondering why RAND PAUL is carpet-bombing your email box? Tomorrow marks the last day of the FEC fundraising quarter \u2014 and campaigns are making a mad dash for cash in the final hours to pad their totals before official campaign numbers get released. He\u2019s not alone: HILLARY CLINTON will fundraise tonight with\u2026wait for it\u2026Jon Bon Jovi. Meanwhile, JEB BUSH was campaigning in South Carolina today ahead of tomorrow\u2019s big news: CHRIS CHRISTIE will join the GOP race.\nTRAIL MIX: A look at what's popping on the campaign trail\nTHE DAILY CLINTON \nTHE DAILY EMAIL HEADACHE: The New York Times: \u201cHILLARY RODHAM CLINTON\u00a0told reporters last month that the\u00a0memos about Libya\u00a0she received while secretary of state from Sidney Blumenthal \u2026 had been \u2018unsolicited.\u2019 But according to officials briefed on the matter, email records that Mrs. Clinton apparently failed to turn over to the State Department last fall show that she repeatedly encouraged Mr. Blumenthal to \u2018keep \u2019em coming,\u2019 as she said in an August 2012 reply to a memo from him, which she called \u2018another keeper.\u2019\u201d nyti.ms/1Lyk84I\nSTAFF UP: BuzzFeed: \u201cHILLARY CLINTON has hired veteran pollster Ron Lester to conduct black research and polling, BuzzFeed News has learned. The news comes as LaDavia Drane is set to join the campaign Monday in her official role as black coalitions director \u2026 Lester, a longtime Clinton associate, presided over Bill Clinton\u2019s analysis of the black vote in his 1996 reelection campaign.\u201d bzfd.it/1NtLHdT\nTHE CHRISTIE LAUNCH\nTHE PITCH: In CHRIS CHRISTIE\u2019s first campaign video, the New Jersey governor argued that his brash style \u2014 a product of his mother, who demanded the family have no secrets \u2014 is crucial to earning voters\u2019 trust. \u201cI know if my mom were still alive, she would say to me, \u2018I taught you that in a trusting relationship, you don\u2019t hold anything back. And if you\u2019re going to run for president of the United States and you\u2019re going to ask these people for their vote, that is the single most trusting thing they can do as a citizen, is to give you their support,\u2019\u201d he says in the video at a town hall. bit.ly/1RJV9uR\nNO TELEPROMPTER: POLITICO\u2019s Mike Allen reports: \u201cCHRIS CHRISTIE\u2019s launch rally at his high school in New Jersey on Tuesday will include friends who remember his years as class president \u2014 but no teleprompter \u2026 Christie\u2019s wife, Mary Pat, and the rest of his family, along with longtime supporters and friends, will jam the gym at Livingston High School, where he was president for three years, for the 11 a.m. bash \u2026 The adviser said the audience \u2018will see a lot of who he is as a person,\u2019 including the middle-class upbringing that shaped him: the influence of his late mother, his Irish father working at the Breyers ice cream plant in Newark to put himself through Rutgers, a grandmother who was a Sicilian immigrant and a single mother.\u201d politi.co/1NtFVZE\nBETTING BIG ON N.H.: POLITICO\u2019s Alex Isenstadt reports: \u201cGone is the idea of an expansive, state-by-state primary election strategy \u2026 And forget about the prospect of a cash-flush campaign: [CHRIS CHRISTIE] is now expected to raise just a fraction of what his top opponents will rake in \u2026 The hope, according to advisers \u2014 who spent the weekend in a flurry of last-minute planning meetings \u2014 is that by exceeding expectations in debates and town hall events, and by performing well in a few select primary contests, he can re-establish himself as a top-tier candidate \u2026 There is no state more central to the governor\u2019s strategy than New Hampshire.\u201d politi.co/1CEq2K8\nBIG CHRISTIE GET: WMUR: \u201cWhen New Jersey Gov. CHRIS CHRISTIE arrives in New Hampshire on Tuesday as an official presidential candidate, former state Republican Party chairman Wayne MacDonald will be on hand to introduce him at his first post-announcement town hall meeting\u2026 MacDonald has signed on as Christie\u2019s state campaign chairman, saying that the New Jersey governor \u2018represents the strong and decisive kind of leadership the country needs, especially after the last seven years of Barack Obama.\u2019\u201d http://bit.ly/1dthXl3\nHANNITY REX: POLITICO\u2019s Dylan Byers reports that CHRIS CHRISTIE \u2014 like JEB BUSH, RAND PAUL, MARCO RUBIO, TED CRUZ and RICK PERRY before him \u2014 will hold his first pre-launch interview tomorrow evening with Fox News host Sean Hannity. politi.co/1SYkd3E\nJEB IN SOUTH CAROLINA\nCLOSED DOOR MEETING: Post and Courier: \u201cJEB BUSH\u2019s first Charleston appearance since declaring his White House bid was behind closed doors Monday with about 60 clergy members from the Carolinas. Those who attended said afterward that Bush told them about his personal story and beliefs. He also took questions regarding his political stances. Bush only lightly addressed the Emanuel AME Church mass shooting that killed nine black parishioners June 17.\u201d http://bit.ly/1eVXUgF\n\u2018RACIST\u2019 SYMBOL: Greenville News:\u00a0\u201cIn his first visit to South Carolina since nine people were shot to death in a historic black church in Charleston by a white gunman, GOP presidential candidate JEB BUSH said the Confederate battle flag is a \u2018racist\u2019 symbol that should be lowered in any state \u2018that is aspirational.\u2019 Bush also said he feels the Charleston shootings are more an issue of what happens when someone loses his connection to others and of mental health than of gun control.\u201d http://grnol.co/1Hu3pjd\nTHE CASE FOR KASICH\nSCOOP: POLITICO\u2019s Mike Allen reports: \u201cOhio Gov. JOHN KASICH will jump into the crowded Republican presidential field on July 21 at the student union at his alma mater, The Ohio State University, in Columbus, advisers tell POLITICO. Kasich, 63, who was overwhelmingly reelected in November, will aim to appear less scripted and guarded than the leading candidates. Advisers say he combines establishment appeal with a conservative record going back to his stint as House Budget Committee chairman, during his 18 years as a congressman from Ohio.\u201d http://politi.co/1FLsfDJ\nGOAL: $15M: Cincinnati Enquirer: \u201cThe governor is pushing to meet a fundraising goal of $15 million by June 30, according to two people briefed on the matter \u2026 [JOHN] KASICH insists a path exists for him to win the nomination if he runs. Such a path surely relies on a lackluster performance by former Florida Gov. JEB BUSH, along with a Kasich win in New Hampshire.\u201d bit.ly/1Kjg3jQ\nTHE DEBATE PROBLEM: Columbus Dispatch: \u201cFranklin County GOP chair Doug Preisse, a [JOHN] KASICH adviser who has traveled with Kasich to some of the earlier primary states, downplayed the impact of the debate, saying \u2018nobody\u2019s wringing their hands\u2019 about the issue. \u2018The debates are important,\u2019 he said, \u2018but if you don\u2019t get an at-bat in the first inning, there\u2019s always the second inning.\u2019\u00a0And Kasich himself has downplayed the importance of the issue, insisting last month in South Carolina that it wasn\u2019t a worry.\u201c http://bit.ly/1R0g95m\nTRUMP ON THE STUMP\nFIRED! POLITICO\u2019s Dylan Byers reports: \u201cAmid mounting public pressure, NBCUniversal announced Monday that it will cut business ties with DONALD TRUMP due to 'recent derogatory statements' the Republican presidential hopeful made regarding Mexican immigrants. \u2018At NBC, respect and dignity for all people are cornerstones of our values,\u2019 the network's statement reads. \u2018Due to the recent derogatory statements by DONALD TRUMP regarding immigrants, NBCUniversal is ending its business relationship with Mr. Trump.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/1GLgHSG\nMY DINNER WITH DONALD: PolitickerNJ: \u201cThe DONALD TRUMP I met was charming, smart and engaging\u2026Trump is no Michele Bachmann or Herman Cain. He is surrounded by brilliant children who he trusts completely and the best advisors money can buy. And unlike the one week wonders of 2012, Trump has not only learned the media spotlight but has mastered it\u2026Accordingly, I would not bet on a Trump implosion.\u201d http://bit.ly/1CFtp3J\n\nTED CRUZ BOOK RELEASE\nHITTING THE BOOKSHELVES: TED CRUZ\u2019s new book, \u201cA Time for Truth,\u201d will come out tomorrow. The candidate will be in Houston tomorrow evening for an end-of-the-quarter fundraising event, as well.\nCRUZ VS. ROVE: TED CRUZ and Karl Rove are feuding over an excerpt in the upcoming book \u2014 provided to Breitbart \u2014 in which Cruz claims Rove told him in 2009 that former President George H.W. Bush was \u201ctoo old to have good judgment\u201d and urged him against seeking a donation for a potential state attorney general race. Over the weekend, Rove pushed back, saying he didn\u2019t question Bush\u2019s judgment. But last night, Cruz released emails between the two men from 2009, accusing Rove of being \u201cblatantly misleading.\u201d\nBIG LEAGUE BURN: In a post on Medium, Rove claims that Cruz sought his counsel for years later, including in his 2012 Senate bid. \u201cOne piece of advice I offered was that he should stop describing himself as the \u2018next MARCO RUBIO,\u2019 since he did not have Senator Rubio\u2019s outstanding legislative record of accomplishments as speaker of the Florida House of Representatives,\u201d Rove writes. bit.ly/1QZyS0W\nUNCONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER: TED CRUZ, in an interview with NPR, says that \u2014 unlike candidates such as MARCO RUBIO and BEN CARSON who vowed to respect the Supreme Court\u2019s same-sex marriage decision \u2014 states not explicitly named in the suit can ignore the law. \u201cThere's no legal obligation to acquiesce to anything other than a court judgment,\u201d he said.\u00a0The Texas senator is also proposing a constitutional amendment to strip Supreme Court justices of their lifetime appointments and hold elections for them. n.pr/1LEy1PL\nSURVEYING THE 2016 LANDSCAPE\nMARCO\u2019S BIG GET: Jewish Insider: \u201cPhil Rosen, a co-chair of Weil Gotshal\u2019s real estate practice and well-known Jewish leader, has officially endorsed MARCO RUBIO and will serve as a foreign policy advisor for the campaign. Rosen, one of Mitt Romney\u2019s top bundlers in 2012, was highly sought after by several candidates \u2026 He called Rubio \u2018the strongest supporter of the U.S.\u2019s best friend on the world stage, Israel.\u2019\u201d bit.ly/1U148M4\nTHE FIGHT FOR FLORIDA: Tampa Bay Times: \u201cThe Super PAC supporting JEB BUSH is looking at television advertising in Florida, according to documents filed with the FCC. Right to Rise USA sought advertising rates from WFTX-TV in the Naples/Fort Myers area.\u201d bit.ly/1CEQ3Ji\nNON-HYPHENATED: A super PAC for BOBBY JINDAL is out with an ad that will run throughout Iowa. The buy cost about $500,000. \u201cI am tired of hyphenated Americans. We\u2019re not Indian-Americans or African-Americans or Asian-Americans. We\u2019re all Americans,\u201d Jindal says in the ad from a clip from CPAC. bit.ly/1Io4xDX\nSCOTT WALKER\u2019S PHONY FIST FIGHT: The Capital Times: \u201cYou may have seen the article on one of your friends' Facebook feeds: \u2018Gov. SCOTT WALKER Challenges Supreme Court Justices to Fist Fight.\u2019 It's been making the rounds on social media since the U.S. Supreme Court last week made two major decisions that aren't necessarily sitting well with Republicans \u2026 Apparently, based on people's reactions on Facebook, some people are under the impression that this article is true. (Hint, it's not.)\u201d http://bit.ly/1IoMddC\nNEXT NEWS CYCLE\nANNOUNCEMENT DAY: CHRIS CHRISTIE will officially get into the race late tomorrow morning with a presidential launch at Livingston High School, where he attended and was student body president. Then, it\u2019s off to all-important New Hampshire, where he\u2019ll hold an evening town hall. He\u2019ll be in the state through July 4.\nELSEWHERE IN THE EARLY STATES: MIKE HUCKABEE will open his Iowa campaign headquarters in Urbandale tomorrow; DONALD TRUMP will be at a house party in Bedford, N.H.; RICK SANTORUM will hold a national security town hall at The Citadel in Charleston.\nDEADLINE DAY: Tomorrow is June 30th \u2014 meaning the last day before the fundraising quarter ends.
