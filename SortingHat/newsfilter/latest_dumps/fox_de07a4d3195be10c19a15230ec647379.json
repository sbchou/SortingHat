They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists and some, I assume, are good people, but I speak to border guards and they're telling us what we're getting.\"\nClinton said Republicans were \u201call in the same general area\u201d -- essentially not wanting to give a path to citizenship to immigrants already living illegally in the United States.\n\u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Tuesday criticized GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump and the entire Republican Party for their views on illegal immigrants and accused the GOP of leading the \u201cbarrage of attacks\u201d on her credibility.", "title": "Clinton rips Trump, entire GOP on immigration", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/GZ9kgE3YPSM/", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Bill Clinton", "Hillary Clinton", "Francisco Sanchez"], "orgs": ["Republican Party", "GOP", "United States."], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-07-07 22:42:29", "org": "fox", "article_id": "de07a4d3195be10c19a15230ec647379", "date_access": "2015-07-07 23:10:03.982677"}
