{"body": "As presidential candidates wrapped up busy weekends in South Carolina, Michigan, Iowa and other states, several took to the Sunday talk shows to clarify points and weigh in on new controversies. Identity politics have resurfaced on the Republican side and a new CNN/ORC poll shows that less than a week after the party\u2019s second debate Donald J. Trump is clinging to his lead, while Carly Fiorina has surged into second place ahead of Ben Carson. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida is also showing signs of gaining traction, while Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin has fallen to the back of the pack. Here are the highlights. \n\nDonald J. Trump\n\nMr. Trump, the billionaire developer, continued to face questions about how he handled a question at a campaign rally from a man who said that President Obama is a Muslim. Mr. Trump stirred the issue on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d when he was asked how he would feel about having a Muslim in the White House. \u201cI mean, some people have said it already happened, frankly,\u201d Mr. Trump told Chuck Todd. \u201cBut of course you wouldn\u2019t agree with that.\u201d He hedged on whether he would be comfortable with the idea of a Muslim president, offering only that it was something that could happen someday. Mr. Trump also said that he would take Mr. Obama\u2019s word that he was a Christian, but he declined to answer questions about whether he thought Mr. Obama was born in the United States.\n\nBen Carson\n\nMr. Carson received the same line of questioning and gave a more direct response about the idea of a Muslim president. He is against it. \u201cI would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation,\u201d Mr. Carson told NBC. \u201cI absolutely would not agree with that.\u201d The retired neurosurgeon said he does not think that Islam is consistent with the Constitution, but he suggested that he would consider supporting a Muslim in Congress.\n\nGov. John Kasich\n\nThe governor from Ohio sought to clarify remarks that he made about Hispanics last week. When talking about immigrants who work in the United States, Mr. Kasich offended some by saying \u201cA lot of them do jobs that they\u2019re willing to do, and that\u2019s why in the hotel you leave a little tip.\u201d Also speaking on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Mr. Kasich clarified his position, noting that he has a Hispanic friend who is an oncologist and that he respects the labor of immigrants. \u201cTo be clear, I believe that, from top to bottom, Hispanics play a critical role in America, not only today, but going forward,\u201d he said. \n\nSenator Marco Rubio\n\nMr. Rubio continued his strategy of playing down polls, even when he is rising in them. CNN\u2019s new poll showed support for the Florida senator jumping from 3 percent to 11 percent, but he insisted that it meant little. \u201cThese polls don\u2019t really mean anything at this stage,\u201d Mr. Rubio said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cObviously, you want to do well and they\u2019re relevant because they\u2019re deciding who gets on the stage. But they\u2019re not going to decide this election,\u201d he said. Mr. Rubio also got the opportunity to discuss Mr. Obama\u2019s nationality and religion. After expressing disappointment in the level of political discourse, he tried to set the record straight: \u201cHe\u2019s born in the United States. He\u2019s a Christian. He\u2019s the president of the United States for the next year and a half and we\u2019re going to move on.\u201d\n\nCarly Fiorina\n\nThe former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard expressed excitement about the attention that her campaign has been getting since her debate performance. She also held her ground over Planned Parenthood, rejecting claims that she exaggerated when discussing the contents of videos about the organization. \u201cI will continue to dare anyone who wants to continue to fund Planned Parenthood, watch the videotapes,\u201d she said on Fox News Sunday. \u201cAnd anyone who wants to challenge me, first, is going to have to prove to me that they watched it.\u201d Mrs. Fiorina said that while she wants to defund Planned Parenthood, she is not opposed to government funding for H.I.V. testing and breast cancer screening. And she said that she would be in favor of shutting down the government over the group\u2019s funding because voters expected change when they elected Republicans to majorities in Congress. \u201cI do think that people want to know what do we stand for.\u201d", "byline": "ALAN RAPPEPORT", "description": "Several presidential candidates took to the Sunday talk shows to clarify points and weigh in on new controversies.", "title": "First Draft: Republicans Ensnared in Questions of Identity Politics", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/09/20/republicans-ensnared-in-questions-of-identity-politics/", "topics": ["personality", "immigration"], "people": ["Scott Walker", "Donald Trump", "Chuck Todd", "Marco Rubio", "Donald J.
