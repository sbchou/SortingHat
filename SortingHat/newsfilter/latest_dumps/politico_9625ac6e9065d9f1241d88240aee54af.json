{"body": "Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush walks with his wife, Columba Bush. | Getty\nBy Adam B. Lerner\n7/28/15 11:01 AM EDT\nJeb Bush is opening up about his mixed-ethnicity family, discussing his family\u2019s Mexican heritage and even discrimination his son experienced as a child.\n\u201cWe are very Hispanic in the sense that we speak Spanish at home,\u201d the former Florida governor said in a Spanish-language interview with Telemundo. \u201cColumba is very Mexican. She is proud of her U.S. citizenship naturally, but we eat Mexican food at home. Our children are Hispanic in many aspects, and we don\u2019t talk about that. But yes, the Hispanic influence in my family is something quite important in my life.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\nBush\u2019s comments came in his first full Spanish-language interview on the 2016 presidential campaign trail. He sat down with Telemundo\u2019s Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz-Balart for a wide-ranging discussion Tuesday that was previewed on the channel that evening, but will be aired in full on Sunday.\nThe interview comes as real estate mogul Donald Trump has soared to the lead in a number of national polls after attacking undocumented Mexican immigrants as \u201crapists\u201d and criminals \u2014 remarks that many on both the left and the right have called offensive and wrong.\nBush said of Trump\u2019s remarks, \u201cI was hurt, hearing someone speaking in such a vulgar fashion,\u201d adding that the remarks \u201churt millions of people that are here legally.\u201d\nHe declined to mention, though, any offense directed at Mexican immigrants who are not in the country legally.\nAlso on POLITICO\nALEX ISENSTADT\nThe former Florida governor then went on to discuss discrimination targeted at Hispanics, mentioning \u201ca time when my son went to Ocala,\u201d a city in central Florida around 80 miles northwest of Orlando, \u201cto play baseball, a game on a team. And the team was a Miami team. The majority were Hispanics. My son George, he\u2019s dark-skinned. And they spoke horrible things about those from Miami.\u201d\n\u201c[N]aturally, I had to explain or describe that people who hate are not the majority, and we must accept them and move forward,\u201d Bush said.\nBush added that his son was \u201cquite upset\u201d because \u201cin Miami, we don\u2019t have a problem. But in other parts of the country it [discrimination] exists.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good lesson to learn, to always remember that we still don\u2019t have a country that\u2019s full justice for all,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWe can see this in the African-American communities also. There\u2019s discrimination still. And in my life, it\u2019s important to acknowledge this, and to act about that. Yes.\u201d\nTelemundo\u2019s Balart finished Bush\u2019s sentence by saying, \u201cAnd act on it, but how?\u201d\nBush responded by touting the diversity of judges and administrative employees he appointed and hired while governor. \u201cI had the greatest diversity of any other governor, and [I will] always be aware of the diversity of the state of Florida as well as the country. It\u2019s a virtue, it\u2019s something positive. It should not divide us, but we should respect and embrace diversity so that we can have better results.\u201d\nThe interview then shifted to the subject of immigration, where Bush reiterated his plan to offer a path to legal status for those in the country without documentation, but not to offer a path to citizenship.\nAlso on POLITICO\nDYLAN BYERS\nWhen asked about a portion of his book that says undocumented immigrants \u201cshould never have access to citizenship,\u201d Bush responded, \u201cOne could have access if they receive legal status, one way or the other. But what I don\u2019t believe should be done is to cut in front of the line, you know?\u201d\nBush flaunted the fact that he \u201cwon more Hispanic votes than Anglo votes\u201d in his 2002 re-election campaign and said that a Republican can carry the Latino vote.\n\u201cIt can be done,\u201d Bush said. \u201cIt can be done, based on a more positive message that respects people. This can be changed.\u201d\nBy BEN WOFFORD\nBy BRUCE BARTLETT\nBy JACK SHAFER\nBy THOMAS GEOGHEGAN\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "\"We are very Hispanic in the sense that we speak Spanish at home,\" he says.", "title": "Jeb Bush: 'I was hurt' by Donald Trump's attacks on Mexicans", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/jeb-bush-hurt-donald-trump-remarks-attacks-mexicans-120717.html", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Jeb Bush", "Adam B.
