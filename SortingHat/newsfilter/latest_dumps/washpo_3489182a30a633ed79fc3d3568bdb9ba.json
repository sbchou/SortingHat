{"body": "  RICHMOND \u2014 Leaders of the state\u2019s Republican Party will gather in the Shenandoah Valley this weekend to make a decision that could determine the future of the party and its ability to deliver Virginia for the GOP presidential nominee in 2016. At issue is whether the party will use a convention or a primary to choose a presidential candidate next spring, when all eyes will be on Virginia and a few other crucial swing states. Proponents of each approach say that their side has the best formula for engaging activists and rebuilding the base, which are key goals for a party that has been shut out of all five statewide offices and has struggled to raise money since former House majority leader Eric Cantor\u2019s loss to tea party favorite Dave Brat. The same faction that helped put Brat over the top, a group calling itself the Conservative Fellowship, favors conventions, which are day-long events that tend to attract only the most committed activists \u2014 and a small percentage of the state\u2019s Republicans. On the other side are business-centric Republicans in the mold of Cantor, who would rather see a state-run primary held in polling places across the state and open to all voters. In the weeks leading up to the meeting, both sides have exchanged a flurry of e-mails and phone calls in hopes of swaying the vote or striking a deal that could lead to a primary in 2016 and a convention in time for the governor\u2019s race in 2017.  [McAuliffe finds himself back in campaign mode for Hillary Clinton]  John Whitbeck, chairman of the state GOP, downplayed the tensions. \u201cThe vote on this is going to be super close,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people are going around and talking about compromises. There\u2019s been a lot of back-and-forth between party activists and leaders about things that work and don\u2019t work, a lot of reaching across the divide.\u201d But the flap already prompted a rebuke from the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, which warned the party against charging delegate fees \u2014 what the ACLU called a poll tax \u2014 if it decides to hold a statewide convention. Chip Muir is chairman of the Richmond GOP and architect of a convention-primary compromise. \u201cThe convention is becoming such a polarizing maneuver because we\u2019re already seeing we\u2019re being threatened with lawsuits, we\u2019re losing black conservatives .\u2009.\u2009. \u201d he said. \u201cBetween the terrible headlines and the lost opportunity to find voters, we\u2019re not creating an opportunity for the eventual nominee to win Virginia\u2019s 13 electoral votes.\u201d Convention enthusiasts disagree. They say a convention is the best way to dig the party out of debt. Russ Moulton, a longtime activist with considerable sway over the Fellowship, has floated the idea of charging a $35 mandatory delegate fee and candidate filing fees as high as $25,000 to generate upwards of $1 million or more for the party. Claire Guthrie Gasta\u00f1aga, executive director of the Virginia ACLU, said charging a delegates fee could violate the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act. \u201cSuch a fee would unfairly exclude Republicans from voting based on their economic means and would invite prolonged and costly litigation,\u201d she said in a letter to Whitbeck. On Thursday, Moulton said he was simply \u201claying out the potential for the amount of revenue that the party could get.\u201d Convention details would be worked out over the summer, he said, if the votes goes his way. Convention supporters say even though the events attract a relatively small number of Republicans, those who do show up will volunteer and strengthen the party. \u201cThe raw number of new activists that we\u2019re going to capture that will be working for our eventual nominee \u2014 that\u2019s really what we need, we need a better ground game,\u201d Moulton said. A convention, supporters say, would also neutralize any threat from sneaky Democrats who may vote in a Republican primary to boost Democratic opponents of front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton. Virginia voters do not register by party, so anyone can vote in any primary. \u201cThe Democrats are likely to have a done deal for the nomination of Hillary Clinton, and we know that Democrats like skullduggery in Virginia,\u201d said Morton Blackwell, Virginia\u2019s GOP national committeeman. Those those who favor a primary say the crossover vote is not a factor because Virginia\u2019s March 1 primary is early enough that Democrats may still be in the midst of a real race. Michael Thomas, vice chairman of the state GOP, said the proposed convention date \u2014 March 19 \u2014 is too early. Candidates coming off nominating contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina contests are unlikely to devote attention to Virginia, he argued, unless a convention could be held later a few months when the contest comes down to the wire. Thomas also questioned the legality and wisdom of charging convention fees. But he said his biggest reason for backing a primary is because it would generate a wealth of data about the party\u2019s potential supporters. \u201cIf a convention in 2016 had twice the number of our largest convention ever \u2014 and that is in\u00adcred\u00adibly unlikely \u2014 it is a fraction of voters and grass-roots activists that we would engage with a primary, and I don\u2019t think we can afford to blow that opportunity,\u201d he said. The lobbying will come to a head Saturday in Staunton, when the 83 members of the State Central Committee cast their votes. Whitbeck, who has the tie-breaking vote, has supported conventions in the past, but he has publicly remained neutral on the 2016 question. There is one thing all Republicans can agree on, he said: \u201cWithout Virginia, we\u2019re not going to win the presidency.\u201d  ", "byline": "", "description": "RICHMOND \u2014 Leaders of the state\u2019s Republican Party will gather in the Shenandoah Valley this weekend to make a decision that could determine the future of the party and its ability to deliver Virginia for the GOP presidential nominee in 2016.Read full article >>", "title": "It\u2019s a nailbiter for Va.
