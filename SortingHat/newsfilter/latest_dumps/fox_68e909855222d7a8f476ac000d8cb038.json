Jeb Bush is walking back controversial comments he made calling for Americans to \u201cwork longer hours\u201d -- insisting his remarks were taking out of context and what he really meant is that there needs to be more full-time jobs for Americans.\nBush told reporters at a campaign event in New Hampshire Wednesday night that \u201cpeople need to work longer hours\u201d to grow the economy, referring to part-time workers being bumped up to full-time schedules and not full-time employees working longer hours, he clarified to the Boston Herald.\u00a0\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to grow our economy, people need to stop being part-time workers and need to be having access to greater opportunities to work,\u201d Bush said. \u201cYou can take it out of context all you want, but high-sustaining growth means people work 40 hours, rather than 30 hours.\u201d\nAt the event, Bush, who is one of 14 Republican candidates vying for a 2016 presidential bid, slammed Donald Trump over his comments about Mexican immigrants, the Boston Herald reported.\nBush told a crowd of about 150 people he was going to \u201ccampaign in the Latino communities all across this country \u2013 and I might do it in Spanish and in English.\u201d\nHe also called Trump\u2019s personal attack on him a \u201cweird little controversy.\u201d\n\nTrump re-tweeted a claim that Bush likes \u201cMexican illegals because of his wife,\u201d Columba, a naturalized U.S. citizen.\n\u201cYou can love the Mexican culture, you can love your Mexican-American wife, and also believe you can control the border,\u201d Bush said.", "byline": "", "description": "Former Florida Gov.
