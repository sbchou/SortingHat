{"body": "Video: Vice President\u00c2\u00a0Joe Biden announces he won\u2019t run for president.\nVice President\u00c2\u00a0Joe Biden said Wednesday he will bypass the 2016 presidential race, forgoing one final shot at the White House. Here is Mr. Biden\u2019s statement, delivered from the White House, as provided by Federal News Service (www.fednews.com):\nVice President Joe Biden: Please, please, sit down. Mr. President, thank you for lending me the Rose Garden for a minute.\nPresident Barack Obama: It\u2019s a pretty nice place.\nMr. Biden: As the family and I have worked through the \u2014 the grieving process, I\u2019ve said all along what I\u2019ve said time and again to others: that it may very well be that that process, by the time we get through it, closes the window on mounting a realistic campaign for president. That it might close.\nI\u2019ve concluded it has closed. I know from previous experience that there\u2019s no timetable for this process. The process doesn\u2019t respect or much care about things like filing deadlines or debates and primaries and caucuses.\nBut I also know that I could do this if the \u2014 I couldn\u2019t do this if the family wasn\u2019t ready. The good news is the family has reached that point, but as I\u2019ve said many times, my family has suffered loss, and \u2014 and I \u2014 I hope there would come a time \u2014 and I\u2019ve said this to many other families \u2014 that, sooner rather than later, when \u2014 when you think of your loved one, it brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eyes.\nWell, that\u2019s where the Bidens are today. Thank god. Beau \u2014 Beau is our inspiration.\nUnfortunately, I believe we\u2019re out of time, the time necessary to mount a winning campaign for the nomination. But while I will not be a candidate, I will not be silent.\nI intend to speak out clearly and forcefully, to influence as much as I can where we stand as a party and where we need to go as a nation. And this is what I believe.\nI believe that President Obama has led this nation from crisis to recovery, and we\u2019re now on the cusp of resurgence. I\u2019m proud to have played a part in that. This party, our nation, will be making a tragic mistake if we walk away or attempt to undo the Obama legacy.\nThe American people have worked too hard, and we have have come too far for that. Democrats should not only defend this record and protect this record. They should run on the record.\nWe have a lot of work to get done over to the next 15 months, and there is a lot of \u2014 the president \u2014 there\u2019s a lot that the president will \u2014 will have to get done, but let me be clear that we\u2019ll be building on a really solid foundation.\nBut it all starts with giving the middle-class a fighting chance. I know that you in the press love to call me \u201cMiddle-Class Joe,\u201d and I know in Washington that\u2019s not really meant a compliment; it means you\u2019re not that sophisticated, but it is about the middle class. It isn\u2019t just a matter of fairness or economic growth, it\u2019s a matter of social stability for this nation. We cannot sustain the current levels of inequality that exist in this country.\nI believe the huge sums of unlimited and often secret money pouring into our politics is a fundamental threat to our Democracy, and I really believe that. I think it\u2019s a fundamental threat, because the middle class will never have a fighting chance in this country as long as just several hundred families, the wealthiest families, control the process. It\u2019s just that simple. And I believe that we have to level the playing field for the American people. And that\u2019s going to take access to education and opportunity to work.\nWe need to commit. We are fighting for 14 years \u2014 we need to commit to 16 years of free public education for all of our children. We all know that 12 years of public education is not enough. As a nation, let\u2019s make the same commitment to a college education today that we made to a high school education 100 years ago.\nChildren and child care is the one biggest barrier for working families. We need as the president proposed a triple child care tax credit. That alone will lead to dramatic increase in the number of women able to be in the workforce, and will raise our economic standards.\nThere are many equitable ways to pay for this. I often hear, well, how do you pay for this? There are many equitable ways to pay for this. We can pay for all of this with one simple step, by limiting the deductions in the tax code to 28 percent of income. Wealthy folks will end up paying a little bit more, but it\u2019s my guess \u2014 and I mean this sincerely \u2014 it\u2019s my guess they\u2019ll be happy to help build a stronger economy and a better educated America. I believe we need to lead more by the power of our example, as the president has, than merely by the example of our power.\nWe have learned some very hard lessons from more than a decade of large scale, open-ended military invasions. We have to accept the fact that we can\u2019t solve all of the world\u2019s problems. We can\u2019t solve many of them alone.\nThe argument that we just have to do something when bad people do bad things isn\u2019t good enough. It\u2019s not a good enough reason for American intervention and to put our sons and daughters\u2019 lives on the line, put them at risk.\nI believe that we have to end the divisive partisan politics that is ripping this country apart. And I think we can. It\u2019s mean spirited, it\u2019s petty, and it\u2019s gone on for much too long. I don\u2019t believe, like some do, that it\u2019s naive to talk to Republicans. I don\u2019t think we should look at Republicans as our enemies. They are our opposition. They\u2019re not our enemies. And for the sake of the country, we have to work together.\nAs the president has said many times, compromise is not a dirty word. But look at it this way folks, how does this country function without consensus? How can we move forward without being able to arrive at consensus? Four more years of this kind of pitched battle may be more than this country can take. We have to change it. We have to change it.\nAnd I believe that we need a moon shot in this country to cure cancer. It\u2019s personal. But I know we can do this. The president and I have already been working hard on increasing funding for research and development, because there are so many breakthroughs just on the horizon in science and medicine, the things that are just about to happen. And we can make them real with an absolute national commitment to end cancer, as we know it today.\nAnd I\u2019m going to spend the next 15 months in this office pushing as hard as I can to accomplish this, because I know there are Democrats and Republicans on the Hill who share our passion, our passion to silence this deadly disease.\nIf I could be anything, I would have wanted to have been the president that ended cancer, because it\u2019s possible.\nI also believe we need to keep moving forward in the arc of this nation toward justice: the rights of the LGBT community, immigration reform, equal pay for women and protecting their safety from violence, rooting out institutional racism.\nAt their core, every one of these things \u2014 every one of these things is about the same thing. It\u2019s about equality, it\u2019s about fairness, it\u2019s about respect. As my dad used to say, it\u2019s about affording every single person dignity. It\u2019s not complicated.\nEvery single one of the issues is about dignity. And the ugly forces of hate and division \u2014 they won\u2019t let up, but they do not represent the American people. They do not represent the heart of this country. They represent a small fraction of the political elite, and the next president is going to have to take it on.\nMost of all I believe there\u2019s unlimited possibilities for this country. I don\u2019t know how many of the White House staff and personnel have heard me say repeatedly that we are so much better positioned than any country the world.\nWe are so \u2014 I\u2019ve been doing this for a long time. When I got elected as a 29-year-old kid, I was called \u201cthe optimist\u201d. I am more optimistic about the possibilities \u2014 the incredibly possibilities \u2014 to leap forward than I have been any time in my career.\nAnd I believe to my core that there is no country on the face of the Earth better positioned to lead the world in the 21st century than the United States of America.\nWashington, though, has to begin to function again. Instead of being the problem, it has to become part of the solution again. We have to be one America again. And at our core, I\u2019ve always believed that what sets America apart from every other nation is that we \u2014 ordinary Americans \u2014 believe in possibilities. Unlimited possibilities.\nThe possibilities for a kid growing up in a poor inner-city neighborhood or the \u2014 a Spanish-speaking home, or a kid from Mayfield in Delaware, Willow Grove in Pennsylvania like Jill and I, to be able to be anything we wanted to be, to do anything \u2014 anything \u2014 that we want.\nThat\u2019s what we were both taught, that\u2019s what the president was taught. It was real. That\u2019s what I grew up believing. And you know, it\u2019s always been true in this country, and if we ever lose that, we\u2019ve lost something very special. We\u2019ll have lost the very soul of this country.\nWhen I was growing up, my parents, in tough times, looked at me and would say to me and my brothers and sister, \u201choney, it\u2019s gonna be OK.\u201d And they meant it. They meant it. It was gonna be OK.\nBut some of you cover me, I say, go back to your old neighborhoods. Talk to your contemporaries who aren\u2019t as successful as you\u2019ve been. There are too many people in America \u2014 there are too many parents who don\u2019t believe they can look their kid in the eye and say with certitude, \u201choney, it\u2019s gonna be OK.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what we need to change. It\u2019s not complicated. That will be the true measure of our success, and we\u2019ll not have met it until every parent out there can look at their kid in tough times and say, \u201choney, it\u2019s gonna be OK,\u201d and mean it.\nThat\u2019s our responsibility. And I believe it\u2019s totally within our power. The nation has done it before in difficult times.\nI have had the very (ph) great good fortune and privilege of being in public service most of my adult life \u2014 since I\u2019ve been 25 years old. And through personal triumphs and tragedies, my entire family \u2014 son Beau, my son Hunter, my daughter Ashley, Jill \u2014 our whole family \u2014 and this sounds corny, but we found purpose in public life.\nWe found purpose in public life. So we intend \u2014 the whole family, not just me \u2014 we intend to spend the next 15 months fighting for what we\u2019ve always cared about \u2014 what my family\u2019s always cared about \u2014 with every ounce of our being, and working alongside the president and members of Congress and our future nominee, I am absolutely certain that we fully are capable of accomplishing extraordinary things. We can do this.\nAnd when we do, America won\u2019t just win the future, we will own the finish line.\nThank you for all being so gracious to Jill and me, for the last six or eight months, and for our whole career for that matter. But I am telling you, we can do so much more. I am looking forward to continuing to work with this man to get it done. Thank you very much. Thank you all very much.\nSource: Federal News Service\nMore:\nJoe Biden Decides Not to Enter Presidential Race\nHow Clinton, Trump, Carson Look Strong in New Poll\nWSJ Poll: Hillary Clinton Widens Lead in Primary Race\n______________________________________________________\n2016 Election Calendar | WSJ/NBC Polls   | 2016 Poll Standings\n\n\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops. \r\n\nCapital Journal Daybreak Newsletter: Sign up to get the latest on politics, policy and defense delivered to your inbox every morning.\r\nFor the latest Washington news, follow @wsjpolitics\r\nFor outside analysis, follow @wsjthinktank", "byline": "", "description": "Vice President Joe Biden said Wednesday he will bypass the 2016 presidential race, forgoing one final shot at the White House.
