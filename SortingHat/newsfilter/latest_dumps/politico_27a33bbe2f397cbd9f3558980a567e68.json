{"body": "POLITICO\nPolitical intelligence on the intersection of Washington and Wall Street\nBy Ben White\n7/31/15 7:59 AM EDT\nSOFT ECONOMY THREATENS CLINTON \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Ben White: \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s advisers breathed a sigh of relief on Thursday as the federal government reported that the economy grew at 2.3 percent over the last three months, a modest bounce back from a first quarter that nearly flat-lined. .. But the report was hardly a blockbuster and underscored that the former secretary of state, should she secure the Democratic nomination, will likely be running in a middling economy that will boast low unemployment but also tepid growth and persistently stagnant wages.\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s good that the economy actually grew rather than contracted in the second quarter but the fundamental story is still very much the same,\u2019 said Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management. \u2018Businesses are not investing and we can continue to expect closer to 2 percent rather than 3 percent growth. And this is now the weakest expansion we have had in 70 years.\u2019\nStory Continued Below\nCLEAR SHOT FOR THE GOP \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of \u201cmeh\u201d economy that will offer the Republican nominee a clear window to argue that Clinton will only offer more of the same policies favored by President Barack Obama that have left the electorate sour and pessimistic. The Commerce Department also reported Thursday that the economy grew only at a 2 percent rate between 2012 and 2014, a 0.3 percent decline from previous estimates and further evidence that this has been the weakest recovery of the modern era. \u2026\n\u201cFormer Florida governor Jeb Bush has already pledged to super-charge the economy to 4 percent growth. And the rise of Donald Trump has been fueled largely by general displeasure with the current state of affairs and the billionaire\u2019s bold claims to be the \u201cgreatest jobs president ever\u201d while restoring the United States to a place of dominance over China and everyone else in the global economy. .. Neither candidate has yet laid out any concrete plan to deliver on these lofty goals. But they and other Republicans can still tap into a generalized American anxiety over the economy and offer themselves as a potential cure for the current malaise.\n\u201c\u2018Forget the unemployment rate,\u2019 said Douglas Holtz-Eakin of the conservative American Action Form. \u2018This race will be about income growth and the ability to advance the American standard of living. Republicans will have the hard job of arguing a counter-factual that they believe is attainable and what that means for the average person. But they also get the benefit of the doubt, while Clinton does not, because they are not of the incumbent party.\u2019\u201d\nANOTHER CONCERN: THE FED \u2014 \u201cBut Clinton does not just have the economy\u2019s current woes to worry about. The Federal Reserve is likely in the next few months to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006, a major policy shift that runs the risk of sapping what little growth exists and slowing a booming stock market that has seen the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 triple in value since bottoming out in 2009. The Fed has made it clear that it wants to return to a more normal footing as the unemployment rate nears its historical low and the housing market and consumer spending continue to recover, albeit slowly. Thursday\u2019s GDP report was just good enough to keep the Fed on track while not good enough to change voter perceptions.\n\u201cBut if the Fed gets it wrong and hikes too soon it could slam the brakes on the economy just as Clinton is hoping to pull off the rare feat of keeping her party in the White House for a third straight term. Many economists believe the Fed should just do nothing. \u2018The Fed has committed to hiking this year. I don\u2019t think they should do it but I think they will do it,\u201d said Green. \u2018And there is no reason to think we are going to see wage growth coming back in a big way\u2019 between now and 2016.\u201d http://politi.co/1KBQj4l\nM.M. MINUTE: G.E. ON EX-IM \u2014 M.M. spoke with G.E. Vice Chairman John Rice on the continued delay of Ex-Im reauthorization: \u201cI\u2019m not confident and I\u2019m worried. I see a majority of Senate and House that support the reauthorization of Ex-Im but a process that has been hijacked by a minority \u2026 For a company like ours it means that we have to explore all other options to ensure that we can satisfy bid requirements in terms of the availability of export credit financing. And that means thinking about doing stuff that we could do in the U.S. in other places.\n\u201cWhat I think people miss who are on the other side of this is that frequently It\u2019s not our choice about whether we have access to export financing or not. To bid compliantly in many cases for infrastructure projects you have to have access to export credit finance. \u2026 And that means that where we have choices about where to make things \u2026 We are obligated to choose a place where we can get access to export credit financing \u2026 The notion that it\u2019s just a choice for a company like GE just illustrates how little the opponents understand about how global businesses operate.\u201d\nM.M. CUTTING ROOM FLOOR \u2014 More from Austan Goolsbee on Clinton\u2019s economic challenge that didn\u2019t make the piece: \u201cIf you look at last four or five years the economy has been remarkably stable doing exactly what it\u2019s been doing for that entire time, which is growing at a modest rate, not bad but not blockbuster either. Then it becomes a bit of a Rorschach test if you are looking for positive signs there are many positive signs \u2026 But if you are looking for something wrong, if you are growing modestly there will continue to be people out of the labor force, many people not going back, many problem companies \u2026\n\u201cNo one claims credit unless you are growing at 7 percent or the stock market is going up 25 percent every year and wages are rising strongly for two years \u2026 There were people who thought summer of 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 would be when growth rate would take off and it hasn\u2019t. Some years like 2014 we have a blockbuster year for jobs even though growth remains modest \u2026 It\u2019s a false choice to say [Clinton] needs to get up say, \u2018We are going to do everything that Obama did\u2019 or to be like Trump or Walker or Bush and say, \u2018Whatever they did we will do the opposite.\u2019 And I don\u2019t think they are failing for that false choice.\u201d\nGOOD FRIDAY MORNING \u2014 Happy weekend, everyone!\nDRIVING THE DAY \u2014 Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and Deputy Secretary Raskin attend the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) Principals meeting \u2026 Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Martin O\u2019Malley and Ben Carson all speak to that Urban meeting in Florida \u2026 Lester Holt will interview Bush for \u201cNightly News\u201d on Friday evening \u2026\nTHIS MORNING ON POLITICO\u00a0PRO\u00a0FINANCIAL SERVICES\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u00a0Patrick Temple-West on the populist wave in FINRA\u2019s contested board elections\u2026\u00a0[http://politico.pro/1LZGmy5] For\u00a0Pro's subscriber-only coverage -- and to get Morning Money every day before 6 a.m. -- please contact\u00a0Pro\u00a0Services at (703) 341-4600 or\u00a0info@politicopro.com\n** A message from MetLife: We keep our promises.

Garibay has served as the Forum\u2019s deputy communications\u00a0director for two years, handling all financial services and economic-related communications. She has previously served as Communications Director for the House Financial Services\u00a0Committee and in the Treasury Department\u2019s legislative office in the Bush Administration.\u201d\nCLINTON WOOS LABOR \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Brian Mahoney and Gabriel Debenedetti: \u201cIt\u2019s no secret to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign that it won\u2019t win the backing of the country\u2019s most powerful labor organization quite yet. Instead, the Democratic front-runner\u2019s machine is turning its attention to individual leaders one by one, looking to methodically win over unions as she faces off against an insurgent Bernie Sanders \u2014 a longtime union ally \u2026\n\u201cClinton spent about an hour with the AFL-CIO\u2019s executive council on Thursday, with the ultimate goal of securing the formal endorsement of the federation of 57 labor unions and the political organization and millions of dollars in campaign money that would come with it. But while Sanders shows staying power in the early-voting states, the organized labor movement sees an opportunity to gain leverage over the party\u2019s likely nominee\u201d http://politi.co/1DTvIAE\nDEFENDING VAROUFAKIS \u2014 Mohamed A. El-Erian: \u201cFrom blaming him for the renewed collapse of the Greek economy to accusing him of illegally plotting Greece\u2019s exit from the eurozone, it has become fashionable to disparage\u00a0Yanis Varoufakis, the country\u2019s former finance minister. While I have never met or spoken to him, I believe that he is getting a bad rap (and increasingly so). In the process, attention is being diverted away from the issues that are central to Greece\u2019s ability to recover and prosper \u2014 whether it stays in the eurozone or decides to leave.\u201d http://bit.ly/1IO3G0X\nU.S. BANKS TAKE GLOBAL LEAD \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Justin Baer and Max Colchester: \u201cIn the trans-Atlantic rivalry for investment-banking supremacy, the Americans are running up the score. European bank executives over the past week have delivered a series of dour proclamations about their need to shrink and further dial back their global ambitions. Meanwhile U.S. banks are preparing to pounce, with executives touting the gloom emanating from their European counterparts as a big opportunity to press their newfound advantage. \u2026 On Thursday,\u00a0Deutsche Bank\u00a0AG\u2019s new co-Chief Executive\u00a0John Cryan\u00a0wrapped up the first half\u2019s earnings period for major European banks by warning of more pain to come. \u2026\n\u201cThose remarks followed\u00a0Barclays\u00a0PLC Chairman\u00a0John McFarlane,\u00a0who on Wednesday conceded that the big Wall Street firms are \u2018an enormous threat\u2019 to European investment banks. \u2026 The diverging paths are now clear, at least to investors. Over the past five years, the shares of\u00a0J.P. Morgan Chase\u00a0& Co.,\u00a0Bank of America, Citigroup,\u00a0Goldman Sachs Group\u00a0Inc.\u00a0and\u00a0Morgan Stanley\u00a0have climbed, on average, by 45 percent. In the same period, European banks Barclays,\u00a0Credit Suisse Group\u00a0AG, Deutsche Bank, UBS Group AG and\u00a0Royal Bank of Scotland\u00a0PLC are down 17 percent.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1ORM4jP\nHILLARY TALKS UP $12 MINIMUM WAGE \u2014 NYT\u2019s Nicholas Fandos: \u201cFresh off a meeting with national labor leaders, Hillary Rodham Clinton on Thursday spoke favorably about legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour, tacitly dismissing proposals by her two leading Democratic competitors who have called for a bigger increase. Speaking with reporters, Mrs. Clinton singled out legislation proposed by Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, that would establish a $12-an-hour minimum nationwide. \u2018Patty Murray is one of the most effective legislators in the Senate, bar none,\u2019 Mrs. Clinton said. \u2018Whatever she advocates, I pay a lot of attention to.\u2019\u201d http://nyti.ms/1DTZ4iv\nTSIPRAS BEATS THE LEFT \u2014 FT\u2019s Kerin Hope in Athens: \u201cAlex Tsipras won his battle with a mutinous far-left faction in the governing Syriza party after a day of tense discussions that laid bare deepening divisions within the party over a new \u20ac86bn bailout being negotiated with Greece\u2019s creditors. The prime minister\u2019s proposal to hold an extraordinary party congress in September to examine the bailout once it has been completed was approved by Syriza\u2019s 200-strong central committee in Athens early on Friday, without resorting to a roll-call vote \u2026\n\u201cMr Tsipras\u2019s earlier suggestion of a party referendum on the bailout to be held immediately was dropped following objections by Panagiotis Lafazanis, the premier\u2019s sharpest critic and leader of the rebellious Left Platform, the party\u2019s internal opposition\u201d http://on.ft.com/1SPYV6u\nTRUMP SOURS ON DEBT \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Michael Hirsh: \u201c[A] closer look at the New York magnate\u2019s career reveals a less ballyhooed transformation from a brash builder for whom amassing and manipulating huge debt was a business model into a chastened cash-hoarder who would rather license his name than take out a loan. In a phrase, debt tamed the Donald, rather than the other way around\u201d http://politi.co/1KCGYJz\nIS RICK PERRY RUNNING FOR THE WRONG OFFICE? \u2014 Reuters Breaking Views\u2019 Rob Cox: \u201cThe presidential candidate and ex-governor of Texas is a proponent of laissez-faire markets. Yet he has joined a global chorus of politicos and watchdogs pushing policies designed to break up the big banks, a form of state-sponsored industrial re-engineering. If he\u2019s serious, he\u2019d make a better Wall Street regulator than White House boss.\u201d http://reut.rs/1SQ452c\nGOP RALLIES BEHIND BLOCKING PLANNED PARENTHOOD \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Burgess Everett and Jennifer Haberkorn: \u201cRepublicans are rallying behind a bare-knuckle strategy to strip Planned Parenthood\u2019s government support via a must-pass fall spending bill, a momentum shift that dramatically increases the chances of a government shutdown fight this fall. \u2026 What started out as a push from socially conservative firebrands like Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and 18 House members on Wednesday, is spreading to include more centrist members of the Senate GOP. On Thursday, Arizona Republican John McCain, who often tacks to the middle in the Senate, not only backed a plan to link Planned Parenthood defunding with spending legislation, he suggested the move was inevitable.\u201d\n\u201cAsked about eliminating the organization\u2019s $528 million in government funding in a spending bill, Orrin Hatch of Utah, the chamber\u2019s most senior senator replied: \u2018It\u2019s the right way to go.\u2019 Meanwhile, Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) said dozens of House Republicans will back his threat \u2014 delivered in a letter to Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) \u2014 to shoot down any legislation that funds Planned Parenthood this fall. \u2018We have to find a way to fund the government without giving any more money to this\u2019 organization, Mulvaney said Wednesday evening\u201d http://politi.co/1KCECdz\nALSO FOR YOUR RADAR \u2014\nCLINTON\u2019S AWKWARD UBS CONNECTION \u2014 WSJ\u2019s James V. Grimaldi and Rebecca Ballhaus: \u201cA few weeks after\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0was sworn in as secretary of state in early 2009, she was summoned to Geneva by her Swiss counterpart to discuss an urgent matter. The Internal Revenue Service was suing UBS AG to get the identities of Americans with secret accounts. \u2026 If the case proceeded, Switzerland\u2019s largest bank would face an impossible choice: Violate Swiss secrecy laws by handing over the names, or refuse and face criminal charges in U.S. federal court.\n\u201cWithin months, Mrs. Clinton announced a tentative legal settlement \u2014 an unusual intervention by the top U.S. diplomat. UBS ultimately turned over information on 4,450 accounts, a fraction of the 52,000 sought by the IRS, an outcome that drew criticism from some lawmakers who wanted a more extensive crackdown. \u2026 From that point on, UBS\u2019s engagement with the Clinton family\u2019s charitable organization increased. Total donations by UBS to the Clinton Foundation grew from less than $60,000 through 2008 to a cumulative total of about $600,000 by the end of 2014, according to the foundation and the bank.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1SPEDKc\nBITCOINERS AT BRETTON WOODS \u2014 Earlier this month Consumers\u2019 Research convened a group of top digital currency experts at Bretton Woods in New Hampshire to discuss the future of cryptocurrency/bitcoin and specifically, to produce a \u2018comprehensive assessment of where bitcoin is, where it may go, and what might prevent it from getting there.\u2019\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1IbZGSv\n** A message from MetLife: Building on a nearly 150-year legacy of excellence, MetLife is committed to ensuring a future in which we can continue helping people, families and communities around the world get the most out of life.
