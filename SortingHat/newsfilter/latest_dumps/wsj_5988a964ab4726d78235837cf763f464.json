{"body": "Since the performance of political debaters is mercilessly and repeatedly analyzed by reporters and pundits, it would be fair and delightful if someday they critiqued us back. \u201cJeb, I didn\u2019t really think that second question was aptly phrased, did you?\u201d \u201cNo, Scott, I didn\u2019t. And the anchor\u2019s ad lib had the rhythm of wit without the content, which is why it didn\u2019t land.\u201d \u201cSoon we\u2019ll hear from the columnists, who\u2019ll be out to shoot the wounded. Hope they don\u2019t injure themselves reaching for their little metaphors.\u201d\nI watched the pregame with these questions:\nWho will The Donald be? If he attempts a statesmanlike bearing will his numbers plummet? Does he know how much his people rely on him not to become domesticated? Will John Kasich start to break through in his home state? Who will Jeb be? Will he come awake? Will he look like a pleasant, bespectacled man who\u2019s actually thinking about dinner? Will he radiate the heaviness of the man who knows too well what can\u2019t be done? Because there\u2019s not much market for that.\nAlso I wondered, as I contemplated the idea of a long row of guys in ties, who my eye would go to. Your eye knows more than you do, it\u2019s drawn for reasons you don\u2019t understand. Part of the mystery of politics is connected to a mystery of show business. Mike Nichols once told me the biggest stars don\u2019t have perfect faces, but rather they\u2019re interestingly imperfect. Stars are stars because you can\u2019t take your eyes from them and don\u2019t know exactly why. So who would we drawn to look at? Who would we be hearing?\nI have been saying the early, back-of-the-pack debate might turn out to be the place to be\u2014low expectations, more airtime, a less intense atmosphere. Interesting things might happen. Also somewhere deep, deep down, where Republicans are sweet, some sympathetic rooting for the underdogs might occur. But it was tight, somber. You could hear the questions and answers echo in the empty hall, which gave it a lonely sound, like a one-camera debate in the early days of democracy in Estonia.\nThe reliably on-point and interesting  Carly Fiorina has been declared the overwhelming winner. That surprised me because I\u2019ve seen her better, including this past weekend at the Koch donors seminars in California, where to some she was a revelation. This is a strong, gutsy woman. The evening was a reminder that the debates are important: Those not preoccupied with politics were seeing her for the first time. Next time she will belong in the top tier.\nIt\u2019s still unclear why  George Pataki and  Jim Gilmore are there, and in a time of sustained national crisis their need is not endearing.  Lindsey Graham is supposed to have entered to be the voice of a burly, interventionist foreign policy in the age of Rand Paul. But it\u2019s not looking like the age of Rand Paul, and everyone\u2019s already being pretty burly. I don\u2019t understand his purpose.\nAs to the main event: Wow. I\u2019ve never seen a political debate come in so sparky. From the first minute it was hot as a pistol, with an electric crowd and highly pointed, even adversarial questions.\nThere are two headlines.\nThe first is that when Donald Trump was put on the spot on whether he would pledge not to launch a third-party campaign, it marked a break point in the Trump saga. It made it official: Mr. Trump sees himself as operating both within and without the party, and within it only at the moment. A political operative emailed me: \u201cHe just gave [a rude gesture] to the RNC.\u201d He did. Mr. Trump\u2019s fiery clash with Megyn Kelly, after she challenged him on crude things he has said about women, did not work in his favor. He was boorish and ungentlemanly. Yes, I know that sounds quaint. The things he was accused of saying, which he didn\u2019t deny, were ugly. However, the moment yielded probably the most memorable line of the evening: \u201cOnly Rosie O\u2019Donnell.\u201d\nMarco Rubio was fresh, crisp and poised. Hillary Clinton, he said, won\u2019t be able to lecture him on living paycheck to paycheck because \u201cI was raised paycheck to paycheck.\u201d He has successfully staked out the future as his theme\u2014one that of course is underscored by his youth.\nJohn Kasich spoke seriously and even soulfully on the mentally ill and drug-addicted in our prisons, and what must be done to help them. He was present and humorous. I thought him lovely on same-sex marriage: \u201cGod gives me unconditional love, I\u2019m gonna give it to my family and my friends and the people around me.\u201d It was clever of him to be gracious to Mr. Trump, who looked like he appreciated the break. I think Mr. Kasich broke through.\nWhen  Chris Christie and Rand Paul clashed on the issue of privacy and government surveillance, Mr. Paul accused Mr. Christie of taking President Obama\u2019s side: \u201cI know you gave him a big hug.\u201d Mr. Christie was quick: \u201cThe hugs that I remember are the hugs that I gave to the families,\u201d after 9/11. It was a fabulous cheap shot followed by excellent special pleading. Bravo for first-class fisticuffs.\nTed Cruz was fine. He didn\u2019t dominate as he has on some stages, but he caused himself no trouble. He\u2019ll get deadlier as the number of candidates winnows down.\nMike Huckabee is going hard and all in for Christians in Iowa.\nMr. Bush achieved adequacy. He received respectful and supportive applause whenever he said anything, but didn\u2019t say anything especially well. He continues to be the front-runner as odd duck.\nJeb has a low pilot light. The other day in the Koch seminar he started his Q&A with Politico\u2019s Mike Allen in a shrugging, sluggish way, as if he were surprised to be answering questions. He seems to me embarrassed by his ambition, as if for 40 years he\u2019d understood himself to be the singular Bush but now here he is, running for president like everyone else. Mr. Cruz, who had spoken before Mr. Bush, stayed to listen. Have you ever seen the look a cat gets in the second before he moves on the mouse? That look of full, predatory concentration? That was the look Mr. Cruz had as he watched.\nI just realized I haven\u2019t mentioned Scott Walker. He did himself no harm. He\u2019ll likely improve as the stage gets smaller too.\nThe second headline is that Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t the person your eye stayed on. It went to him first. But as the evening progressed, the other candidates stole his drama and thunder with their own claims and arguments. \u201cThe strength of the field is overshadowing Trump,\u201d wrote a Hill staffer. That was exactly it. I found other candidates as interesting\u2014more so.\nI really don\u2019t know if fiery debates like Thursday evening\u2019s will wind up building interest and excitement in the Republican field, or wearing and tearing it down. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll look back on this as the beginning of a making or a breaking. Maybe the former. Anyway, it was alive.
