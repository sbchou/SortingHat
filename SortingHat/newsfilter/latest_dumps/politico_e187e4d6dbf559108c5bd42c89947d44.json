But many candidates are preparing for a messy, fractious crawl to the 2016 nomination anyway \u2014 and they\u2019re stockpiling the cash to do it.\nTed Cruz has talked of an electorate so splintered no nominee is chosen before the party\u2019s July convention in Cleveland. His early fundraising claims\u2014 including around $38 million amassed by supportive super PACs \u2014 suggests his campaign could last that long.\nStory Continued Below\nRand Paul is betting on caucus states, including those that vote later in the cycle \u2014 channeling his father, who employed that strategy to remain viable late in the 2012 primary. Rick Santorum is planning a selective congressional-district-by-congressional-district strategy to amass delegates, the truest sign of a trench warfare outlook.\nAll of it is a function, Republican operatives and campaign strategists say, of an unusually crowded field and the virtually limitless campaign contributions ushered in by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizen\u2019s United case.\nAbout 20 candidates will divide Republican primary voters in so many ways, the argument goes, that it will be nearly impossible for anyone to claim a prohibitive lead after the first few states vote \u2014 meaning there would be little reason for longer-shot candidates to drop out even after a poor showing in Iowa or New Hampshire. And disparate super PACs empower wealthy donors to single-handedly sustain candidates for months.\nThen there\u2019s the shorter, more compact primary season that was intended by the RNC to prevent a drawn-out contest \u2014 that could convince some middle-of-the-pack candidates to hang on longer. Taken together, those dynamics could incentivize many longer-shot campaigns to embrace strategies that look well beyond the early states.\n\u201cEvery time you go and you start fiddling and messing with the rules, you invariably get the exact opposite result from the one you intended,\u201d said Steve Schmidt, who ran Sen. John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. \u201cThere could well be a contested convention.\u201d\nAlso on POLITICO\nSTEVEN SHEPARD\nOne reason why is that candidates like Cruz are amassing war chests that far outpace the second-tier candidates who ran in 2012. Back then, Santorum had just $229,000 on hand at the same point in the cycle, though he went on to win Iowa. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who won the South Carolina primary, had just $320,000 at the this point.\nPlenty of Republican operatives still expect a quick resolution to the race, convinced that the organization, infrastructure and talent of top-tier campaigns will swamp lesser candidates. So far, the contenders leading in the polls, from Jeb Bush (with a war chest expected to exceed $100 million) to Scott Walker to Marco Rubio, are generally keeping their attention fixed on the early states \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada \u2014 confident that they\u2019ll have the resources and infrastructure to last deep into the nomination fight, if necessary, but hoping for and expecting a more decisive win earlier.\nAlso on POLITICO\nDYLAN BYERS\nYet, even if the field shrinks after the first four states, the prospect that six, seven, even eight other candidates could survive well into the spring is leading some middle- or bottom-of-the-pack contenders to bluntly state that they will wage a more surgical bid for delegates, identifying discrete opportunities and pockets of voters to target \u2014 rather than focusing on which states to win. It\u2019s not what the RNC envisioned when it shortened the primary calendar and rewrote its rules to prevent a prolonged free-for-all.\n\u201cThis is going to go a long time,\u201d said John Brabender, a senior Santorum adviser. \u201cYou almost have to think, I believe, more like a consumer marketer rather than a traditional political marketer. This becomes about market share. No one\u2019s going to have market share in every market.\u201d\nFor the GOP long-shots, the best hope is a lengthy, drawn-out process. Brabender said his candidate is focused on competing at the congressional district level to siphon off enough support to collect delegates and stay alive deep into primary season.\n\u201cIt was the belief last time that you have to be in the top three or four to move on. Now, if you have 13 candidates, coming in fifth or sixth isn\u2019t necessarily too bad,\u201d he said.\nAlso on POLITICO\nMARC CAPUTO\nTo one prominent Republican, the strategy of amassing delegates, rather than the broader approach of running statewide campaigns, resembles a game of Monopoly.\n\u201cDo you buy Boardwalk or do you buy the railroads?\u201d wondered Ron Kaufman, a longtime adviser to Mitt Romney and an RNC committeeman.\nKaufman, a Bush supporter, said the strategies will in part rely on candidates\u2019 geographic strengths \u2014 New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, for example, will likely target his home state, delegate-rich New York, Delaware and try to secure a Northeastern beachhead. Walker, on the other hand, will attempt to lay claim to the Midwest, while also wooing a swath of conservative voters who won\u2019t align with his other likely Rust Belt competitor, Ohio Gov. John Kasich. The ultimate winner won\u2019t have to capture a majority of delegates, he said, just enough to show that victory is \u201cinevitable.\u201d\nUnder RNC rules, February is reserved for voting in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. But in March, a cascade of populous states \u2014 from Florida to Texas to Virginia to Ohio \u2014 will award enough delegates to practically determine the nominee, or at least elevate a presumptive winner. On March 1, a slew of Southern states are planning to host a so-called \u201cSEC primary.\u201d And after March 15, states are allowed to award delegates on a winner-take-all basis \u2014 rather than proportionally \u2014 which was expected to quickly thin the field. And the rules require all delegates to be awarded 45 days before the convention.\nIt\u2019s why RNC officials say they\u2019re confident that the race won\u2019t drag on \u2014 and that a brokered convention is all but a fantasy; the the last one occurred in 1976.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be intense. There\u2019s a really good possibility that by April 1 we could have a nominee,\u201d said a national Republican official. \u201cYou can\u2019t argue that it\u2019s going to be a longer, drawn-out process because mathematically, the calendar\u2019s a lot shorter.\u201d\nRepublican presidential candidate Sen.

Cruz, the Texas senator, says he can envision a brokered convention, telling conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt it is \u201ccertainly a possibility\u201d given the large field. And his political director told POLITICO recently that the campaign\u2019s strategy is to take the fight to the convention. The senator is devoting time to the early caucus and primary states, but has also been staffing up in late-voting states like California and New Jersey, which are scheduled to hold June primaries.\nOther candidates haven\u2019t gone quite as far as Cruz, but their allies and aides say they are also preparing for a long grind, though the degrees of effort vary.\n\u201cNobody knows whether the nomination is going to wrap up early or whether it will go all the way to the convention or something in between,\u201d said Steve Munisteri, a senior adviser to Paul, who emphasized he wasn\u2019t speaking for the campaign. \u201cWe are playing both the short and the long game with the initial emphasis on the short game, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re ignoring the long game.\u201d\nThe Paul campaign, for example, has emphasized that he\u2019ll make a big push in caucus states like Utah, Minnesota and Colorado.\n\u201cI still think the [early] states winnow down the field, but when you have between 15 and 18 candidates starting off, I also suspect that chances are, we will not know the nominee after the first four carve-out states,\u201d said Munisteri, the former chairman of the Republican Party of Texas. \u201cI\u2019m not with those people that say it\u2019s impossible to have a brokered convention when the nominee is not decided in advance of the convention, but I\u2019m also not one of those who says, just because you have 15 candidates, it means it\u2019ll go on for a long time.\u201d\nLast cycle, Santorum won 11 states as the alternative to Mitt Romney in 2012\u2019s protracted Republican primary. But he dropped out in April, before his home state voted. This time, Brabender said Santorum planned to showcase his strength in the Keystone State, a prelude to potentially competing there next spring. \u201cThis time, we\u2019re able to move multiple chess pieces at one time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a 50-state strategy. It\u2019s just not a one-state-at-a-time strategy.\u201d\nBut ultimately, while some of the long-shot candidates may be buoyed by a super PAC or wealthy donor, as Santorum was in 2012, they make a risky bet by assuming the front-runners will battle to a stalemate in the early states, thus creating an opening for alternative candidates, Kaufman said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s their hope. That\u2019s part of their plan,\u201d he said. \u201cIs that reality or fantasy?\u201d\nBy SEAN TRENDE\nBy GUSTAVO ARELLANO\nBy MICHAEL J.
