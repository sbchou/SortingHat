{"body": "For months, Hillary Rodham Clinton has been telling crowds, the news media, and anyone else who will listen that she \u201calways thought this would be a competitive race.\u201d\n\nBut she did not, at least until this past weekend, seriously anticipate the competition would include Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nMr. Biden has not yet announced whether he will join the race for the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination, but reports over the weekend that the 72-year-old former Delaware senator was seriously exploring a bid reignited discussion among Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers about what his potential candidacy would mean for the contest ahead.\n\nThe scenario of a Clinton-Biden matchup brought mixed emotions inside Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Brooklyn campaign headquarters. Many of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s senior staff members previously worked for Mr. Biden and hold him in the highest regard, especially after his son, Beau Biden, died in May at the age of 46 after a long battle with brain cancer.\n\nBut Mrs. Clinton\u2019s allies do not hide their annoyance at the implication by Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers and supporters that she is vulnerable, and ripe for a challenge from the vice president.\n\n\u201cShe has the most money and she is beating every Republican in most of the polls,\u201d Jennifer Palmieri, a spokeswoman for the campaign, told CNN on Sunday. \u201cSo you can\u2019t really ask for much more than that.\u201d\n\nMs. Palmieri and others pointed to the many endorsements Mrs. Clinton has already secured and the more than $45 million her campaign raised in the three months since she officially announced her candidacy in April, much of which came from supporters excited about potentially electing the first female president.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Clinton campaign will introduce its first television advertisements in Iowa and New Hampshire, which the campaign manager, Robby Mook, called \u201cthe natural next step\u201d as Mrs. Clinton is \u201cworking to earn every vote.\u201d\n\nHaving Mr. Biden as an opponent could help Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign in its efforts to shed the perception of inevitability that hurt her with Iowa caucusgoers in the 2008 contest. Back then, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Biden sparred on the debate stage before Mr. Biden withdrew from the race after receiving less than 1 percent of the vote in the Iowa caucuses.\n\nGoing up against Mr. Biden again in the first Democratic debate in October could help Mrs. Clinton hone her skills and appear to be working for the nomination, said Steve Elmendorf, a veteran Democratic strategist. \u201cYou\u2019re a better general election candidate if you have competition,\u201d he said. \u201cThe vice president would be a formidable opponent.\u201d\n\n(Mrs. Clinton has already denounced parts of one of Mr. Biden\u2019s signature pieces of legislation in the Senate, the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which former President Bill Clinton signed into law.)\n\nFriends described Mr. Biden\u2019s relationship with Mrs. Clinton in the Senate as cordial and warm. But his relationship with the Clintons has not been without awkwardness and slights.\n\nIn December 2011, pollsters working for President Obama\u2019s re-election campaign asked voters in an indirect but obvious way whether they would be more inclined to vote for Mr. Obama if Mrs. Clinton, rather than Mr. Biden, were his running mate.\n\nThe following year, as Mr. Obama planned his speech for the annual White House Correspondents\u2019 Association Dinner, he made sure to edit out a joke about dropping Mr. Biden from the ticket, concerned the subject would further annoy the vice president.\n\nMr. Obama has been careful not to undermine or wholeheartedly endorse his former secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton, or his vice president. \u201cThe president has said that the best political decision he\u2019s ever made in his career has been to ask Joe Biden to run as his vice president,\u201d Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman, said last week.\n\nFor a while, speculation about Mr. Biden\u2019s plans had subsided as he cared for his son and ceased any discussion of politics. In June, Mr. and Mrs. Clinton attended the funeral Mass of Beau Biden.\n\nIn what seemed the most telling sign that the vice president may have decided against a run, the Clinton campaign brought on Ron Klain, a close Biden confidant, to help Mrs. Clinton prepare for the Democratic debates.\n\nBut in June, The Wall Street Journal reported that Beau Biden had encouraged his father to run before he died. And that was followed by a Maureen Dowd column published Saturday by The New York Times reporting that Mr. Biden was holding meetings in his residence, \u201ctalking to friends, family and donors about jumping in\u201d to challenge Mrs. Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire. Those reports heightened speculation about his plans, which he will likely decide on by early September.\n\nThe possibility of a Biden candidacy has brought renewed focus to one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s challenges. For all the advantages she has in terms of Democratic support, donations and a seasoned campaign staff, she struggles to connect with voters in an authentic way. \u201cJoyless\u201d was how one prominent Democratic Party official who supports Mrs. Clinton \u2014 and would only criticize the campaign without attribution \u2014 described her candidacy.\n\nMr. Biden is known for his passionate, unscripted presence on the campaign trail, a trait that endeared him to voters but has also landed him in hot water for his inartful, at times offensive, comments.\n\n\u201cFinally Biden may jump in as Hillary slips almost daily,\u201d the conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch wrote on Twitter. \u201cBiden decent, smart pol but gets in trouble as a motormouth!\u201d", "byline": "AMY CHOZICK", "description": "Reports that Mr. Biden was seriously exploring entering the 2016 race reignited discussion among Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers about what his potential candidacy would mean for the contest ahead.", "title": "Hillary Clinton Campaign Weighs Implications of Potential Joe Biden Challenge", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/us/politics/hillary-clinton-campaign-weighs-implications-of-potential-joe-biden-challenge.html", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Joe Biden", "Steve Elmendorf", "Bill Clinton", "Beau Biden", "Hillary Clinton", "Jennifer Palmieri", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Barack Obama", "Maureen Dowd", "Eric Schultz", "Rupert Murdoch", "Joseph R.
