{"body": "DONALD TRUMP gives me his Grumpy Cat look.\n\nI\u2019m sitting in his office in Trump Tower high above Fifth Avenue, next to a wall plastered with framed magazine covers giving the effect of an infinity mirror, his face endlessly multiplying \u2014 including an old Playboy with the real estate mogul slyly smiling next to a comely bunny.\n\n\u201cI could put up 40 of those walls,\u201d he says. \u201cI have covers in warehouses. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m trying to tell the freshly minted pol that Megyn Kelly had the right to ask him a question in the debate on how he talks about women, and that she should be tough on the front-runner.\n\nHe\u2019s not buying it. In fact, in his stubborn \u201cI win, you lose\u201d way, he has an assistant come over to hand me a printout of Gabriel Sherman\u2019s New York magazine piece headlined \u201cHow Roger Ailes Picked Trump, and Fox News\u2019 Audience, Over Megyn Kelly.\u201d\n\nBut the 69-year-old is trying hard not to bare his claws at any women right now. His wife, Melania, and his daughter Ivanka have told him they don\u2019t want him to come across as a misogynist when they don\u2019t see him that way.\n\n\u201cI have many women executives and they are paid at least as much as the men,\u201d he said. \u201cI find women to be amazing.\u201d\n\nThe billionaire braggart known for saying unfiltered things is trying to be diplomatic. Sort of.\n\nIt has suddenly hit Trump that he\u2019s leading the Republican field in a race where many candidates, including the two joyless presumptive nominees, are sputtering. He\u2019s got the party by the tail \u2014 still a punch line but not a joke.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal huffed that Trump\u2019s appeal was \u201cattitude, not substance,\u201d and the nascent candidate is still figuring out the pesky little details, like staff and issues, dreaming up his own astringent campaign ads for Instagram on ISIS and China.\n\nThe other candidates, he says, \u201chave pollsters; they pay these guys $200,000 a month to tell them, \u2018Don\u2019t say this, don\u2019t say that, you use the wrong word, you shouldn\u2019t put a comma here.\u2019 I don\u2019t want any of that. I have a nice staff, but no one tells me what to say. I go by my heart. The combination of heart and brain. When Hillary gets up there she reads and then goes away for three days.\u201d\n\nAs he headed off this weekend to see the butter cow in Iowa \u2014 \u201cIowa is very clean. It\u2019s not like a lot of places where you and I would go, like New York City\u201d \u2014 Trump is puzzling over a conundrum: How does he curb the merciless heckler side of himself, the side that has won over voters who think he\u2019s a refreshing truth teller, so that he can seem refined enough to win over voters who think he\u2019s crude and cartoonish?\n\nHow does he tone it down when he\u2019s proud of his outrageous persona, his fiery wee-hours Twitter arrows and campaign \u201cgusto,\u201d and gratified by the way he can survive dissing John McCain and rating Heidi Klum when that would be a death knell for someone like Scott Walker?\n\n\u201cSometimes I do go a little bit far,\u201d he allowed, adding, after a moment: \u201cHeidi Klum. Sadly, she\u2019s no longer a 10.\u201d\n\nHe could act more refined, he muses over spaghetti and meatballs, with a side of pulled pork, in the Trump Tower restaurant, as fans gawk and wait for selfies, but that would make for a boring lunch.\n\nHe relishes giving me a play-by-play of the Kelly and Rosie O\u2019Donnell donnybrooks as though he\u2019s talking about Pacquiao-Mayweather. He beams with pride when he talks about Rush Limbaugh marveling about how much \u201cincoming\u201d he can take.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a counterpuncher,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t hit people who don\u2019t hit me. Maybe that\u2019s my weakness. Perry started it. Lindsey Graham started it. This moron Rand Paul just started it because he is mired in 12th place and he\u2019s a U.S. senator.\u201d\n\nHe said Rosie was a bully and the only way to beat bullies is to smack them in the nose.\n\nSo he doesn\u2019t think of himself as a bully?\n\nHe looks hurt. \u201cOh, no, the opposite,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ll go a step further. The way to do best with me is to be really nice to me.\u201d\n\nI mention that George Will has written a column demanding that Republican leaders renounce Trump as a cynical opportunist \u201cderanged by egotism.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo George Will came to Mar-a-Lago 10 years ago and made a speech,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI refused to go because he\u2019s a boring person.\u201d Trump said he stayed on the patio and had dinner and that offended Will. (Will says he has \u201cother and better reasons for thinking it might not be altogether wise to entrust him with the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal.\u201d)\n\nI tell Trump that he has transcended the level of narcissism common in a profession full of narcissists. He is, after all, wearing a red tie with a label by \u201ca wonderful guy named Trump,\u201d as he wryly puts it, with his Brioni suit. In the latest Time, Jeffrey Kluger, the author of \u201cThe Narcissist Next Door,\u201d said \u201cpeople at ease inside their skin just don\u2019t behave the way Trump does.\u201d\n\nI ask if he was always like this, boasting that he had the best baby food and the best high chair?\n\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think people change that much,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m a solid, stable person.\u201d Knocking on the wooden restaurant wall, he added: \u201cI am a man of great achievement. I win, Maureen, I always win. Knock on wood. I win. It\u2019s what I do. I beat people. I win.\u201d\n\nNo insecurities?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you would define insecurity as it pertains to me,\u201d he replies.\n\nHe does have a germ phobia and carries packs of germicidal disposable wipes. He describes how a man came out of a restaurant bathroom the other night with wet hands wanting to clasp his hand. \u201cSo what do I do?\u201d Trump asked. \u201cI don\u2019t eat. That\u2019s O.K.\u201d\n\nI note that many people still think his bid is more runaway Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day balloon than a run on meaningful issues.\n\nHe says it\u2019s real, noting: \u201cI was with Carl Icahn yesterday and I said, \u2018Carl, if I get this thing you are going to represent me on China. Maybe I\u2019ll even give you China and Japan.\u2019 You know, the money they are ripping from us.\u201d\n\nHe is trying to be a bit more low key. He says he thought it would be \u201ccool\u201d not to put his name on some of his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d caps. But it\u2019s hard to imagine Trump implementing impulse control.\n\nWhat if, I ask him, he fires off a nuclear tweet at Vladimir Putin insulting his pecs or Kim Jong-un calling him a \u201cfat little slob\u201d?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll only do it for a purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cI have total control. I will get along great with these people. I\u2019m a dealmaker. I\u2019m the best dealmaker there is.\u201d\n\nHow will he deal with Carly Fiorina, who is being hailed as the one to slay Trump after she excoriated him, interpreting his blood \u201cwherever\u201d remark as being about Kelly\u2019s period. (I don\u2019t think he meant it that way.)\n\n\u201cCarly has to be a little bit careful,\u201d he warned.\n\nWhat if he bursts into Trumpian analysis of how Carly and Hillary look?\n\n\u201cOh, I would never talk about their looks,\u201d he replied primly. He did, however, imitate how his ears felt (\u201cEeeeeeeeee\u201d) when he hears Carly\u2019s \u201cstaccato bing, bing, bing\u201d voice and delivery.\n\nHow important are women\u2019s looks to him?\n\nHe said he has found looks can hold you back, that \u201csome of the great looking men and women, they\u2019ve never had a problem getting a date, they\u2019ve never had a problem in life, now they get into a world which is a cruel place and they don\u2019t fight as hard.\u201d\n\nI ask Trump if he can at least admit that President Obama was born in this country.\n\nThe Grumpy Cat face comes back. \u201cNo comment,\u201d he murmurs.\n\nLightning Round With Donald Trump: Maureen Dowd shares more of his impressions on rivals and boldface names here.
