Jason Chaffetz has officially launched his dark-horse campaign for House speaker, arguing he\u2019s a better choice to unite the fractious Republican conference and that Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy lacks the communication skills and credibility with conservatives needed to succeed in the top leadership job.\nIn a lengthy interview with POLITICO in his Capitol Hill office this weekend, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee predicted that opposition from conservatives will block McCarthy from securing the 218 votes he needs to be elected on the House floor later this month \u2013 and so Chaffetz is pitching himself as an alternative.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cThere are very few people who can win the support of our hardcore conservatives and yet be palatable to our more moderate members,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is who can help unite the party and bridge the divide and I hope they see me as the person that will give everyone a fair shake.\u201d\nMcCarthy has broad support within the House Republican Conference and remains the overwhelming favorite to succeed outgoing Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). And it\u2019s unclear how much support Chaffetz can actually garner. Chaffetz, who remarked that he\u2019s \u201ccomfortable with losing,\u201d would not say whether he has any pledged supporters.\nBut until now, McCarthy faced only token opposition in Florida Rep. Daniel Webster; Chaffetz, by contrast, is the head of a major committee and a respected figure among the rank-and-file. At the very least, the Utah Republican\u2019s last-minute entry complicates McCarthy\u2019s path and highlights the uneasiness with which the centrist Californian is viewed among the most conservative members of the GOP conference.\nChaffetz argued that Republicans would be getting more of the same with McCarthy \u2014 inviting the same discord that\u2019s racked the conference during Boehner\u2019s five years in the job.\n\u201cWe owe Kevin McCarthy a lot; he is a major reason we enjoy the majority, with the strongest numbers we\u2019ve had since the 1920s,\u201d Chaffetz said. \u201cBut there are too many members who won\u2019t promote (an) existing (member of) leadership just because there\u2019s a vacancy.\u201d\nChaffetz said McCarthy is likely to secure the backing of a majority of Republicans during a secret-ballot conference vote on Thursday. But the floor vote for speaker, expected later in the month, is a different matter, Chaffetz said. Members must openly declare their position, and Chaffetz is convinced that McCarthy won't receive enough backing to become speaker.\n\u201cI think the math is the biggest challenge for Kevin McCarthy,\u201d Chaffetz said.\nChaffetz went on to question McCarthy\u2019s talent as a communicator, on the heels of the majority leader\u2019s statement last week that the Benghazi Committee investigation of Hillary Clinton has damaged the Democratic frontrunner's campaign. Democrats said the comments exposed the true motives of Republicans in creating the committee.\nMcCarthy later walked back his remarks after a firestorm of criticism, but Chaffetz was not assuaged.\nWith the first votes in the presidential race just months away, he said, \u201cWe have to have someone who can communicate the conservative message to America, and that deeply undercut it.\u201d\nChaffetz, a frequent guest on cable TV news, touted himself as a superior public speaker.\n\u201cWe need a speaker who speaks,\u201d Chaffetz added. \u201cWe lose the communication war time and time again, and I think the conference wants a proactive communicator.\u201d\nChaffetz\u2019s age and experience level could hinder him. He is two years younger and has been in Congress for less time than McCarthy, who himself is relatively green compared with past speakers.\nChaffetz said he\u2019d approach the speakership as more of a facilitator, allowing the majority of the GOP conference to work its will.\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to be a dictator but to empower members to do what they see fit. I want the process to work its way through the body,\u201d he said.\nThat means more debate and more power delegated to the committees, he said, rather than having the speaker act as final decision-maker on big policy issues.\n\u201cI\u2019m not scared of diversity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to have debates and win the argument, and if there are amendments that need to be brought up so we find out where the party is, so be it.\u201d\nAsked if, as speaker, he would have allowed a vote on a \"clean\" short-term funding bill that did not include a provision to defund Planned Parenthood, Chaffetz said he would have looked to the committees for guidance. The same goes with raising the debt ceiling, which must happen by early November in order to avoid a first-ever government default.\n\u201cThe only way you can raise the debt ceiling is to change the trajectory of spending \u2014 that\u2019s my personal preference,\" he said. \"But I want the Ways and Means Committee to offer up a solution.\u201d \nChaffetz said he felt compelled to jump in because the people he considers the best candidates for speaker \u2014 Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Benghazi Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) \u2014 won\u2019t run.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t plan on running for speaker, but I don\u2019t see anyone else stepping up,\u201d he said. \u201cI know I\u2019m the underdog.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "In a POLITICO interview, the underdog challenger says Kevin McCarthy lacks communication skills and the trust of conservatives.", "title": "Chaffetz enters speaker's race, pans McCarthy", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/jason-chaffetz-speaker-mccarthy-republicans-boehner-214404", "topics": ["immigration", "abortion"], "people": ["Bryan Bender", "Allie Grasgreen Ciaramella", "John King", "Manuel Noriega", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Rachael Bade", "Hillary Clinton", "Henry C.
