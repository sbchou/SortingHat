As Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz and Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew head to the Hill for a series of open- and closed-door meetings to face lawmakers\u2019 questions and screeds over the Iran deal, the White House is also going into campaign mode \u2013 with the public.
