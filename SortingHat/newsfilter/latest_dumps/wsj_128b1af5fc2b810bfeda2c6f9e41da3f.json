{"body": "The first words out of Donald Trump\u2019s mouth last night (not counting his opening statement) were also among the oddest: \u201cWell, first of all, Rand Paul shouldn\u2019t even be on this stage. He\u2019s No.\u00a011, he\u2019s got 1% in the polls, and how he got up here, there\u2019s far too many people anyway.\u201d\nThat was in response to Carly Fiorina\u2019s answer to the first question of the night, in which Paul\u2019s name had not come up. Nor did Paul mention Trump in his inoffensive opening statement. Trump\u2019s attack on Paul was out of the blue.\nFor the record, it was also based on a false premise. According to CNN, Paul was No.\u00a08 in one of its rankings and No.\u00a010 in the other; he polled at an average of 4.7% in the former and 3.2% in the latter. No.\u00a011 in the two rankings were Fiorina and Chris Christie, respectively. Both were included by virtue of having finished in the top 10 in one of the two rankings. Paul led Christie in both rankings.\nBut that\u2019s a quibble. More noteworthy was the strangeness of a presidential candidate in a debate talking about opinion polls\u2014a subject to which Trump returned twice. When Scott Walker compared Trump\u2019s business bankruptcies unfavorably with Walker\u2019s own balanced state budgets, Trump might have pointed out that states cannot go bankrupt and the Wisconsin Constitution mandates a balanced budget. Instead he went for the argumentum ad populum:\nAnd when moderator Jake Tapper asked Trump to \u201ctell Gov. Bush why you are a serious candidate and what your qualifications are to be commander in chief,\u201d Trump began his response: \u201cI\u2019ve actually been in politics all my life, although I\u2019ve been on that side as opposed to this side. I\u2019m now a politician for about three months. Obviously, I\u2019m doing pretty well. I\u2019m No.\u00a01 in every polls [sic] by a lot.\u201d\nNote that Trump was not making the \u201celectability\u201d argument, that he is better positioned than his nomination rivals to defeat Hillary Clinton or another Democrat. Polls to date argue to the contrary. Rather, to the extent that his boast can be construed as an argument, it amounts to a tautological one: Vote for me, I\u2019m popular. It\u2019s as if he mistook the bandwagon effect for a syllogism.\nAnd yet the Trump ergo Trump argument does capture something about Trump\u2019s success, such as it is. His lead in the polls is what made him the dominant figure in last night\u2019s debate, as well as last month\u2019s.\nModerators at both debates led off with questions designed to isolate Trump, the effect of which was to elevate him. Whereas last month\u2019s Fox hosts directed those questions directly to Trump, CNN\u2019s Tapper tended to play let\u2019s-you-and-him-fight. His opening question to Fiorina was whether she agreed with Bobby Jindal, who \u201csaid he wouldn\u2019t want, quote, \u2018such a hothead with his finger on the nuclear codes.\u2019\u00a0\u201d (Jindal is the governor of Louisiana.)\nFiorina was wise enough to decline the bait, even when Tapper offered it a second time: \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question. Would you feel comfortable with Donald Trump\u2019s finger on the nuclear codes?\u201d Fiorina: \u201cThat\u2019s not for me to answer; it is for the voters of this country to answer, and I have a lot of faith in the common sense and good judgment of the voters of the United States of America.\u201d\nBoth CNN and Fox put poll-leading Trump at center stage, flanked by his closest rivals (Jeb Bush and Ben Carson last night, Bush and Walker last month). That meant he was usually on screen when they were talking. Viewers\u2019 eyes were drawn to Trump because he has an interesting face and likes to mug for the camera.\nWhen lower-ranked candidates like Fiorina talked about Trump, CNN provided a split screen, with the same effect, which was to make Trump look dominant. The Washington Post\u2019s David Farenthold observed late last night that while Fiorina \u201cjabbed Trump,\u201d \u201cstill, Trump dominated the night\u2019s conversation\u2014with other candidates often asked to react to things he\u2019d said,\u201d although Trump \u201clost his role as the dominant player in the debate\u2019s second hour\u201d as \u201cFiorina became a dominant figure.\u201d\nThat leads us to think that if Trump loses his dominance in the polls\u2014if he falls to No.\u00a02 or 3 over the coming weeks or months\u2014he will lose the capacity to dominate the debates. The moderators and other candidates would pay him less attention; and viewers would laugh at, rather than with, his braggadocio if it were coming from a position of weakness.\nFiorina\u2019s presence on last night\u2019s stage may prove to be Trump\u2019s undoing. Dominance games operate under very different rules when one of the players is female\u2014something that Trump shows signs of starting to realize. His spat with Fox\u2019s Megyn Kelly last month had no evident effect on his poll ratings, and he seemed to be following the same pattern with Fiorina, disparaging her appearance then implausibly trying to explain the insult away the next day.\nBut last night Trump tried a different tack. Tapper once again tried to goad Fiorina into fighting with Trump:\nWill Trump\u2019s new approach fend off the threat from Fiorina? As we did last month, we watched the debate with a mostly female audience at New York\u2019s Women\u2019s National Republican Club.
