In fact, they now rank comfortably among the top one-tenth of the top 1 percent of earners. \nHer net worth is $32,015,000, according to POLITICO\u2019s analysis of her most recent financial disclosure. \nThe Clintons financial turnaround is largely due to Bill Clinton turning on the money-making faucet immediately after leaving office \u2014 but it was always Hillary Clinton who was more concerned with the family's finances and wanted them to earn money to pay off their debts. Raised by a strict father who owned a small business, she always wanted a safety net, but Bill Clinton rarely spent time worrying or thinking about financial security.\nWhen Bill Clinton served as Arkansas attorney general, Hillary Clinton was building a nest egg: Her $1,000 in cattle futures with an adviser turned into $100,000 in less than a year. She played a more central role in the couple\u2019s involvement in the Whitewater land deal, the source of many of their future legal troubles.\nIn 1991, tax returns show, Bill Clinton earned $46,854 as governor of Arkansas, while Hillary Clinton made $188,547 as an attorney at the Rose Law Firm. As first lady, she earned no salary for eight years, watching their bills pile up.\n\n\n\n            By \nGabriel Debenedetti\n\nBy the end of Clinton\u2019s term, the couple faced $11.3 million in legal bills from investigations into the Whitewater land deal and the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Two legal defense funds covered about $7.4 million, but they still faced $4 million in debts. Part of the amount was related to an $850,000 settlement in a a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Bill Clinton by former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones. \nThey appealed for help under the Independent Counsel Act, which covers legal fees in cases that do not lead to indictment. But they got only $85,000. \nBill Clinton survived an impeachment vote on Feb. 12, 1999, and that same day, Hillary Clinton began planning her run for the Senate, poring over a New York map with former White House top aide Harold Ickes.\nTo run, the Clintons would have to establish New York residency. Bill Clinton did not worry about how they would pay for a house, associates recalled. But Hillary Clinton, longtime acquaintances said, was fraught. \u201cIt goes against every grain in her body to spend money they don\u2019t have yet,\u201d a friend recalled. \u201cWhile I think intellectually she knew they would have money, she was concerned. She wanted to get her bills paid. It was more scary for her than it was for him.\u201d\nThey purchased in the fall of 1999 a five-bedroom, $1.7 million Chappaqua farmhouse with just over an acre of land. Their longtime friend and fundraiser Terry McAuliffe, now the Virginia governor, guaranteed their mortgage by placing $1.35 million as collateral. A month later, they obtained new financing for the house, allowing them to drop the arrangement with McAuliffe. \nAround that time, Hillary Clinton signed her $8 million deal for her memoir, Living History, after a spirited publishing auction in New York. And the couple began planning for life after the White House.\nTheir income skyrocketed. The last year of Clinton\u2019s presidency they reported income of $357,629, which was largely Clinton\u2019s presidential salary. The following year, their combined income was $16.2 million. \nThe Clintons paid $2.85 million for their second home \u2014 a five-bedroom 5,500-square-foot brick Colonial in Washington, D.C. \u2014 so Hillary Clinton could live there when Congress was in session. Property records show they have paid off their mortgage. \nAs New York\u2019s junior senator, Hillary Clinton made $145,100, and her husband became the principal family breadwinner with a new career as a paid speaker. He brought in $1 million in a little over a month. In 2001, his speaking income totaled $9.2 million. \n\n                            Clockwise: The Clinton\u2019s 5,100-square-foot home in Washington, D.C.,  that they bought at the end of 2000; Hillary Clinton speaking at a fundraising dinner for the UNLV Foundation in 2014; and the farmhouse in Chappaqua, N.Y., which was purchased by the Clintons after they left the White House. | Getty\nMeanwhile, Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2003 memoir sold 1 million copies in its first month. \n\u201cWriting the book was not to make money,\u201d insisted one friend. \u201cThey\u2019re both people who are students of history and they felt individually they had a responsibility to write their memoirs, as historical figures. Was money a driver of that conversation? No, it was not. But there\u2019s always been an awareness that they did not have much in the way of any kind of wealth at all.\u201d \nIn her book tour last summer, Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cdead broke\u201d comment drew so much angry reaction that she conceded it was the wrong thing to say. The fact-checking Website PolitiFact.com rated the claim \u201cmostly false,\u201d writing that the Clintons\u2019 \u201cearning potential had a real economic value that the financial sector traditionally acknowledges and is willing to bank on.\u201d \nAs she campaigns for president, Hillary Clinton has changed her tune about her wealth. \u201cIt was accurate,\u201d she has said of the infamous \u2018dead broke\u2019 comment. \u201cBut we are so successful and we\u2019re so blessed by the success we\u2019ve had and my husband has worked incredibly hard.\u201d\nBut she still struggles to sell herself as the candidate of everyday Americans.During the last two weeks of August, she took a break from a family vacation to do a quick campaign swing to rural America, then returned to the rented Hampton vacation property with a private beach and a 50-foot pool.\nRental cost: $100,000. \nIsabelle Taft is an intern for POLITICO Magazine.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "They went from \u2018dead broke\u2019 to millionaires in months.", "title": "Fear of debt drove Clinton's dash for cash", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/hillary-clinton-candidate-wealth-2016-213317", "topics": ["abortion", "personality", "economy", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Sara Solovitch", "Burgess Everett", "Jesse Rifkin", "Henry C.
