{"body": " Next week\u2019s Republican presidential debate in Cleveland marks not only the inaugural formal gathering of the expansive GOP field but the start of a new and unpredictable chapter in an already raucous 2016 race. Under the bright studio lights on the shores of Lake Erie on Aug. 6, ambitions will be showcased, positions staked, and Donald Trump, who has consumed the summer\u2019s political headlines, will finally be confronted, face to face, by his rivals. \u201cThere is more downside than upside for most candidates, and the first goal is to try not to self-destruct,\u201d said former House speaker Newt Gingrich, who ran for the GOP nomination in 2012. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get in a situation where you knock yourself out,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cThe candidates ought to figure out what their message is for the American people rather than worrying too much about the back and forth with others.\u201d But the presence of Trump, who has in recent days attacked former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Texas governor Rick Perry, makes calculations more difficult. Every candidate will have a strategy for making a memorable impression. \u201cEvery candidate has to have a Trump strategy\u201d as well, said an experienced GOP operative.   Former House speaker Newt Gingrich says the first goal of next week\u2019s GOP debate is to try not to self-destruct. And dealing with Trump will be difficult, he warned. \u201cIt\u2019s like dealing with nitroglycerin.\u201d (Whitney Curtis/for Getty Images)  \u201cA multi-candidate debate can be hard,\u201d Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who has for two decades counseled Republican nominees before debates. \u201cSpending time with policy books is part of it, but so is carefully considering what the dynamic is going to be.\u201d Figuring out how to handle Trump is a constant subject among campaign aides, especially with regard to his demeanor. Will he be combative and mostly disregard the rules and moderators, or will he go from being \u201cP.T. Barnum to Reaganesque,\u201d as one campaign adviser wondered. In recent days, Trump has cast the others as the hunters and himself as the hunted, telling reporters last weekend in Iowa, \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, every one of \u2019em is going to come at me. .\u2009.\u2009. For two hours, I\u2019m going to be, like, in the lion\u2019s den, right?\u201d At the same time, Trump sought to lower expectations for his performance. \u201cI\u2019m hearing everyone say I\u2019m going to be good at the debates,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know I\u2019m going to be good. I\u2019ve never done it before. Politicians do it every night.\u201d Trump adviser Chuck Laudner, a longtime Iowa strategist, said the wealthy businessman plans no special prep sessions. \u201cIt\u2019s low key, absolutely low stress,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t 50 consultants locked in a war room, with a fake podium and cardboard cutouts of the other candidates, playing the game of Risk. .\u2009.\u2009. He\u2019s going to get his views across and do so in a way that\u2019s not programmed.\u201d Ed Rollins, who was campaign manager for former president Ronald Reagan in 1984 and later advised Ross Perot\u2019s independent campaign in 1992, met with Trump advisers in early June at the 21 Club in New York as they were seeking advice about how to navigate the GOP contest. Rollins said that, based on his Perot experience, \u201cSomeone like Trump doesn\u2019t want guidance. .\u2009.\u2009. They don\u2019t want to be prepped.\u201d Rollins said the advantage of such candidates is that they are generally fearless and willing to battle. \u201cThe problem,\u201d he added, \u201cis that the message can get lost.\u201d The nine other candidates who will be there see the debate primarily as an opportunity to win favor with what is almost sure to be the largest audience so far of the campaign. With that in mind, they will seek to accentuate the positive, talk about their records and above all avoid mistakes. The main targets of the GOP candidates will be President Obama and Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton. That\u2019s in part because many of those watching on television will have their first opportunity to compare and contrast the candidates and will be assessing who looks most capable of winning a general election contest in November 2016. To make the most of their limited time in the limelight, candidates need both a message and a moment, said Brett O\u2019Donnell, a GOP strategist and the former director of debates at Liberty University who is working with Sen. Lindsey O. Graham of South Carolina. \u201cYou have to make sure your message cuts through,\u201d he said, \u201cbut at the same time you have to make sure you have a moment in the debate where you basically capture the attention of the audience and the press.\u201d That moment could be in a confrontation with Trump, though Gingrich cautioned about the risks of adopting that approach. \u201cHe\u2019s very aggressive by nature and prepared to say virtually anything,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cIt\u2019s like dealing with nitroglycerin.\u201d John Weaver, senior adviser to the campaign of Ohio Gov. John Kasich, offered a different description of what the other candidates could face. In a tweet Tuesday, he wrote, \u201cImagine a NASCAR driver mentally preparing for a race knowing one of the drivers will be drunk. That\u2019s what prepping for this debate is like.\u201d Beyond the presence of Trump, two things are different about this year\u2019s debates. First, the Republican National Committee has sanctioned just nine official debates, chopping by more than half the number of debates in the past two cycles. That means fewer opportunities to shine \u2014 or to recover from a misstep. The second difference is that not all the candidates running for the nomination will be in the first debates. Under the rules set out by Fox News, which is co-sponsoring and will air the Cleveland debate, only the top 10 candidates, based on a collection of national polls, will be invited to participate in the two-hour, prime-time event. CNN has set similar rules for the second debate in September. \u201cOur role is to better control the process, not manage the candidates,\u201d said Sean Spicer, chief strategist at the RNC. \u201cAfter going through those 20 debates in 2012, our goal all along has been to add order, discipline and predictability.\u201d Those on the bubble \u2014 not quite guaranteed a place but not definitely out \u2014 have an extra burden this week. They want to boost their poll numbers before next Tuesday\u2019s cutoff for qualification and are in a mad dash to raise their standing, scheduling as many national interviews as possible and making provocative statements to attract attention. At this point, the top eight candidates, based on the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls, includes Trump, Bush, Walker, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.). Tightly bunched after those eight are Kasich, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Perry. Those at the bottom and in clear danger of not being in the debate are former senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, businesswoman Carly Fiorina, Graham and former New York governor George Pataki. Bush comes to the first debate with the most money by far and by dint of his famous last name certain expectations to meet. He has recruited two of Mitt Romney\u2019s senior advisers, Beth Myers and Peter Flaherty, to help with debate preparations and has held sessions in Kennebunkport, Maine, site of the Bush family compound and more recently in Las Vegas. He will spend much of this week in Miami doing additional preparation. Walker, too, will arrive with expectations high, given his strength in Iowa and his appeal to the party\u2019s conservative base. Last weekend, Trump assaulted Walker\u2019s record in Wisconsin, saying the state is in \u201cterrible shape.\u201d In a preview of what might happen in Cleveland, Walker, in an interview with Fox News on Monday, dismissed Trump\u2019s charges as Democratic \u201ctalking points,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019m going to talk about what I\u2019m for.\u201d Walker talked about his preparations while campaigning Tuesday in Pennsylvania, saying the policy briefings he\u2019s gone through this spring and summer were aimed at preparing him to be ready to serve as president \u2014 and would make him ready for the coming debate. He said the number of people on the stage would not affect his approach. \u201cYou just want to spend your time talking to the voters,\u201d he said. Other candidates are preparing in their own ways. \u201cI\u2019m sleeping on a really thick book,\u201d Paul joked to reporters during a Monday trip to South Carolina. \u201cI tried that in college, but it didn\u2019t work somehow!\u201d For Perry, the debate offers the possibility for redemption after his poor performances in the 2012 campaign. But if he qualifies, he will arrive with double expectations. First, he will need to show that he is better prepared than he was before. Second, because he has been the most aggressive in challenging Trump, he will be under pressure to make those criticisms directly. \u201cA tremendous amount is at stake for him,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cIf he does reasonably well, his candidacy will keep growing. If not, he knows as much as anyone that it\u2019s a long way toward game over.\u201d Kasich has risen in polls of New Hampshire Republicans since his announcement last week but still is at risk of not being on stage in his home state. Weaver said the governor has been doing prep sessions throughout the summer but said the team does not see the Ohio debate as a make-or-break event. \u201cWhile this is an important event, it\u2019s not the most important event of the campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cOur focus is on the early primary and caucus states and how we\u2019re doing on the path to winning the nomination.\u201d Carson, a favorite of grass-roots activists, is \u201cas relaxed as ever,\u201d said Deana Bass, his spokeswoman. \u201cHe\u2019s working with his team and getting rest. His general nature is to be calm and contemplative. That hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d Cruz, a champion debater while an undergraduate at Princeton, is considered by many Republicans as the best in the field, but his camp is keeping his efforts tightly guarded. Advisers declined to discuss his preparation. Said Portman, \u201cThe candidates that do the best are ones who do their homework, who are comfortable with their prep and don\u2019t have their heads full of data and minutiae.\u201d Christie last week told reporters that he is getting ready \u201cin a similar way\u201d to how he prepped for gubernatorial debates: \u201cI\u2019ll get a group of the people I trust who are smart around the table, get them to torture me, and then we\u2019ll see where it lands.\u201d Rubio, who has been running an understated summer campaign with an emphasis on meeting voters and raising money, has avoided wading into divisive controversies that have flared up and from knocking his opponents. Instead, he has drawn in speeches an implicit generational contrast with Jeb Bush and Clinton \u2014 a playbook his allies expect him to follow in Cleveland. Rubio, like his opponents, has also been practicing. When a Washington Post reporter visited his Capitol Hill office last week, Rubio and his advisers weren\u2019t there because they were off doing debate prep. \u201cThe impact on donors is what matters most. If candidates can\u2019t prove themselves, they\u2019ll see their large donors start to migrate to other candidates very quickly,\u201d said Vin Weber, a Bush adviser. \u201cFor the past few months, many of the second-tier candidates have been telling the donors, \u2018Stick with me, watch and wait until I get behind that podium.\u2019\u2009\u201d Fiorina went for substance to draw attention to her candidacy, delivering a foreign policy speech at the Ronald Reagan Library on Monday night. Though she has attracted favorable reviews in both Iowa and New Hampshire, she still lags in national polls. And though Trump has been the biggest attention-getter so far, Huckabee stole the spotlight at the beginning of this week when he charged that Obama, in his quest for a nuclear agreement with Iran, is prepared to march Israel \u201cto the door of the oven.\u201d Huckabee\u2019s debate preparations, conducted in Little Rock and while on the campaign trail, \u201chave been less about the other people on stage than about making sure the governor can articulate his vision,\u201d said J. Hogan Gidley, a Huckabee adviser. \u201cAnd he is not going to come in with canned one-liners. People see through that.\u201d O\u2019Donnell suggested one way to judge the outcome of the first debate: \u201cThe candidate who is able to handle Trump strongly but not make him the center of attention, and walk that line and pivot back on Hillary and President Obama \u2013 that\u2019s going to be the candidate who has a pretty good debate performance,\u201d he said.
