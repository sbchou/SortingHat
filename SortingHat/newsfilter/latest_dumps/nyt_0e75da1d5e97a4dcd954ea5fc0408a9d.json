{"body": "For months, the suspense surrounding Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s plans to make a second attempt at the White House had little to do with whether, and everything to do with why: What would be her rationale for seeking the presidency?\n\nYet with her videotaped announcement that she would run in 2016 to fight for American families so they can \u201cget ahead and stay ahead,\u201d Mrs. Clinton has only begun to answer that central question.\n\n\u201cAmericans have fought their way back from tough economic times, but the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top,\u201d she says in the highly polished production, whose release just after 3 p.m. on Sunday after a drawn-out buildup seemed to stop a nation of tweeting political obsessives in their tracks. \u201cEveryday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.\u201d\n\nWith those words, delivered near the end of a 2-minute, 18-second video, Mrs. Clinton ended two years of public demurrals and private maneuvering and instantly put herself in a strong position to become the Democratic standard-bearer. If successful, she would become the first female nominee from either party, with a serious chance to become the first woman to be elected president.\n\nLong before any ballots are cast, however, she faces enormous pressure to explain, in compelling terms, why she wants the job and is best suited to hold it.\n\n\u201cHer message has to be pretty well baked,\u201d said Russell J. Schriefer, who was a senior adviser to the Republican candidate Mitt Romney in 2012. \u201cOtherwise, it\u2019s like, \u2018What have you been thinking about this whole time?\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s aides say the video, with its focus on voters of all stripes \u2014 not on the candidate \u2014 as they contemplate the future, captures the essence of what her message will be.\n\n\u201cWe had realistic expectations about what you can accomplish in a video,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign\u2019s communications director. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more she needs and intends to talk to the American people about in the coming months.\u201d\n\nShe will begin in Iowa; Mrs. Clinton set out on a two-day road trip there on Sunday afternoon. She will hold conversations with voters there on Tuesday and Wednesday and slowly make a more detailed case for her candidacy and specific policy proposals, ahead of a more formal kickoff of her campaign in May.\n\nMuch of what she is likely to say is motivating her is well known.\n\nWhile her husband promised in 1991 to restore the American dream to \u201cthe forgotten middle class,\u201d Mrs. Clinton is expected to offer herself as best equipped to reverse the sense among many voters that the middle class is already out of reach.\n\nIndeed, her campaign will shy away from the characterization \u201cmiddle class\u201d \u2014 because, her advisers say, the term no longer connotes a stable life \u2014 and instead use the term \u201ceveryday Americans.\u201d\n\nFor months, Mrs. Clinton has lamented the stagnant wages holding back lower-income people and the concentration of wealth among a sliver of the wealthiest, a sentiment echoed in her first public remarks as a 2016 candidate.\n\nIn the video, she allows a series of people \u2014 nonactors, her campaign said \u2014 to stand for those ideas: A black couple looks ahead to the birth of a child, Latino brothers beam with excitement about starting a business, two men hold hands anticipating their wedding, a young Asian-American woman looks ahead to her first job and a white woman who says she will retire soon talks about \u201creinventing\u201d herself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting ready to do something, too,\u201d Mrs. Clinton says. \u201cI\u2019m running for president.\u201d\n\nEvery White House aspirant eventually has to face the question that famously reduced Edward M. Kennedy to incoherence when the CBS News correspondent Roger Mudd asked it just before his run for president in the 1980 election: \u201cWhy do you want to be president?\u201d An honest reply, no matter the candidate, would most likely entail healthy doses of ambition and ego, along with a concern for the fate of the nation or for the greater good.\n\nYet Mrs. Clinton faces an especially high threshold, Democrats say, to deliver a persuasive \u2014 and, to some degree at least, selfless \u2014 rationale.\n\nAs the first lady in 2000, she drew enormous attention to her first campaign for the United States Senate. But her lack of a clear-cut message early on fueled accusations of carpetbagging and a sense among voters that Mrs. Clinton felt free to coast from the White House to a seat representing New York. She overcame that with a barnstorming blitz of close-up conversations that impressed voters across the state, and won by 12 percentage points.\n\nDespite that experience, however, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s entry into the Democratic primary field in January 2007 showed that she still faced difficulty in reconciling her outsize public image with the need to dispel any air of entitlement.\n\nWhile Barack Obama offered a crisp promise to end the \u201csmallness of our politics,\u201d and John Edwards spoke of healing the divide between the \u201ctwo Americas,\u201d Mrs. Clinton issued a statement\u00a0 to her supporters: \u201cI\u2019m in. And I\u2019m in to win.\u201d The declaration rang hollow and uninspiring to some Democrats, and a videotaped message of her sitting on a couch and saying, \u201cLet the conversation begin,\u201d is still being parodied. Iowa caucusgoers rewarded her with a third-place showing.\n\nBy the time Mr. Obama had edged ahead in the delegate tally, Mrs. Clinton was showing a less scripted, more vulnerable side. Connecting with women and with white working-class voters over kitchen-table issues, she won 17.5 million votes, about as many as Mr. Obama, and victories in Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers insist that she has learned from that race, and her announcement on Sunday sought to shift the focus away from her personal journey. \u201cI\u2019m hitting the road to earn your vote,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s your time.\u201d\n\nEven as her supporters and outside \u201csuper PACs\u201d seek to raise money for what could be the costliest campaign in history, her advisers say she intends to run as if she were an underdog. Shunning mass rallies for small-scale events, Mrs. Clinton will hold round tables with educators and students in Monticello, Iowa, on Tuesday and small-business owners in Norwalk, Iowa, on Wednesday, settings that make it possible to connect with voters individually.\n\nMrs. Clinton enters the campaign with no apparent formidable competition for a wide-open Democratic nomination, and her video, notably, makes no mention of party labels.\n\nShe starts with a strong base of support: 59 percent of Democratic voters said there was a \u201cgood chance\u201d they would vote for Mrs. Clinton, compared with 52 percent who said the same in 2007, according to a Pew Research Center poll conducted March 25-29. But a weakly stated rationale in the coming weeks could encourage others to consider a run, or invite a backlash among Democrats who are already wary of putting all their chips on one bet.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s reference to the \u201cstacked deck\u201d confronting most Americans could mollify those in the party\u2019s left wing who have pined for potential alternatives like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has led a fiery, populist attack on Wall Street opulence and big banks.\n\nYounger voters may need to be enticed to take a fresh look at Mrs. Clinton, a quintessential baby boomer whose starring role in the drama of the Bill Clinton years came nearly a quarter-century ago. And reports about her exclusive use of a private email address while secretary of state have already harmed her standing with independents and played into Republican suggestions that the name Clinton is synonymous with secrecy, sophistry and scandal.\n\nFifty-three percent of Americans and 60 percent of independents said they believed that Mrs. Clinton had not been truthful in saying she handed over all emails relevant to her time as secretary of state, according to a Bloomberg Politics poll conducted April 6-8.\n\nRobert Shrum, a strategist for Democratic presidential candidates including Mr. Kennedy, Al Gore and John Kerry, said an effective opening argument in the coming days could sharply improve perceptions of Mrs. Clinton. \u201cIf she can show the country, manifesting what kind of leader she would be, manifesting what she cares about, having a sense of vision for the future, the email story becomes pretty small,\u201d he said.\n\nThat she needs to expand on her rationale in a powerful way, and soon, is likely to come as no surprise to Mrs. Clinton, a perfectionist who knows that anything less would be an unforced error and the squandering of a precious second chance to introduce herself as a candidate.\n\nMr. Shrum said a successful reintroduction could do wonders for the public\u2019s impression of Mrs. Clinton \u2014 much as it did when Ronald Reagan, seen as an aging actor in his failed primary run in 1976, began his campaign in 1980 by demonstrating his vigor and talking about his work as a soldier, sportscaster and union leader. \u201cHe turned his negatives into positives,\u201d Mr. Shrum said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite different from sitting on the couch,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be, \u2018I look forward to having a conversation.\u2019 It has to be, \u2018This is where America needs to go.\u2019 She can rewrite the script.
