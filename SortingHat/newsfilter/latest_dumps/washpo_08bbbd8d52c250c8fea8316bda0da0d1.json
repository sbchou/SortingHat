{"body": "   Amy Schumer (Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP, File)  Amy Schumer and Jeb Bush aren\u2019t people you\u2019d normally put in the same sentence, but thanks to Stephen Colbert, we\u2019re doing just that. Here is the story. See, Colbert and Bush have been messing with each other this week ahead of Colbert\u2019s debut as the new host of the CBS \u201cLate Show\u201d on Tuesday. In fact, Bush is going to be one of the show\u2019s first guests (the other is George Clooney), as Colbert announced on Aug. 11:   .@JebBush will be on #LSSC Sept. 8! My first GOP candidate! Luckily I do 200 shows a year, so I think I can fit them all. \u2014 Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) August 11, 2015  The guest spot is a nice get for Bush. Plenty of people will be watching, and as we know, Bush is trying to stay relevant in his bid for the Republican presidential nomination. The Bush team was apparently so excited that it used the event to launch a fundraising drive. The contest involves donating to Bush\u2019s campaign for a chance to win a VIP ticket to the taping:   On Sept 8th I\u2019ll sit down w/Stephen Colbert for his first taping of the Late Show. Enter to win a VIP ticket to join: http://t.co/OvCqPsqk4D \u2014 Jeb Bush (@JebBush) August 24, 2015  Pretty straightforward, right? Wrong. Colbert responded to the contest and seemed a little miffed. \u201cNo one from Jeb\u2019s campaign asked me if this was OK with me to raise money off my first show,\u201d he said in a video-slash-comedy-routine posted Wednesday on YouTube. \u201cWhere is my cut of that sweet three bucks, governor?\u201d The real purpose of Colbert\u2019s video was to announce his own contest. Here\u2019s how it works: fans can donate $3 to a veterans charity for the chance to give Colbert a non-obscene question to ask Bush on the show. Oh, and the winner also gets two VIP tickets to the taping:   Enter this raffle and I might ask @JebBush your question on #LSSC! Have your voice heard, in the form of my voice. http://t.co/EtSg9N9H3j \u2014 Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) September 2, 2015  Colbert made several jokes at Bush\u2019s expense during the video. In one instance, he made fun of the clumsy way Bush\u2019s contest talked about the \u201cnew host\u201d of the \u201cLate Show.\u201d (That would be Colbert.) \u201cGosh, I hope it\u2019s Amy Schumer,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cShe is hilarious.\u201d This is where the tweeting really heats up. A couple of hours later, Bush responded to Colbert with a video on Twitter. He said he\u2019s excited for the show, and made a joke that suggested he\u2019s a Schumer fan (unlikely and strange as that is):   .@StephenAtHome I\u2019m in. See you September 8th my man https://t.co/INl40CfrQ4 \u2014 Jeb Bush (@JebBush) September 3, 2015  This is where the real Amy Schumer comes in (finally). In a turn for the absurd, she recorded a video message to Bush while pretending to be Colbert, and it was posted on Colbert\u2019s account:   .@JebBush I'm inner! See you Tuesday, my Jebroh! http://t.co/fJkcqonJmt https://t.co/uFZh9dDcNh \u2014 Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) September 3, 2015  And that brings us to the finale, when a self-declared conservative Republican presidential candidate tweeted at Amy Schumer:   I see what you did there, @amyschumer https://t.co/opfKqdPpK2 \u2014 Jeb Bush (@JebBush) September 3, 2015  The end.
