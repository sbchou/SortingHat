If she did, I think there is going to be a high, high likelihood of additional scrutiny, either from Capitol Hill or from the Department of Justice itself.\u201d\n\nBurns likened the known fact setting in the Clinton controversies to that which led to the federal indictment, earlier this month, of Sen. Robert Menendez, D-NJ, who stands accused of performing favors for a well-connected Democratic donor in exchange for pricey gifts. Menendez has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cIf the facts suggest that there was a linkage between what Secretary Clinton did in her official capacity and the money that was coming into the Clinton Foundation,\u201d Burns said, \u201cthis would fall under 18 U.S.C. 201 as a potential bribery violation.\u201d\n\nThat statute provides that a bribe has occurred, among other circumstances, whenever \u201ca public official directly or indirectly demands, seeks, receives, accepts, or agrees to receive or accept anything of value personally for or because of any official act performed or to be performed by such official.\u201d\n\nC. Boyden Gray, who served as White House counsel to President George H.W. Bush, told Fox News the money that linked the uranium deal to the Clintons and their foundation \u201cis very hard to dissect from the personal,\u201d and creates, at a minimum, the appearance of a conflict of interest, particularly \u201cwhen one of them is in office and money is coming in, in connection with issues over which that person in office has jurisdiction and responsibility.\u201d\n\nGray added that Clinton is \u201cnot protected by the fact that her husband may have taken money \u2026 spouses\u2019 interests are attributed to each other and that is no excuse or defense.\u201d\n\nIn the tangle of cases brought to light by the book \u201cClinton Cash,\u201d no one associated with the Clinton Foundation has been formally accused of wrongdoing. Lanny Davis, a former special counsel to President Clinton, told Fox News there is no evidence tying Hillary Clinton to the State Department\u2019s approval of the uranium deal, and argued her critics are seeking to tarnish her 2016 presidential campaign on the basis of \u201cinferences.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people on that process -- on that board -- nine agencies approved the [uranium] deal, and the individual from State said he never heard from Mrs. Clinton,\u201d Davis told Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d Friday. \u201cThere's no evidence that President Clinton, that I've seen yet, tried to influence any decision by any governmental agency.\u201d\n\nThe Clintons, at any rate, are veterans of this terrain. In addition to her husband becoming the first president to be impeached \u2013 and ultimately acquitted \u2013 in over a century, in 1996 Hillary Clinton became the First Lady to testify before a grand jury.\n\n\u00a0James Rosen joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in 1999.
