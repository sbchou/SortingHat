With 17 or 18 Republicans gearing up to run, you simply can\u2019t have a viable debate with all of them. Each candidate would receive a miniscule amount of time. No sustained questioning would be possible. And it would be bad television. \nEven 10 people on a stage is going to be a challenge. Most viewers will want to know what the top three or four combatants are going to say, not folks who don\u2019t have a prayer of making it to the White House. \nSure, limiting the debate participants to 10 is arbitrary, but someone had to draw a line. Still, long-shot candidates of the past have used a series of strong debate performances to catch fire. And that won\u2019t be possible now. It\u2019s a decision that will help winnow the field. \nAs things stand now, Carly Fiorina, the only woman in the GOP field, wouldn\u2019t make the cut. And the optics of that aren\u2019t great. But nor can any network be carving out special exceptions. \nAnd by the way, Lindsey Graham and Bobby Jindal, among others, would also be excluded. If you don\u2019t get to sit (stand?) at the big boy table, your media attention and fundraising potential can really dry up. \nFox says it will offer additional airtime to the excluded candidates after the Aug. 6 debate. CNN, which hosts a debate at the Reagan Library in September, is splitting it into two parts: One for the top 10 candidates (which the media will treat as the \u201creal\u201d event) and another for the rest who are polling above 1 percent. \nRick Santorum, a former Fox News contributor who right now is 10th in national polling, is unhappy. He told National Journal that in January 2012 he was close to last in the polls, yet won the Iowa caucuses. \u201cIf you\u2019re a United States senator, if you\u2019re a governor, if you\u2019re a woman who ran a Fortune 500 company, and you\u2019re running a legitimate campaign for president, then you should have a right to be on stage with everybody else,\u201d Santorum said. \nBut there is no \u201cright.\u201d News organizations invest plenty of money in these extravaganzas and are entitled to make journalistic judgments. \nThe media play a winnowing role in every presidential campaign. Lagging candidates simply don\u2019t get much ink and air time, which can put them in a negative spiral. No news organization has an endless budget to assign reporters to trail 17 candidates, and even if they did, how many clips can make a half-hour evening newscast? \nSetting debate rules is a more dramatic version of that process. You\u2019re either on the stage or you\u2019re not. \nRight now the media are treating Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker as the top-tier contenders, with Rand Paul and Ted Cruz right behind them. That can change as polls fluctuate. \nBut now there is a deadline for trailing candidates to perhaps use extra spending and other methods to boost their visibility, hoping to boost their poll standing enough to make the cutoff. \nThe threshold is starting to seep into the coverage. In a laudatory piece yesterday on how Carly is generating excitement in Iowa, the New York Times said: \u201cRepublicans here are starting to swoon over Ms. Fiorina, who is so unknown in national polls that she may not even be included in the first presidential debate in August.\u201d \nAnd Politico says the polling standard penalizes those who do the spade work in the early states while \u201ccandidates with higher name ID have the advantage \u2014 even if it was built by working the network green rooms rather than the grass roots. \u2018It\u2019s the Trump problem,\u2019 said Florida GOP strategist Rick Wilson. \u2018He\u2019s an entirely unserious candidate but one with very serious name ID.\u2019\u201d \nAs the polls stand now, Ben Carson, Chris Christie, Mike Huckabee, Rick Perry and Santorum would round out the Fox debate field, according to 538. Yet the website refuses to include Donald Trump (on the theory he\u2019ll probably re-sign with \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d I suppose.) But polls always fluctuate. \nEven CNN\u2019s two-debate compromise will provide little lift to the second tier, I suspect. There\u2019s only going to be one front-page story in the next day\u2019s papers, and the secondary faceoff will likely to limited to the equivalent of agate type. And how many viewers will sit through two debates? \nSo well before anyone makes it to Iowa, the Republican candidates will have to clear the bar for Fox\u2019s Cleveland primary. \nClick for more from Media BuzzHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).
