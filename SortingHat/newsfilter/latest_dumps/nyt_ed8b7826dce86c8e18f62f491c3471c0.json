{"body": "KEENE, N.H. \u2014 One day last month, in the middle of a furniture factory here, Hillary Rodham Clinton finished prepared remarks about her presidential candidacy and opened the floor for discussion.\n\nA middle-aged worker, Pamela Livengood, began to speak, tentatively at first, about the drug addiction that has tormented her daughter and left her granddaughter in her care.\n\n\u201cThis little 5-year-old lives with me, and I\u2019m guardian \u2014 Grandpa and I have guardianship because of all the growing drug problems in our area,\u201d Ms. Livengood said.\n\nMrs. Clinton gave her a sympathetic, knowing nod.\n\n\u201cPam, what you just told me and what I\u2019m hearing from a lot of different people, there is a hidden epidemic\u201d of heroin, methamphetamine and prescription pills that is \u201cstriking in small towns and rural areas,\u201d she said, taking out an index card and scribbling notes.\n\nMrs. Clinton lacks some of the extraordinary gifts for connection and empathy that her husband possesses, and the round-table events that have characterized her early campaign can feel stage-managed. But even these settings are producing revealing moments, as Mrs. Clinton finds herself far from the world of international diplomacy and scrambling to re-educate herself about the nation she hopes to lead.\n\nA lot has changed since Mrs. Clinton left domestic politics to become the secretary of state: Student debt has ballooned, access to credit has tightened, and the cause of income inequality has taken on a forceful momentum.\n\nEver an eager student, she has immersed herself in dense briefing papers and academic tomes and consulted more than 200 experts as she thought about her economic policy. But now, as the campaign faces pressure to reveal specific policy proposals, Mrs. Clinton has 35 million more advisers \u2014 also known as the Democratic primary electorate.\n\nThere is not a lot of I-feel-your-pain hugging at these events and few uproarious moments. But Mrs. Clinton brings a wonkish intensity, arriving at each round table armed with specific data points. She said: \u201cThe average four-year graduate in Iowa graduates with nearly $30,000 in debt,\u201d and \u201cIn New Hampshire, 96 percent of all businesses are considered small businesses.\u201d She nods, jots down notes and interjects conversations with words of encouragement. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s a very good point.\u201d\n\nAnd she relays what she is hearing back to her campaign\u2019s policy shop in Brooklyn; the problem of drug addiction, especially in small towns, has now become a prominent theme for her on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cShe came back from both places and said, \u2018I want you guys to go beyond standard policies and really take a hard look at some of the more creative or forward-looking policy positions,\u2019 \u201d said Jake Sullivan, the campaign\u2019s senior policy director. \u201cSo we\u2019re in the process of working on those at the moment.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, part of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s reassuring voters that she is learning has to do with an acute awareness by her campaign that she must combat the opinion of some voters in 2008 that she seemed aloof and entitled. \u201cThe goal,\u201d said Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, is to \u201ctake advantage of the long campaign season, start small\u201d and \u201cnot just shake hands but get under the hood.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton is clearly most comfortable devising and thinking about policy and it has given her a way to interact with voters.\n\nAfter she stopped at a coffee shop on her first trip to Iowa as a candidate, the people she met bemoaned all the red tape faced by entrepreneurs. From her van on the way to the next stop, Mrs. Clinton called policy advisers to talk through some of the issues she had heard on the ground. Small-business growth is now central to her campaign.\n\nOn Friday, she held the second stop of her small-business push, telling voters at a family-owned brewery in Hampton, N.H., how she hopes to be \u201cthe president for small business.\u201d\n\nShe takes frequent opportunities to remind voters that she is, indeed, listening and, yes, she is learning. \u201cI want to hear from people of New Hampshire,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at a small gathering of supporters last month.\n\nAll these conversations could potentially muddy the policy-making process back in Brooklyn. In the last month, Mrs. Clinton has told her team to zero in on mental health, too, after a mother in Council Bluffs, Iowa, told her that coverage under the Affordable Care Act did not do enough to support her son, who has Asperger\u2019s syndrome.\n\nShe told her campaign team to start using a new expression for education, \u201copportunity system,\u201d after Dr. Mick Starcevich, the president of Kirkwood Community College in Monticello, Iowa, used the term and Mrs. Clinton jotted it down on a notepad.\n\nBryce Smith, a 23-year-old owner of a bowling alley near Des Moines, told Mrs. Clinton that his biggest challenge in starting a business was his $40,000 in student loans affecting his access to credit. \u201cI went for education in college so I could teach, but I fell in love with bowling,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cSo that\u2019s my biggest thing, is the barrier of entry and financing.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton lit up. \u201cWe all know about the student loan debt, but I\u2019ve never heard anyone so persuasively link it to the slowdown in business start-ups,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve given me an insight that nobody else has and I\u2019m grateful to you,\u201d she told Mr. Smith.\n\nMrs. Clinton told her campaign team that the separate advisers working on college affordability and small-business policies needed to more closely coordinate, thanks to Mr. Smith, now a minor celebrity who is seeking elected office in Iowa. Mrs. Clinton sent Mr. Smith and other round-table participants handwritten notes thanking them for their insight.\n\nMr. Sullivan, the senior policy adviser, is not just waiting to hear from Mrs. Clinton, though. In recent weeks, he has traveled to places like Dallas, Houston, Atlanta and Minneapolis, where a campaign infrastructure does not yet exist, to talk to people about policies and report back to Mrs. Clinton.\n\nThe campaign will hold its official kickoff rally on June 13. After that, it will be hard for Mrs. Clinton to keep listening and learning without talking about specific policy proposals. If those specifics do not come soon, her political opponents will more than likely seize on her vagueness.\n\n\u201cThe asset she has at this point is that everything she says get picked up and people hear it,\u201d said David Winston, a Republican strategist. \u201cThe problem is she has gotten to this point and what is she saying?\u201d he continued. \u201cWhat are the policy directions? It was a fuzzy, soft reintroduction to the general public who already believes they know who she is.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Mrs. Clinton will hold a round-table talk with voters in South Carolina on Wednesday, the next stop on her learning tour.", "byline": "AMY CHOZICK", "description": "Hillary Rodham Clinton lacks some of the political gifts of her husband, and her campaign events can feel staged.
