Univision said it would not be working on any other projects tied to the Trump Organization.\nColombian reggaeton singer J Balvin was expected to perform at the Miss USA pageant, but on Wednesday he pulled out of the show because of Trumps comments. It was going to be his first national mainstream performance, Balvin told Billboard.\n\"But we're talking about our roots, our culture, our values,\" he added. \"This isn't about being punitive, but about showing leadership through social responsibility. His comments weren't just about Mexicans, but about all Latins in general.\"\nThe Miss USA pageant is slated to air on July 12.\n", "title": "Univision Will Not Air The Miss USA Pageant Because Of Ties To Donald Trump", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/adolfoflores/univision-will-not-air-the-miss-usa-pageant-because-of-ties", "topics": ["mexico"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Charlie Neibergall"], "orgs": ["Univision", "Trump Organization"], "authors": [{"author_id": 10174, "fullname": "adolfo flores", "primary_org": "buzzfeed"}], "date_written": "2015-06-25 18:44:52", "org": "buzzfeed", "article_id": "33fac0b17789b831336636b2273dbb05", "date_access": "2015-06-25 18:41:01.936536"}
