We have Iran having their sanctions lifted, having a number of these other issues with respect to their activities not addressed and having the rest of the region receiving a signal that we, the United States, are accepting the eventuality that they will acquire a nuclear weapon,\u201d Webb said Wednesday on \u201cThe Diane Rehm Show\u201d on NPR.\nStory Continued Below\nThe former Virginia senator and Navy secretary\u2019s remarks are in contrast with those of Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley and Lincoln Chafee, the former Rhode Island senator and governor, all of whom praised the agreement to varying degrees on Tuesday.\n\u201cSo, however you get through the checks and the measures as the agreement moves forward \u2026 that\u2019s where we end up after 10 years, even if everything works,\u201d Webb told Rehm. \u201cThe bottom line is: Even if it all works, is this where we want to be in that region as a country with Iran having been so empowered in recent years,\u201d he said, noting that he has been a proponent of improving relations with Iran and removing sanctions in a measured way that keeps regional balances in check.\n\u201cWe should, with respect to the situation with Iran right now, we do not want to be signaling in the region right now that we have accepted that Iran would have a larger role in this balance than would be good for the region,\u201d Webb said.\nBy MOHAMAD BAZZI\nBy ELIZABETH DICKINSON\nBy DANIELLE PLETKA\nBy ALEXANDER COHEN\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "He says the United States is accepting \"eventuality that they will acquire a nuclear weapon\"", "title": "Webb breaks from 2016 Dems in dinging Iran deal", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/jim-webb-criticize-iran-deal-120145.html", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Diane Rehm", "Martin O'Malley", "Hillary Clinton", "Jim Webb", "Bernie Sanders", "Lincoln Chafee"], "orgs": ["Navy"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30728, "fullname": "nick gass", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-07-15 16:58:44", "org": "politico", "article_id": "2ac7fd41ae6adc1685d184f058d08f17", "date_access": "2015-07-15 16:30:06.949202"}
