{"body": "Rep.  Paul Ryan \u201ccould save the House majority from self-destruction,\u201d writes the Journal editorial board. \u201cThe Wisconsin Republican says he prefers to remain at the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, but he won\u2019t return as Chairman if Republicans lose the House. The contagion that took out Mr. McCarthy will continue to spread, and don\u2019t be surprised if Mr. Ryan concludes he must make his own personal sacrifice to stop it.\u201d\nPeggy Noonan writes that the virtue of Donald Trump\u2019s tax plan \u201cis that I can understand it. A friend said, \u2018It\u2019s a total rip-off of Jeb\u2019s plan!\u2019 It probably is. But Trump explained Trump\u2019s plan, so people paid attention, and Jeb explained Jeb\u2019s, so they didn\u2019t. Mr. Trump\u2019s economic policies seem to come from indignation\u2014the poor need a break, the rich have a racket. Jeb\u2019s seem to come from a desire for good government. In the current climate indignation beats good government every time.\u201d\nMs. Noonan adds that \u201copposition research doesn\u2019t really work on Mr. Trump, mostly because no one has illusions of probity about him. His supporters don\u2019t think he\u2019s a sweet, sinless businessman. They love it that he\u2019s not.\u201d\n\u201cAccording to the National Institute of Mental Health, those with mental illness in treatment are 15 times less likely to engage in an act of violence than those who go untreated,\u201d writes Rep. Tim Murphy, a psychologist who led a congressional investigation of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. \u201cWhat we found was shocking and disgraceful: a wasteful federal bureaucracy that is anti-patient, anti-family and anti-medical care.\u201d\nClick here to receive Opinion headlines and James Freeman\u2019s commentary via email.\nMr. Murphy notes that in 1955 \u201cthere were 558,000 inpatient psychiatric beds in the U.S. Today there are fewer than 45,000. The severe shortage is due to the decades-long deinstitutionalization that began in the civil-rights era.\u201d\nKimberley Strassel writes that Rep. Kevin McCarthy\u2019s comments last week suggesting that the House Benghazi committee had been designed to attack Hillary Clinton \u201care dead wrong.\u201d Chairman Trey Gowdy\u2019s investigation has been \u201ca model of seriousness, professionalism and discreetness,\u201d adds our columnist. \u201cMr. Gowdy handpicked a staff of 16 professionals, many recruited from law-enforcement and legal backgrounds, headed up by retired Lt. Gen. Dana Chipman, who was an Obama-appointed Army judge advocate general. Mr. Gowdy told every hire on day one that leaking was a firing offense.\u201d\nMs. Strassel notes an interesting result: \u201cFormer Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills\u2019s private interview concluded with the remarkable sight of her, Mr. Gowdy and ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings together at a post-interview press availability, where she thanked the committee for its \u2018professionalism\u2019 and \u2018respect.\u2019\u201d\n", "byline": "", "description": "A Wisconsin lawmaker can save the GOP\u2019s majority, plus Peggy Noonan says Trump is immune to opposition research and Kim Strassel says McCarthy was \u201cdead wrong\u201d about the Benghazi committee.", "title": "Ryan Time", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/ryan-time-1444387167", "topics": ["economy", "immigration"], "people": ["Trey Gowdy", "Cheryl Mills", "Tim Murphy", "Kevin Mccarthy", "Kimberley Strassel", "Hillary Clinton", "Donald Trump", "Paul Ryan", "James Freeman", "Kim Strassel", "Peggy Noonan"], "orgs": ["Journal", "GOP"], "authors": [{"author_id": 3011, "fullname": "james freeman", "primary_org": "wsj"}], "date_written": "2015-10-09 13:52:36", "org": "wsj", "article_id": "a64b4986b3abf605557894c3b62dc125", "date_access": "2015-10-09 18:00:20.620189"}
