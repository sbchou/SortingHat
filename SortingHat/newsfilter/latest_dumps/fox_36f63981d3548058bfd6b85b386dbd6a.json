Unable to break the Democratic logjam, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that he would instead offer a standalone bill to block Obama\u2019s amnesty gambit before resuming the funding fight. Appearing on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said he would vote to \u201cprevent the president from his executive action\u201d and suggested that there might be the five other Democrats necessary to advance the legislation.\n\n\u201cWell, this bill removes those excuses. It sets up a simple political equation: Either stand in defense of extreme overreach, or stand with constituents in support of shared democratic values.\u201d \u2013Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell in a floor speech today.\n\nTick-tock - While Obama would almost certainly veto the bill, significant Democratic objections to his policies combined with the federal court ruling against the administration on the actions could start to shift the debate. The president will prove today that he doesn\u2019t mind vetoing popular, bipartisan legislation as he spikes the bill approving an oil pipeline from Canada, but if there is a Democratic rebellion it is harder to argue that he is doing the will of the people. Plus, getting Democrats on the record as protecting the amnesty is always helpful to the GOP. But big questions remain. Can the House and Senate cough up an emergency, stopgap spending plan to keep the agency running while the debate plays out? The deadline is Friday and time is running out quickly.\n\n\u201cThe American people are demanding more than that and seeing through these antics which are designed to protect the president in his lawlessness in defiance of a constitutional system.\u201d \u2013Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, on \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d Watch here.\n\nIN SLAP TO UNIONS, OBAMA TO CAN BIPARTISAN KEYSTONE BILL\nFox News: \u201cThe Senate will send the Keystone XL pipeline bill to President Obama on Tuesday, senior congressional sources tell Fox News. \u2026 The House passed a final version of the bill about two weeks ago, but the sources told Fox New that leaders of the Republican-controlled Congress intentionally waited to send it to the White House. They purportedly wanted Congress, which last week was on break, to be in session if and when the president vetoes the bill so they can draw more attention to the issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe White House\u2019s recommendation of a veto has nothing to do with the aforementioned merits of the project. Instead, the administration claims the bill will \u2018cut short\u2019 the process for approving the project. We disagree. If anything, the process has been needlessly drawn out: more than\u00a02,300 days have passed\u00a0since the Keystone application was first filed. This level of delay is extreme, even for Washington. In fact, approving these types of pipelines was once routine.\u201d \u2013Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. in a USA Today op-ed.\n\nHangover for Hillary \u2013 What does Hillary Clinton think about the pipeline project?\u00a0 She was seemingly for it before she went silent. In 2012, as her boss buoyed the green base with a further delay, one pipeline opponent observed: \u201cShe doubtless figures four years is a long time, and \u2013 even though it\u2019s the one environmental issue in decades that\u2019s brought big crowds of environmentalists into the streets \u2013 that voters will forget her stance on the pipeline.\u201d\u00a0But those years have come and gone and the issue is still alive, thanks to the president\u2019s obduracy. Given the support the Clinton Foundation has reportedly received from Keystone proponents, greenies will demand answers from the presumptive Democratic nominee.\n\nThat was then - \u201cWe\u2019ve not yet signed off on it. But we are inclined to do so\u2026\u201d \u2013Hillary Clinton in a 2010 speech.\n\nThis is now - \u201cWe have differences and you won't get me to talk about Keystone because I have steadily made clear that I'm not going to express an opinion. It is in our process and that\u2019s where it belongs.\u201d \u2013Hillary Clinton to an audience in Canada on January, 21 2015.\n\nHILLARY RE-EMERGES FOR EVENT WITH CORPORATE BACKERS\nAfter not appearing before an American audience in more than two months and with questions swirling about foreign donations to her family foundation, presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is back on the speaking circuit today. She\u2019s on stage for a Silicon Valley gig touting the gender equality policies of some of her most influential corporate patrons. McClatchy: \u201cClinton will serve as the keynote speaker [today] at a conference sponsored by a series of major companies that have donated to her political campaigns or her family\u2019s foundation, helped pay her hefty speaking fees at other events and lobbied her when she served as secretary of state. Some of their employees have been involved in her campaigns or initiatives at the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Many have multiple ties to the Clintons.\n\n\u201cCisco, a California networking-equipment company, donated thousands of dollars to Clinton through its political action committee, and its general counsel served as a bundler and a policy adviser for her 2008 presidential campaign. Ericsson, a Swedish communications company, donated between $50,000 and $100,000 to the foundation, and its president participated in a group discussion at the related Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting last year. Morgan Stanley, a New York investment firm that\u2019s Clinton\u2019s sixth largest donor, spent at least $14 million lobbying the federal government, including the State Department, during her term on issues related to China, India and currency-exchange oversight, according to public records.\u201d\n\n[WaPo: \u201cFor Clinton, the Bay Area represents perhaps her biggest opportunity to expand her fundraising base from 2008, when she raised $6.2\u00a0million from the affluent counties of San Francisco, Santa Clara and San Mateo, according to campaign finance data compiled by the\u00a0Center for Responsive Politics. Obama brought in $9.8\u00a0million from donors in those counties during the same time period.\u201d]\n\nCampaign motif will be gender war \u2013 National Journal: \u201cAlready, recent words and actions hint at the ways [Hillary Clinton will] bring gender into the 2016 campaign\u2014by talking about issues like pay equity, affordable child care, and paid family leave, referencing her past work for women and children, and gushing about her new granddaughter. That soft approach will be coupled with a sharp-edged assault by supporting organizations outside of her camp. Some of them, including the abortion-rights group EMILY's List and the Democratic National Committee, have begun playing offense against the Republican field, painting many of the 2016 GOP hopefuls as anti-woman.\u201d\n\nBAIER TRACKS: \u00a0\u2018GETTING TO YES\u2019 ON IRAN NUKES\u2026\n\u201cAs more and more details are starting to leak out about a possible U.S.-Iran nuclear deal, an increasing number of U.S. allies appear to be getting very nervous. Israelis, for obvious reasons, are the most concerned. So much so that the conventional wisdom that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would see serious political backlash for speaking to the U.S. Congress about Iran without a White House blessing is being turned around completely. Some Israeli pundits and commentators even called for Netanyahu\u2019s opponent in the upcoming election, Isaac Herzog, to stand alongside the prime minster when he addresses Congress. Herzog declined, but the conversation itself is a sign of the shifting Israeli politics on the issue.\n\nThe structure of the deal is being dramatically reframed by the Obama administration. As Bloomberg reports, gone is the idea of a grand bargain that would empower moderates and lead to lasting change in Iran\u2019s leadership. This now appears to be just a temporary arms deal that could leave Iran at the brink of having nuclear weapon. That prospect looks different, though, after reading this piece from the Weekly Standard that lays out details of the funding of Al Qaeda operations.\u00a0It is no wonder that Israel and Gulf State nations are worried. In a remarkable switch, these allies seem to be hoping for the ayatollah in Tehran to have a change of heart and turn the deal down. Because at this point, it seems the Obama administration is trying extremely hard to \u2013 in the president\u2019s words \u2013 \u2018get to yes.\u2019\u201d \u00a0- Bret Baier.\n\nWITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\nThe Atlantic examines the phenomenon of how the body registers effects of capsaicin, the active chemical in chilies that causes the burning sensation through a pain receptor, TRPV1. Receptors are found throughout the body, researcher John Hayes, said, and \u201cThis is why when you chop chilies, and then rub your eyes, or use the bathroom, without washing your hands, you are in for a world of hurt.\u201d Though it feels like a burn, there isn\u2019t an actual burn occurring, but rather a chemical evolution, \u201cThe chili pepper evolved a chemical that fits into that molecular receptor [TRPV1] and lowers the activation energy from 43 [degrees] Celsius to about 34 [degrees] Celsius,\u201d he said. Hayes and fellow researcher Nadia Byrnes, both agree that it is possible to increase tolerance through repeated exposures, particularly at young ages. \u201cBasically, if you don\u2019t like something, the more you eat of it, the more you\u2019ll like it,\u201d Byrnes said.\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Our commitment is going forward, we\u2019re going to talk about the things that matter to everyday Americans, and we\u2019ll leave the nonsense to the media aside.\u2019\u201d\n\nMeans money - The Hill: \u201cWalker\u2019s campaign sent an email requesting donations Sunday night. The email from Friends of Scott Walker, which runs his reelection campaign, said the governor \"refuses to be distracted by the small, petty, and pale ideas that the \u2018gotcha\u2019 headline writers for the Liberal Media want to talk about.\u201d\n\nEARLY TEXAS PRIMARY SHAKING UP GOP RACE\nAP: \u201cTexas doesn\u2019t open the voting in presidential campaigns like Iowa and New Hampshire do, but the 2016 Republican race already feels well underway in America's largest conservative state. Much earlier than usual, potential candidates, operatives and donors are maneuvering for advantage here. The urgency comes from Texas' moving its election from the end of the primary calendar toward the beginning. Which, for Republicans, changes everything. Already, would-be presidential hopeful and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul has recruited the state's Republican Party chairman to handle communication strategies.\n\n\u201cFormer Gov. Rick Perry is enlisting powerful Texas donors to prove he\u2019s serious about 2016, notwithstanding his flame-out three years ago. New Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush is stepping forward as a more prominent conservative voice as his father Jeb readies a run, and Sen. Ted Cruz is building a broader fundraising apparatus. Texas\u2019 plan to hold its 2016 primary on March 1 means that only the traditional two early voting states, along with South Carolina and Nevada, would predate it, though some other states may eventually move their primaries up too. In 2012, Texas' primary came in late May, when the GOP race was already settled.\u201d\n\nHowdy, hipsters - 2016 contender Sen. Rand Paul is slated to appear at the Austin\u2019s South by Southwest music festival in mid-March. \u00a0SXSW Interactive: \u201cPaul joins Texas Tribune CEO Evan Smith for a special interview at SXSW. The conversation will cover how technology has transformed politics, campaigning, governing and citizen engagement and the future of tech policy.\u201d\n\nPerry staying on the trail - Former Gov. Rick Perry [R-Texas] gives a speech tonight at the 2015 RPV Commonwealth Dinner in Richmond, Va.\n\nGOP MONEY MEN DIGGING RUBIO\nNYT:\u201cAnd though [Sen. Marco Rubio] is not expected to make any official announcement until April, he is quietly telling donors that he is committed to running for president, not re-election to the Senate. (During a stop in Las Vegas, Mr. Rubio met privately with Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate and major Republican donor. Neither Mr. Rubio nor Mr. Adelson\u2019s team would comment on what the two men had discussed.) At a seminar last month hosted by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, Mr. Rubio impressed the powerful crowd. \u2026 \u2018We keep talking about growing the tent of the Republican Party and bringing in new folks,\u2019 said Spencer Zwick, Mitt Romney\u2019s longtime finance chief, who is now a coveted Republican operative. \u201cI think Marco can be a candidate to bring that excitement and energy needed to win a general election.\u201d\n\nDiaz-Balart backing Jeb - Miami Herald: \u201cJeb Bush\u00a0is the presidential pick for Miami Republican Rep.\u00a0Mario Diaz-Balart. Yet he also had nice things to say Monday of U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, assuming both Bush and Rubio seek the GOP presidential nomination. \u2026But, Diaz-Balart added, \u2018I just don't know of anyone who's better prepared to be president of the United States\u2019 than Bush\u2026\u201d\n\n[Bush continues his fundraising campaign with a stop in Tampa at the Grand Hyatt hotel hosted by notable Florida Republicans including Mel Sembler and former House Speaker Will Weatherford.]\n\nCHRISTIE TO TOUT DEAL WITH TEACHERS TO SOLVE BUDGET CRISIS\nAmid a brewing fiscal crisis New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will unveil what he says is a deal with the state teachers union to plug a $1.57 billion budget hole and address the state\u2019s long-term budget woes. In a preview of the speech provided to Fox News First by Christie\u2019s team, the 2016 hopeful will announce that the state\u2019s independent Pension and Health Benefit Study Commission has reached a deal with the New Jersey Education Association to find \u201ca sustainable, long-term solution to the pension problem.\u201d This is significant for Christie since the union bitterly opposed his 2011 budget package. In an excerpt provided by Team Christie, the governor uses the deal to highlight his work as a bipartisan dealmaker: \u201cWe do it differently. We get it done.\u00a0 I am committed to working with each and every one of you in good faith to make a promise to the people of this state that we will not push this off\u2026we will not leave it for another day\u2026for another year\u2026for another generation.\u201d\n\n[Tune in - You can watch the Christie address live at 2 pm ET. The action-movie-style teaser video is here.]\n\nKasich seeks to convince conservatives on tax plan - Gov. John Kasich has a chance to appeal directly to Ohio voters as he delivers his State of the State address tonight. In a bid to get past opposition among conservative Republicans who seek to block his tax package, Kasich is taking the unusual step of taking his show on the road. As the Cleveland Palin Dealer reports, Kasich is heading to Wilmington in the solidly Republican southwestern part of the state for the speech to make his case for the plan which shifts income taxes to other targets, including sales taxes and energy producers.\n\nREADERS RESPOND TO 2016 POWER INDEX\n\u201cGovernor Rick Perry has had one of the most successful governorships in our nation's history.

Reuters reports that early today, about 20 manatees, aka sea cows, were rescued from a storm drain in Cape Canaveral, Fla. These creatures habitually flee the colder ocean waters in winter, and head inland to warmer canals, but this group must have taken a wrong turn. This is a rare mishap for the highly intelligent animal. Seems the frigid temperatures have made even the smartest creatures delirious.\n\nChris Stirewalt\u00a0is digital politics editor for Fox News.\u00a0 Want FOX News First in your inbox every day?
