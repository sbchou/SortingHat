{"body": "Donald J. Trump repeatedly side-stepped questions on Sunday about how he would pay for his new plan to deport undocumented immigrants, and he also faced criticism from several rivals for the Republican presidential nomination about his call to end so-called birthright citizenship for children of those immigrants.\n\nMr. Trump, the billionaire businessman whose blunt talk and outsider appeal has helped him build a lead in Republican polls, refused to provide specifics about his immigration plans during phone interviews on two Sunday news programs, ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d and CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d He disputed estimates that he would need hundreds of billions of dollars to deport the roughly 11 million people who are living in the United States illegally, but he declined to cite his own figures or explain where the money would come from. He promised instead that good \u201cmanagement,\u201d as he put it on ABC, would fix the nation\u2019s immigration system.\n\n\u201cMy specifics are very simple,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m going to get great people that know what they\u2019re doing, not a bunch of political hacks that have no idea what they\u2019re doing, appointed by President Obama, that doesn\u2019t have a clue. I mean, that man doesn\u2019t have a clue. People are walking across the border right now, right in front of these great people that we have. We have wonderful border patrol people. They can do their job, but they\u2019re not allowed to do the job.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also said he would \u201cexpedite\u201d the return of \u201cgood people\u201d deported from the United States but then seek to come back \u2013 though he acknowledged that this could be seen as rewarding people who entered the United States illegally in the first place.\n\n\u201cWell, you could say that,\u201d Mr. Trump said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d in response to a question from the host, John Dickerson. \u201cBut we have lot of good people that have been here. They have done a good job. It\u2019s a tough situation, but they have lived here sometimes for 10, 15, 20 years.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, who has been lambasted by some of his rivals for offering simplistic ideas and being loose with his words, also suggested that there were far more illegal immigrants in the nation than widely assumed.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hearing 11 million for five years, then the other day I heard 30. Nobody has any idea,\u201d Mr. Trump said on \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nThe host, George Stephanopoulos, pressed him multiple times to be more specific, asking at one point if Mr. Trump expected neighbors to start turning in neighbors to immigration authorities.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Mr. Trump replied, before pivoting to attack other candidates like Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, whom he accused of heeding the advice of pollsters by turning against birthright citizenship to match Mr. Trump\u2019s position.\n\nMr. Walker, who has fallen behind Mr. Trump in some recent polls, and who appeared on \u201cThis Week\u201d after him, was vague at first about his position on birthright citizenship. He twice refused to say if he supported the Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to anyone born in the United States. When asked if he would try to repeal or alter it, however, he said, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy point is any discussion that goes beyond securing the border and enforcing the laws are things that should be a red flag to voters out there, who for years have heard lip service from politicians and are understandably angry because those politicians haven\u2019t been committed to following through on those promises,\u201d Mr. Walker said.\n\nOther Republican candidates also said they would not try to change the 14th Amendment. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey said ending birthright citizenship was \u201can applause line\u201d for Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the Constitution, and I don\u2019t think that we should be looking to change it,\u201d Mr. Christie said on \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cNow, what I said was, if we wanted to have comprehensive immigration reform, I would be willing to listen to anything. But the truth of the matter is that that is not something we should be being focused on.\u201d\n\nCarly Fiorina, appearing on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d also said she would leave the Constitution alone \u2013 and suggested that Mr. Trump was playing politics with the citizenship issue rather than tackling immigration in pragmatic, specific ways.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump may not be a politician, but he\u2019s sure acting like a politician in this regard,\u201d she said.\nOn another issue, taxes paid by hedge fund managers, Mr. Trump took another tough stand but did not delve into details.\n\n\u201cA lot of them, it\u2019s like they\u2019re paper pushers \u2013 they make a fortune, they pay no tax, it\u2019s ridiculous, OK?\u201d Mr. Trump said on CBS. \u201cThe hedge fund guys are getting away with murder. They\u2019re making a tremendous amount of money. They have to pay taxes. I want to lower the rates for the middle class. The middle class is the one, they\u2019re getting absolutely destroyed.\u201d\n\nThe anti-politician ethos of Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy has proved so popular so far, however, that Mr. Walker, for one, tried to tap into it on Sunday by criticizing Republican leaders in Congress for not replacing the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cHeck, I\u2019m angry at Washington, I\u2019m angry at my own \u2013 my own party leadership, who told us they were going to repeal Obamacare and we still don\u2019t see a bill on the desk of the president,\u201d said Mr. Walker, who laid out his own health care proposals last week.\n\nThe benefits of being an outsider also accrued to another Republican candidate, Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, whose strong poll numbers prompted this question on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d: Would he serve as Mr. Trump\u2019s vice presidential candidate, or perhaps choose Mr. Trump as his running mate?\n\n\u201cAll things are possible, but it is much too early to begin such conversations,\u201d Mr. Carson said.\n\nThe Sunday shows also tried to divine meaning from Vice President Joseph Biden\u2019s private meeting on Saturday with Senator Elizabeth Warren as he considers whether to enter the race for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. Speculation centered on the possibility of a Biden-Warren ticket, although one supporter of a Biden candidate, Josh Alcorn, appearing on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d emphasized that Mr. Biden was still simply considering the race.\n\nAnother Democratic candidate, former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland, said he would welcome Mr. Biden as a presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cIt would be nice to have at least one more lifelong Democrat in the race,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Malley said on ABC. Asked if he was taking a shot at Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a popular independent who is seeking the Democratic nomination, Mr. O\u2019Malley said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s a compliment to Vice President Biden for also being a lifelong Democrat.\u201d Then he broke into a grin.", "byline": "PATRICK HEALY", "description": "Scott Walker, Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina each took shots at Mr. Trump on the Sunday morning news shows over his immigration proposals.", "title": "First Draft: As Rivals Snipe, Trump Dodges Questions on Details of Immigration Plan", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/08/23/as-rivals-snipe-trump-dodges-questions-on-details-of-immigration-plan/", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Martin O'Malley", "Chris Christie", "Josh Alcorn", "John Dickerson", "George Stephanopoulos", "Ben Carson", "Donald Trump", "Donald J.
