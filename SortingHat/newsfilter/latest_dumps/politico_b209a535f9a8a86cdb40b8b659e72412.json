That's what he thinks,\" the New Jersey governor and Republican presidential candidate said in an interview with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" in which he addressed the president's \"60 Minutes\" interview that aired Sunday night on CBS. \nStory Continued Below\nAsked how he would handle the situation with the Russian military in Syria, Christie said that he would first institute a no-fly zone. His first phone call, he said, would be to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\"And I'd say to him, 'Listen. We're enforcing this no-fly zone, and I mean we're enforcing it. Against anyone. Including you. So don't try me. Don't. Try me. 'Cause I'll do it.'\"\nPutin would keep his planes on the ground, co-host Joe Scarborough said.\n\"You bet he would,\" Christie responded, adding that Obama got \"pushed around\" during an interview aired Sunday night with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Steve Kroft, who he said \"has basically been his buddy during the last seven years.\"\nChristie, whose campaign has remained steady in spite of low poll numbers nationally and in early voting states, reiterated that there is a long way to go until the first voters head to the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire early next year.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in October.

We\u2019ve got to go through the entire regular season, all of the playoffs except for the Super Bowl before Iowa votes and we\u2019ve got to go through the Super Bowl before New Hampshire votes. Are we really worried now about whether someone\u2019s 3-2 or 2-3?\" he asked. \"You know, bet on talent. Bet on the people who have been tested.\"\n\u201cNo one on that stage has been more tested than me,\" he added.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Christie slams &#8216;weakling&#8217; Obama for foreign policy failures", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/chris-christie-obama-weakling-foreign-policy-214663", "topics": ["immigration", "campaign_finance", "economy"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Mary Jo White", "Ron Paul", "Joe Pompeo", "Rachael Bade", "Hillary Clinton", "Jason Rezaian", "Spiro Agnew", "Hadas Gold", "Vladimir Putin", "Angela Merkel", "Henry Kissinger", "Steve Kroft", "Richard Nixon", "Chris Christie", "Patrick Temple", "Kimberly Hefling", "John Boehner", "Josh Gerstein", "Katie Glueck", "Nick Gass", "Jack Shafer", "Trey Gowdy", "Isaac Dovere", "David Rogers", "Andrew Glass", "Donald Trump", "Nicholas Vinocur", "Eliza Collins", "Paul Ryan", "Richard M.
