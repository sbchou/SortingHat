{"body": "POLITICO\nA daily overview of education policy news\nBy Caitlin Emma\n8/24/15 10:00 AM EDT\nWith help from Kimberly Hefling and Aubree Eliza Weaver\nNEW CHIEFS\u2019 CEO LOOKS FORWARD: The nature of the job of superintendent can lead to high turnover at the state and district level. Reform advocacy group Chiefs for Change has seen as much \u2014 a number of its founding state education chiefs have moved on, for one reason or another. That turnover in education leadership is a problem new Chiefs for Change CEO Michael Magee told Morning Education hopes to address in his new role. \u201cWe want to work with our members to ensure that they have long, productive tenures ... and when positions open up, we\u2019d love to see how we can add value there.\u201d Founded with state education chiefs, the nonprofit Chiefs for Change is now welcoming local superintendents as members. Recent additions include Utah Superintendent Brad Smith, Michigan Education Achievement Authority Chancellor Veronica Conforme and D.C. Superintendent Hanseul Kang. Magee said he wants to convene members more regularly and do everything possible to make their jobs easier. \u201cStay tuned,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the coming months, I think there will be some amazing people joining me.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\n\u2014 Magee comes from the Rhode Island Mayoral Academies, which he co-founded in 2009. He said the job helped him learn what\u2019s possible to accomplish in education reform when you have bipartisan support. \u201cI think there\u2019s an opportunity to do that with Chiefs for Change as we grow the organization over time,\u201d he said. In building the group\u2019s membership, Magee said he\u2019s looking for bipartisan leaders from across the country who support the organization\u2019s education reform vision and goals. Magee said he wants the group to serve as a thoughtful voice on education policy at the state and federal level. And he wants to spread the word about the work that members are doing. At the moment, he\u2019s working to recruit a top-notch staff. \u201cChiefs for Change has never had a staff before and that\u2019s limited its capacity to work with members,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that we\u2019re staffing the organization, we have an opportunity to do some new things.\u201d\nGOOD MONDAY MORNING, AUGUST 24.

For the first time, the results feature demographic data. Overall, a majority of those surveyed oppose the Common Core, but African Americans and Hispanics are more likely to support the standards. Standardized testing lacks support across the board, but just 28 percent of African Americans say they should be allowed to opt their children out of tests. That\u2019s compared to 35 percent of Hispanics and 44 percent of whites. The results: http://politico.pro/1hy4LhB.\n\u2014 Sixty-five percent of public school parents overall said they wouldn\u2019t excuse their own child from exams. Broken down by demographic, three-quarters of African Americans parents said they wouldn\u2019t excuse their own child, compared to 65 percent of Hispanic parents and 54 percent of white parents. \u201cCommunities of color tend to see the standardized tests as more valuable,\u201d said PDK International CEO Joshua Starr. \u201cThere are a lot of factors involved with that.\u201d He said urban and under resourced schools might see the tests as more important, but he said he\u2019s hesitant to draw conclusions from the demographic differences. He said the data is something PDK hopes to further explore.\n\u2014 When asked about ideas for improving schools, people surveyed ranked testing as least important. But a third of African Americans and Hispanics ranked testing as very important, and African Americans were more likely than whites to say that student test scores were very important when measuring a school\u2019s effectiveness. Sixty-one percent of parents overall opposed the use of test scores in teacher evaluations.\n\u2014 American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said the poll shows that \u201cthe public is saying end the fixation on and misuse of testing. ... What\u2019s infuriating is that parents and teachers have repeatedly raised the red flag over high-stakes testing, but policymakers routinely dismissed them.\u201d\n\u2014 Paige Kowalski of the Data Quality Campaign, said \u201cit\u2019s clear we need to have a conversation about how the information from tests is used. The backlash against student testing came about because teachers and families have traditionally gotten little value from it. Evidence suggests this is changing, but tests need to give parents more than a number that lacks context or meaning.\u201d\n\u2014 On a related note, Cheryl Oldham, VP of education policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, talks about the need for strong assessments and accountability while reviewing the amount of testing that happens in schools in a new podcast: http://bit.ly/1EeaRxO.\n\u2014 Other results from the survey: Americans continue to believe that their local schools are better than schools across the country. A majority of Americans endorse school choice and are on board with charter schools, but only about a third support the idea of vouchers. And students should also receive certain vaccinations before attending public school, according to a vast majority of those surveyed.\nDCPS KICKS OFF WITH CAREER ACADEMY: District of Columbia Public Schools start the school year today by rolling a ninth career academy, and Mayor Muriel Bowser is scheduled to announce that the district will apply for two more. NAF Be Future Ready academies [http://bit.ly/1KavD27] allow high school students to get an industry-issued certification and participate in paid internships during the school day. The graduates can then use the certification to get a job or help pay for college while working in that field. In D.C., the certifications are in the areas of engineering, hospitality and information technology. Eight such academies opened last year, and the ninth one opening today at Ballou High School is focused on hospitality. About 730 students are enrolled this year to participate in the program, which takes three years to complete. That\u2019s nearly double the number of enrollees from last year.\n\u2014 Nationally, there are more than 560 such academies. In the 2013 school year, more than 70,000 students attended one. Most go onto college. It\u2019s estimated about that 52 percent of graduates in the academies programs later get a bachelor\u2019s degree in four years, which is higher than the national average. \u201cIt\u2019s very much for students who are thinking about a career path or planning on a career path and it\u2019s very much for students who may not be going to college, so it works very well for both directions,\u201d Emily Durso, chief of college and career for DCPS, tells Morning Education.\nNO CANDIDATE LEFT BEHIND: GOP candidate Donald Trump is known for his nativist policies and inflammatory remarks about undocumented immigrants, but his recent comments about international students struck a more welcoming tone, Inside Higher Ed reports. \u201cWhen foreigners attend our great colleges and want to stay in the U.S., they should not be thrown out of our country,\u201d Trump tweeted recently. \u201cI want talented people to come into this country \u2014 to work hard and to become citizens. Silicon Valley needs engineers, etc.,\u201d another tweet said. More: http://bit.ly/1MD1Yil.\n\u2014 Vermont Gov.

The school hired Alexis Diamond, who earned his degree from Harvard University, and Michelle Greene, an MIT grad and postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School, to teach Formal Analyses at the College of Computational Sciences. Within the College of Natural Sciences, Abha Ahuja from McMaster University in Canada and Harvard, as Andy Dosmann from the University of Chicago, will teach Empirical Analyses.More on those and other hires:  http://prn.to/1JnbMOh.\n\u2014 \u201cAs we prepare to welcome a larger class of students this fall, we are thrilled to have recruited a remarkably talented group of scholars who will teach the freshman cornerstone courses this year,\u201d said Stephen M Kosslyn, Minerva Schools\u2019 Founding Dean. \u201cWe were fortunate to have a very large pool of candidates to draw from which allowed us to be as selective in our staff recruitment as we are with our student admissions.\u201d\n\u2014 Minerva was designed to \u201cprovide an extraordinary liberal arts sciences education to the brightest, most motivated students in the world,\u201d by way of small seminars with 19 or fewer students, immersion abroad, and a diverse group of students and faculty. Students live in one of seven cities throughout the world, depending on where they are in the program, including San Francisco, Berlin, Buenos Aires, Seoul, Bangalore, Istanbul, and London. About 78 percent of the program\u2019s students come from outside the United States:http://bit.ly/1DYZYQi.\nEDU-PINION: University of Michigan professor Susan Dynarski writes for the New York Times that, amid congressional efforts to substantially reduce the lengthy FAFSA form, \u201cWe could go even further and eliminate the aid application altogether.
