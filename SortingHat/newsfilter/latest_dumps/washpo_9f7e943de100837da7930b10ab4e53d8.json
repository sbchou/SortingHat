{"body": "   Bernie Sanders cracks a rare smile. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)  THE BIG IDEA: \u00a0 \u2014\u00a0A 74-year-old democratic socialist from Vermont essentially matched Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s fundraising over the past three months, and he probably has even more cash on hand than she does, a remarkable development certain to make already-nervous supporters of the Democratic frontrunner even more so. Clinton raised $28 million from July 1 to Sept. 30. Bernie Sanders raised $26 million. Hillary personally headlined 58 fundraisers during that time period, the same number as she did during the previous quarter. Sanders only appeared at seven finance events! Almost all of his money came from online. The disclosures come with fresh evidence that the base of the Democratic Party is not ready for Hillary. Yesterday alone, the Sanders campaign raised more than $2 million online. About $500,000 of that came in from 10:30 p.m. until midnight, according to my colleagues Matea Gold and John Wagner. Sanders has received 1.3 million donations from about 650,000 different donors. That puts him across the threshold of 1 million contributions earlier than Barack Obama in both his presidential campaigns. The Sanders campaign says it has more than $25 million in the bank. The Clinton campaign refused to disclose its cash on hand, but they have been far less thrifty. She\u2019s built a gigantic apparatus full of pricey consultants. She\u2019s also running ads on television in the early states, which Sanders has not done. Her burn rate last quarter was 40 percent. In all, Clinton has now raised $75 million for her campaign, while Sanders has pulled in more than $40 million. Sanders strategist Tad Devine has said that they gauged that it would take at least $40 million before the Iowa caucuses to run credibly against Clinton \u2014 a mark they\u2019ve now hit months ahead of schedule. Many of Clinton\u2019s donors are\u00a0now maxed out for the primaries. Sanders\u2019 average donation is for less than $25, so he can keep pumping the well for more. Clinton aides in Brooklyn stress that they are on pace to reach their goal of raising $100 million by the end of the year, and that they\u2019re breaking records. They also have the backing of a serious super PAC, which can raise unlimited money, something Sanders has eschewed. \u2014 Four major\u00a0implications of this:  Last night\u2019s numbers raise the stakes for the first Democratic debate, which is just 11 days away. Hillary needs a really strong performance to make her supporters less queasy; Sanders needs to look presidential. The closeness of the money chase will further tempt Joe Biden. The Times reports this morning that the Clinton campaign is \u201cINCREASINGLY WORRIED\u201d about Biden and is \u201cmaking a sudden and urgent effort to throw roadblocks into his path,\u201d with extra attention being given to locking down super delegates. Per Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman: \u201cAmong the clearest signs in the last week was a series of phone calls from Mrs. Clinton and two of her top advisers, Huma Abedin and John Podesta, to the financier Robert Wolf, a major Democratic donor who is now supporting Mrs. Clinton but who recently met privately with Mr. Biden.\u201d It\u2019s not clear Biden could raise as much money as either. In fact, he probably could not. But, as Mitt Romney told Philip Rucker\u00a0yesterday, \u201cthe unavailable is always the most interesting, the most attractive.\u201d There will be more pressure from Clinton\u2019s donors to go negative on Sanders. Brooklyn has dismissed him, and Hillary has tried to avoid\u00a0saying his name. Will that change? Watch for a flurry of fresh stories that take Sanders more seriously. It remains pretty inconceivable to the political class in both parties that Bernie could actually be the nominee. As a top D.C. Republican likes to tell us: America will never elect as president someone who does not comb his hair.  The Post\u2019s David Fahrenthold has a great read\u00a0this morning on how Sanders would transform America if he became president.\u00a0The piece\u00a0is based\u00a0on an examination of his current and past legislation; his campaign speeches;\u00a0and interviews with him, his chief policy aide and experts. \u201cIf he becomes president, Sanders would spend an enormous amount of money: $3.27 trillion. At the very, very least,\u201d Dave writes. \u201cBut he\u00a0is not just a big-spending liberal. And his agenda is not just about money.\u00a0It\u2019s also about control.\u00a0The biggest pieces of Sanders\u2019s domestic agenda \u2013 making college, health care and child care more affordable \u2013 seek to capture\u00a0these industries and convert them to run chiefly on federal money.\u201d \u201cThe simplest parts of Sanders\u2019s platform are the parts that are simply very expensive. New money. But pumped through old pipes.\u00a0He would allot, for example, an extra $1.2 trillion for Social Security beneficiaries, paid for by higher taxes on people\u00a0earning more than $250,000. He also would create a new Social Security benefit: paying for Americans of any age to take 12\u00a0weeks off to care for a new baby or deal with a serious illness. The funding for that would be new taxes on wage-earners\u00a0and businesses, raising $319 billion.\u00a0Clinton also has called for family leave, but her staff declined to say how she would pay for it.\u201d    Hillary Clinton checks her Blackberry from inside a C-17 in 2011. (AP Photo/Kevin Lamarque, Pool, File)  \u2014\u00a0On the\u00a0bright side for Hillary, the fundraising numbers helped bury another cycle of embarrassing coverage about the latest tranche of e-mails from the State Department.\u00a0Here are\u00a0the hard news developments out of the afternoon release, the fifth round, which included 6,300 pages of e-mails:  The number of e-mails now considered classified that were on Clinton\u2019s homebrew server doubled to more than 400 with this release. Three of the 215 newly classified documents are marked as SECRET, per Politico\u2019s Josh Gerstein: This is \u201cthe first time the State Department itself has deemed messages in Clinton\u2019s account to warrant protection at the SECRET level \u2014 the middle tier of the national security classification system. State earlier classified one Benghazi-related message SECRET, but did so at the request of the FBI.\u201d \u201cTwo of the just-released SECRET emails pertain to talks about the Iranian nuclear program \u2026. The messages are from January 21 and 22, 2011 and were forwarded to Clinton\u2019s private account by Deputy Chief of Staff Jake Sullivan, who now serves as policy director on Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. The substance of the two emails was redacted from the public release, but the subject lines identify the messages as summaries of the nuclear talks underway in Istanbul, Turkey.\u201d It turns out that John Kerry not only had Hillary\u2019s personal address, but he still sometimes uses private e-mail to conduct State Department business, the Boston Globe scoops. State Department spokesman John Kirby says that the secretary \u201cprimarily uses a state.gov e-mail account for his daily work.\u201d Per Annie Linskey and Matt Viser: \u201cThe State Department goes to extensive lengths to be sure work-related matters sent to Kerry\u2019s personal account are preserved, with at least one staff member granted access to his private account and tasked with pulling out any potentially work-related e-mails, a department official said. \u2026 In the past Kerry has used an AOL account and a Gmail account to communicate with longtime friends.\u201d Russia-linked hackers tried at least five times in August 2011 to pry into Clinton\u2019s private email account while she was secretary of State, the Associated Press reports. \u201cIt is unclear if she clicked on any attachment and exposed her account.\u201d They were phishing emails designed to look like speeding tickets, which would suggest they were not that sophisticated. The Clinton campaign says there\u2019s no evidence her system was ever breached. Two months of emails from the start of Clinton\u2019s tenure at State are missing, and federal officials haven\u2019t been able to recover them, the Wall Street Journal reports. The first emails turned over by Clinton\u2019s lawyers are from March 18, 2009. Clinton was privately cautious about being a leader on\u00a0gay rights. My colleagues note that Clinton was\u00a0perturbed after she read a Washington Post story about the State Department deciding to make U.S. passport forms gender neutral. \u201cWho made the decision that State will not use the terms \u2018mother and father\u2019 and instead substitute \u201cparent one and two\u2019?\u201d she wrote to Cheryl Mills, her chief of staff, on Jan. 8, 2011. \u201cI\u2019m not defending that decision, which I disagree w and knew nothing about, in front of this Congress. I could live w letting people in nontraditional families choose another descriptor so long as we retained the presumption of mother and father. We need to address this today or we will be facing a huge Fox-generated media storm led by Palin et al.\u201d Read the email here.\u00a0The Los Angeles Times, read widely by the west coast donor class, leads its coverage with this message.  \u2014 Six\u00a0of the funniest e-mails\u2014\u00a0  Hillary could not convince a White House operator that it was really Hillary on the line, and she emailed Huma Abedin to complain. In an email to Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski, she called Harriet Tubman her \u201chome girl.\u201d She had to ask aides what \u201cFUBAR\u201d meant. Clinton sometimes acted as her own press agent. In the midst of discussions about a possible Clinton appearance on Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s television show, Clinton told an aide: \u201cI spoke w her and she said she would do whatever we asked and so full speed ahead!\u201d Read it. Clinton kept a close eye on her reputation, polling about her and Capitol goings-on. On Dec. 30, 2010, as Congress faced a looming debt ceiling battle the next year, Clinton asked a staffer: \u201cCan you pls tell me how many times I voted against raising the debt limit?\u201d Finally, Delaware Sen. Chris Coons was apparently sad when Hillary did not recognize and greet him by name at an event for senators. \u201cHe was the only one whom HRC didn\u2019t recognize and greet by name,\u201d Nelson Cunningham said in a message to Cheryl Mills. \u201cHe reminded her that he was \u2018the one who beat the witch.\u2019 Chris is not a big-ego, high-maintenance guy, but he seemed a bit miffed as he described this.\u201d Coons also expressed some dismay that he was not informed through official channels of a Clinton trip to Africa.      \u2014 Kevin McCarthy\u2019s first big mistake\u00a0as Speaker Apparent could let Clinton get off the mat over Benghazi:\u00a0Michael Kinsley defined a gaffe as when a politician tells the truth, and that\u2019s what the California congressman appeared to do on\u00a0Fox News when he said that the House GOP deserves credit for dragging down Hillary\u2019s poll numbers through\u00a0its broadening inquest into the deaths of four Americans in Libya. Outgoing Speaker John Boehner has gone out of this way for the last year to insist that politics has nothing to do with it. McCarthy\u00a0made the mistake, apparently deliberately, to reassure conservatives, including Sean Hannity, that he\u2019ll be a fighter in his new job.  What he actually said: \u201cEverybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she\u2019s untrustable. But no one would have known any of that had happened had we not fought.\u201d\u00a0(Watch McCarthy in his own words\u00a0here.) Privately, congressional Republicans were incensed. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who chairs the oversight committee, told CNN that McCarthy should apologize and that it was an \u201cabsolutely inappropriate statement.\u201d He added, \u201cThat was not the reason we started. We started because there were four dead Americans and we didn\u2019t have answers.\u201d Observers like Chris Cillizza point out McCarthy\u2019s relative inexperience as he prepares to get the gavel,\u00a0wondering if he\u2019s ready for primetime and suggesting that\u00a0Republicans may be making a mistake by not putting him through his paces. Hillary testifies before the panel on Oct. 22, and\u00a0the McCarthy comment is\u00a0already allowing her team to lower\u00a0expectations and present the whole show as a political witch hunt.\u00a0Several Democrats said yesterday that the committee should now be shut down.\u00a0Clinton\u00a0campaign chairman, John Podesta, piled on:     (@johnpodesta)  WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:    Trump hugs a U.S. flag in Derry, New Hampshire (Reuters/Brian Snyder)  \u2014 In a New Hampshire speech last night, a few hours after another poll showed him leading the GOP field,\u00a0Donald Trump said the U.S. should not accept Syrian refugees because they could actually be a terrorist army in disguise. \u201cThey could be ISIS \u2014 I don\u2019t know,\u201d Trump said. \u201cDid you ever see a migration like that?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re all men, and they\u2019re all strong-looking guys. \u2026 There are so many men; there aren\u2019t that many women. And I\u2019m saying to myself: Why aren\u2019t they fighting to save Syria? Why are they migrating all over Europe? Seriously. \u2026\u00a0Military tactics are very interesting.

Noah said he felt the New Jersey governor was \u201cspeaking to me\u201d because he\u2019s a South African national. \u201cSo, you want people to get FedEx stamps, or\u2026?\u201d Noah asked, referring to Christie\u2019s statement that immigrants should be tracked like Fedex packages.\u00a0 \u201cThis is getting personal,\u201d Noah said, even though the conversation was pretty civil, according to Bustle.com.\u00a0Watch the full interview here.

WAPO HIGHLIGHTS: \u2014\u00a0Russia giving U.S. another big headache in the Middle East. Karen DeYoung reports:\u00a0\u201cBlindsided by the unexpected swiftness of Russia\u2019s air attacks in Syria, the Obama administration scrambled Wednesday to retake the diplomatic and military initiatives, saying it would not be bullied into supporting President Bashar al-Assad and that it was about to significantly expand its own Syrian air operations. \u2026 Secretary of State John F. Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, said in terse evening statements that U.S. and Russian military officials would meet, perhaps as soon as Thursday, to \u2018de-conflict\u2019 their operations in Syria. \u2026 Earlier in the day, Russian President Vladimir Putin brushed off Western concerns, suggesting that other countries \u2018get involved\u2019 in Syria under Russia\u2019s leadership.\u201d U.S. officials believe\u00a0the strikes not only targeted ISIS but U.S.-backed Assad foes, despite Russian denials.\u00a0Defense Secretary Ashton Carter warned Russia of \u201cpouring gasoline on the fire,\u201d adding that the year-long U.S. bombing campaign would continue as planned.\u00a0If you\u2019re trying to keep all the players straight, the NYT has a nifty \u201cwho\u2019s fighting whom\u201d guide.

Mrs. Fiorina and other candidates who have depended the most on the unlimited money raised by allied super PACs have taken it a step further: making travel schedules available, then letting the outside groups arrange and finance the events.\u201d Fiorina (along with Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee) posts her travel schedule on an a public Google calendar, allowing allies to track it. \u2014 Wall Street Journal, \u201cWhat\u2019s holding women back in the workplace,\u201d by Nikki Waller and Joann S. Lublin: \u201c\u2026when asked whether they want a top role in their companies or industries, a majority of women say they would rather not grab the brass ring\u2026Roughly equal numbers of men and women say they want to be promoted\u201478% and 75%, respectively. But as men\u2019s desire for big jobs intensifies in the course of their careers, only 43% of women said they want to be a top executive, compared with 53% of men. Perhaps most startling, 25% of women feel their gender has hindered their progress, a perception that grows more acute once women reach senior levels\u2026Women, along with many men, cited stress and pressure associated with upper-management jobs as the main reason they didn\u2019t aspire to those roles, a result that held whether the respondents were parents or not.\u201d Read the whole study by McKinsey & Co. and LeanIn.org here. HOT ON THE LEFT Today\u2019s anti-Muslim sentiment is yesterday\u2019s fear of Catholics. From TPM: \u201cBen Carson\u2019s warnings about a Muslim president sound almost identical to many concerns raised about John F. Kennedy as he ran for the presidency in 1960 \u2026 If we extend our historical gaze further back, we can find even more overt anti-Catholic echoes of our contemporary narratives about Muslim Americans. New York Governor Al Smith\u2019s 1928 campaign for the presidency was significantly affected \u2014 if not indeed derailed \u2014 by anti-Catholic fears and accusations.\u201d HOT ON THE RIGHT Family is on fleek. From the Federalist: \u201cParenthood is having a cultural moment. It\u2019s striking, because in our materially oriented society, we\u2019ve recently seen a number of celebrities speak out publicly not only about the joy of children, but also acknowledging that their professionally successful lives feel incomplete without children. Indeed, it has become cool to publicly praise family \u2026 Ivanka Trump [who recently announced she is pregnant with her third child] is certainly an example of that.\u201d DAYBOOK: \u2014 What\u2019s happening today on the campaign trail: Hillary Clinton attends a community forum on substance abuse in Dorchester, Mass.

NEWS YOU CAN USE IF YOU LIVE IN D.C.: \u2014 \u201cToday\u2019s showers and gusty winds are just a sneak preview for what promises to be a windy and wet next several days. Even if Hurricane Joaquin follows tracks passing to our north or out to sea, we still face a good old deluge Friday from tropical moisture driving directly into cold air pushing down into our area (ahead of Joaquin). If Joaquin follows the many models towards the Mid-Atlantic, Sunday into Monday could be even more inclement with the potential for flooding and damaging winds,\u201d the Capital Weather Gang reports. \u2014 With Joaquin coming, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe has already declared a state of emergency.\u00a0Watch\u00a0a video of what Joaquin could mean for our\u00a0region here. \u2014 The Nationals lost to the Atlanta Braves, 2-0. \u2014 The Justice Department\u00a0gave D.C. a $1 million grant to support\u00a0more body cameras for cops.

I am grateful in some ways that people will ask the question, but I am enjoying what I\u2019m doing in my life right now.\u201d These guys just can\u2019t let go. Watch the 2-minute exchange:    (Fusion)  \u2014 \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d tricked Hillary supporters by asking them what they thought about her tax plan.
