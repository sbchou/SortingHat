Because, you know, millennials.\u00a0\nThe Hillary Clinton campaign tried an exercise along these lines earlier this week, when it asked supporters to tweet their thoughts on student loan debt using only \u2018emojis\u2019 -- as part of Clinton's rollout of her college affordability plan.\u00a0\n\nHow does your student loan debt make you feel? Tell us in 3 emojis or less.\n\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) August 12, 2015\n\n\nNow, even the Clinton campaign seems to acknowledge the gimmick backfired.\u00a0\nInstead of inviting a cascade of cute and clever emojis on the student debt crisis, Twitter users roundly mocked the attempt at social media engagement with young potential voters.\u00a0\n\n\n\"@HillaryClinton: How does your student loan debt make you feel?
