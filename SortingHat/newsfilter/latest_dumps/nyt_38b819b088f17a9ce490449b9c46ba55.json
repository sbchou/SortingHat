{"body": "Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., in an emotional, wide-ranging interview on Stephen Colbert\u2019s \u201cLate Show\u201d on Thursday, expressed doubt about the likelihood that he would run for president, saying that \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said that I knew I was there.\u201d\n\nRepeatedly touching on his parents, his faith and his emotional fragility from the recent death of his son Beau, Mr. Biden told Mr. Colbert that no \u201cman or woman should run for president\u201d without being able to promise voters that \u201cyou have my whole heart, my whole soul, my energy, and my passion.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody has a right, in my view, to seek that office unless they are willing to give it 110 percent of who they are,\u201d Mr. Biden told Mr. Colbert, on his third night hosting the CBS program.\n\nMr. Biden made just a few jokes on the show, saying to Mr. Colbert, who in 2012 ran a fake campaign for president, that \u201cyou should run for president again, and I\u2019ll be your vice president.\u201d\n\nThe vice president never said directly that he did not plan to run for president, a decision that would disappoint the handful of \u201cDraft Biden\u201d supporters who chanted \u201cRun, Joe, Run\u201d in front of the Ed Sullivan Theater in Manhattan, where the show was taped Thursday afternoon.\n\nBut Mr. Biden repeatedly seemed to hint that he may not be ready to run for president for a third time. He described himself as \u201coptimistic\u201d about the country and \u201cpositive about where we are going,\u201d but he stumbled as he sought to describe what was holding him back.\n\n\u201cI find myself ... you understand, sometimes it just sort of overwhelms you. I can\u2019t. ...,\u201d he said, trailing off. Mr. Biden then told a story about how he broke down when he was greeting members of the military and their families at a rope line in Denver and one of them mentioned Beau.\n\n\u201cIt was going great,\u201d Mr. Biden recalled, choking up. \u201cAll of a sudden, a guy in the back yells, \u2018Major Beau Biden. Bronze Star, Sir. Served with him in Iraq.\u2019 I lost it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can you? That\u2019s not .... You can\u2019t do that,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Colbert repeatedly seemed to try to prod Mr. Biden to run, saying at one point that the American people were inspired by the vice president because of the tragedies he had endured. In addition to the death of his son, Mr. Biden\u2019s first wife and his daughter were killed in a car accident in 1972.\n\nMr. Colbert, who lost his father and two brothers in an airplane crash, told Mr. Biden: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be emotional for a lot of people if you don\u2019t run. Your example of suffering and service is something that would be sorely missed in the race.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden seemed almost embarrassed by the praise, saying: \u201cI feel self-conscious. The loss is serious and it\u2019s consequential, but there are so many other people going through this.\u201d\n\nAt Mr. Colbert\u2019s urging, he also discussed religion and philosophy at length, describing his Roman Catholic faith as providing an \u201cenormous sense of solace.\u201d He attributed part of it to the rituals of his religion.\n\n\u201cI go to Mass, and I\u2019m able to be just alone, even in a crowd,\u201d Mr. Biden said. He recalled how his wife, Jill, once taped a note on his bathroom mirror with a quote from the philosopher Kierkegaard that said, \u201cFaith sees best in the dark.\u201d\n\nThere was one moment when Mr. Biden seemed to suggest where he might find the strength to run. He noted that his mother had a favorite expression: \u201cAs long as you are alive, you have an obligation to strive, and you\u2019re not dead until you see the face of God.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden said he did not want to let his family down by allowing the weight of the tragedies to keep him from continuing to strive.\n\n\u201cNo one owes you anything,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cYou got to get up. And I feel like I was letting down Beau, letting down my parents, letting down my family.\u201d Mr. Colbert interrupted, asking why they would be let down. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t just get up,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\n\n\u201cI marvel at the ability of people who absorb hurt and just get back up,\u201d he said.\n\nThe interview had a few light moments. The vice president\u2019s microphone malfunctioned at one point, prompting Mr. Biden to joke that \u201cthey do this to me at the White House all the time \u2014 shut my mike off.\u201d\n\nThe audience laughed at Mr. Biden\u2019s retort when Mr. Colbert remarked that his mother had to take care of him when his father died.\n\n\u201cI imagine that would be a hell of a job,\u201d the vice president said, making Mr. Colbert laugh as well.\n\nMr. Colbert started the show with a routine about the presidential candidates, including Donald J. Trump. Mr. Colbert noted that a recent Republican focus group included one man who supported Mr. Trump because the candidate wears a hat that says he would \u201cMake America Great\u201d again.\n\nThat led to photographs of Rick Perry, aa former governor of Texas, wearing a 10-gallon hat with the word \u201cOops\u201d emblazoned on it, as well as a joke about Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mr. Colbert showed her wearing a plain white cap that \u201ccompletely explains her email scandal, but unfortunately, she erased it.\u201d", "byline": "MICHAEL D.
