This is becoming a disgusting spectacle after these increasingly common mass shootings. And it is reprehensible. \nOne target, less than 24 hours after the murders, was Fox News. \nTodd Rutherford, a South Carolina state rep, unloaded in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. He said the gunman \u201cwatches the news and he watches things like Fox News, where they talk about things that they call news, but they\u2019re really not. They use that coded language, they use hate speech, they talk about the president as if he\u2019s not the president, they talk about churchgoers that they\u2019re not really churchgoers. And that\u2019s what this young man acted on.\u201d \nI was inclined to cut Rutherford some slack because he was very emotional and lost a friend in that church. But then he doubled down in an interview with Bill O\u2019Reilly. \nThis is the worst kind of politicization. I shouldn\u2019t even have to say this: We don\u2019t even know if the shooter watched Fox. When people on Fox News criticize President Obama, they\u2019re not acting as if he\u2019s not president, and I have no clue what Rutherford means by talking about churchgoers as if they\u2019re not churchgoers. \nThink about this lawmaker\u2019s message: Someone watches Fox and goes berserk. This was a heinous act committed by a psychopath, a white supremacist consumed by hate, and Rutherford couldn\u2019t wait 24 hours before dragging in a cable news network he doesn\u2019t like. \nBut he was hardly alone. Even the church\u2019s murdered pastor, Clementa Pinckney, came under attack. \nCharles Cotton, an NRA board member, invoked the late clergyman\u2019s role as a state senator: \n\u201cHe voted against concealed-carry. Eight of his church members who might be allowed if he had expressly allowed members to carry handguns in church are dead. Innocent people died because of his position on a political issue.\u201d \nThe man is dead and he\u2019s being blamed. And regardless of your position on the issue, no one knows what would have happened on that particular night if the state had such a law. (Cotton later deleted the post and an NRA spokesman said he speaks only for himself.) \nSome also faulted President Obama for invoking gun control. But he didn\u2019t do it as a call to action: \u201cAt some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. I say that recognizing the politics in this town foreclose a lot of those avenues right now.\u201d \nThen there was Hillary Clinton, lamenting in an interview with Nevada journalist Jon Ralston: \n\u201cWe have to have a candid national conversation about race, and about discrimination, hatred, prejudice. Public discourse is sometimes hotter and more negative than it should be, which can, in my opinion, trigger someone who is less than stable.\u201d \nThen, without naming Donald Trump, Hillary said: \u201cA\u00a0recent entry into the Republican presidential campaign said some very inflammatory things about Mexico.\u201d \nNow it\u2019s certainly fair for Clinton to jump on Trump for having said that illegal Mexican immigrants\u00a0\u201care bringing drugs, crime\u201d and are \u201crapists\u201d and \u201csome, I assume, are good people.\u201d\u00a0But in the context of the South Carolina shootings? \nTrump replied that\u00a0\u201cwow, it\u2019s pretty pathetic that Hillary Clinton just blamed me for the horrendous attack that took place in South Carolina.\u201d She didn\u2019t do that, but she did drag him into the conversation. \nUnfortunately, both sides have a history of engaging in shameful rhetoric over the years. After the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, in remarks aimed at Rush Limbaugh, Bill Clinton blamed \u201cloud and angry voices\u201d that \u201ckeep some people are paranoid as possible\u2026They spread hate, they leave the impression that, by their very words, that violence is acceptable.\u201d \nLimbaugh responded that \u201cliberals intend to use this tragedy for their own political gain,\" blaming \"many in the mainstream media\" for \"irresponsible attempts to categorize and demonize those who had nothing to do with this.\" \nIn 2011, some liberals blamed Sarah Palin for the Arizona shooting that wounded Gabby Giffords and killed six people because Palin\u2019s organization had put crosshairs on a political map targeting Democratic lawmakers.\u00a0 I denounced it then and will continue to denounce such guilt-by-association tactics. \nPalin responded that \"within hours of a tragedy unfolding, journalists and pundits should not manufacture a blood libel that serves only to incite the very hatred and violence they purport to condemn.\u201d The phrase blood libel sparked a fresh controversy.\u00a0 \nEvery time there\u2019s a mass shooting, if the murderer had any kind of discernible political beliefs\u2014and often it\u2019s just an incoherent stew of hatred\u2014some on the left or the right try to capitalize on that. It\u2019s ugly, it\u2019s appalling and has no place in civil discourse. \n\u200eThis message and its attachments may contain legally privileged or confidential information.
