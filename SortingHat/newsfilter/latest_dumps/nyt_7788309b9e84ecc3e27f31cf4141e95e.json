{"body": "Have Democrats duped themselves with their fixation on carried interest?\n\nGrover Norquist, the anti-tax crusader who founded Americans for Tax Reform, thinks they have.\n\nDemocrats have pointed to a provision that allows private equity and hedge fund managers to pay lower tax rates as an embodiment of all that is unfair in the tax code. Now, both former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Donald J. Trump, two Republican presidential candidates, have issued tax proposals that target the loophole, presumably throwing liberals a bone.\n\nWhile Mr. Norquist, who pressures candidates to sign pledges against tax increases, has been against increasing carried interest tax for philosophical reasons, he said that killing the loophole would not be that big of a deal.\n\n\u201cYou guys can have carried interest; we\u2019ll take a big cut in the corporate rate, and we\u2019ll call it even,\u201d Mr. Norquist said, referring to Democrats. \u201cCarried interest doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nMr. Norquist estimated that taxing carried interest, the income that fund managers make when investing other people\u2019s money, like ordinary income might generate $3 billion in tax revenue over a decade. He said that he would happily give that up in exchange for slashing the corporate tax rate and cutting the top personal income rate to 25 percent, as Mr. Trump has proposed.\n\nLikening attacks on carried interest to a dog chasing a bus, Mr. Norquist said that, for Democrats, closing the loophole could be more trouble than it is worth.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t mean to catch the bus, you meant to whine about the bus,\u201d he said.", "byline": "ALAN RAPPEPORT", "description": "Grover Norquist estimates that taxing carried interest, the income that fund managers make when investing other people\u2019s money, like ordinary income might generate $3 billion in tax revenue over a decade.", "title": "First Draft: Grover Norquist, Anti-Tax Crusader, Says Carried Interest Tax \u2018Doesn\u2019t Matter\u2019", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/09/29/grover-norquist-anti-tax-crusader-says-carried-interest-tax-doesnt-matter/", "topics": ["personality", "economy"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Jeb Bush", "Grover Norquist", "Donald J.
