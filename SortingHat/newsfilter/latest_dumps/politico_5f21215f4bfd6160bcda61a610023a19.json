{"body": "Getty\nBy Nick Gass\n8/12/15 7:13 AM EDT\nHarvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig says he is mulling a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination because \u201cthe system is rigged\u201d in favor of lobbyists and those able to exert their influence to a disproportionate degree.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to get nothing done that the Democrats are talking about until we deal with this issue,\u201d Lessig said in an interview with MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Wednesday.\nStory Continued Below\nDemocratic candidate Bernie Sanders is \u201cchecking all the right boxes, he\u2019s saying all the right things,\u201d Lessig said, but \u201cunless you say you\u2019re going to fix this first, everything else is not credible.\u201d\nPressed further on the issue by Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Lessig acknowledged that the issue goes beyond campaigning and into the legislative process.\n\u201cWhy are the lobbyists so powerful? It\u2019s because they are one of the channels through which money gets into the system,\u201d he told Steele. \u201cBut if you change the way you fund campaigns, they don\u2019t begin to have the power they have anymore.\u201d\nLessig, who has said that he would step down as president after he got those reforms passed, floated a couple of names for his ideal vice president\n\u201cI have a list, it\u2019s my preferences. But ultimately it\u2019s the Democratic convention that would do it,\u201d Lessig added, bringing up Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren as \u201cpeople who get the base excited enough to turn up and vote.\u201d\nHillary Clinton is not there in creating confidence\u2014at least not yet, per Lessig.\n\u201cShe\u2019s just begun to describe this. She\u2019s got a lot to explain. She comes from a different era,\u201d Lessig said.\n\u201cI ultimately have come to my view\u2014this is why I\u2019m running\u2014that none of them could win on this issue. None of them could win on this issue. They could never have a mandate powerful enough in this partisan environment to win on this issue, which is why we need to do something different,\u201d Lessig said.\nThe law professor has said that he will run for president if his crowdfunded campaign raises $1 million by Labor Day and if none of the Democratic candidates make campaign finance reform a central issue of their campaigns.\n\u201cI\u2019m running in the Democratic primary,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat I hope is that somebody in the Republican primary would do the same thing,\u201d he said, mentioning absent MSNBC co-host Joe Scarborough, a Republican representative from Florida from 1995-2001, as a potential carrier of the mantle on the GOP side for the cause.\nLessig has made this point before, in a May piece for The Atlantic in which he wrote that Clinton\u2019s promises for a constitutional amendment on campaign finance reform are insufficient.\n\u201cIt is not enough to make cheap promises to push a constitutional amendment, as she has done. Reversing Citizens United alone won\u2019t fix the problem. Washington will not change until the economy of influence fueled by the lobbying-industrial-congressional complex is radically changed,\u201d he wrote in the piece.\nBy SEN.
