{"body": "The field of Democrats mulling a run to succeed Senator Barbara Boxer just got a little smaller.\n\nAntonio R. Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles, said Tuesday that he would not be run for the Senate in 2016.\n\n\u201cAs I think about how best to serve the people of this great state, I know that my heart and my family are here in California, not in Washington, D.C.,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nMr. Villaraigosa\u2019s decision follows similar announcements last month from Tom Steyer, the billionaire environmentalist, and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nThat leaves Kamala D. Harris, the state\u2019s attorney general, as a favorite to succeed Ms. Boxer, who announced last month that she would not seek re-election next year.\n\nOfficials from both parties have said that a Republican would have an extremely difficult time winning the seat in overwhelmingly Democratic California. \n\nWhile Mr. Villaraigosa is not running for Senate, he has hinted at being interested in running for governor, setting up a potential contest against Mr. Newsom, who has taken steps toward a bid. \n\n\u201cWe have come a long way,\u201d Mr. Villaraigosa said Tuesday, \u201cbut our work is not done, and neither am I.\u201d", "byline": "By ALAN RAPPEPORT", "description": "The field of Democrats mulling a run to succeed Senator Barbara Boxer just got a little smaller.", "title": "First Draft: Antonio Villaraigosa Opts Against Run for Boxer\u2019s Senate Seat", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/02/24/antonio-villaraigosa-opts-against-run-for-boxers-senate-seat/", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Tom Steyer", "Gavin Newsom", "Barbara Boxer"], "orgs": ["Senate"], "authors": [{"author_id": 8381, "fullname": "alan rappeport", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-02-24 23:19:54", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "24dbc2187507d7655fba0853820081ff", "date_access": "2015-02-25 18:42:52.772612"}
