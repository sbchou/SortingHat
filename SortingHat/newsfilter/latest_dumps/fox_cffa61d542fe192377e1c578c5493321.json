House Speaker John Boehner had one way left to keep his rivals off base, and this morning he deployed it.  Boehner had intimated to a close circle of advisers and friends that the end was near for his tumultuous tenure and crafted a plan, but he still managed to stun House Republicans this morning when he announced his decision to step down at the end of October.  The act will allow Boehner to shove through short-term spending measures to get to the end of the year and the chance to craft a budget (or reasonable facsimile) that will carry the government through the 2016 election year.  Boehner aides told Fox News that Boehner had planned his departure through the end of 2014, but the stunning primary defeat of former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor closed the door on that plan. Since then, it\u2019s been about finding the right exit ramp.  One member who was in the meeting with Boehner described the scene as \u201ctotally jaw-dropping\u201d and that the caucus is in \u201cchaos\u201d trying to sort out what happens next. Good question.  The most likely scenario seems to be Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy stepping out as frontrunner whenever elections are held. But it will surely not be easy for the Californian. The winner will need the support of every Republican except 15 or so, and McCarthy will have a hard time, at least at first, getting to the necessary 218 votes.  There will be pressure on other leadership rivals, including Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan to consider joining the fray. Ryan already said today that hes not interested today, but if McCarthy can\u2019t get the ball over the goal line, a backup QB will be required.  On the side of the stampede that pushed Boehner out there is considerably less clarity. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan would appear to be the frontrunner, but keeping order among revolutionaries has been tough stuff since before the Bastille.  As far as next steps on the fiscal-year-end cliff five days from now, it will depend on how well slaked is the bloodlust in the renegade caucus. If Boehner\u2019s departure is enough to satisfy the group\u2019s outrage, the outgoing speaker and his team will have more latitude to get a deal done quickly and to greater advantage. If the rebels are emboldened but unsatisfied, Republicans face the possibility of a fiscal plan written entirely by Democrats and ushered to the floor by a defeated Boehner.  Some have suggested that Boehner was moved to a sudden resignation by Pope Francis\u2019 announcements about unity in Congress. That\u2019s far from the case, according to two longtime Boehner confidants.  This plan, or something like it, had been in place since at least the beginning of this week if not sooner. The timing of the announcement, however, was dictated by the papal visit.  Who knew what a tremendous benediction devoted Roman Catholic Boehner was receiving?

Born in 1897, the Noble Prize winner is the definitive voice of the American South in the 20th century and best known for his Shakespearean portrayals of Southerners of castes high and low and both black and white in novels like \u201cAbsalom Absalom\u201d and \u201cThe Sound and the Fury.\u201d But Faulkner may have reached his highest heights in short stories. Faulkner despised the necessity of turning out smaller pieces to pay the bills, an act he referred to as going \u201cwhoring\u201d and \u201cboiling the pot.\u201d The University of Mississippi tells the story of his short stories here.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., up 16 points from Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton in what is the latest sign of an early state collapse for the Clinton camp. Adding to his double-digit lead, Sanders also ties Clinton for the most likely candidate to win the New Hampshire primary next February. Although Clinton\u2019s numbers stand strong when it comes to who has best chance of winning next November, the continued drip, drip, drip, of the Clinton email scandal seems to be wearing thin on Granite State voters. And today\u2019s news that Clinton personally signed off on Huma Abedin triple-dipping her resources \u2013 working for the State Department, Clinton Foundation, and private consulting firm Teneo simultaneously \u2013 show this scandal doesn\u2019t seem to be drying up anytime soon.  Biden, Hillary to woo big gay group - WaPo: \u201cThe Oct. 3 meeting of the leading activists of the Human Rights Campaign will not quite be a head-to-head confrontation between [Vice President Joe Biden] and former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton. But the two Democrats will speak before the biggest gay rights activists, inside the District\u2019s Walter E. Washington Convention Center, within a few hours of each another.\u201d  POWER PLAY: HILLARY\u2019S RE-RE-RE-SET Hillary Clinton\u2019s effort at a campaign reset can\u2019t seem to get ahead of the next scandal.

AH, \u2018WHITE PPL\u2019 Independent: \u201cAn Indian restaurant in west London has apologized to a customer for marking his receipt with the words \u2018white ppl\u2019 after he requested a mild curry. Valentine Restaurant in Southall said the mix-up was a misunderstanding rather than a comment on the race of the customer, because \u2018ppl\u2019 was its shorthand for \u2018milk.\u2019 The note, added underneath the order of a venison curry, read ***VERY MILD, WHITE PPL***\u2026But the customer, 44-year-old Stuart Lynn, said he was offended by the note and that he wouldn\u2019t be using the restaurant again\u2026He told the\u00a0Mirror: \u2018I was not happy at all. It implies we can\u2019t deal with strong curries\u2026 I thought it was very rude of them.\u2019\u201d  AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026 \u201cWhat I think strikes everyone is the\u00a0humility of [Pope Francis], carrying\u00a0on in the Franciscan tradition.\u00a0And also the gentleness of his\u00a0manner and the genuine way in which he\u00a0embraces the least among us,\u00a0which is sort of the ultimate message of\u00a0religion.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d Watch here.
