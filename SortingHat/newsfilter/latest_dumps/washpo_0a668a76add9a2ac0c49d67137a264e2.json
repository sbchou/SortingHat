{"body": " ST. LOUIS \u2013 Ben Carson likes to tell a joke about how his fellow conservatives, his silent majority, can get out the vote. He told one version of it at a speech in Conroe, Tex., an exurb north of Houston, and more than 1,000 people roared with laughter. He told it the same way to the conservative  Eagle Forum\u2019s conference this weekend, where the demand for seats forced organizers to move Carson\u2019s appearance from the main hotel into a wedding tent. \u201cGo talk to your uncle, who is an alcoholic,\u201d Carson said. \u201cAll he wants to do is drink all day long. Let him know that if we go down this road, there\u2019ll be no alcohol!\u201d It\u2019s not clear why the line works so well. Nor is it clear how Carson is drawing massive crowds in places barely touched by his rivals, including Anaheim, Calif., and Ferguson, Mo. \u2014 where, on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, he talked with the mayor about racial healing rather than chasing the news cycle of somber remembrances. What is clear is that Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, will enter the second GOP debate Tuesday polling behind only Donald Trump, the other non-politician in the race doing little of what\u2019s expected from candidates. And that seems to be the takeaway, so far, of the 2016 Republican nominating process. Like frontrunner Trump, Carson is running laps around the candidates with conventional political experience who are reading from a playbook that seems to have stopped working this year.  [Trump questions Ben Carson\u2019s energy to be president]  While the rest of the Republican field fulminated about the Iran nuclear deal working through Washington, Carson was several time zones away, quibbling with Trump\u2019s harsh characterization of the \u201cstupid\u201d deal. \u201cI would call it unwise, perhaps, but not stupid,\u201d he said in Anaheim. \u201cTo some degree I fault Congress for not insisting that something that involves us and other nations is a treaty. If it\u2019s a treaty, it has to be approved by two-thirds of the Senate. I don\u2019t know why our leaders are not savvy enough to understand that.\u201d An unlikely movement has begun rallying around that soft-spoken but uncompromising approach to politics. Carson\u2019s supporters often see the hand of God in his success. In Texas, supporters set up a table piled with copies of \u201cBen Carson: RX for America,\u201d written by John Phillip Sousa IV, who works for the 2016 Committee, the pro-Carson super PAC. All 800 copies were gone before Carson finished his speech. The volunteer forms filled up so quickly, with at least 500 sign-ups, that people took to scrawling on the blank sides. \u201cThis is God \u2013 it\u2019s all God,\u201d said Shannon Farr, the Texas chairman of the committee. \u201cI was that person who said: I came here to drink a margarita and talk. I don\u2019t want to talk about politics. Now I\u2019m the one talking politics \u2013 and no one wants to drink a margarita with me!\u201d Carson\u2019s Anaheim rally drew nearly 8,000 people to a conference center where parking cost $15 and signs for corporate events out-numbered a single whiteboard announcing Carson. The speech in Texas packed a high school auditorium and most of its cafeteria, where stragglers could watch a simulcast.  [Ben Carson visits Ferguson with a call to get past race]  One thing missing has been the national press. In Anaheim and in St. Louis, Carson held press conferences where empty chairs outnumbered reporters by as much as five to one. But even those gatherings eventually filled up, once VIP supporters were shown in to watch their man handle reporters. At every stop, they brought copies of his books, copies of the film adaptation of his life, stories of how his brain surgeries saved their niece or nephew or son. \u201cIt\u2019s a God thing \u2013 he\u2019s God-sent,\u201d said Bill Springer, 71, after Carson\u2019s speech in Texas. \u201cObama was God-sent, too. Obama is a blessing, because he\u2019s doing what God has planned, so we\u2019d better get ready for it.\u201d Springer was talking about the apocalypse. In fact, the brightest-burning enthusiasm for Carson\u2019s campaign comes from evangelical voters, who cheer when Carson says that the 2012 election was lost when too few of them voted. Even his campaign logo, with its image of four-cartoon colored stick figures in ecstasy, looks more suited to a global Christian charity than a campaign. A Quinnipiac poll confirming a Carson surge last week found him easily winning born-again evangelical voters, with support from 27 percent of those surveyed going to Carson compared to 20 percent for Trump and 15 percent for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). Carson is not the first evangelical conservative to come to such prominence; the televangelist Pat Robertson was competitive in 1988, and in 2008 former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee built a machine from Iowa\u2019s network of pastors. But both Robertson and Huckabee had to do some introductions, and they learned the patois of politics. Carson sounds completely unlike a politician. He also has needed no introduction; his memoir, \u201cGifted Hands,\u201d has been in some home-school curricula for years.   \u201cI don\u2019t think that my campaign is a religious campaign,\u201d Carson told reporters in Anaheim, \u201cbut I do believe that our country has a faith-based foundation. I know how many people would like to deny that, but think about it. Our founding document refers to the inalienable rights given to us by our creator.\u201d He sounded out that word \u2013 cre-a-tor. Carson often starts sentences with phrases like \u201cit\u2019s very interesting,\u201d or \u201cpeople like to say,\u201d before softly pummeling some \u201cstupid\u201d argument someone made to contradict him. Other candidates, with more electoral experience, talk about the fight for religious liberty. Carson skips to the part about secularists being stupid. \u201cEvery bill in our pocket says \u2018In God We Trust,\u2019 Carson said in Anaheim. \u201cIf it\u2019s in our founding documents, it\u2019s in our courts, and it\u2019s on our money, and we\u2019re not supposed to talk about it \u2013 what in the world is that? In medicine, we\u2019d call it schizophrenia.\u201d Schiz-o-phren-i-a.   [Outsider infighting: Trump goes hard after Carson]  Carson talks matter-of-factly about his own intellect. The typical Carson stump speech spends 10 or more minutes telling the story of his youth. It\u2019s all there in \u201cGifted Hands\u201d and the other books, but there\u2019s something potent about Carson himself describing how he used to tease kids, or get in fights, or struggle as the \u201cworst student\u201d who \u201chated poverty.\u201d That approach lets Carson evade the normal traps that ensnarl candidates \u2014 and lets him echo the fears of evangelicals without anyone hearing a pander. In every speech this week, Carson talked up the need for a viable guest worker program, where even those who\u2019d broken into the country could be eligible. Every time, he took questions. No one accused him of backing \u201camnesty\u201d \u2013 though it helped when he suggested canceling 10 visas from the country of any one immigrant found overstaying his. Every time, he described how he could \u201cdestroy America\u201d if he was so inclined \u2014 and he proceeded to describe the policies of Barack Obama. The litany ran from \u201cdividing us by race\u201d to \u201cgiving people free phones,\u201d a misreading of a policy that pre-dates his presidency. \u201cI was an intern in George W. Bush\u2019s White House and I volunteered for Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign,\u201d said Brian Foley, 30, who brought his young family to see Carson in Texas. \u201cMy wife and I talked about it, and we donated to him. We hadn\u2019t donated money until this campaign. He\u2019s a guy who can inspire the whole nation. I liked how he referenced Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin\u2019s idea that the population of America needs to be educated. That way, we could be less easily manipulated by people with their own agendas.\u201d Carson\u2019s rivals, some of whom have waited out previous summer surges, have no choice but to do the same now. Like Trump, he\u2019s seen as a holding center for very gettable voters, people who might come around once they think seriously about the demands of the presidency. \u201cIf you can separate Siamese twins, you\u2019ve clearly shown capacity to take complex things and make them work,\u201d said Huckabee, whose efforts to win back evangelical voters hit an apex with his Tuesday freedom rally for Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis. \u201cAt some point, people will start asking themselves: Who\u2019s prepared to sit in the office and carry out this job?\u201d Carson\u2019s answer to a question like Huckabee\u2019s is that, well: He grew up poor, and he became a doctor. He didn\u2019t think he was a politician, then people saw his address at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast, and God told him he had it in him. \u201cAll the political pundits were saying, it\u2019s impossible,\u201d Carson told his audience in St. Louis. \u201c\u2019Someone like you? You can\u2019t put together the political organization. You can\u2019t raise the money.\u2019 I said, \u2018Phew, good!\u2019 It\u2019s good to hear that. I finally said, \u2018Lord: All the experts say it\u2019s impossible. But if you want me to do it, if you open the doors, I\u2019ll walk through them.\u2019\u201d One hour after Carson said that, former Texas Governor Rick Perry wrapped up his own speech in which he suspended his campaign. No candidate had entered the 2016 race with more executive experience. And no one had failed so fundamentally to get traction. Perry, in some ways, was the first true victim of the Carson surge. Huckabee, who closed out the afternoon, was determined not to be the second. \u201cI delight that he\u2019s in the race,\u201d said Huckabee. \u201cI\u2019d delight more if he were at about half a percent.\u201d  ", "byline": "", "description": "Polling behind only Trump, the retired neurosurgeon has grown a following without conventional experience.", "title": "Like Trump, Ben Carson has surged ahead by being a non-politician", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/like-trump-ben-carson-has-surged-ahead-by-being-a-non-politician/2015/09/12/3e0ef32e-57f8-11e5-8bb1-b488d231bba2_story.html", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Mitt Romney", "Kim Davis", "Rick Perry", "Thomas Jefferson", "Donald Trump", "George W.
