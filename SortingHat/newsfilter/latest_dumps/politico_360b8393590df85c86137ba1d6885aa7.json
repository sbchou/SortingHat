Despite the fact that the attacker's Facebook page had pictures of Osama bin Laden, the Taliban, a gruesome beheading by ISIL, pictures celebrating the destruction of the Twin Towers, and the promise that America would go up in flames, and also his declaration that \"Islamic terrorists behead their victims' because of a 'precedent bestowed by their Prophet.\"\n No indication that Nolen was copying ISIL? No religious motivation? How stupid does the FBI think we are? Who exactly are they afraid of offending? ISIL?\n And is political correctness now so pervasive throughout our government that the FBI can't tell Americans the truth about the beheading of a grandmother in middle America out of fear of offending Muslims?\n If the FBI weakly resorts to political correctness after a beheading on U.S. soil, can they really confront the evil America now faces and the threat of copycat killers?\n The answer is no.\nOpinion: How stupid does the FBI think we are?\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Opinion: Can the FBI really confront the evil America now faces and the threat of copycat killers?", "title": "Who is the FBI afraid of offending?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/joe-scarborough/2014/09/who-is-the-fbi-afraid-of-offending-196268", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Ben Schreckinger", "Tony Romm", "Jennifer Haberkorn", "Mike Allen", "Nicholas Kusnetz", "Isaac Dovere", "Seung Min Kim", "D.C.
