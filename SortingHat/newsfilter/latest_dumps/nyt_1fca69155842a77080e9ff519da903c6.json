{"body": "MADISON, Wis. \u2014  It was a flashback to 2011: Hundreds of union members in hard hats and work boots waved signs under falling snow, denouncing Gov. Scott Walker and his fellow Republican lawmakers outside this Capitol building on Wednesday. Yet this time, their numbers were smaller, their chants softer.\n\nAs Mr. Walker builds a presidential run on his effort to take on unions four years ago, he is poised to deliver a second walloping blow to labor. After saying for months that an effort to advance so-called right-to-work legislation would be \u201ca distraction\u201d from dealing with larger issues like the state\u2019s economy and job growth, Mr. Walker is now preparing to sign a measure \u2014 being fast-tracked through the Republican-held State Legislature \u2014 that would bar unions from requiring workers to pay the equivalent of dues. The state Senate was debating the bill into the night on Wednesday, and the state Assembly is expected to take it up next week. Where Mr. Walker\u2019s earlier high-profile strike against labor cut collective bargaining rights for most public-sector unions, this one is aimed at workers in the private sector. And where Mr. Walker led the drive in 2011, he has taken a far less publicly forceful role this time, saying only that he will sign a bill. Yet the political effect will be the same, burnishing Mr. Walker\u2019s record as an unafraid foe of Big Labor, who has been able to prevail in a state where Democrats have won presidential elections.\n\nThe move has significant upsides for Mr. Walker, who has been cheered by conservatives for significantly diminishing the political power of public sector union numbers here. Leaders of some unions say membership has dropped by more than half since 2011. It would seal Wisconsin\u2019s place on the issue, even as other states \u2014 like Missouri, where lawmakers are considering a similar provision \u2014 have moved more slowly. As roughly 2,000 union supporters protested outside the Capitol for a second day and a few people interrupted proceedings in the state Senate with angry objections, some seemed resigned to what was ahead.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not optimistic that we can stop it,\u201d said John Finkler, a retired university employee and union member. \u201cBut I think people won\u2019t forget.\u201d\n\nFour years ago, the images here were jarring. Mr. Walker was only weeks into a first term as Wisconsin\u2019s governor, when he proposed cuts to collective bargaining rights and increased contributions from public workers for health care and pensions. In a state that had prided itself on polite political debate across partisan lines, furious opponents moved into the Capitol, chanting and beating drums, and would not leave. The crowds grew to tens of thousands at points, by some estimates. Democratic lawmakers fled to Illinois for weeks to try, unsuccessfully, to prevent a vote.\n\nMr. Walker\u2019s boldness drew national attention, and a recall effort against him sealed his support from conservative donors around the nation. As he sought a second term as governor last fall against a liberal Democrat, he was often asked whether he might next advocate new limits on private sector unions. Along the campaign trail, he said the issue \u2014 known by advocates as a \u201cright to work\u201d law \u2014 would be a distraction to more pressing matters on his agenda.\n\nYet after Republican legislators said they had the votes to pass a measure banning requirements that workers pay fees to unions, Mr. Walker\u2019s office said late last week that he would back it. \u201cGovernor Walker continues to focus on budget priorities to grow our economy and to streamline state government,\u201d his spokeswoman, Laurel Patrick, said. \u201cWith that said, Governor Walker co-sponsored right-to-work legislation as a lawmaker and supports the policy. If this bill makes it to his desk, Governor Walker will sign it into law.\u201d\n\nThe measure would allow private-sector workers who choose not to join unions to avoid paying the equivalent of dues, known as \u201cfair share\u201d payments, which union leaders say are reasonable for anyone who benefits from union contracts. The widely protested 2011 law gave most public employees that same right. Neither provision would apply to police officers and firefighters.\n\nSupporters of the measure say it would give workers choices, while opponents say its intent is to shrink union membership and political power. In the Senate, Republicans pushed back against Democratic efforts on Wednesday first to return the bill to committee, then to add a series of amendments. At points, the police removed several people in the gallery who yelled in opposition, and a group of protesters could be heard chanting just outside the chambers.\n\n\u201cThis bill has been rushed so fast that we haven\u2019t had a chance to look and study and analyze the budget hole that this bill will create,\u201d Senator Jennifer Shilling, the Democratic leader, said, adding that it would lessen wages and make workplaces less safe.\n\nSenator Scott Fitzgerald, the Republican leader who has pushed for the bill, said Wisconsin was at a disadvantage in attracting jobs because of its union payment requirements. He said passing the bill would benefit the state. Twenty-four states have similar measures \u2014 and most recently Michigan and Indiana, not far from here. \u201cThere\u2019s a bill before us today that certainly sends a signal that Wisconsin can be viewed in a different light than it was before,\u201d Mr. Fitzgerald said.\n\nBefore a crowd of demonstrators that spilled out around the Capitol on Wednesday, Phil Neuenfeldt, the president of the Wisconsin A.F.L.-C.I.O., called out, \u201cWe\u2019re back.\u201d He promised, to cheers, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to forget about it.\u201d Cold weather, short notice and work schedules may have diminished the crowds, some protesters said, but there was also a sense of inevitability \u2014 and of weary d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n\n\u201cFrom day one,\u201d Mr. Finkler, the retired university worker, said, \u201cWalker was all about running for president.\u201d About two hours into the debate on Wednesday afternoon, protesters inside the Capitol had dwindled to several dozen.", "byline": "By MONICA DAVEY and MITCH SMITH", "description": "A measure being fast-tracked through Wisconsin\u2019s Republican-held state legislature would bar unions from requiring workers to pay the equivalent of dues.", "title": "Walker Is Set to Deliver New Blow to Labor and Bolster Credentials", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/26/us/politics/walker-is-set-to-deliver-new-blow-to-labor-and-bolster-credentials.html", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "economy"], "people": ["Phil Neuenfeldt", "Scott Fitzgerald", "Jennifer Shilling", "Scott Walker", "Laurel Patrick"], "orgs": ["Senate", "Big Labor", "Assembly"], "authors": [{"author_id": 734, "fullname": "mitch smith", "primary_org": "nyt"}, {"author_id": 741, "fullname": "monica davey", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-02-26 02:29:15", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "1fca69155842a77080e9ff519da903c6", "date_access": "2015-02-26 03:41:45.259485"}
