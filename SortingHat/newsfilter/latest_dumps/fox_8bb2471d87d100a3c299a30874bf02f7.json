It\u2019s not a problem. This is media-bubble stuff. She\u2019s emerged unscathed. It\u2019s not hurting her in the polls. \nBut now it is. \nThe pundit class is so poll-addicted that if something doesn\u2019t show up in fav/unfav, or right track/wrong track, or cares-about-people-like-you, it didn\u2019t happen. I know that journalists were just as aware as I was that Hillary has been hammered since the day her listening tour began. But most of them couldn\u2019t believe their own eyes because, well, it wasn\u2019t there in the data.\n \nOf course, polls can be a lagging indicator, and the barrage had to be chipping away at Clinton\u2019s image\u2014especially among independents. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. \nIn the CNN poll, 57 percent say she\u2019s not honest and trustworthy, compared with 42 percent who say she is. \nIn the Washington Post/ABC poll, 52 percent say she\u2019s not honest and trustworthy, compared with 41 percent who think she is. \nNow polls bounce around, of course, but those are troubling numbers. \nThey show the combined impact of the private emails scandal, the ethical questions swirling around the Clinton Foundation, the six-figure speaking fees, and one more thing: the constant avoidance of the press. \nIt\u2019s not that people are up in arms about journalists getting stiffed. We aren\u2019t very popular either. \nBut by barely responding to questions about the negative stories, she ceded the turf to all the damaging headlines. Her operation seemed antiseptic and orchestrated. And by having bland conversations with small groups of voters, Hillary made no competing news. She left a vacuum filled by all the financial and email stories. \nPerhaps that will change after Hillary does her Roosevelt Island kickoff in New York next week. But impressions about trustworthiness are hard to change, especially with a figure as well known as Hillary Clinton. \nThere is some truth to the spin that Hillary was always going to slip in the polls when she descended from the lofty perch of secretary of State to the grubby reality of campaigning. But that doesn\u2019t fully explain her slide on the honesty question in just the last couple of months. \nMost political journalists are smart. They can see when a presidential candidate is struggling. And they don\u2019t need the latest pollster\u2019s survey to report what they\u2019re seeing and hearing. \nClick for more from Media Buzz\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmedia-buzz\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMedia Buzz, hosted by Howard Kurtz, airs on Sundays at 11AM and 5PM ET on Fox News Channel.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore on this show\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t", "byline": "", "description": "The conventional wisdom on Hillary Clinton turned in an instant.", "title": "Attention, pundits: If the polls confirm Hillary\u2019s slide, it must be true", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/-OkFQMZVc4Q/", "topics": ["women"], "people": ["Howard Kurtz", "Hillary Clinton"], "orgs": ["Clinton Foundation"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-06-06 00:17:56", "org": "fox", "article_id": "8bb2471d87d100a3c299a30874bf02f7", "date_access": "2015-06-05 09:13:17.704084"}
