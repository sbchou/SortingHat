{"body": "So a stock crash in China triggered a big decline around the world, while I was trying to have a personal life (and succeeding, actually). Leaving aside whether this really made sense, why should events in China matter for the rest of us?\n\nWell, you and I might think that it\u2019s because China is a pretty big economy \u2014 a huge buyer of commodities and a significant importer of manufactured inputs too. So when China slumps, you can and should expect knock-on effects elsewhere.\n\nBut trust the Republican field to declare that it\u2019s all Obama\u2019s fault. Scott Walker wants Obama to cancel a state dinner with Xi; Donald Trump says that it\u2019s because Obama has let China \u201cdictate the agenda\u201d (no, I have no idea what he thinks he means). And Chris Christie says that it\u2019s because Obama has gotten us deep into China\u2019s debt.\n\nActually, let\u2019s play a bit with that last one, OK? You could, conceivably, tell a story in which America becomes dependent on Chinese loans; then, when China gets in trouble, it demands repayment, pushing us into crisis too. But any story along those lines has a corollary: we should be seeing a spike in US interest rates as our credit line gets pulled. What you actually see is falling rates:\n\nOh, why am I even bothering?\n\nBut remember: all the experts said that the GOP had an unusually strong field, a very deep bench, a lot of talent running for president.", "byline": "PAUL KRUGMAN", "description": "Obama did it!
