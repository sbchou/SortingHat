{"body": "AP Photo\nBy Jeremy Herb\n8/23/15 9:57 AM EDT\nBen Carson on Sunday dismissed criticism of the term \u201canchor babies,\u201d which has been used by several Republican presidential hopefuls, as \u201csilly\u201d political correctness.\n\u201cWe need to talk about the actual issue and stop getting pulled off into the weeds and saying, \u2018you can\u2019t use this term, you can\u2019t use that term,\u2019 \u201d Carson said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s silly.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\nSome other GOP presidential contenders, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, have also defended the term, which refers to the babies of undocumented women who illegally immigrate to the U.S. to have children.\n\u201cYou give me a better term and I\u2019ll use it,\u201d Bush said Thursday. \u201cGive me another word.\u201d\nCarson, a retired pediatric neurosurgeon, also defended his suggestion last week that armed drones could be used on the U.S.-Mexico border to target illegal immigration. Carson said he was not saying the U.S. should use drone strikes on people crossing the border, but only as a way to go after the caves used to smuggle people across the border.\nMore on POLITICO\n\u201cWhat I said is it\u2019s possible that a drone could be used to secure the caves,\u201d Carson said. \u201cThose caves can be eliminated. There are a number of possibilities; that could be one of them.\u201d\nBy BEN SCHRECKINGER\nBy JEFF GREENFIELD \nBy CALEB HANNAN\nBy IBRAHIM HIRSI\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "\"We need to talk about the actual issue and stop getting pulled off into the weeds,\" Carson said.", "title": "Carson dismisses 'anchor-babies' controversy as 'silly'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/ben-carson-anchor-babies-immigration-2016-121639.html", "topics": ["immigration", "personality"], "people": ["Jeremy Herb", "Jeb Bush", "Ben Carson"], "orgs": ["GOP"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30887, "fullname": "jeremy herb", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-08-23 14:57:23", "org": "politico", "article_id": "ee39a2d6317cfe5243f7f5ea9a7b0413", "date_access": "2015-08-23 14:20:10.661941"}
