John Kasich, \u201cwere designed to and will disproportionately burden specific populations, including African-Americans, Latinos and young people \u2013 each of which are, not coincidentally, core Democratic constituencies,\u201d the complaint says. \nAmong the lawyers representing The Ohio Organizing Collaborative and three individuals who filed the injunction is Marc Elias \u2013 the general counsel to \u201cHillary for America,\u201d Clinton's presidential campaign.\u00a0 \nElias also worked for John Kerry\u2019s 2004 presidential campaign and lists the Democratic National Committee, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Governors Associations among his former clients, according to his website. \nThe complaint calls for an injunction on a number of measures passed in recent years, including laws that restrict the casting of absentee and provisional ballots and limit the times and locations for early voting, such as abolishing an early voting period known as \"Golden Week\" in which voters could register and cast an in-person ballot on the same day. \n\u201cIf the laws and procedures described above are not invalidated, hundreds of thousands of Ohioans will find it substantially more difficult to exercise this fundamental right [to vote],\u201d the complaint says.\n \nHowever, the challenge has drawn accusations that the Clinton camp is playing politics. \n\u201cOhio just settled a federal lawsuit on early voting a couple of weeks ago so that we could have a smooth, fair elections process in 2016. But some politicians don't want peace, they just want to play politics, again,\u201d Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted said in a statement. \n\u201cOhioans don't want politically motivated, legal lap dogs messing around in our elections, this nonsense creates more confusion and discourages voting by undermining voter confidence,\" Husted said. \nIn a statement to Fox News, Elias dismissed Husted\u2019s accusation that he was playing politics. \n\u201cMy firm and I have brought many lawsuits throughout the country to vindicate the right to vote.\u00a0 Our lawsuit is on behalf to the plaintiffs listed in the complaint.\u00a0 It is unfortunate that Secretary Husted chose to respond with a political attack rather than working to remedy the problems identified in our suit,\" Elias said. \n\u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "In a sign that Hillary Clinton\u2019s camp are gearing up for battle in the crucial battleground state of Ohio, her top campaign lawyer has issued a challenge to Ohio voting laws, claiming that they are designed to suppress potential minority and young voters.", "title": "Clinton's top campaign lawyer challenges Ohio voting laws", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/L6TVT4pSI_M/", "topics": ["women", "abortion"], "people": ["John Kerry", "Marc Elias", "Jon Husted", "Hillary Clinton", "John Kasich"], "orgs": ["Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee", "Democratic National Committee", "Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee", "GOP"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-05-13 00:44:02", "org": "fox", "article_id": "e247966081a2f0aaa4e51ef733a50615", "date_access": "2015-05-13 00:50:18.324372"}
