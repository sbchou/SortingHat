{"body": "Both Donald Trump and political strategist Roger Stone agree they have parted ways. What they don\u2019t agree on is when and how they did it.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s campaign aides announced on Saturday afternoon that he had fired Mr. Stone because the former Richard Nixon aide, one of the more colorful operatives in Republican politics, had sought attention for himself instead of for the candidate.\n\nThey said Mr. Stone had been fired on Friday. But close associates of Mr. Stone, who was a top adviser to Mr. Trump in 2011 when he publicly considered a presidential campaign before deciding against it, said he told them that he had resigned early Saturday morning, before the Trump campaign\u2019s announcement.\n\nMr. Stone took to Twitter to tell his side of the story, borrowing his former client\u2019s signature reality television phrase and writing, \u201cSorry @realDonaldTrump didn\u2019t fire me- I fired Trump. Diasagree with diversion to food fight with @megynkelly away core issue messages.\u201d In another Twitter post, he intimated that Mr. Trump\u2019s standing in the polls would suffer from the attacks on Ms. Kelly.\n\nMr. Stone was said to take issue with the direction the campaign was taking under the direction of new advisers brought in by Mr. Trump, according to friends. Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about Megyn Kelly, the Fox News anchor, in an interview with CNN on Friday evening, had been the final straw. In the interview, Mr. Trump said Ms. Kelly, one of the moderators of the Republican debate on Thursday, was so angry during the debate that she had \u201cblood coming out of her wherever,\u201d an apparent reference to menstruation.\n\nMr. Trump, who is known for keeping his own counsel, had been rejecting Mr. Stone\u2019s advice more frequently, according to the strategist\u2019s friends, who said he had advised against Mr. Trump\u2019s CNN interview on Friday.\n\nIn a \u201cDear Donald\u201d letter to Mr. Trump on Saturday morning, Mr. Stone said he was \u201cproud to have played a role in the launch of your presidential campaign\u201d and that Mr. Trump\u2019s message \u201charkened back to the Reagan era. Restoring national pride and bringing jobs back to America \u2014 your initial and still underlying message \u2014 is a solid conservative message.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the current controversies involving personalities and provocative media fights have reached such a high volume that it has distracted attention from your platform and overwhelmed your core message,\u201d Mr. Stone continued in the letter, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times. \u201cWith this current direction of the candidacy, I no longer can remain involved in your campaign. I care about you as a friend and wish you well. I care about our nation, too, and wish it well.\u201d\n\nMr. Stone would not comment on his departure. Mr. Trump, in an interview, said it was \u201ctotally false\u201d that Mr. Stone had resigned.\n\n\u201cI hardly ever spoke to the guy; he was just there. He played no role of any kind,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nBut Mr. Stone showed up in the Trump campaign\u2019s filings with the Federal Election Commission as being on its payroll, and he frequently defended Mr. Trump on Twitter and on television\n\nMr. Trump acknowledged that he and Mr. Stone \u2014 who attended two of Mr. Trump\u2019s weddings as well as the funerals of his parents, and had worked as a lobbyist for his casinos \u2014 had parted ways in the past only to reunite.\n\n\u201cYears ago, I fired him and then he came back,\u201d Mr. Trump said.", "byline": "MAGGIE HABERMAN", "description": "Both Donald Trump and political strategist Roger Stone agree they have parted ways.
