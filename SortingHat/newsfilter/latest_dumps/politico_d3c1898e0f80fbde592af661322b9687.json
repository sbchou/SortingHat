are not just targeting the Islamic State, according to the Associated Press quoting a spokesman for the Russian president.\nOn Wednesday, as Russia began airstrikes on Syria, many expressed concern that their true motive was to protect Syrian President Bashar Assad.\nStory Continued Below\nU.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told reporters that Russia \"may well have\" hit non-ISIL fighters, and, speaking at the U.N., Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. \"would have grave concerns should Russia strike areas where ISIL and Al Qaeda-affiliated targets are not operating.\"\nSpokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Russia had carried out 20 airstrikes against ISIL and other \u201cwell-known\u201d extremist groups, and the targets are in-coordination with the Syrian army. \n\nForeign Policy\n\n            By \nJohn Bresnahan\n             and \nEdward-Isaac Dovere\n\nIran's Foreign Ministry said it supported Russia's involvement.\n\u201cThe Islamic Republic of Iran considers military action by Russia against armed terrorist groups to be a step toward fighting terrorism and toward resolving the current crisis,\" said a spokeswoman.\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio, speaking with Fox News' Megyn Kelly Wednesday night, said that Russia's action was \"quite predictable\" and said the sudden move made the United States \"look like a junior partner under Barack Obama.\"\n\"It had already been reported in the media that the Russians were positioning air assets and in Syria,\" Rubio said. \"This is not about ISIS. This is about propping up Assad, who is a client state of both Iran and Vladimir Putin.\"\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Russia admits its airstrikes went beyond ISIL", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/russia-syria-airstrikes-not-just-isil-isis-214313", "topics": ["terrorism", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Burgess Everett", "Megyn Kelly", "Bashar Assad", "Rachael Bade", "Henry C.
