{"body": "Senator Bernie Sanders was quick to offer praise for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Wednesday, portraying himself as a grateful ally of the vice president\u2019s and perhaps an appealing alternative to Democratic voters who might have been drawn to a Biden candidacy.\n\nAddressing reporters outside Penn Station in Manhattan, Mr. Sanders said it was \u201chard to say\u201d how Mr. Biden\u2019s decision would affect the presidential race.\n\nHe was more interested in paying tribute to the vice president, describing him as \u201ca man who has devoted his entire life to public service and to the well being of working families and the middle class.\u201d\n\nIn particular, Mr. Sanders said he wanted to thank Mr. Biden and President Obama for their work to improve the economy. \u201cObviously, we have a long way to go,\u201d the senator said. \u201cBut because of Joe Biden, because of President Obama, we have seen significant progress in the last seven years.\u201d\n\nHe also portrayed Mr. Biden as a like-minded partner in confronting some of the issues that he has focused on in his campaign, including combating income inequality and the influence of wealth on elections. \u201cI look forward to working with Joe Biden, who I know will remain active in these struggles,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.\n\nIn response to a question, Mr. Sanders also agreed with Mr. Biden\u2019s assertion on Wednesday that Republicans should not be viewed as enemies \u2014 in contrast to Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s comment in last week\u2019s debate that she considered Republicans to be among her enemies.\n\nMr. Sanders suggested \u201copponents\u201d with \u201cstrong differences of opinion\u201d might be better a description.\n\n\u201cThere is no issue that we don\u2019t have fundamental disagreements,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would not use the word quote-unquote enemies to describe fellow Americans.\u201d", "byline": "THOMAS KAPLAN", "description": "Bernie Sanders was quick to offer praise for Joseph R.
