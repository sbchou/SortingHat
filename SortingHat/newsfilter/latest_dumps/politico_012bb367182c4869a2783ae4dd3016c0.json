{"body": "POLITICO\nAn early filing of the day's tax news\nBy Hillary Flynn\n7/8/15 10:00 AM EDT\nWith assistance from Toby Eckert, Elena Chiriboga and Brian Faler\nOPAQUE PHONE SCAMS IN SPOTLIGHT. The IRS's auditor will shed some light\u00a0on phone scams, which\u00a0have boomed in recent years, at a media briefing today.\u00a0The update is expected to provide new data on the problem and efforts to combat it. The scams started to pick up in August 2013. By October of that year, the\u00a0Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration\u00a0was tracking the crime in earnest. Now it's\u00a0on everyone\u2019s radar. The\u00a0scheme \u2014 in which a taxpayer receives an unsolicited call from a scammer posing as an IRS agent who says the taxpayer owes taxes and can be immediately arrested if they don\u2019t put cash on a prepaid debit card \u2014 came in at No. 1 on the\u00a0IRS\u2019s \u201cDirty Dozen\u201d tax scams this year and there have been two congressional hearings on the issue,\u00a0by the Senate Finance Committee and the\u00a0Senate Special Committee on Aging.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cTo date, TIGTA has received over 366,000 reports of these calls,\u201d Timothy\u00a0Camus, deputy inspector general at TIGTA, told\u00a0the Senate Finance Committee in March. He went on to say that as of March 9, there were 3,052 individual victims who paid\u00a0a total of $15.5 million \u2014 which comes to an average of $5,000 per victim.\nRead Camus\u2019 past testimony here: http://1.usa.gov/1Apsh1R and the IRS\u2019s \u201cDirty Dozen\u201d here: http://1.usa.gov/1DBsS68\nHAPPY WEDNESDAY!

The Senate Finance Committee will release a long-awaited report on the way the IRS handles tax-exempt groups before the August recess, committee aides confirmed to POLITICO. The report is the culmination of a 26-month investigation into the way the IRS processed applications for 501(c)(4) status, after the agency\u2019s inspector general kicked up a firestorm with a May 2013 report revealing the IRS had judged conservative groups\u2019 applications using \u201cinappropriate\u201d criteria. Several congressional investigations are still under way. http://politico.pro/1J389am\nTAXES SHAPING UP AS DEFINING ISSUE IN GOP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY. With SO many candidates, the Republican presidential contenders are hoping to stand out from the crowd with big, splashy tax reform proposals. The result? A surprisingly diverse array of proposals, some of which defy the party\u2019s mantras on tax increases and low marginal rates. The party\u2019s already vigorous debate over the competing plans is likely to ramp up in coming weeks, with Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and John Kasich yet to weigh in with their own proposals. And with the primary debates set to begin in August, candidates will be looking to flesh out their policy agendas. Read the take from Pro Tax's Brian Faler here: http://politico.pro/1JSo1zt\nSTILL NO FUNDING FIX FOR HIGHWAYS. After retreating to the Library of Congress for a meeting of the minds on that and other matters, House Ways and Means Republicans say they are still at a loss for how to find money for a transportation fund extension, Pro Transportation\u2019s Heather Caygle and Jennifer Scholtes report.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re still hoping for an extension until the end of the year, which gives us time to get to the five- to six- to seven-year long-term bill, which then gives us an opportunity to look at permanent funding,\u201d said Rep. Dave Reichert, chairman of the Ways and Means Select Revenue Measures Subcommittee.\nGRASSLEY ISSUES TIMELY\u00a0REMINDER ON\u00a0ACA PENALTY BILLS. Just in case they forgot, Sen. Chuck Grassley wants small businesses to know he has their back as an Obamacare regulation that could snare them kicks in. Grassley reminded everyone there\u2019s bipartisan legislation in the Senate and House that he says would fix the problem. Starting July 1, businesses that give their workers additional pay to compensate them for medical expenses or for buying health insurance can be fined $100 per day, per employee. Small business advocates want Congress to revoke the regulation. Hence Grassley\u2019s legislation, and a companion bill in the House. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from farmers, small-business owners and accountants who are worried about getting hit with a penalty for something they\u2019ve done for a long time without any controversy,\u201d the Iowa Republican said in a statement. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to tell small employers they can\u2019t help their employees get health insurance.\u201d\n\u2014 THE DEETS OF GRASSLEY\u2019S LEGISLATION:\u00a0It would allow small businesses and municipalities with fewer than 50 employees to continue using pre-tax dollars to chip in for health care expenses; allow the employees to use the money to buy health insurance on the individual market or to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses if he or she has qualified health coverage; and protect employers from being fined for the practice.\nThe Senate legislation is here: http://bit.ly/1LVCNbD\u00a0And the House legislation is here:\u00a0http://bit.ly/1JNeeNT.\nIRS WHISTLEBLOWER PROGRAM PARTICIPATION JUMPS IN 2014. Looks like the\u00a0IRS whistleblower program is booming. The agency\u2019s report of how the program went for fiscal 2014 was released Tuesday, showing that it received a record 14,365 claims. During that year the IRS paid out $48,516,906 in awards, after the amount reduced by sequestration was accounted for. These payout are for claims filed between fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2011 and are 16.9 percent of the total amount the IRS collected because of the claims. http://1.usa.gov/1HLbqQL\n\u00a0\u2014 GRASSLEY TIPS HIS HAT \u2014 AND GIVES A WARNING: \u201cThe point of the whistleblower office changes was to encourage the IRS to work as closely as possible with whistleblowers to rein in tax cheats and return money to the U.S. Treasury.\u00a0It seems the IRS has made some progress but there\u2019s always danger of moving backward if the IRS\u2019s focus changes or if whistleblowers stop coming forward out of fear of poor results, such as the seeming lack of urgency in the processing of awards.\u00a0I\u2019ll continue to look for progress and even more evidence that the IRS is offering a welcome mat to whistleblowers.\u201d\nNIGER INNIS GRACIOUS TOWARD ONETIME RIVAL\u00a0HARDY. Niger Innis, the Nevada activist and politician who ran against Rep. Cresent Hardy in the 2014 GOP primaries and whom Hardy attacked for having\u00a0unpaid business taxes, is not rejoicing over the revelation Hardy has $5.3 million in unpaid tax liens and other business debt. \u201cI think obviously Hardy is dealing with some issues regarding taxes and debt that a lot of small businesses and large business have to deal with every day,\u201d Innis told your Morning Taxer. Hardy\u2019s debt came from an upscale golf course he had designed. Innis acknowledged that during the primary, they both \u201chit each other very hard over our tax problems.\u201d He said, though, \u201cOne of the things both Hardy and I argued during our primary is that small businesses are catching hell in their regulatory environment and the heavy tax burden they have to deal with.\u201d\nPOLL: WESTERNERS WANT TO HIKE ENERGY EXTRACTION TAXES. Westerners want energy companies to treat their land better, or at least pay more to extract from it. The Western Values Project commissioned\u00a0a poll of residents in New Mexico, Colorado and Montana that\u00a0showed 84 percent of Westerners believe companies that extract energy from federal public lands should pay the same tax rate as they pay when they extract energy from private and state-owned lands. The federal royalty rate is currently 12.5 percent and has not been updated since the 1920s, while oil- and gas-producing states tend to charge much higher tax rates. Texas has a 25 percent rate, North Dakota has an 18.75 percent rate, and Wyoming has a 16.67 percent rate. http://bit.ly/1CZfupn\nMARK EVERSON WANTS TRUMP TO CALL IT QUITS. Mark Everson \u2014 remember him? No? The former IRS commissioner and 2016\u00a0presidential hopeful\u00a0wants real estate mogul Donald Trump \u2014 one of his competitors for the GOP nomination \u2014 to end his campaign. His issues with Trump are the pretty standard: outrage over Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants, and probably Trump\u2019s hair (just kidding). Trump is obviously fearing for his political life right now \u2026 If you want to meet Mark Everson, click here: http://bit.ly/1J3f4QV.\nWORLD NEWS \u2014 \nU.K. PENSION CHANGE COULD HIT RETIREES WITH HIGH TAX BILL. Thanks, Granny: A change in the U.K.\u2019s pension rules will produce a big windfall for that country\u2019s Treasury. Pensioners age 55 and over can now take their pensions in cash, instead of having to buy an annuity. Taking the cash in a bundle\u00a0can result in a hefty income tax bill. \u201cSuch income tax revenue this year is expected to be more than double the amount predicted by the Treasury,\u201d the BBC reports. While the Treasury cited an estimate of \u00a3320m (roughly $494 million) for 2015-16,\u00a0the BBC commissioned its own study showing the extra taxes will total \u00a3700m (roughly $1 billion).\u00a0\nSTATE TAX WATCH \u2014 \nMEASURE PLACES REGULATIONS ON OREGON DEPT. OF REVENUE PRACTICES. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown has signed into law a bill that places restrictions on the state Department of Revenue\u2019s aggressive tax collection tactics against Oregon\u2019s underprivileged residents, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. The bill \u201cdirects the Revenue Department to suspend collection of unpaid state income taxes from seniors and other Oregonians getting by on Social Security and other income exempt from collections.\u201c The department has intensified\u00a0its collection practices in recent years. It collected $60.9 million in 2014 versus $32.2 million in 2010.
