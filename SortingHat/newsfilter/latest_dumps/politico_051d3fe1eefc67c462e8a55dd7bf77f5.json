Calls for a special counsel are purely political and completely unnecessary.\u201d\n\u201cI do not question the integrity or ability of Attorney General Lynch or FBI Director Comey \u2013 and certainly do not see any conflict or extraordinary circumstances that would warrant a Special Counsel,\u201d Leahy said in an emailed comment to POLITICO. \u201cSuch a suggestion is nothing more than yet another political ploy that would compound the growing pile of taxpayer dollars that already has been wasted on this politically motivated quest.\u201d \n Those remarks come just a day after Cornyn (R-Texas) wrote Lynch asking that she consider an outside investigator because Clinton is a former Obama Administration official and the frontrunner for the Democratic ticket for the White House. \nRepublicans have grown increasingly skeptical that Justice Department political appointees will allow the elevation of the FBI\u2019s probe of classified documents into a criminal matter if necessary, or to empanel a grand jury, due to the clout Clinton holds in Washington's Democratic circles.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON EMAILS\n\n            By \nRachael Bade\n\nOutside counsels have been used before to side step the appearance of a conflict-of-interest. But Justice has dismissed the GOP\u2019s calls for such prosecutors numerous times before\u2014 and few expect Lynch to make such a move, which would affectively take the entire issue out of the Justice Department\u2019s control.\nLeahy also noted that there\u2019s been \u201cno indication\u201d that the Clinton probe, currently more of a systematic review of how State documents were treated rather than a focus on her specifically, has been elevated to a criminal matter \u2014 so there\u2019s, therefore, no need for special counsel. \n In the hallway in recent weeks when asked about the Clinton scandal, the former Judiciary chairman grumbled about the cost of the House Select Committee on Benghazi. Feinstein likewise in her statement chastised the panel for \u201cattacks\u201d against Clinton, pointing out the previous congressional committees have already probed the matter and have not found any wrongdoing. The Benghazi committee, however, has actually not called for special prosecutor.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Sens.
