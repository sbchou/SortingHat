There was \u201cno smoking gun\u201d in the 3,000 pages of Hillary Clinton emails disgorged by the State Department on Tuesday night? There was \u201cno incriminating evidence,\u201d said the NYT. Since there wasn\u2019t an email in which the then-Secretary of State wrote, \u201cHey guys, make sure to fake the Benghazi riot so that we can get away with this,\u201d should we all just move on down the road?  In real life, we know that while there may not be prima facie \u201cincriminating evidence\u201d here, they are anything but exculpatory. What we see here is a woman running a government within the government \u2013 a semi-autonomous entity with not just private email system but also privately funded, secret minister without portfolio, speechwriter, intelligence bag man and political fixer, Sidney Blumenthal. Clinton called Blumenthal an \u201cold friend\u201d who passed along some tips \u201cunsolicited.\u201d  That simply is not the true according to these emails that show Blumenthal, deemed unacceptable for an administration post by the White House, carried on in a quasi-official but unaccountable capacity throughout her tenure. Making matters worse, Blumenthal was being paid by Clinton\u2019s family foundation, which we now know was taking unreported donations from foreign governments and entities with business before Clinton and her department.  What a debacle. And, in fact, one might even say that as far as gun smoke goes, there is a strong whiff of cordite around Clinton when it comes to her claims about Blumenthal.  And through it all is an effort to elevate her role in the administration but not her subservience. How much of her autonomy and secrecy were the result of her own aloofness or mistrust of President Obama and his team and how much was a result of Obama shunning Clinton and her team we will likely never know. But inside the emails we get examples small and large of the depth of the dysfunction. We see Clinton passing along an email from her former campaign strategist lambasting one of the president\u2019s speeches on Afghanistan and suggesting she ramp up her role; Clinton eyeing an email from Blumenthal touting Obama\u2019s crumbing poll numbers in Ohio.  Most telling, perhaps, is that the senior White House adviser and even the chief of staff had to go ask for Clinton\u2019s email address many months after the administration had begun. Not only does this weaken White House claims of ignorance about Clinton\u2019s secret, unsecure server but also shows how fraught the relationship was between the two camps. The chief of staff, the captain of the cabinet, asking permission to email a cabinet secretary? Woof.  The picture that comes into focus is of a woman who did not join a team of rivals, but persisted in an exile partly by the sentence of the president and partly of her own making. A remarkable moment comes when Clinton, obviously peeved, tells her staff that she has been called to the White House a second time for a meeting that was cancelled. Another time she hears of a cabinet meeting on the radio (!) and writes to her team to ask if it is so and if she can go.  People have compared the Clintons many times to the ruthlessly effective Underwoods of \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d In this batch of emails we see a figure much more like the lead character of another show: Selina Myer of \u201cVeep.\u201d  [\u201cIn thinking about the Kissinger interview, the only issue I think that might be raised is that I see POTUS at least once a week while K saw Nixon every day\u2026\u201d \u2013 Hillary Clinton in an email to her staff.]  Clinton, Inc. gets D\u2019Souza treatment - Filmmaker Dinesh D\u2019Souza, the man behind the film \u201c2016: Obama\u2019s America\u201d is now turning his energies toward the Clintons in a new film, \u201cClinton, Inc. the Movie.\u201d The Clinton film will be based on Daniel Halper\u2019s book \u201cClinton Inc.: The Audacious Rebuilding of a Political Machine.\u201d D\u2019Souza is also the man behind the film \u201cAmerica: Imagine the World Without Her,\u201d which grossed the most of any documentary in 2014 at $14.4 million. D\u2019Souza is serving a five-year probation after being pleading guilty to making illegal political contributions to a 2012 U.S. Senate campaign.  WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026 The New Yorker tells the story of Koji Kondo, a Japanese prog-rock fan and composer who heard the sound of possibility in early video games. He went to work at Nintendo in 1984, with the goal of enriching the gamer\u2019s experience. Rather than just \u201chailing\u201d players, he wanted the music to be in tune with what the player is feeling at various points of play: tension, struggle, triumph, etc. And rather than arcade-style music designed to attract attention, Kondo sought to compose scores the deepened and enriched the experience for the new home-console market. The results were revolutionary. New Yorker: \u201cFocussing on Kondo\u2019s much-loved score for Super Mario Bros. \u2013 and offering a brief detour through his Deep Purplish soundtrack for The Legend of Zelda \u2013 [author Andrew Schartmann] brings readers into a world of visionary musicians producing beloved masterpieces in almost total obscurity. Could it be that the largely unknown Kondo, Nintendo\u2019s first dedicated sound designer, was one of the great innovative forces of our time?\u201d  Got a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT? Email\u00a0FoxNewsFirst@FOXNEWS.COM  POLL CHECK Real Clear Politics Averages Obama Job Approval: Approve \u2013 46.4 percent//Disapprove \u2013 49.8 Directions of Country: Right Direction \u2013 28.6 percent//Wrong Track \u2013 62.4 percent  WALKER STAYS ATOP A REMADE IOWA RACE Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker maintained his 8-point lead from May in the Quinnipiac University poll of Iowa Republican caucus goers out this morning. While Walker lost 3 points to fall to 18 percent, it was against a dramatically altered field. The biggest change was the arrival of real-estate developer and pageant organizer Donald Trump who debuted at 10 percent in his first inclusion in the poll. Trump is tied with retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who recovered from a springtime stumble with a 3-pouint gain. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush also returned to a happier place to climb 3 points back to 8 percent. The other winners were businesswoman Carly Fiorina, who bumped up a point to 3 percent, and the Ricks (Perry and Santorum) who both climbed back to 4 percent.  On the other side of the ledger, the biggest losers were Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Rubio saw his support nearly halved from May, finishing at 7 percent. Huckabee, a longtime Iowa favorite, had been holding steady in the top tier with 11 percent since February but skidded to 5 percent and eighth place. It appears that he, like Sens. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, suffered more than most from the arrival of Trump and perhaps the revival of Carson. Cruz and Paul were tied at 9 percent each, falling 3 points and 4 points respectively. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie slipped to 1 percent in a tie for second-to-last with South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. Former New York Gov. George Pataki showed no discernable support in his initial appearance in the poll.  POWER PLAY: JEB GOES DEEP Jeb Bush released a whopping 33 years of tax returns. What\u2019s the strategy behind the move and what message is the Republican frontrunner sending? Chris Stirewalt has the lowdown, in 60 seconds. WATCH HERE.  Jeb earns less, pays higher tax rate tax than Clintons \u2013 AP: \u201c[Jeb Bush] released three decades of federal tax returns on Tuesday that show he\u2019s generated a vast fortune since leaving the Florida governor's mansion. But they also show that Hillary Rodham Clinton and former President Bill Clinton made more in speaking fees and book royalties alone in the past year and a half than Bush and his wife earned overall in the first seven years after he left public office\u2026[Bush\u2019s returns] show he paid an effective federal income tax rate of roughly 36 percent in the past three decades and made roughly $27.7 million in total income between 2007 and 2013. By comparison, the Clintons\u2019 earnings exceeded $30 million combined in speaking fees and book royalties between January 2014 and May 2015, according to a personal financial disclosure Clinton filed earlier this year. In that time, the Clintons paid a tax rate of more than 30 percent.\u201d  Rubio blasts Obama on Cuba relations - Calling President Obama\u2019s announcement today restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba a \u201cprized concession\u201d to the Castro regime, Sen. Marco Rubio asks: What is the U.S. getting in return? \u201cIt remains unclear what, if anything, has been achieved\u2026in terms of securing the return of U.S. fugitives being harbored in Cuba, settling outstanding legal claims to U.S. citizens for properties confiscated by the regime, and in obtaining the unequivocal right of our diplomats to travel freely throughout Cuba and meet with any dissidents, and most importantly, securing greater political freedoms for the Cuban people. I intend to oppose the\u00a0confirmation\u00a0of an Ambassador to Cuba until these issues are addressed,\u201d Rubio said in a statement.  Kelly File: Cruz defends court sacking -\u201cThe framers wrote about judicial overreach quite a bit. They believed the check would be impeachments.\u00a0 Now, here is the sad reality.\u00a0Within a few decades, Thomas Jefferson said, impeachment had been not even a scarecrow. \u00a0Even 200 years ago, the Supreme Court wasn't afraid of it.\u00a0Today, we have a United States Senate.\u00a0 We can't even muster 50 votes to defeat Loretta Lynch, an attorney general who tells us she is not going to follow the law or the constitution.\u00a0 There is no universe in which there are 67 votes to remove Anthony Kennedy from the Supreme Court.\u201d \u2013 Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d  [Ted Cruz kicks off his book tour with a pair of stops in the Houston area.]  Christie\u2019s Maine man - Asbury Park Press: \u00a0\u201cGov. Chris Christie interrupts his New Hampshire campaign swing with a side trip to [Portland] Maine this morning, where it appears he may pick up an endorsement for his 2016 bid. [H]e\u2019ll take part in a \u2018special announcement event\u2019 at Becky's Diner at 10 a.m. Christie made a campaign stop at that diner with Maine Gov. Paul LePage in May 2014, one of Christie\u2019s five visits to Maine as Republican Governors Association chairman to help LePage win re-election. The RGA also spent $5 million on the race. The special announcement could be an endorsement by the bombastic LePage. Christie told a Maine television station, in New Hampshire on Tuesday night, that he'd be meeting with LePage today.  [After his side trip to Maine, Christie picks up the pace in New Hampshire with a house party in Bristol and a town hall meeting in Ashland. He\u2019ll remain in the Granite State through Saturday.]  More endorsements for Carly - Union Leader: \u201cRepublican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina on Tuesday announced 20 additional endorsements and members of her leadership committee in New Hampshire.\u201d  Carson hits debt, immigration in N.C. - Asheville (N.C.) Citizen-Times: \u201cThe economic collapse that will eventually result from the national debt if action isn\u2019t taken will make the stock market crash that set off the Great Depression \u2018look like a cakewalk,\u2019 Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson said [Tuesday]\u2026. Carson told the crowd of more than 800 [in Fletcher, N.C.] that the United States should end immigration, reduce government regulation and go to a 10 percent tax rate based on the biblical tithe with no deductions or loopholes. And he told the crowd not to succumb to political correctness \u2018because that's how (progressives) control you.\u2019\u201d  Wielding veto pen, Kasich signs Buckeye budget - Cleveland Plain Dealer: \u201cGov. John Kasich signed a $130.3 billion budget bill Tuesday that will govern Ohio's spending the next two years, but not before using his line-item veto to eliminate 44 provisions\u2026.The GOP-authored budget -- supported by just one Democrat, Rep. Martin Sweeney of Cleveland --\u00a0provides a 6.3-percent, across-the-board state income tax cut as well as tax deductions for business owners. That reduces Ohio's income-tax rate from 5.33 percent to 4.99 percent for residents making more than $200,000 per year \u2014 a top rate not seen since 1982, according to lawmakers.\u201d  Santorum gets PAC boost - A new super PAC, \u201cWorking Again PAC\u201d backing Rick Santorum is up and running today. \u00a0The group is run by Nadine Maenza, Santorum\u2019s chief fundraiser for his 2012 campaign. \u201cRick Santorum, who won 11 states and 4 million votes in 2012, is the only candidate in the race for the White House with an understanding of the challenges working Americans face.\u201d Maenza said in a release announcing the PAC\u2019s formation.

REALLY NATURAL CHILDBIRTH Amber Pangborn, a pregnant mom from Oroville, Calif. went to visit a friend at a casino but ended up finding good luck elsewhere. She apparently decided to take a shortcut home through a nearby national forest. Oops. Pangborn\u2019s mother told the LAT that her daughter, a mother of three already, said she made a wrong turn, ran out of gas in a remote spot without cell service and promptly went into labor. Pangborn, who was nine months along, said she delivered her daughter on her own. But having made it through that ordeal, her trial was just beginning. Pangborn said she was chased by a swarm of bees, and got multiple stings while shielding her child. Then, in an attempt to summon help, she started a fire, which quickly grew out of control in the drought-wracked forest. Pangborn fled the fire she set and met firefighters rushing to fight the blaze. Mom and baby are doing well and the paper walked away with an early frontrunner for headline of the year: \u201cWoman gives birth, fights off bees, starts wildfire in Northern California.\u201d  Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
