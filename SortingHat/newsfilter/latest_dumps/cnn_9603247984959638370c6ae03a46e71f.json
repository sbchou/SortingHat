{"body": " (CNN)A sixth video targeting Planned Parenthood was released Wednesday featuring a former employee of a company that provides tissue to biomedical researchers.\nThe Center for Medical Progress, an anti-abortion group, released a video featuring Holly O'Donnell discussing her role in gathering blood and tissue from Planned Parenthood clinics. The group has released multiple edited and unedited videos accusing the abortion provider of breaking federal laws by profiting off the selling of organs and tissues of aborted fetuses. \nPlanned Parenthood denies that it has broken any laws and has repeatedly dismissed the Center for Medical Progress as extremist. \n\"The video released today shows someone who has never worked for Planned Parenthood making false and outrageous claims, without any evidence to back them up,\" said Eric Ferrero, Vice President of Communication, Planned Parenthood Federation of America in a statement out Wednesday. \"Planned Parenthood follows all laws -- period. This latest video is part of a fraud intended to deceive the public and advance an extreme political agenda, and nothing on this video substantiates false claims from anti-abortion activists.\"\nIn the most recent video, O'Donnell is identified as an ex-procurement technician at StemExpress and said she worked with northern California Planned Parenthood locations. She describes herself as \"pro-life\" in the video. \nA Los Angeles Superior Court previously issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the Center for Medical Progress from releasing videos featuring leaders of StemExpress, a company that provides blood, tissue and other specimen to biomedical researchers.\nDavid Daleiden, head of the Center for Medical Progress, told CNN's New Day last month that StemExpress leaders are \"very scared\" that he will release the videos. \n\"Stem Express is trying to suppress a specific video recording of a meeting with their top leadership where their leadership admitted that they sometimes get fully intact fetuses shipped to their laboratory from the abortion clinics that they work with and that could be prima facie evidence of born-alive infants,\" he said. \nCNN reached out to StemExpress on Wednesday for comment on the video's release.\nFollowing that July interview Daleiden gave, StemExpress officials released a statement calling Daleiden's accusations false. \n\"We coordinate with clinics and hospitals to obtain human tissue and blood -- specimens that would be otherwise be disposed of -- and provide them to biotechnology and academic institutions performing research to find a cure,\" said Beau Phillips, spokesman for the group. \"The nation's and the world's greatest research facilities need a reliable source of healthy human-derived blood, tissue and cellular specimens to perform their studies.  As a point of clarification, StemExpress has never requested nor received an intact fetus.\"\nIn the most recent video, O'Donnell said Planned Parenthood is breaking the law by selling tissue and organs from aborted fetuses for research. Federal law requires women to know that they are donating their aborted fetuses to scientific research.\n\"If there was a higher gestation, and the technicians needed it, there were times when they would just take what they wanted. And these mothers don't know. And there's no way they would know,\" she said. \nO'Donnell also said the Planned Parenthood locations with which she worked performed late-term abortions, which has become an issue on the 2016 campaign trail with nearly all the GOP presidential hopefuls backing a national standard limiting abortion after 20 weeks.\nAbortion is legal in California until viability, which varies case by case. Some experts define viability as between 22 and 24 weeks while others have argued that fetuses can feel pain as early as 20 weeks.  \nDaleiden said O'Donnell's story is proof that the government needs to stop providing the more than $500 million in federal funding to Planned Parenthood.\n\"Taxpayer subsidies to Planned Parenthood's barbaric abortion business should be revoked immediately, and law enforcement and other elected officials must act decisively to determine the full extent of Planned Parenthood's offensive practices and hold them accountable to the law,\" he said in a statement.\nMultiple Republican candidates have called for the defunding of Planned Parenthood following the release of the videos. Republican candidate Rand Paul introduced a bill that he hoped would lead to the organization's defunding that did not pass. \nDeveloper Donald Trump has waffled on defunding Planned Parenthood arguing that the group provides other helpful services to women.\nWhile Democractic candidate Hillary Clinton has repeatedly defended the organization, she called the videos \"disturbing.\" Clinton has previously been honored by Planned Parenthood for her work protecting abortion rights. \n", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Planned Parenthood video targetted in sixth video", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/12/politics/planned-parenthood-stem-express-video/index.html", "topics": ["abortion"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Eric Ferrero", "David Daleiden", "Holly O'Donnell", "Hillary Clinton", "Donald Trump"], "orgs": ["Planned Parenthood", "GOP", "Center for Medical Progress"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30257, "fullname": "eugene scott", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-08-12 19:00:07", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "9603247984959638370c6ae03a46e71f", "date_access": "2015-08-12 18:30:17.403197"}
