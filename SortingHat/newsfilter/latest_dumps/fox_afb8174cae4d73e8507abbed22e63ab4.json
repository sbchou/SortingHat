But how will he fare in his fresh feuds with fellow outsiders Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina?  A week ago Trump said he hoped Carson would \u201chit\u201d him, because Trump \u201clove[s] to counterpunch.\u201d Does he ever.  Carson, who is gaining fast on frontrunner Trump in a new poll today, took a mild shot at what Trump\u2019s self-described \u201cbig league\u201d Christian faith.  Pressed by reporters during a campaign stop in Anaheim, Calif., to respond to Trump\u2019scriticisms that Carson isn\u2019t qualified to be president, the retired neurosurgeon initially declined.  But when asked to contrast himself with the New York billionaire, Carson responded, \u201c\u2026I realize where my success has come from, and I don\u2019t any way deny my faith in God,\u201d said Carson. Carson went on to cite favorite scriptures that \u201chumility and fear of the Lord are riches in honor and life,\u201d saying that he didn\u2019t get \u201cthat impression with\u201d Trump.  That was a swipe at Trump who bragged that he likely hadn\u2019t ever felt the need to ask God\u2019s forgiveness.  On CNN today, Trump unloaded on Carson:  \u201cLook at his faith and you\u2019re not going to find so much. And you look at his views on abortion which were horrendous, and that\u2019s I think why I\u2019m leading with all the evangelicals. I\u2019m leading Ben Carson by a lot I\u2019m almost double his numbers.\u201d  \u201cBut I don\u2019t know Ben Carson, perhaps \u2013 you know \u2013 an okay doctor\u2026we\u2019re not talking about a great \u2013 he was an okay doctor.\u201d  \u201cAnd now, because he\u2019s a doctor and he hired one nurse, he\u2019s going to end up being president of the United States?\u201d  \u201cFor him to read from the Bible in his memory, it looked like it memorized it about two minutes before he went on stage.\u201d  But Carson isn\u2019t the only target of Trump\u2019s wrath.  Businesswoman Carly Fiorina, who also gained ground on Trump in CNN\u2019s poll out today, got a dose too.\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone Trump mocked Fiorina\u2019s appearance: \u201c\u2018Look\u00a0at that face!\u2019 he cries. \u2018Would anyone\u00a0vote\u00a0for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next\u00a0president?!\u2019 The laughter grows halting and faint behind him. \u2018I mean, she\u2019s a woman, and I\u2019m not s\u2019posedta say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we\u00a0serious?\u2019\u201d  Fiorina declined to respond in kind during an interview on \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d saying instead, \u201cI\u2019m not going to spend a single cycle wondering what Donald Trump means. But maybe just maybe I\u2019m getting under his skin a little bit because I\u2019m climbing in the polls.\u201d  In a phone call to \u201cFox & Friends\u201d today, Trump claimed he was not referring to her appearance but instead, \u201cabout persona.\u201d But as Trump\u2019s own comments to Rolling Stone make clear any disparagement of women\u2019s appearances is a fraught subject for the GOP frontrunner.  Trump did not, however, shy away from continuing to attack Fiorina\u2019s record as a businesswoman and her qualifications to be president.  Given the strong favorable views of Republicans voters towards Fiorina and Carson, Trump\u2019s attack-dog approach with his fellow outsiders looks to be a much riskier gambit than his ceaseless trolling of the beleaguered Bush.  WALKER JOINS FALL FASHION TREND WITH RE-BOOT AP: \u201cRepublican Scott\u00a0Walker\u00a0plans to talk about \u2018wreaking havoc\u2019 on Washington D.C. with a Thursday speech at the alma mater of former President Ronald Reagan. Walker's\u00a0presidential campaign on Tuesday released excerpts of his speech to be delivered at\u00a0Eureka\u00a0College in Illinois. Walker\u00a0is also expected to release weekly \u2018day one\u2019 promises that describe action he would plan to take on his first day as president.\u00a0Walker\u00a0has already said he will end the Iranian arms deal and propose repealing and replacing the federal health care law on his first day in office. The speech and weekly release of \u2018day one\u2019 promises comes as\u00a0Walker\u00a0is trying to regain ground after being among the top tier of Republican candidates, only to see his standing drop in recent polls.\u201d  [The Atlantic\u2019s Molly Ball goes back to where it all began to look for Walker\u2019s path forward: \u201cFor the past four years, Walker has dominated Wisconsin. His bold agenda shattered the status quo, he shocked the left and united the right, and he couldn\u2019t be beat. Recalled in 2012, challenged in 2014, he kept on fighting and kept on winning. \u2026 For Wisconsinites accustomed to Walker\u2019s dominance, his fall from glory nationally has been disorienting and out of character. Back home, he has always been focused, disciplined, on-message to a fault.\u201d]  Jeb gets a little Trump-y in tax plan - NYT: \u201cFormer Gov.\u00a0Jeb Bush\u00a0of Florida challenged some long-held tenets of conservative tax policy on Wednesday by proposing to curtail valuable deductions that benefit businesses and the wealthy and eliminate a loophole that has benefited hedge fund and private equity managers for years. That an establishment Republican candidate has embraced such changes not only highlights how income inequality has altered the tenor of the presidential debate for the party, but also indicates the ideological pull Donald J. Trump\u2019s candidacy is having on the Republican field after he made\u00a0similar proposals.\u201d  [Bush will talk about his tax policy and\u00a0hold\u00a0a town hall in New Hampshire today.]  Koch group applauds - Conservative group Freedom Partners praised the GOP candidates who have come out with detailed tax reform plans. President Marc Short said in a statement, \u201cWe applaud Governor Jeb Bush, as well as Senators Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, for providing detailed plans to lower rates, reduce corporate welfare and simplify the tax code.\u201d Freedom Partners supports reducing tax rates, and ending corporate loopholes.  FEDS FILLET CHRISTIE\u2019S REVIVAL USA Today: \u201cThe Bridgegate scandal, dormant for months, sprung back to life with a vengeance Tuesday \u2013 a day before the second anniversary of the bridge lane closures\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and his struggling presidential campaign. United Airlines announced that its chief executive officer had stepped down, a casualty of the airline and federal prosecutors\u2019 inquiries into the relationship between the company\u2019s executives and the former chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey\u2026 Two former Christie loyalists, Bill Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly, are scheduled to be tried in the fall on Bridgegate-related charges. David Wildstein, a former Port Authority official and high-school classmate of Christie, pleaded guilty in May... The fall of United\u2019s CEO is the latest sign that prosecutors may be building a case in their spinoff investigation of David Samson, the influential lawyer who chaired Christie\u2019s gubernatorial transition and later the Port Authority.\u201d  WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026 Of the many theories that exist about human evolution the latest find from explorers in South Africa proves to be the most revolutionary. National Geographic brings today\u2019s biggest science story of two recreational cave divers stumbling upon a new species of human ancestor called Homo naledi. Steven Tucker and Rick Hunter found a cave outside Johannesburg looking for a new adventure in an area known for fossil discoveries, and research. Although much of the area has been trodden over, Tucker and Hunter were hoping to find a new path or a less-explored area. In a narrow cave, barely big enough to fit them through, they found they would be far from disappointed, discovering what appeared to be a vast collection of human bones. But how did this cave collect so many bones? Is it possible that this species buried their dead in some way? Check out this deep read for an account of their findings here.

The Vermont U.S. senator is the favorite choice for president for 41 percent of Iowa likely Democratic caucusgoers, while 40 percent say former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is their current favorite choice, a Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday found. Another 12 percent pick Vice President Joseph Biden as their top choice for president in 2016. In Quinnipiac's last poll, in early July, Clinton had 52 percent, Sanders had 33 percent and Biden had 7 percent.\u201d  Pressure mounts for more Dem debates - The Hill: \u201cTwo Democratic National Committee officers are bucking party leaders and joining the growing chorus for more Democratic presidential debates. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and Minneapolis mayor R.T. Rybak, both of whom are DNC vice-chairs, wrote a joint Facebook post on Wednesday night urging the national party to add more debates and to drop the threat of exclusion for candidates that participate in unsanctioned debates.\u201d  TAKE FIVE: SENATE STAKES SPEEDING UP As Democrats look to pick up five seats in 2016 and Republicans look to shore up their majority, we\u2019re asking readers to jot down your picks of the top five GOP battlegrounds.

Dem puts out another doozy - Daily Caller: \u201cDemocratic Florida Rep. Patrick Murphy, who is running for U.S. Senate to replace\u00a0Marco Rubio, has had a rough couple of weeks. First,\u00a0he channeled\u00a0Neville Chamberlain\u2019s\u00a0infamous \u2018peace in our time\u2019 rhetoric when he endorsed the Iran deal. And now, in a local interview that aired on Sunday, he declared that \u2018America has topped the world, in many ways, [in] greed and selfish behavior.\u2019\u201d  Stage call - The Hill: \u201cRepublicans have targeted Sen. Michael Bennet (Colo.) as the party\u2019s best chance at toppling a Democratic incumbent. And Democrats see Sen. Richard Burr\u2019s (N.C.) seat as prime for the taking.

THE JUDGE\u2019S RULING: TWO WRONGS DON\u2019T MAKE A RIGHT Though he believes that the decision to incarcerate Kentucky court clerk Kim Davis wasn\u2019t the right course of action, Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano says Davis\u2019s argument in\u00a0refusing\u00a0to\u00a0issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples because of her religious convictions is flawed:\u00a0\u201cThe Free Exercise Clause guarantees individuals the lawful ability to practice their religion free from government interference. It does not permit those in government to use their offices to deny the rights of those who reject their beliefs. That is the lesson for Kim Davis.\u201d Read here.  HIS BEN & JERRY\u2019S FLAVOR: ROCKY ROAD RAGE WCAX: \u201cVermont state police say a man caught going more than 100 mph in Royalton was on his way to court to take care of a speeding ticket. Investigators say they received several reports Wednesday afternoon of a car going over 100 mph and weaving in and out of traffic on Interstate 89 northbound. Troopers say they clocked Seth Tichenor, 33, of West Hartford, going 112 mph in a 65 mph zone. He was arrested for excessive speed and negligent operation. Police say Tichenor told them he was headed to traffic court to take care of a speeding ticket.\u201d  AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026 \u201cPeople are upset about [Hillary Clinton\u2019s] server and secret email and all that, yes.\u00a0 But the most upsetting thing \u2013 and I think the real danger \u2013 is the corruption in the foundation.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s what needs to be asked: \u2018Did you as a criterion for erasing stuff on the grounds that it is not public, was one of those criteria references to the foundation?\u2019\u00a0 And if her answer is yes \u2013 who knows what it will be? \u2013 but if the answer is yes, that\u2019s what she is trying to hide.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier.\u201d  Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
