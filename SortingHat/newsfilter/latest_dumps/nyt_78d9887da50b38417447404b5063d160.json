{"body": "Former President Bill Clinton has made millions of dollars giving paid speeches since he left office, but he said on Wednesday that if his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, won the White House, he would no longer take money for talking.\n\nSpeaking at the Clinton Global Initiative America meeting in Denver, Mr. Clinton said that continuing his paid speaking engagements would attract too much attention, but that he still planned to talk to groups about subjects that mattered to him.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Mr. Clinton said in an interview with Bloomberg\u2019s Betty Liu,  when asked about whether he would continue the practice. \u201cBecause once you get to be president, then you\u2019re just making a daily story. I will still give speeches, though, on the subjects I\u2019m interested in, and I\u2019ve really enjoy those things.\u201d\n\nMr. Clinton charges as much as $500,000 per speech and said last month that he would continue to give them while Mrs. Clinton runs for president because he needed to \u201cpay our bills.\u201d \n\nFinancial disclosures released in May revealed that the Clintons earned $30 million in the last 16 months, largely from speeches made to corporations. \n\nThe Clintons have been under fire in recent months over foreign donations to their family foundation, and the former president again defended its work on Wednesday. \n\n\u201cHas anybody proved that we did anything objectionable?\u201d Mr. Clinton asked. \u201cNo. Have we done a lot of good things with this money? Yes.\u201d  ", "byline": "ALAN RAPPEPORT", "description": "Former President Bill Clinton said that if his wife won the White House, he would no longer give paid speeches.", "title": "First Draft: Bill Clinton Says He Will Stop Giving Paid Speeches if Hillary Wins", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/06/10/bill-clinton-says-he-will-stop-giving-paid-speeches-if-hillary-wins/", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "immigration", "economy"], "people": ["Bill Clinton", "Hillary Rodham Clinton"], "orgs": ["Clinton Global Initiative America"], "authors": [{"author_id": 8381, "fullname": "alan rappeport", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-06-10 23:20:27", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "78d9887da50b38417447404b5063d160", "date_access": "2015-06-10 22:36:28.654324"}
