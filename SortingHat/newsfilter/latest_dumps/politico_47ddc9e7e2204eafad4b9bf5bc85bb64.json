Nikki Haley, Sen. Lindsey Graham and the state\u2019s new Republican Party, the wrenching debate provided an opportunity, both politically and economically.\nAlso on POLITICO\nDANIEL STRAUSS\n\u201cOn the face, it might seem like a really difficult decision,\u201d said one local Republican operative involved in meetings over the past several days with the governor who asked for anonymity to speak openly. \u201cBut, really, it was pretty easy. South Carolina has changed a lot in the last five years. It took some of the old guard Republicans dying, frankly, for this new generation of conservative leaders to come in and remake the party.\u201d\nHaley, an Indian-American just starting her second term, and Tim Scott, the first African-American Republican senator from a Southern state since the 1880s who she appointed in 2013, have emerged as the faces of South Carolina\u2019s new Republican Party.\nWhile they point to their electoral success as evidence of a changing state, they\u2019ve still been torn between competing interests \u2014 party stalwarts who cling to the Confederate flag as an important symbol of their heritage and pro-business critics who say the flag\u2019s shadow is holding the state back.\nThose critics have argued that the new South Carolina, where Boeing decided in 2009 to locate a new assembly line for the 787 Dreamliner that created some 4,000 new jobs, could grow at a faster pace if they could find a way to remove the flag from the Statehouse.\n\u201cWe were missing out on some great opportunities to showcase our state,\u201d said Glenn McCall, an RNC committeeman who stood with Haley on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost some NCAA tournaments, some big companies looking to relocate because of that flag.\u201d\nHaley, who has in the past acknowledged the flag\u2019s presence as a \u201csensitive issue,\u201d began informing people Friday of her plan to call for its removal. She took much of the weekend to coordinate Monday\u2019s announcement so that members of the state\u2019s congressional delegation could attend. Her carefully written speech, recognizing that the flag means different things to different people, elevated her as a potential vice presidential nominee in some people\u2019s eyes and offered political cover to the Republicans running to lead the GOP ticket.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to move the flag from the Capitol grounds,\u201d Haley said. \u201cThat flag, while an integral part of our past, does not represent the future of our great state.\u201d\nAlso on POLITICO\nADAM B. LERNER\nHaley was also in touch over the weekend with Graham, who was receiving criticism for telling CNN on Friday that the flag marks \u201cpart of who we are,\u201d even as he said he\u2019d be open to a renewed debate on the issue.\nThere was a sense among South Carolina Republican leaders, including Graham, that they couldn\u2019t come out too forcefully against the flag until they were certain there would be enough support across the state to follow through. A source familiar with Graham\u2019s thinking noted that in addition to the sensitivities around the families of those killed, there were economic considerations in play.\n\u201cIf the senior senator rushed out right in front of the cameras, and the flag had not come down, you just handed the competing states a huge weapon to use against you,\u201d said the source, noting that other states would try to attract business based on the state failing to follow through on a moral call from a senior leader. \u201cFailure is not an option.\u201d\nSince Thursday night, the source said, Graham had been working the phones, talking with business leaders, state and federal legislators and other stakeholders to take their temperature on the issue, and was in frequent consultation with Haley and Scott.\nOn Sunday afternoon, Haley\u2019s staffers called Graham\u2019s team and invited him to come to Columbia for a meeting early Monday afternoon with other stakeholders and legislators, including Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and South Carolina GOP Chairman Matt Moore.\nBy Sunday, the source said, the direction in which the issue was trending was fairly clear \u2014 it was more a question of how the announcement would be rolled out.\nA source close to Priebus, who appeared at Haley\u2019s announcement, said his decision to fly down to South Carolina was made Monday morning after Haley invited him.\nAs Haley and state leaders wrestled with the decision over the weekend, Republican presidential hopefuls struggled with their messaging.\nJohn McCain has expressed regret in hindsight over his own statements during his 2000 campaign that the Confederate flag was a state issue. | AP Photo\nUntil her announcement Monday, candidates not-so-artfully dodged the question of whether South Carolina should continue to fly the Confederate flag near its state Capitol, noting that it\u2019s a state issue.\nEven those like Jeb Bush, who reminded voters that he opted to remove the same flag from Florida\u2019s Statehouse when he was governor, expressed confidence that South Carolina \u201cwill do the right thing,\u201d but stopped just short of saying what that might be.\nAs soon as Haley finished her news conference Monday, Bush tweeted his \u201cKudos\u201d to her and the bipartisan group of South Carolina leaders standing behind her for \u201cdoing the right thing.\u201d\nOn Saturday evening, after an appearance at a Washington gathering held by the conservative Faith and Freedom Coalition, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker wasn\u2019t yet ready to say whether he thought the Confederate flag was a symbol of racism, saying he had been asked by \u201ca number of people\u201d to hold off on expressing his views. Asked who made that request, Walker replied that he\u2019d spoken with Haley, and suggested she was preparing to take action.\n\u201cWell, she talked about, that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to do, and we think that\u2019s a respectful decision and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to start to have a debate after that,\u201d he told reporters, noting that it was a state issue and saying he would be open to weighing in \u201cwhenever they\u2019re done with all their funerals and the dead have been buried and I think it\u2019s an appropriate time after that.\u201d\nOn Monday, like Bush, Walker tweeted his support, writing \u201cI am glad @nikkihaley is calling for the Confederate flag to come down. I support her decision.\u201d\nBush and Walker weren\u2019t the only ones dragging their feet, and not just on the issue of the flag.\nIn the first 48 hours following the shooting, Republicans were slow to call it a \u201chate crime,\u201d despite ample evidence of the alleged shooter\u2019s white supremacist predilections, preferring to frame the shooting as an attack on people of faith. Only when pressed by reporters did most of them acknowledge the widely recognized motivation for the killings.\nOn the question of the flag, they waited, perhaps smartly, for leaders in South Carolina to take the lead, knowing many people there were more likely to be offended by outsiders telling them what to do than by the flag\u2019s eventual removal.\n\u201cThe one thing Southerners don\u2019t take kindly to is people from the North telling them what they should do,\u201d said Rick Wilson, a Florida-based GOP strategist who\u2019s advised a number of presidential campaigns.\nAlso on POLITICO\nNICK GASS\nWhile the current candidates were reluctant to run afoul of white voters in the state that holds the first-in-the-South primary next February \u2014 the most important state in what has been the most important region for the Republican Party for more than 40 years now \u2014 the last GOP nominee didn\u2019t hold back.\n\u201cTake down the #ConfederateFlag at the SC Capitol,\u201d Mitt Romney tweeted on Saturday. \u201cTo many, it is a symbol of racial hatred.\u201d\nDavid Gergen, an adviser to four presidents, asked Sunday night why the current crop of presidential hopefuls wasn\u2019t joining Romney. \u201cWhere is their moral courage?\u201d he tweeted.\nMoral courage, it turns out, is easier to come by when you\u2019re a former presidential candidate. Sen. John McCain has expressed regret in hindsight over his own statements during his 2000 campaign that the Confederate flag was a state issue, later telling various audiences that his decision to put political self-interest above his own convictions remains one of his \u201cdeepest regrets.\u201d\nFifteen years after McCain\u2019s first foray into South Carolina, Republicans seemed to still be prioritizing their base over the wider imperative of broadening the party\u2019s appeal beyond it \u2014 until Haley\u2019s call Monday for change.\n\u201cGovernor Haley and our political leaders here were very courageous to take this position,\u201d said Moore, the South Carolina GOP chairman. \u201cWe can\u2019t change our past, but we can heal our future.\"\n\nBy CASEY MICHEL\nBy JOSH ZEITZ\nBy VANESSA VITIELLO URQUHART\nBy PETER SUDERMAN\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "For lawmakers the wrenching debate provided an opportunity, both politically and economically.", "title": "Inside the Republican reversal on the Confederate flag", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/republican-confederate-flag-reversal-119309.html", "topics": ["personality", "economy"], "people": ["Mitt Romney", "Tim Scott", "Lindsey Graham", "Jeb Bush", "Nikki Haley", "Reince Priebus", "David Gergen", "Matt Moore", "Eli Stokols", "Rick Wilson", "Scott Walker", "Katie Glueck"], "orgs": ["Faith and Freedom Coalition", "RNC", "Republican Party", "Statehouse", "Committee", "GOP", "SC Capitol"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30851, "fullname": "katie glueck", "primary_org": "politico"}, {"author_id": 30850, "fullname": "eli stokols", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-06-23 01:22:36", "org": "politico", "article_id": "47ddc9e7e2204eafad4b9bf5bc85bb64", "date_access": "2015-06-23 17:13:42.001246"}
