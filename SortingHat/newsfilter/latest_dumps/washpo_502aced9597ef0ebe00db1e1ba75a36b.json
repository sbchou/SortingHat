{"body": "   Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker announces to supporters and news media gathered at the Waukesha County Expo Center that he will seek the Republican nomination for president on July 13, 2015 in Waukesha, Wisconsin.(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)  Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) said Tuesday that the\u00a0Boy Scouts of America should keep its\u00a0blanket ban on openly gay leaders because the policy \"protected children and advanced Scout values.\u201d The Boy Scouts' executive committee voted\u00a0unanimously on Friday to drop the ban and the issue now moves to a national executive board that will meet\u00a0later this month. The proposed change stops short of requiring that\u00a0all Scout groups allow gay leaders. [Boy Scouts executive committee endorses ending ban on gay leaders] Walker, who launched his presidential campaign on Monday, is an\u00a0Eagle Scout who has long been\u00a0active\u00a0with the organization.\u00a0His two sons, now in their 20s, were involved in scouting and his wife served as a den mother. \u00a0 \u201cI have had a lifelong commitment to the Scouts and support the previous membership policy because it protected children and advanced Scout values,\" Walker\u00a0told the Independent Journal Review, a popular news site with a young conservative following that published his comments on Tuesday afternoon. When asked about this comment following a campaign event at a Harley-Davidson dealership in Las Vegas on Tuesday afternoon, Walker said: \"I\u2019m an Eagle Scout. My kids were in Scouts. My mom was a den mother. I think their previous policy was personally fine.\" Walker's comments quickly drew criticism from gay rights activists -- and again raised questions about how he would treat the gay community if elected president. The Human Rights Campaign, a leading LGBT rights organization, called for Walker to\u00a0renounce his statement and apologize. The group also asked other presidential candidates to take a position on the issue. [Five things you might not know about Scott Walker] \u201cScott Walker's suggestion that the Boy Scouts of America's current discriminatory policy somehow 'protects' children from gay adults is offensive, outrageous, and absolutely unacceptable,\" said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign in a statement. \"His comments imply that we represent a threat to the safety and well-being of young people.\" Walker\u00a0has already faced criticism from some in his party for his staunch opposition to\u00a0gay marriage. Some\u00a0wealthy donors in New York who worry\u00a0the Republican\u00a0has gone too far to the right in his opposition, especially when Walker called the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision allowing gay marriage in all 50 states a \"grave mistake.\" The governor called for a constitutional amendment that would allow states to decide if they want to allow gay marriage or not. Walker's two college-aged sons, Matt and Alex Walker, have said they don't agree with their father's stance on gay marriage.\u00a0One of their mother's cousins, who is close to the family, has\u00a0been with her partner for 18 years. The\u00a0couple, Shelli Marquardt and Cathy Priem, married last year. Alex Walker was the best man, and Walker has said he attended the reception. \"We love our family. We love our cousin. We stand by that,\" Alex Walker said in an interview with CNN that aired on Sunday.\u00a0The two Walker sons said in that interview that they have debated gay marriage with their father but have not tried to change his position.
