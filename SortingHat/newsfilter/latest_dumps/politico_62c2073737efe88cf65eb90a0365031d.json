Confidants of Vice President Joe Biden expect him to make a decision next weekend, or shortly thereafter, on whether to launch an epic battle with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination. \nSeveral people who have visited Biden recently said he seems to be leaning \u201cyes.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cNothing he has heard in the past couple of months has deterred him,\u201d said one Democrat close to the process. \nA former Senate colleague of Biden\u2019s said, after visiting the vice president, \u201cHe loves what he does, and he has a great deal of confidence that he could contribute in a meaningful way. He\u2019s willing to face, ultimately, having his final political expedition be a defeat.\u201d\nIt\u2019s just that possibility that has some friends telling POLITICO that they hope he\u2019ll ultimately decide to take a pass.\nOne person who\u2019s in the \u201cbearish\u201d camp said he thinks that testing the waters has been its own therapy after Biden\u2019s loss of his son. The vice president has been showered with love and attention, and should declare victory and avoid a likely political debacle. \nOne longtime friend said the long windup \u2014 and the fact that no staff has been hired \u2014 tells its own story.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to run, you run,\u201d the friend said. \u201cEvery time he pushes back a decision, that\u2019s the ultimate tell.\u201d\nA third recent Biden visitor said: \u201cI can\u2019t see how he can wake up one morning and think some big tidal wave sweeps him in. The raw politics just aren\u2019t there.\u201d\nAfter describing their hunches, friends and advisers almost universally added that they remain unsure which way he\u2019ll go. \n\u201cThat\u2019s Joe Biden,\u201d one of them said. \u201cHe could talk to someone on a rope line tomorrow, and decide to do it. His emotional state just increases his unpredictability.\u201d\nThe confidants say the most likely scenario for a decision is a family council next weekend. But these sources note that the timing will be driven completely by Biden, and he has proved to be ever-unpredictable as he contemplated a race. \nUnder that scenario, Biden would begin calling friends with his decision next Monday, the day before the first Democratic debate on Oct. 13, which he had already decided to forgo. If the decision is a \u201cgo,\u201d the announcement could be delayed as advisers begin assembling a campaign.\nMike Allen is chief White House correspondent for\u00a0POLITICO.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Exclusive: Biden eyes weekend decision", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/joe-biden-possible-2016-announcement-214423", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Kelly Ayotte", "Burgess Everett", "Manuel Noriega", "Rachael Bade", "Doug Palmer", "Anna Palmer", "Emile Simpson", "Natasha Korecki", "Marc Caputo", "Ronald Reagan", "Steven Shepard", "Mandy Grunwald", "Carolyn Maloney", "Joe Biden", "Harry Reid", "Kimberly Hefling", "Josh Gerstein", "Annie Karni", "J.
