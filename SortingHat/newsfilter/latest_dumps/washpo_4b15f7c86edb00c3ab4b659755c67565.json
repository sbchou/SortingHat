{"body": "  CEDAR FALLS, Iowa \u2014 These days, Hillary Rodham Clinton and her senior campaign staff sound like old-school investment advisers when the market has a stomach-lurching drop: Remain calm, they say. Don\u2019t panic. And stick to the plan. Faced with her worst poll ratings since she was losing badly to Barack Obama in 2008, Clinton is doubling down on a strategy laid out months ago. As drawn up by campaign manager Robby Mook and others when Clinton was seemingly invincible, the prospectus is a detailed month-by-month, state-by-state strategy to roll out serious policy proposals, raise a prohibitive amount of money, lock up Democratic delegates and woo members of her party\u2019s disaffected left. It was designed to win what had been presumed to be a somewhat dull primary without looking too presumptuous. Now Clinton has a full-on fight on her hands against a surging Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and faces the possibility that Vice President Biden will make a late entrance. Biden sits at roughly 20\u00a0percent in recent polls, and most of that support appears to come from erstwhile Clinton voters. \u201cYou are supposed to have an election. You are supposed to have a contest,\u201d Clinton said here this week during a question-and-answer session with students and others at the University of Northern Iowa. \u201cIn the Democratic primaries and caucuses, you have to try to earn every single person\u2019s support. That is what I intend to do.\u201d Clinton\u2019s tumble in national surveys, including in a new Washington Post-ABC News poll, owes partly to fallout from the fracas surrounding her State Department e-mails and partly to an anti-establishment sentiment fueling Sanders\u2019s rise. More than 7 in 10 Americans say people in politics cannot be trusted. More than 6 in 10 say the political system does not work.

(Scott Morgan/AP)  Clinton still leads among Democrats nationally, but for the first time her support has dropped below 50\u00a0percent in Post-ABC surveys. The biggest decline was among white women, a mainstay of Clinton\u2019s bid to become the first female U.S. president.  [Poll: Clinton\u2019s support erodes sharply among Democratic women]  Top campaign aides have told nervous supporters in recent days that none of the bad news is an argument to veer from the plan or lose heart. Mook does some of the hand-holding himself, telling donors that as the 2016 race gels this fall and winter, the \u201cfundamentals\u201d he has set in place will be a bedrock no other candidate on either side of the race can match. Press secretary Brian Fallon describes the campaign\u2019s approach as \u201cheads down, marching forward, onward and upward.\u201d If that does not sound very cheerful, Fallon and other Clinton aides and associates suggest patience and a deep breath.  \u201cThere is always going to be second-guessing of any strategy,\u201d and the test is whether the strategy falls apart under that scrutiny, Fallon said, that \u201cwhen adversity arises, that you not deviate from the plan, that you stick it out, remain confident and ride out whatever turbulence you may encounter.\u201d The original plan assumed that Clinton would easily dispatch a challenge from her left before moving on to the general-election contest, where her center-left views, long r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and hawkish national security credentials would have broad appeal.   Thousands of people gathered in Manassas, Va., on Monday to see Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)  Advisers did not seriously contemplate that Clinton could lose to the dark-horse Sanders in New Hampshire or Iowa, as current polling suggests she could, or that her perceived weakness would be an invitation to Biden.  In Cedar Falls, Clinton declined a student\u2019s invitation to discuss Sanders\u2019s political views, which are far to Clinton\u2019s left, and said she is looking forward to the first Democratic debate next month. She is holding intraparty fire until then.  [How Bernie Sanders is plotting his path to the Democratic nomination]  The idea is that when the dust settles \u2014 on the Democratic side and in the raucous Republican primary \u2014 Clinton will stand as the best-qualified and most electable candidate. The person, in the words of one Clinton adviser, who looks like the grown-up. She is focusing on women this month, including her event this week in Iowa announcing a program to reduce campus sexual assault. She spoke before a crowd of about 500. It was a fairly large venue by the standards of Clinton events that cannot compete with Sanders\u2019s crowds of thousands \u2014 and that sometimes seem designed to avoid the comparison.  The plan also factored in an onslaught of GOP attacks on Clinton\u2019s record as secretary of state, her family ties and her family foundation. It did not initially account for the news that Clinton had used a privately owned and operated e-mail system for her State Department work, since only a handful of close advisers knew of the arrangement and Clinton apparently did not consider it a liability. The campaign is telling anxious supporters that the worst of the e-mail storm has probably passed, while also acknowledging that their initial response \u2014 nothing to see here, folks \u2014 was a serious mistake. \u201cWe anticipate it will come up less and less, because she\u2019s answered the questions,\u201d Fallon said.  \u201cWe recognize that this will be a subject we need to address, and we will do so,\u201d he added. \u201cWe feel that while the topic won\u2019t completely go away, it won\u2019t obstruct or block out our other messages about the other issues that matter as time goes by.\u201d  [New campaign, same old problems: Clinton hurt by familiar shortcomings]  The bet is that the e-mail issue will not irreparably damage Clinton\u2019s appeal as a hard worker and advocate for the little guy, the basis of her second campaign. But even some of her strongest backers say they are not sure she can ever put the question of whether she skirted government rules behind her.  It is not yet clear whether Clinton\u2019s troubles have dampened the pace of her fundraising, which hit a record $46\u00a0million in her first three months. The next Federal Election Commission report is due Sept. 30; Fallon said the campaign is comfortable with the fund-raising numbers but declined to provide details. Privately, Clinton friends are lowering expectations for the next report, noting the usual summer slowdown and the fact that her most eager supporters probably already gave in the spring. The e-mail issue and falling poll numbers are nothing Clinton cannot manage, several donors and supporters said. But two major donors \u2014 who requested anonymity to speak candidly \u2014 said they have told the campaign they felt blindsided by the e-mail issue and are uneasy about where an FBI investigation into the security of Clinton\u2019s system could lead. Others were more sanguine, though still critical of Clinton\u2019s response to a problem she brought on herself. \u201cThe Clintons have faced far worse crises. This is a blip,\u201d said John Morgan, a major Florida fundraiser and host of one of Clinton\u2019s early fundraising parties in the spring. \u201cThe problem was not dealing with it quickly. If someone walks in and says, \u2018Stand up so I can see what\u2019s under the cushion,\u2019 you stand up and let them look. She should have stood up immediately because there is nothing under the cushion and never was.\u201d  ", "byline": "", "description": "CAMPAIGN DEBRIEF | Faced with her worst polling since 2008, the Democratic front-runner is not deviating from her early strategy.", "title": "As worries rise, Hillary Clinton camp says stick to the plan", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-worries-rise-hillary-clinton-camp-says-stick-to-the-plan/2015/09/15/8c5ada86-5bde-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html", "topics": ["women", "economy", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Hillary Clinton", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "John Morgan", "Barack Obama", "Bernie Sanders", "Robby Mook", "Scott Morgan", "Brian Fallon"], "orgs": ["Federal Election Commission", "FBI", "State Department", "GOP"], "authors": [{"author_id": 31354, "fullname": "anne gearan", "primary_org": "washpo"}], "date_written": "2015-09-16 13:00:00", "org": "washpo", "article_id": "4b15f7c86edb00c3ab4b659755c67565", "date_access": "2015-09-16 16:10:09.489236"}
