{"body": "Weeks, even months of mixed signals from Vice President Joe Biden about his presidential intentions are increasingly testing the patience of Democrats who have otherwise been sympathetic to his family concerns, and the window of opportunity for him to emerge as a desired alternative to Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s candidacy appears to be shrinking.\nSince resuming work in late summer after the death in May of his eldest son, Beau, the vice president has alternately stoked speculation that he might join the Democratic field and said he lacked what he called the emotional fuel to do so.\nBut factors beyond his control are intruding on Biden\u2019s deliberations. Outside ruminations on his tragic personal history have had the inadvertent effect of giving his grief an off-putting veneer of opportunism. The White House has been deferential but has increasingly hinted that it is ready to move on. And talk of a Clinton campaign collapse has eased as her standing in the polls has stabilized before the first Democratic debate Tuesday.\nOne longtime Biden associate, who months ago thought the vice president could afford to sit out some of the first nominating contests if needed, said he has become less sure.\n\u201cI don't know,\u201d he said, echoing others close to the vice president who would not be named discussing private conversations but also expressed new doubt that he\u2019ll ultimately join the race. \u201cIf she collapses, he can. I'm not so sure she's going to collapse.\u201d\nLogistically, time is running short as well. In Iowa, which casts the first nominating ballots of 2016, one prominent Democrat suggested that Biden\u2019s opportunity to seriously compete in the state is rapidly dwindling. He calculated that it would be late November before a fully staffed Biden campaign could be running there, leaving less than 90 organizing days before the February caucuses.\n\u201cThat's a very tall order,\u201d the strategist said, \u201cone that looks almost insurmountable at this point.\u201d\nThe vice president\u2019s office has stopped commenting for the record on reports of an imminent announcement. But close aides insisted he hasn't made a final decision. They say that the question of whether he and his family are ready to endure the rigor of a campaign so soon after Beau\u2019s death has not been answered conclusively enough to push ahead.\nAs Vice President Joe Biden zeros in on a final decision for the 2016 presidential race, one factor pushing him toward another run is the view that the political climate could be more favorable than ever before in his more than four decade-long career.\nThe vice president's close-knit circle of...\nAs Vice President Joe Biden zeros in on a final decision for the 2016 presidential race, one factor pushing him toward another run is the view that the political climate could be more favorable than ever before in his more than four decade-long career.\nThe vice president's close-knit circle of...\nThe vice president has spent almost every weekend since May close to his family in Delaware, where the subject of a campaign is likely to have been a recurring topic of discussion, according to a source close to the discussions.\nAs the first of many state filing deadlines approach \u2013 Alabama's is less than a month away \u2013 Biden has acknowledged that the he \u201cmay not get there in time to make it feasible to be able to run and succeed,\u201d as he told a Catholic magazine recently.\nOctober brings three signposts: the debate, which Biden probably will skip; Clinton's testimony before a congressional panel investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, which has become a rallying point for her campaign; and a key Iowa Democratic Party dinner on Oct. 24.\nIowa has no filing deadline; on caucus night, more than 1,600 precinct-level meetings are held across the state, and winning requires an intensive organizational effort to persuade supporters to turn out on in the winter cold and sit through a series of speeches before they can vote.\n\u201cYou don't have to be a genius to organize in Iowa, but you need to hire people with experience,\u201d said the veteran party strategist, who asked to remain anonymous to avoid antagonizing Biden or his supporters. \u201cIdentifying them and getting those who aren't already committed to a campaign takes time.\u201d\nFormer Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a Clinton supporter, said Biden could still decide on a run as late as mid-November, though he doubted he would run.\nHe said he didn\u2019t think there was a limit to Democrats\u2019 patience \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of chits with all of us\u201d \u2013 but noted that after weeks of being included in polls, Biden still trails Clinton and in some cases Sen. Bernie Sanders in key states.\n\u201cWith all the goodwill that Joe has, for him to still be where he is in the polls \u2013 it\u2019s pretty daunting,\u201d he said.\nAnd from the White House comes indications of an administration itching to refocus on its remaining time in office. At a news conference last week, President Obama referred to \u201cif and when\u201d Clinton is president, and on Tuesday, Press Secretary Josh Earnest noted that Clinton is \u201cthe leading candidate\u201d for the nomination, even as he later said Biden should take what time he needs.\nAlternatively, though, Biden has dropped hints in recent months that a third presidential bid might be in the offing and even sketched out a campaign message as a warrior for the middle class.\nOn Thursday, Biden spoke at a Washington conference on job creation and infrastructure immediately after Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a darling of the progressive base with whom he met privately in August, stoking talk of a possible dream ticket of Democratic luminaries.\nBiden heaped praise on Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, as \u201cone of the most articulate people in the United States Congress,\u201d before delving into a speech on the critical need for investment in infrastructure to aid the middle class. He insisted that the economic stimulus, whose implementation he oversaw, was \u201cthe most competently run program in the history of the United States for the amount of money involved.\u201d\nLast weekend, Biden and Clinton spoke at separate Human Rights Campaign events, a rare instance of the two courting the same key Democratic constituency in close proximity. And Tuesday, as he addressed labor leaders at a White House summit, Biden's call to action seemed to include a direct swipe at his would-be rival\u2019s former job as President Obama\u2019s top diplomat.\n\u201cWe need your muscle, we need to move. If I don't move, I'll be demoted to secretary of State or something,\u201d Biden said, before pointing to the assembled press corps to stress: \u201cThat's a joke!\u201d\nWithout a definitive signal from Biden, though, an independent effort promoting his candidacy is ramping up. The Draft Biden super PAC, which is unaffiliated with Biden, released a national ad Tuesday urging him to enter the race.\nThe dramatic 90-second ad opens with Biden's own words, addressing a gathering just weeks before his son died of cancer, reflecting on another personal tragedy: the car accident in 1972 that killed his first wife and infant daughter and left his two sons seriously injured, just after Biden\u2019s election to the Senate.\n\u201cBy focusing on my sons, I found my redemption,\u201d Biden is heard saying, as a montage of black-and-white photos of him and his family plays.\nThe outpouring of sympathy for Biden after Beau's death, and the admiration of many for the way he has conducted himself publicly since, has certainly enhanced the vice president's public image in a way that would serve his campaign.\nBut just a day before the Draft Biden ad launched, Politico reported that it was Biden himself who told a New York Times columnist months earlier that his son's dying wish was for him to run. The report cast the revelation as evidence of political calculation by Biden, a characterization the vice president's office called \u201coffensive.\u201d\n\u201cThe bottom line on the Politico story,\u201d the vice president\u2019s office said in a statement, \u201cis that it is categorically false.\u201d\nTimes staff writer Mark Z.
