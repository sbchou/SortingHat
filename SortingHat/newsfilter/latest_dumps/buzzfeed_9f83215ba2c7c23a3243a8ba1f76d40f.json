Paul does.\"\n\n\n ", "title": "Scott Walker: I Don't Stand With Rand", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/ilanbenmeir/scott-walker-i-dont-stand-with-rand", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "personality", "terrorism"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Charlie Hebdo", "Michael Medved", "Scott Walker"], "orgs": ["Senate", "NSA"], "authors": [{"author_id": 20926, "fullname": "ilan ben-meir", "primary_org": "buzzfeed"}], "date_written": "2015-05-22 17:18:32", "org": "buzzfeed", "article_id": "9f83215ba2c7c23a3243a8ba1f76d40f", "date_access": "2015-05-22 16:36:11.851964"}
