Bernie Sanders. \u201cI have been waiting for the administration to make a decision \u2026 I can\u2019t wait too much longer. I\u2019m putting the White House on notice, I\u2019m going to tell you what I think -- soon.\u201d\nThe contentious pipeline project is still under review at the State Department, and Clinton has said for months that because the process was started under her watch, she should not \u201csecond guess\u201d President Barack Obama\u2019s eventual decision. Her refusal to say whether she supports approving or rejecting the pipeline has been criticized from both sides as a lack of leadership on an important issue to the Democratic Party\u2019s grassroots. Sanders opposes the pipeline and has criticized Clinton for not taking a position on it.\nThe Keystone question was lobbed at Clinton at the end of what devolved into a lightning-round town hall at the Boys and Girls Club, where attendees shouted out the general topic of their questions -- immigration, autism, Russian President Vladimir Putin, climate change, and more -- with Clinton offering a quick-fire round of answers that did not probe much deeper than what she says in her stump speech.\nThe evening event \u2013 Clinton\u2019s second of the day -- was attended by many New Hampshire voters who said they were deciding between Clinton and Sanders for the Democratic nomination. By the end, she appeared eager to tick off quick hits on national and international issues rather than engage in longer back-and-forth discussions that some attendees had been anticipating.\nClinton had already listened a lot throughout a day that kicked off with a discussion about substance abuse in Laconia, a picturesque city between two lakes where the community has struggled with pervasive problems of drug and alcohol addiction. She was joined by Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, who has become a choice endorsement from Sanders' home state for Clinton to tout in neighboring New Hampshire (where Sanders is leading Clinton by 7 points, 43 percent to 36 percent, in a Monmouth Poll released earlier this week).\nThe morning discussion and setting could not have provided a starker contrast with Clinton\u2019s Wednesday night appearance on \u201cThe Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon,\u201d where she gamely poked fun at Donald Trump and herself, part of a recent charm offensive in an attempt to show off a softer side. But at the sober event with grieving parents and recovering addicts, Clinton was somber again as attendees poured out their personal stories. \n\n\nTwo mothers shared stories of losing their sons -- one to a drug overdose and one to suicide. Another woman, Jane Sparks, told Clinton she has been in recovery since 2009, and said her 21-year-old son has been sober for two weeks and is living with her.\nNone of the teary testimonials ended in a question -- and Clinton didn\u2019t jump in to reclaim the narrative or offer any more specifics about her $10 billion, ten-year plan to help combat drug abuse that she unveiled earlier this month. Instead, she took a back-seat role and listened, offering her sympathy from the center of the room. \"This is a disease,\" she said in her opening remarks. \"It has to be interrupted and treated and prevented, if possible. We have to equip law enforcement with the ability to save people from overdoses.\" Clinton has proposed that first responders carry naloxone \u2013 which reverses the effects of opiods -- to help prevent overdoses. \"Untended, it's only going to get worse ... the heartbreak and the tragedies are only going to increase.\"\nClinton\u2019s New Hampshire swing continues Friday morning, with a community forum on college affordability in Durham and a Democratic dinner in Plymouth Friday night.\nMany New Hampshire voters who came out to see her speak on Thursday said they were still undecided -- but that had nothing to do with the email controversy that has been dogging Clinton's campaign, or even any dislike of the former Secretary of State. It had more to do with facts about Clinton that she has little power to change, they said.\n\u201cI am on the fence,\u201d said Glenda Guzouskas, a retired teacher. \u201cI like Hillary a lot. What nags at me a little bit is that the establishment doesn\u2019t really tend to get very far and do very much. I keep wondering, how are you going to be different? Bernie Sanders says things that are really for the everyday person right now. And he\u2019s not an establishment person.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Clinton: I'll give my Keystone pipeline opinion 'soon'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/hillary-clinton-keystone-pipeline-213813", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "abortion"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Sara Solovitch", "Burgess Everett", "Jesse Rifkin", "Henry C.
