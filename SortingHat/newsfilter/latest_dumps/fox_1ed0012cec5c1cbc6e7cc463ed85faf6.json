(AP)\n\n\nThe Hillary Clinton campaign has hired a former Planned Parenthood organizer to rally support from Asian Americans.\nThe Clinton campaign announced on Tuesday that it hired Lisa Changadveja, a former Planned Parenthood official. Changadveja took a job with the embattled abortionist after serving as a regional field director for Clinton\u2019s failed 2008 run and deputy field director for Gov. Bill Bennett of Colorado during his successful gubernatorial campaign in 2010.\nHer LinkedIN profile says that she oversaw Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) operations in the Mountain West. She \u201cprovided on-site, e-mail, and telephone public affairs consulting, advocacy training, and technical assistance for 7 affiliates in 6 states,\u201d it says.\nShe will now lead outreach for the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. That demographic voted overwhelmingly for President Barack Obama in 2012, though his support in that group varied drastically by region.\n\u201c89 percent of Asian Americans polled in Pennsylvania, and 86 percent of Asian Americans polled at sites in both New York and Michigan, voted for Obama, However, Obama received 57 percent of the Asian American vote at sites polled in Texas and only 16 percent at sites in Louisiana,\u201d according to a study by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund.\nChangadveja\u2019s job is similar to the role she filled in the Ready for Hillary super PAC, which was formed to clear the path for Clinton\u2019s nomination. She handled Asian and LGBT outreach before the PAC disbanded when the former secretary of state made her candidacy official.\n\nChangadveja is the latest Planned Parenthood alum to join the Clinton campaign. One of Clinton\u2019s top staffers in Iowa, the nation\u2019s first primary state, is the daughter of Cecile Richards, the CEO of Planned Parenthood.\nClick for more from The Washington Free Beacon.", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Clinton hires former Planned Parenthood staffer for Asian outreach - Santorum set to visit all 99 Iowa counties", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/26/hillary-hires-former-planned-parenthood-staffer-for-asian-outreach/", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "women", "trade"], "people": ["Rick Santorum", "Bill Bennett", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Hillary Clinton", "Cecile Richards", "Lisa Changadveja", "Barack Obama"], "orgs": ["Planned Parenthood Federation of America", "PAC", "PPFA"], "authors": [{"author_id": 26982, "fullname": "bill mcmorris", "primary_org": "fox"}], "date_written": "2015-08-26 14:37:43", "org": "fox", "article_id": "1ed0012cec5c1cbc6e7cc463ed85faf6", "date_access": "2015-08-26 14:00:04.065736"}
