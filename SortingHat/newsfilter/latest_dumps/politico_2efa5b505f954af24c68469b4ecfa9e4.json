About 70 people attended, a source said.\nStory Continued Below\nSpeakers at the meeting included vice chairman Huma Abedin, campaign chairman John Podesta, and campaign manager Robby Mook, who all participated in a \u201cwrap-up\u201d panel discussing the state of play. Communications director Jennifer Palmieri also spoke, along with top policy gurus Jake Sullivan and Maya Harris, and national political director Amanda Renteria, among others.\nThe first campaign filings released Wednesday evening showed Clinton struggled to attract small donors. Less than 20 percent of the $47.5 million Clinton raised between April and July was from individuals contributing $200 or less. A source said engaging small donors was part of a bigger conversation at Thursday\u2019s meeting about grassroots engagement, including how to reach out to millennial voters.\nThe Clinton camp released the names Wednesday night of over 100 bundlers who together make up the campaign\u2019s finance committee, which included longtime Clinton donors, Obama allies, and some elected officials\nAlso on POLITICO\nHADAS GOLD\nIncluded in the roster are former Indiana Sen.
