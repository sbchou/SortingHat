Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., chairman of the Benghazi panel, said he had \"no choice\" but to make the subpoena public \"in order to correct the inaccuracy\" of Clinton's claim.\u00a0\nClinton told CNN on Monday that she \"never had a subpoena,\" adding: \"Everything I did was permitted by law and regulation.\"\u00a0\nGowdy said the committee issued the March 4 subpoena to Clinton personally after learning the full extent of her use of private emails while serving as secretary of state.\u00a0\nRegardless of whether a subpoena was issued, \"Secretary Clinton had a statutory duty to preserve records from her entire time in office, and she had a legal duty to cooperate with and tell the truth to congressional investigators requesting her records going back to September of 2012,\" Gowdy said in a statement.\u00a0\nThe dispute over the subpoena is the latest flashpoint in an increasingly partisan investigation by the House panel, which was created to probe the September 2012 attack in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador.\u00a0\n\nGowdy and other Republicans have complained that Clinton and the State Department have not been forthcoming with release of her emails and note that the State Department has said it cannot find in its records all or part of 15 work-related emails from Clinton's private server.\u00a0\nThe emails all predate the assault on the U.S. diplomatic facility and consist mainly of would-be intelligence reports passed to Clinton by longtime political confidant Sidney Blumenthal, officials said.\u00a0\nGowdy has said the missing emails raise \"serious questions\" about Clinton's decision to erase her personal server, especially before it could be analyzed by an independent third-party arbiter.\u00a0\nA Clinton campaign spokesman has said she turned over 55,000 pages of materials to the State Department, \"including all emails in her possession from Mr. Blumenthal.\"", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "'NO CHOICE'  Gowdy reveals subpoena Clinton said she never had", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/09/benghazi-panel-chair-releases-clinton-subpoena-counters-claim-never-had-one/", "topics": ["women", "immigration", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Trey Gowdy", "Sidney Blumenthal"], "orgs": ["State Department"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-07-09 04:22:00", "org": "fox", "article_id": "c6baca083e463a52ce2c4b4842e66655", "date_access": "2015-07-09 03:50:02.422643"}
