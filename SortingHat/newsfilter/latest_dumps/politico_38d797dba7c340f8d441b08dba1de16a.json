Remarking upon his fellow contenders in the race, McAfee said of Donald Trump: \"If I didn't enter, he would've won.\"\nMcAfee, who fled Belize for the United States in 2014 after authorities tried to question him in the death of his neighbor, told CNN that he would talk about his \"checkered background\" and would win voters over with his personality. He was also arrested last month in Tennessee for driving under the influence and possession of a handgun while driving under the influence, telling CNN that the case was still pending and that he would be back in court in November and that it was Xanax, not alcohol that affected his driving.\nMcAfee's campaign website features a large photo of the tech founder along with a quote from George Washington and links about how to get involved and donate to his campaign. The site also features links to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts, but it does not yet have any policy positions.\n\n                                            By \nAlan Wolfe\n\n\n                                            By \n                                                    Luiza Ch.
