This is a moment for him to gain his footing on foreign policy issues.\u201d \n Arguing that Clinton, as secretary of state, \u201cstood by\u201d while Iraq fell apart and as the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS, took root across Iraq and Syria puts Bush on offense, shifting the conversation away from whether the war itself was a mistake. (Bush admits now, after stumbling on this question for four days in May, that the invasion was a bad idea.) \n \u201cISIS grew while the United States disengaged from the Middle East and ignored the threat,\u201d Bush said. \u201cAnd where was Secretary of State Clinton in all of this? Like the president himself, she had opposed the surge \u2026 then joined in claiming credit for its success \u2026 then stood by as that hard-won victory by American and allied forces was thrown away.\u201d \n Bush\u2019s speech was also an attempt to harden negative perceptions about Clinton\u2019s globe-trotting tenure as America\u2019s top diplomat. \n \u201cIn all her record-setting travels, she stopped by Iraq exactly once,\u201d he said. \u201cWho can seriously argue that America and our friends are safer today than in 2009, when the president and Secretary Clinton \u2014 the storied \u2018team of rivals\u2019 \u2014 took office? So eager to be the history makers, they failed to be the peacemakers. It was a case of blind haste to get out, and to call the tragic consequences somebody else\u2019s problem.\u201d \n While Clinton herself didn\u2019t mention Bush publicly Tuesday, the Democratic rapid-response machine whirred into motion, eager to turn the debate around. \nJENNIFER SHUTT\n \u201cIf Jeb Bush wants to spread blame for the situation in the Middle East, he doesn\u2019t need to look much further than his next family reunion,\u201d said Brad Woodhouse, president of Correct The Record, the organization tasked with running Clinton\u2019s rapid-response operation. \u201cJeb championed former President George W. Bush\u2019s destructive foreign policy from Day One, from the invasion of Iraq based on faulty intelligence to the strategy regarding ISIS.\u201d \n Clinton\u2019s official campaign held a conference call Tuesday afternoon, putting senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan on the line with reporters to argue that Clinton\u2019s tenure in Foggy Bottom was spent rebuilding relationships with allies after George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cpolicies that for eight years set the cause of American leadership back.\u201d \n \u201cThis is a pretty bold attempt to rewrite history and reassign responsibility,\u201d Sullivan said, pushing back at Bush\u2019s idea that the Islamic State took root due to the vacuum created on Obama\u2019s watch, when American troops left Iraq. \u201cISIS grew out of Al-Qaeda in Iraq,\u201d said Sullivan, who served as a top adviser in Clinton\u2019s State Department. \u201cAnd where did AQI come from? It didn\u2019t exist before the invasion. It emerged in no small part as a result of President\u2019s Bush\u2019s failed strategy. And it gained strength by signing up former Sunni military officers \u2014 officers from the army that the Bush administration disbanded.\u201d \n Following the conference call, Bush\u2019s campaign fired back, emailing reporters a transcript from a town hall that took place during Clinton\u2019s only visit to Iraq in 2009, in which she promised to take more questions \u201cwhen I next come to Iraq.\u201d \n She never returned. \n Both Clinton and Bush, two political heirs desperate to present themselves as the candidates of \u201cthe future,\u201d are, at least when it comes to foreign policy, far more comfortable focusing on the past. On Tuesday night, Bush sought to change that, presenting a more detailed plan for combating ISIL \u2014 which, according to FBI Director James Comey, has overtaken Al Qaeda as a threat to the U.S. homeland. \n Last week, during a candidate forum in New Hampshire, Bush repeatedly criticized Obama for not having a strategy but offered only a vague proposal himself, attempting to draw a line between putting \u201cboots on the ground,\u201d which he opposes, and embedding U.S. special forces with Syrian rebel forces, which he supports. He also backs using limited airstrikes against ISIL \u2014 the very policy Obama is pursuing with little obvious success. \n As for Clinton, when reporters asked Sullivan during Tuesday\u2019s conference call what the former secretary of state would do to fight ISIL, he demurred, saying only that she \u201cwill have more to say in the days and weeks to come.\u201d \n In his speech Tuesday night, Bush called for supporting the Iraqi military with American air power, embedding the few U.S. forces in Iraq with the country\u2019s army and providing more support for Kurdish fighters. His plan to bring stability to Syria goes much further, calling for a U.S.-led international coalition to oust Assad and rebuild the country\u2019s depleted military. \n Beyond that, Bush called for creating safe zones within Syria and instituting a no-fly zone. \n \u201cOur ultimate goal in Syria is to defeat ISIS and to achieve long-term political stability in that country,\u201d Bush said. \u201cDefeating ISIS requires defeating Assad, but we have to make sure that his regime is not replaced by something as bad or worse.\u201d \nELI STOKOLS\n Tuesday\u2019s speech, while an opportunity to project a presidential bearing, could remind voters that, however tight Bush\u2019s case against Clinton might be, he might not be his party\u2019s best messenger on this subject \u2014 given his last name, he might even be the worst. \n \u201cVoters are looking for someone who\u2019s not held captive by the debates and fights of the past,\u201d said Steve Schmidt, a GOP strategist who guided John McCain\u2019s 2008 campaign and has offered legal advice to Rick Perry over the past year. \u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that the more there\u2019s a Bush versus Clinton fight, the more fatigue that will cause, especially if it commences in 2015.\u201d \n It also has some foreign policy experts questioning Bush\u2019s grasp of the facts. \n Jeb Bush speaks at the RedState Gathering Saturday, Aug. 8, 2015, in Atlanta. | AP Photo \n \u201cWhy was the success of the surge followed by a withdrawal from Iraq, leaving not even the residual force that commanders and the Joint Chiefs knew was necessary?\u201d Bush asked in his speech. \u201cThat premature withdrawal was the fatal error, creating the void that ISIS moved in to fill.\u201d \n Richard LeBaron, a career diplomat who served as ambassador to Kuwait under George W. Bush, called that argument \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d The answer to Bush\u2019s rhetorical question about why the surge led to a drawdown, he argues, \u201cdistorts history.\u201d \n Obama administration officials have long noted that it was George W. Bush \u2014 not Obama \u2014 who signed the initial agreement to remove U.S. troops by 2011. And it was the Iraqi parliament that ultimately nixed the administration\u2019s proposal to keep a small residual force in Iraq, not the president, they say. \n A slim majority of Americans, 51 percent, consider the Iraq War to have been a mistake, according to a Gallup poll earlier this year; that\u2019s down 6 points in the past year as ISIS has emerged as a major threat, but still significant. \n And if there was any \u201cfatal error\u201d that led to the rise of ISIL, LeBaron says, it was George W. Bush\u2019s dissolution of the Iraqi military in May 2003 rather than Obama\u2019s U.S. troop drawdown in 2011. \n \u201cThe notion that the surge worked is belied by facts after it,\u201d said LeBaron, now a Middle East policy expert at the Atlantic Council. \u201cIt gave us some political space to say \u2018we\u2019re not leaving a total fiasco\u2019 when we probably were; it was really just a period in which we were able to placate and buy off some of the Sunni tribes who took our money and just waited for us to leave. \n \u201cThe Bush administration was looking for an exit strategy; the whole country was looking to get out,\u201d LeBaron said. \u201cThe surge was designed to get us out of Iraq, not to keep us involved there.\u201d \n Then there are the parallels, Democrats note, between Jeb Bush\u2019s team and George W.\u2019s. \n Of Jeb Bush\u2019s 21 named foreign-policy advisers, 17 worked in his brother\u2019s White House; his top foreign policy staffer, Robert S. Karem, was a member of Dick Cheney\u2019s national security staff and assisted with the former vice president\u2019s autobiography. \n \u201cThe Republican bench of experts on the Middle East is pretty weak, and you can tell they\u2019re already giving Jeb bad advice,\u201d said LeBaron. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a very good track record, and they\u2019re going to be telling him things to justify their own actions. These are the people responsible for the Iraq War. They\u2019re rewriting history for their own reasons.\u201d \n\nEli Stokols, an Emmy-winning reporter and anchor at Denver\u2019s KDVR-TV, has covered Colorado politics for nearly a decade.\n\n                                            By \nCaleb Hannan\n\n\n                                            By \n                                                    Amb.
