He called the real estate mogul \"gracious\" and \"hospitable.\"\n\"What I found in the private dialogue ... was a very different Donald Trump than the one I've seen in the media,\" Palomarez told POLITICO. The CEO said that Trump spent more time listening than talking.\nThe meeting, which was held Tuesday morning at the request of Trump, was first reported by CNN. The USHCC represents 3.2 million Hispanic-owned businesses and has 200 local chapters.\n\n\n\n            By \nJosh Gerstein\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to immigration, we've repeatedly found ourselves in disagreement with Mr. Trump. His advisors stressed, however, that our disagreement was based on the media's mischaracterization of his stances,\u201d USHCC said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cWe wanted to hear Mr. Trump clearly articulate his views, away from the public spectacle, the media, and the debate floor.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s remarks about illegal immigrants have been causing waves since he referred to them as \u201crapists\u201d and \u201ccriminals\u201d during his presidential announcement speech on June 16.\nAfter that speech, the chamber announced it would not use Trump hotels for two upcoming conventions, a move that Palomarez estimated would cost the business tycoon millions, compared to if he had won their bids. \nPalomarez said that most people were supportive of the meeting when they learned that it was just giving the GOP contender a platform to share his views, but some are still \"a bit off-put.\"\nHis immigration policy \u2014 the only proposal the candidate has released so far \u2014 calls for the deportation of 11 million illegal immigrants, a wall along the southern border, and the end to birthright citizenship. It has caused presidential candidates to take hard stances on the issues, putting them on both sides of the line. \nPalomarez said that the two discussed a range of issues including the economy, American competitiveness and immigration. \nWhen asked if they addressed Trump's use of the derogatory term \"anchor baby\" to describe children of illegal immigrant parents who gain citizenship by being born in the U.S., Palomarez said, \"To hear Donald tell it, he\u2019s been mischaracterized, the media. The liberal media has been unfair to him.\"\nTrump agreed to participate in a public Q&A with USHCC on Oct. 8, an opportunity they offer to all presidential candidates. So far, they've hosted Sens. Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders and former Gov. Martin O'Malley. Gov. John Kasich and former Gov. Jeb Bush also have plans to participate in the future, according to Palomarez.\n\n                                            By \n                                                    Katy Reckdahl\n\n\n                                            By \nJR Ross\n\n\n                                            By \nJohn Parmentola\n                                             and \nTheodore A.
