On a good week, her poll numbers reached 2 percent. But after she mopped the floor with her opponents in the second-tier debate \u2013 affectionately dubbed #kidstable \u2013 the former Hewlett-Packard CEO suddenly finds herself in the top tier of presidential candidates.\n\u201cObviously I am really gratified.\u00a0I am really encouraged,\u201d Fiorina told Fox News, having just finished a capacity-crowd town hall meeting in Alden, Iowa. A week ago, barely 40 percent of people knew who she was. Now, the left-leaning polling group PPP is blaring the headline \u201cFiorina On Fire.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get rattled when people don\u2019t really know that you are out there,\u201d Fiorina told Fox News.\u00a0\u201cOn the other hand you can\u2019t get rattled when all of a sudden they say you are on fire as well.\u00a0This is a long haul. So none of this is going to go to our heads.\u201d\nYou could forgive Fiorina for having a little more bounce in her step, though.\u00a0When she walked into the Mason City, Iowa, library for a town hall Friday morning she found a standing-room-only crowd.\u00a0Her campaign staff was pleasantly stunned by the newfound enthusiasm \u2013 a precious commodity for a person seeking the highest office in the land.\nIn Iowa, a Suffolk University poll this week showed Fiorina with 10 percent, placing her in the top five in the GOP field. A CNN/ORC poll in the state likewise showed her in the top five, with 7 percent.\nVoters have found a lot to like about Fiorina, whether it\u2019s her status as a political outsider, or that she has the toughness to stand up against seasoned political pros.\n\u201cShe was one of my top picks out of the debates,\u201d Brenda Crabb told Fox News.\u00a0\u201cI liked that she seemed really smart \u2013 she\u2019s not a politician.\u201d\nRich Baldwin put it a little more bluntly.\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s not a career politician.\u00a0And we have had it up to here with career politicians.\u201d\nFiorina also says she is seeing an uptick in fundraising.\u00a0Money is the key to whether she will be in it for the long haul, or may wither as quickly as she blossomed.\u00a0\nNever one to shrink from a fight, whether in the boardroom or the campaign trail, Fiorina is doubling down on her recent criticism of Donald Trump, questioning whether Trump is \u2013 in fact \u2013 a Republican.\n\u201cHe won\u2019t take a pledge saying he will support the Republican nominee,\u201d Fiorina told Fox News.\u00a0\u201cHe has changed his mind on some pretty important things.\u00a0I would like to know where he actually stands on amnesty.\u00a0Where he actually stands on universal health care. Where he actually stands on abortion.\u00a0Those are things that matter to me and they matter to Republican voters.\u201d\nFiorina\u2019s ascent is a boon to the GOP as \u2013 at the moment at least \u2013 it gives her a far louder voice with which to go after Hillary Clinton.\u00a0Fiorina has been relentless in her criticism of Clinton, saying she lied about Benghazi.\u00a0Now she is going after Clinton for suggesting comments Trump made about Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly prove that the Republican candidates are waging a war on women.\n\u201cI think Hillary Clinton is equally as guilty,\u201d Fiorina told Fox News.\u00a0\u201cAnyone who paints with a broad brush in those insulting terms is as guilty as\u00a0Donald\u00a0Trump. It is ridiculous\u00a0for Hillary Clinton to say that the Republican Party is waging a war on women.\u201d\nFiorina also dismisses the notion \u2013 floated in a New York Times article -- that she is the GOP\u2019s weapon to fight back against Democratic attacks that the party is waging war on women.\n\u201cI am a leader with a proven track record of problem solving. \u00a0I happen to be a woman,\u201d she told Fox News.\nFiorina had a target on her back long before she announced her candidacy.\u00a0Her newfound prominence will only make that target a more attractive one.\u00a0After she told a voter Thursday night that parents have the choice whether to vaccinate their children, Slate magazine wrote that Fiorina \u201cComes out in favor of kids getting measles.\u201d Fellow Republican George Pataki whacked Fiorina on Twitter, saying she rejects \u201caccepted science that has eradicated diseases like small pox (sic) and polio.\u201d\nFiorina told Fox News that Pataki is clearly trying to get attention and conveniently ignored the rest of what she said.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are talking about contagious diseases and I would certainly encourage parents to vaccinate their children,\u201d Fiorina told Fox News.\u00a0\u201cI would respect true religious objections to those vaccinations and I support a school\u2019s right to say if you will not vaccinate your child against these contagious diseases, then we have the right to say your child can\u2019t attend public school.\u201d\nIf Fiorina\u2019s star continues to rise, she can expect more attacks from all corners.\u00a0Whether she rises is another question.\u00a0Much of her future hinges on the next debate \u2013 particularly if she makes the cut to play in the top 10.\u00a0Fiorina told Fox News she has to constantly \u201cexceed expectations.\u201d\nShe raised the bar very high with her performance in the second-tier debate last week in Cleveland.\u00a0The problem with mopping the floor with your opponents is that viewers will expect you to do it every time.John Roberts joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in January 2011 as a senior national correspondent and is based in the Atlanta bureau.", "byline": "", "description": "What a difference a week makes in presidential politics.\u00a0Before the Cleveland debates, Carly Fiorina was little more than a dogged, hard-charging afterthought for most voters.
