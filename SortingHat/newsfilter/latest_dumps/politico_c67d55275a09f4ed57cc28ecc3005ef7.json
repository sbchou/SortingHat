Yeah, I get credit for doing a lot of things I didn't do like that.\"\n\"His daughter told my daughter that he had tried to call me, and I didn't get the message. So, I simply called him back,\" Clinton explained. \"And I don't know whether he had ever intended to discuss this with me or not, and this has happened to you before, I bet, I think by the time I got him back, he had forgotten why he called me in the first place, probably.\"\n\"You never said, like Iowa is beautiful this time of year or anything like that? Nothing like that?\" Colbert pressed.\n\"Not a thing. I had a very pleasant conversation with him, and it wasn't about running for office. And so I missed the chance,\" Clinton deadpanned.\nThe former president also attempted to explain the appeal of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders: \"Because there are a lot of people all over the world that are really hacked off, that think the system's rigged against them and the rich get all the gains and in America a lot of them believe that Republicans have been rewarded for \u2014 they reward the people who go furthest to the right so the Democrats would be even more effective if they moved further to the left.\"\nAsked why Trump is doing so well, Clinton said that it's because \"he's a master brander and he's the most interesting character out there and because he says something that overrides the ideological differences.\"\n\"There is a macho appeal to saying, 'I'm just sick of nothing happening, I'm going to make things happen, vote for me,'\" he added.\nGiving his most unsurprising answer of the interview, Clinton told Colbert that he still planned on voting for his wife for president, referring to her as \"the lady I saw singing on 'Saturday Night Live.'\" Hillary Clinton appeared during a sketch last week in which she played a bartender named Val. Clinton joked that it \"made me want to have a drink with her.\"\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Bill Clinton denies calling up Trump and asking him to run", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/bill-clinton-denies-calling-donald-trump-2016-run-stephen-colbert-214499", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Mary E.
