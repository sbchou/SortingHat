Marco Rubio (R-FL) discussed immigration policy, affirming his longstanding objection to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) programs.An article on Breitbart News earlier Saturday said that Rubio called DACA \u201cimportant\u201d and one that he would not reverse, but a closer look at the official transcript shows some misinterpretations in the translation, and Rubio\u2019s campaign pushed back strongly against any suggestion that the Senator would allow President Barack Obama\u2019s executive amnesty to continue.Response from Rubio SpokesmanAs Rubio spokesman Alex Conant told Breitbart News, \u201cMarco went on Spanish media this week and rejected a comprehensive immigration reform approach, said that the immigration executive orders won\u2019t be permanent policy under his administration, and that he would oppose legalization today because we first need to prevent a future illegal immigration crisis by enforcing our laws.\u201d\u201cMarco also said it\u2019s important not to end DACA immediately since it would be disruptive given all the people that have it,\u201d continued Conant, \u201cbut that at a certain point it would have to end since it cannot be the permanent policy of the land.\u201d\u201cIn case anything was lost in translation, he believes we have to fix our broken immigration system in a series of smaller bills, starting with border security and enforcement, then modernizing our legal immigration system, and then eventually dealing with the illegal immigrants living here,\u201d said Conant.\u00a0\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tread more at breitbart.com\u2192\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Rubio Affirms He\u2019ll End Obama\u2019s Executive Amnesty; Univision Interview Mistranslated", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/ZXX2aCcf7nU/rubio-affirms-he-ll-end-obama-s-executive-amnesty-univision-interview-mistranslated", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Sarah Rumpf", "Jorge Ramos", "Marco Rubio", "Barack Obama", "Alex Conant"], "orgs": ["DAPA", "DACA", "Amnesty", "Univision", "Al Punto"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-04-19 21:20:46", "org": "fox", "article_id": "fccdc53d0729d3aca5cf98328619753e", "date_access": "2015-04-20 00:05:04.176167"}
