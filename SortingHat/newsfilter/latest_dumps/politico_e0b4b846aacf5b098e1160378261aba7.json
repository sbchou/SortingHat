EDT\nDonald Trump now has the support of nearly one-in-three likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire, according to the results of a new Monmouth University poll released Monday.\nBut it's retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson \u2014 whose second-place showing represents a 12-percentage-point jump from Monmouth's July poll \u2014 who had the largest increase of any candidate.\nTrump grabbed 28 percent compared with Carson's 17 percent, while Ohio Gov. John Kasich came in next with 11 percent. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz followed with 8 percent, with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former tech executive Carly Fiorina each at 7 percent, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at 4 percent. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie drawing 2 percent, with no other candidate earning more than 1 percent and 7 percent undecided.\n\u201cRepublican voters are fed up and as a result appear to be rejecting the GOP\u2019s game plan for this nomination contest,\u201d said Patrick Murray, Monmouth's polling director, in a release. \u201cAs with the classic episode of 'Seinfeld,' the Festivus nature of this campaign won\u2019t be over unless the leader \u2014 in this case, Trump \u2014 is taken down. Rick Perry was the first challenger who failed in the \u2018feats of strength\u2019 against Trump.\u201d\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\nCarson's favorability numbers dwarf the field, at 73 percent favorable to 10 percent unfavorable. It's an increase from July, when 45 percent to 15 percent saw him favorably. By comparison, Trump earned 54 percent approval to 36 percent disapproval, an improvement from the previous Monmouth poll,in July,when he stood at 47 percent to 44 percent. Cruz's favorability also jumped (50 percent to 28 percent) relative to July (44 percent to 32 percent).\nAmong very conservative voters, Carson leads Trump this time, 25 percent to 23 percent, with Cruz grabbing 13 percent. But Trump has gained among somewhat conservative voters, leading Carson 32 percent to 17 percent; and he leads Kasich among moderate Republicans likely to vote, 29 percent to 19 percent.\nOverall, Trump's support is up 4 points, from 24 percent in the July poll.\nBut the fortunes of Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker have taken a tumble. Bush, who drew 12 percent in July, went down to 7 percent this time, and Walker fell from 7 percent to 2 percent. Bush went from 47 percent to 37 percent favorability in July to 39 percent-45 percent in the latest survey. Walker, who drew 57 percent to 16 percent favorable numbers in July, experienced a decrease this time \u2014 down to 44 percent to 25 percent.\nThe poll was conducted via telephone from Sept. 10 to 13, surveying 415 registered voters who are likely to vote in February's GOP presidential primary. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Poll: Carson jumps 12 points in New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/ben-carson-poll-jump-new-hampshire-monmouth-213598", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Allie Grasgreen Ciaramella", "Burgess Everett", "Rachael Bade", "Steve Shepard", "Matt Latimer", "Elena Schneider", "Hanna Trudo", "Eric Wolff", "Austin Wright", "Tim Starks", "Peter Suderman", "Danny Vinik", "John Kasich", "Patrick Murray", "Chris Christie", "Vince Guerrieri", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Theodoric Meyer", "Andrew Cuomo", "Rick Perry", "John Cornyn", "Ted Cruz", "Scott Walker", "Nick Gass", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Adam Behsudi", "Jeb Bush", "Seung Min Kim", "Donald Trump", "John Bresnahan", "Marco Rubio", "Brian Faler", "Eliza Collins", "Florian Eder", "David Pittman", "Lauren French", "Carly Fiorina", "Brianna Ehley", "Adam Sneed", "Ben Schreckinger", "Mitt Romney", "Mike Allen", "Daniel Strauss", "Michael Crowley", "Rachana Pradhan", "Matthew Karnitschnig", "Ben Carson", "Ben White", "Barack Obama", "Bill Tomson", "Bernie Sanders"], "orgs": ["Internet Association", "Greens", "Congress", "AMA", "College Scorecard", "Monmouth University", "UAW", "Senate Judiciary Committee", "FCC", "House Oversight", "Photo Gallery", "GOP", "Chicago Council"], "authors": [{"author_id": 31411, "fullname": "matt latimer", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-09-14 16:30:10", "org": "politico", "article_id": "e0b4b846aacf5b098e1160378261aba7", "date_access": "2015-09-15 21:40:15.908645"}
