It is sort of sharing this resource more, merging this. We\u2019re not thinking separately anymore. It doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t going to be some opinion shows at night on MSNBC, but it\u2019s not just my show will that will demonstrate this. You\u2019ve already seen changes with Kate Snow, Brian Williams, but you\u2019re going to see it on my show, you\u2019ll see an awful lot of NBC News talent.\"\nTodd said his Monday-through-Friday show won't compete with his own Sunday show for guests or stories, since it will be news-driven; the Sunday show makes its own news, driven by the guests it attracts each week as they get deep into the issues.\n\"I do think that the danger with the Sunday show, in general, and what I\u2019m hoping to protect against, is you're just on this island on one day a week,\u201d Todd said. \u201c[MTP Daily] helps to keep a brand that is a legacy brand in all the best sense of the word and have it be relevant in the 21st century. Frankly under any era this is a natural extension of 'Meet the Press.\u2019\u201d\nAnd when Todd takes the wheel at 5p.m. on MSNBC, he's inserting himself into a lineup of direct competitors: CNN's Jake Tapper and Fox News' Bret Baier, who occupy the 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. slots on their networks respectively. \n\"I would look at both Jake and Bret as competitors and models. I think they both do a very good job. Look, we are all going to have our own different philosophies, of is it a pure news cast, how much politics, but in many ways I think the Washington news junkie will view all three as complimentary to each other,\" Todd said. \nTodd also hailed the new energy that's been injected into the entire Sunday show landscape, from both the news hosts (such as \"Face the Nation's\" John Dickerson and Jake Tapper on CNN's \"State of the Union\u201d); he thinks it makes everyone more competitive. For years, Todd said, pundits and media watchers had declared television was dead. Instead, Todd said, television is \"finding [its] place again.\"\n\"Look, people still care about news when it's a good story and people will still tune in to some trusted place,\" he said.\n\"We also have a great story to cover right now. The campaign is delivering,\" Todd said. \"I\u2019d like to think, yes we have all cracked the code, but the story is great. The public is tuned in everyone is interested, you put that whole stew together and it has certainly provided an opportunity on Sundays and I\u2019d like to think we\u2019ve made the most of the opportunity.\"\nOf course one of the main reasons the 2016 story is so much more interesting is Donald Trump, a candidate Todd said is partly to thank for making more candidates available to the media.\n\"I think what Trump has done is reminded candidates that, you know what, avoiding the media is not always the best strategy. Say what you want about Trump, but his accessibility is part of his initial success, he\u2019s always available. He makes himself available,\" Todd said. \"I think more campaigns are slowly coming around and realizing if there is one thing to learn from Trump\u2026it is don\u2019t be afraid [to get out there]\"\nIn the last two months, Todd said he's noticed more and more candidates have become available, including Hillary Clinton. \n\"I've described what Trump is doing as the spread offense, which is you sort of do a million things. Don\u2019t make one interview that you do every three months be 'the interview' which everyone picks it apart. Go everywhere,\" Todd said. \"At 7am you make a gaffe and make news and your opponent tries to tackle you at 7 a.m., meanwhile you\u2019ve gone somewhere else at 8 a.m., made different news and just like spread offense they\u2019re tackling the wrong guy because the media ball has moved down the field.\"\nTurning to the coming debates, Todd expressed a desire to slowly winnow the field on the Republican side. Though Todd is not in full control of the coming CNBC GOP debate in Boulder, Colo., he's working with the network to help them determine format and criteria. NBC News is co-hosting a Republican debate in Houston, Texas on Feb. 26 with Telemundo and a Democratic debate on Jan. 17 in Charleston, S.C.\n\"I look at debates holistically. The first one should be introductory there should be this feeling everyone gets a shot. As you move on there\u2019s nothing wrong with it slowly winnowing,\" Todd said. \"...In a two hour period it would be great if you could start getting it down to seven, six or seven [candidates].\"\nDebate criteria should include polls from Iowa and New Hampshire, Todd said, because otherwise candidates are only incentivized to make national news in order to pump up a national number.\n\"It is a state by state contest, not a national contest. So I think diversifying the criteria so it includes states, you\u2019re incentivizing candidates to do what they should be doing in between debates, which is campaigning for delegates,\" Todd said. \nAdditionally, don't be surprised if NBC's debate criteria is the same for both Republican and Democratic debates despite the vast differences in the two parties' fields.\n\"Make the criteria the way the criteria should be whether it\u2019s four people or 13 people,\" Todd said. \"I do think there\u2019s a danger to having two different criteria, you should be as consistent as you can be, (across both parties). You have to. You want to make sure you\u2019re just worrying about the editorial project and not just the production. But people have bosses and they can do that but I can tell you I worry about the editorial product.\"\nHadas Gold is a reporter at\u00a0Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Todd said his Monday-through-Friday show won't compete with his own Sunday show", "title": "For Chuck Todd, a new evening news show is evidence 'everything old is new again'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/09/chuck-todd-new-show-msnbc-214192", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Joseph J.
