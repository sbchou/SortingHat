Nor did she know of anyone who did.\nMills' testimony is perhaps the highest-profile interview the panel has conducted since its probe began a year ago. And unlike some of the other staff interviewed, Mills had a direct role in combing through Clinton's emails before they were handed over to the government or destroyed. \nThe longtime family lawyer for the Clintons, who defended Bill during his impeachment days, worked alongside Clinton\u2019s lead lawyer David Kendall of Williams & Connolly to oversee the process whereby they selected which emails should be saved from a homemade personal server Clinton used during her State Department tenure. After the Clinton team finished scouring the messages, they had the server wiped clean, deleting the rest of the contents.\nAccording to the source close to Mills, two employees at Denver-based technology company Platte River Networks originally pulled the messages from the server, and a few lawyers under Kendall and Mills sifted through the messages to pull anything they thought could constitute a federal record.\n\n2016\n\n            By \nRachael Bade\n\nMills testified that they weren\u2019t trying to hide anything when Clinton decided to wipe the server and that they were over inclusive in what they thought might be a work-related message. Clinton has said the remaining, erased correspondence were \"personal\" in nature. \nPanel Republicans are skeptical that Clinton preserved all her work related emails \u2014 particularly after they discovered this spring about a dozen undisclosed Clinton emails in a separate set of messages they received from her longtime ally Sid Blumenthal. Those emails were work related, they argue, and should have been included. They suspect there could be more that didn't make the cut before the server was erased. \n\u201cChairman Gowdy is concerned with ensuring the Committee has a complete and responsive record, and understanding any facts or events that may have led to the committee not having a complete record,\u201d said Jamal Ware, committee spokesman. \nThe testimony comes just a few hours after a lawyer for Clinton\u2019s go-to IT staffer Bryan Pagliano said he\u2019d take the Fifth and refuse to answer potentially self-incriminating questions from the committee. The panel subpoenaed him in hopes of learning more about the server set-up the former State Secretary exclusively used for work, which was under tech guru Pagliano\u2019s charge.\n Clinton\u2019s use of private email as the nation\u2019s top diplomat has created significant headwinds for her current White House campaign, hurting her in the polls as some call into question her trustworthiness and transparency. Government officials are supposed to use official email to capture public records, but Clinton's unusual setup seems to have challenged that notion. State Department policy in effect at the time Clinton was in office called for the \"day-to-day\" work of the department to be done on official accounts and systems. Clinton's aides have argued that use of personal email was not exclusively prohibited.\nWhile probing a batch of the more than 35,000 emails Clinton turned over, an intelligence community watchdog found messages it argues were or should have been classified at the time they were created \u2014 never left on an unsecured server. The State Department has classifed 188 messeges but refuted the notion that they were classified when Cilnton and her top aides like Mills fowarded them around on an unsecured network. \n\n\n\n            By \nMarc Caputo\n\nStill, the intelligence community referred the matter to the FBI, which is probing the special email arrangement to learn if top secret information was ever put at risk. \nWhile Mills no longer works directly under Clinton, she still sits on the philanthropic Clinton Foundation board and advises the family from time to time, including on personal matters like closing on a house. She has a reputation for being blunt with a family that's used to being treated like royalty.\nAnd lawmakers in attendance say she was certainly charming. She emerged from her nearly 10-hour interview smiling and laughing with Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.). She stood beside the South Carolina Republican and lawmakers from both sides of the committee, and thanked them for their \u201cprofessionalism\" and \"respect\" and \"the work they're doing.\"\n\u201cObviously, the tragedy that happened in Benghazi was about more than what\u2019s happening in this room: it was about the loss of individuals who were dear to the State Department and dear to this country,\" she said. \"And we honor them by remembering what happened and doing our best to ensure that that doesn\u2019t happen again, so I\u2019m grateful for the chance I had to visit with the committee today.\u201d\nGowdy, likewise, thanked her for coming, said she answered every question they asked and told reporters that the committee would not be giving a read-out from the session. Lawmakers refused to answer questions about what happened in the room, and Mills likewise did not give interviews.\nThe cordial atmosphere was a surprisingly stark contrast from the way Blumenthal\u2019s deposition ended, with the witness saying the GOP asked him mostly about political items and how much he made, and Republicans questioning his integrity for passing the nation\u2019s chief diplomat information unvented intelligence on Libya.\nRep. Trey Gowdy is pictured. | Getty \n\"The dialogue was professional and fact-centric, and the members of the Benghazi committee on our side are going to treat the conversation as if its classified,\u201d was all Gowdy said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to answer any of your questions.\u201d\nTop panel Democrat Elijah Cumming (D-Md.), also in the same gaggle, did not accuse the panel of playing politics \u2014 though, hours before, he told reporters he felt the probe had \u201cturned into an [attempted] derailment of the Clinton nomination.\u201d\nMills told the Benghazi panel she was not aware if anyone raised red flags about Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email system at State \u2014 nor did anyone specifically approve the private server that she knew of, according to the source familiar with her testimony. \nMills said she was not involved in setting up the initial server, nor was she part of the decision to have it stored at Platte River Networks, a small start-up that was reported to have stored servers in a bathroom closet at one point. \nMills was one of several top State officials who forwarded Clinton a number of emails that the intelligence community now believes should have been classified. But she testified that she never knowingly mishandled classified documents.\nMessages came to Mills and her colleagues, often from foreign service officers out in the field around the world, on two different computers: one, a classified computer system that was protected and would have prevented the forwarding of any message outside a secure network; the other, an unclassified machine, which would have allowed staff to forward the messages. \nIn many instances, Mills received messages from the unclassified networks and forwarded them along to Clinton, although some of those messages were deemed classified after the fact.\nShe also said she never moved emails from a classified to an unclassified system. In an old 2010 email exchange released this week, Jake Sullivan, Clinton\u2019s top policy staffer who will testify before the panel Friday, explained to Clinton that he couldn\u2019t simply pull information off the classified computer and send it over an unsecured network, for example.\nMills also reiterated to the panel what Clinton\u2019s camp has consistently said about the Benghazi attack: She said she knows of no \u201cstand down order\u201d following the attacks, nor has she any knowledge of the U.S. moving weapons or knowing of other countries moving weapons to Libyan rebels. Conservatives suspected that the weapons used to overrun the compound that fateful Sept. 11, 2012 day may have come from a covert smuggling operation that went awry. \nFollowing the attack, Mill testified there was no cover up or attempt to mislead the American public about what happened. Shortly after the 2012 attacks, US Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice on national television blamed the attack on a protest against an anti-Islam documentary \u2014 a suggestion the intelligence community later said was false since it was a plotted terrorist attack. \nMills said they didn\u2019t know it was solely a terrorist attack until Sept. 21.\nAs for her own use of personal email, Mills testified, according to the source, that she used work email \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d and almost only used personal email when she was overseas, at home at night or when their State email otherwise didn\u2019t work. The source previewing the testimony also said she copied her State.gov addresses most of the time when she did go for personal email. \nMills has come under scrutiny for turning down a federal judge's request that she and Huma Abedin sign an affidavit swearing that she handed in all her federal documents. She testified, however, that she did turn them all in.\nJosh Gerstein contributed to this story.\n\n                                            By \nMichael Kazin\n\n\n                                            By \nRich Lowry\n\n\n                                            By \nBarney Frank\n\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "No work-related messages had been withheld or destroyed, she said.", "title": "What Cheryl Mills told Benghazi investigators", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/cheryl-mills-benghazi-testimony-213320", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["Anna Palmer", "Joe Biden", "Jorge Ramos", "Kim Davis", "Kamyl Bazbaz", "Rachael Bade", "Michael Kazin", "David Axelrod", "Hadas Gold", "Dylan Byers", "Sid Blumenthal", "Cheryl Mills", "Marc Caputo", "Bill O'Reilly", "Dylann Roof", "De Blasio", "Nahal Toosi", "Josh Gerstein", "Annie Karni", "Jake Sullivan", "Kate Bennett", "Huma Abedin", "Nick Gass", "Trey Gowdy", "Bryan Pagliano", "Robert Menendez", "Isaac Dovere", "David Kendall", "Jeb Bush", "Seung Min Kim", "Michael Lind", "Andrew Glass", "Donald Trump", "Mark Meadows", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Barney Frank", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Ben Schreckinger", "Mike Allen", "Daniel Strauss", "Hillary Clinton", "Rich Lowry", "Eli Stokols", "Darren Samuelsohn", "Andrea Mitchell", "Jamal Ware", "Edward Snowden"], "orgs": ["California Democratic Rep.
