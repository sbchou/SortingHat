(AP)\n\n            By \nHadas Gold\n\n10/20/15 11:45 AM EDT\nDonald Trump has canceled a planned appearance on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" the host said on Howard Stern's satellite radio show Tuesday.\nTrump was scheduled to appear on Tuesday night's show after rapper Jay Z. Kimmel, who is broadcasting his late night show out of Brooklyn this week, told Stern that Trump canceled on them late Monday night.\n\"Due to a political obligation, Mr. Trump is rescheduling his appearance and looks forward to being on the show in the next few weeks,\" a Trump spokeswoman told CNN.\nOn Stern's show on Tuesday, Kimmel said he wasn't sure what happened, but that they may move comedian Tracy Morgan to take his place. Morgan originally was scheduled to appear on the show later this week.\nKimmel told CNN in an earlier interview on Monday that Trump's appearance was not going to be a traditional interview.\n\"I'm not interviewing him ... It will be in studio, it'll be live, and it'll all make perfect sense when you see it,\" Kimmel said.\nIt's the second time in a month that a politician has canceled on a late-night host. Earlier this month, House Speaker John Boehner canceled a last-minute appearance on Jimmy Fallon's \"The Tonight Show\" after Rep. Kevin McCarthy abruptly pulled out of the race for House speaker.\nHadas Gold is a reporter at\u00a0Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Donald Trump was scheduled to appear on Tuesday night&#39;s show after rapper Jay Z.", "title": "Donald Trump cancels on Jimmy Kimmel", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2015/10/donald-trump-cancels-on-jimmy-kimmel-214958", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Joe Pompeo", "Chelsea Clinton", "Justin Trudeau", "Rachael Bade", "Jimmy Fallon", "Anna Palmer", "Hadas Gold", "Jimmy Kimmel", "Carla Marinucci", "Marc Caputo", "Kelsey Sutton", "Austin Wright", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Jeremy Herb", "Theodoric Meyer", "Caitlin Emma", "Elana Schor", "Aaron Schock", "Brianna Ehley", "Nick Gass", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Isaac Dovere", "Jeb Bush", "Seung Min Kim", "Michael Lind", "Andrew Glass", "Donald Trump", "John Bresnahan", "Reince Priebus", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Chase Purdy", "Sarah Wheaton", "Toby Eckert", "David Pittman", "Tim Starks", "Carly Fiorina", "Janosch Delcker", "Adam Sneed", "Adam Behsudi", "Hillary Clinton", "Ben White", "Marco Rubio", "Eric Wolff", "Stephen Harper", "Ben Carson", "Paul Ryan"], "orgs": ["Heritage Action", "House Benghazi Committee", "USB", "Congress", "FIORINA", "RNC", "Pentagon", "PAC", "IRS", "NYT", "Senate", "House GOP", "V.P.", "Stern", "Howard Stern", "CISA", "GOP", "The Economist Group", "House Select Committee"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30854, "fullname": "edward-isaac dovere", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-10-20 16:45:59", "org": "politico", "article_id": "56cc26f87ebffec67cf09e153458f626", "date_access": "2015-10-20 16:30:22.377583"}
