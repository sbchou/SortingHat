{"body": "  RICHMOND \u2014 When Gov. Terry McAuliffe goes to Austin next month to speak at the Texas Democrats\u2019 big fundraising dinner, he\u2019ll talk about what it takes to win in a state with a lot of Republican voters. But Crystal Perkins, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party, said there\u2019s another reason Virginia\u2019s Democratic governor can thrill a crowd. \u201cHe\u2019s very well known, of course, because he\u2019s been involved with both President Clinton, Secretary Clinton, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll have some good stories about that,\u201d she said. \u201cTexas Democrats love the Clintons. The Clintons are very popular in Texas.\u201d In the four months since McAuliffe\u2019s longtime friend Hillary Rodham Clinton made her White House bid official, McAuliffe has traveled to seven states to raise money, give speeches and stand in for the former secretary of state. Only one of the events was billed as an official presidential campaign activity, but McAuliffe\u2019s name is synonymous with the Clinton dynasty, making him the ideal person to spread her message in states she must win. Stephen Carter, spokesman for McAuliffe\u2019s political action committee, Common Good VA, said the governor\u2019s travel has been relatively light. \u201cThe Governor\u2019s out-of-state political travel this year can be measured in hours, not days. It pales in comparison to the political travel of his predecessors,\u201d he said in a statement. Yet the schedule could prove problematic for McAuliffe at home. The reality of his ambitious travel schedule is a departure from frequent assurances McAuliffe made \u2014 from before he took office until as recently as this summer \u2014 that he would not be a high-profile surrogate for Hillary Clinton. \u201cI\u2019ve done that. It\u2019s been a great part of my life, but to be honest with you, I\u2019m past the politics. I\u2019m now into governing,\u201d he told WWBT (Channel 12) in Richmond the week before he was sworn in to office. He added: \u201cI have so much responsibilities and duties sitting right here. .\u2009.\u2009. I\u2019ll be traveling, but it will be on behalf of the commonwealth to create new economic opportunities.\u201d McAuliffe often travels overseas to plant the Old Dominion\u2019s flag throughout Asia and Europe; plans are even in the works for a Cuba trade mission. That\u2019s all fine and good, as far as Republicans are concerned. But planting the flag for the Clintons \u2014 that\u2019s a fulfillment of everything they tried to warn voters about when the veteran fundraiser and political operative said he wanted to run Virginia, too. After all, they said, he was not only chairman of the Democratic National Committee but also chairman of Clinton\u2019s 2008 White House bid.  [See the 120 donors who gave to McAuliffe and the Clintons]  Chris LaCivita, the veteran GOP consultant who worked for McAuliffe\u2019s opponent in 2013 and now advises the presidential campaign of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), said Republicans are sure to seize on the McAuliffe-Clinton relationship.  \u201cAnyone who thinks that Terry McAuliffe isn\u2019t going to do whatever he has to do to ensure his BFF is elected president is living on another planet,\u201d LaCivita said. Mo Elleithee, who is both a former DNC communications director and Clinton adviser, said McAuliffe is loyal and has other goals. \u201cHe\u2019s got personal skin in the game: He\u2019s close with her, he wants her to win \u2014 there\u2019s no question of that. She\u2019s probably the one person whose political fortunes he cares about more than his own, and it raises his political profile,\u201d said Elleithee, executive director of Georgetown\u2019s Institute of Politics and Public Service. It\u2019s also important to McAuliffe that he can deliver Virginia, where a string of super-close races have raised the stakes for both parties. \u201cVirginia is the purplest shade of purple there is,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything that the governor and his political infrastructure can do now to get ready for that is critical. You don\u2019t want to backslide.\u201d McAuliffe\u2019s camp also noted that his recent travel has mostly consisted of day trips and that the rate of travel doesn\u2019t compare to how often past governors have hit the road for political causes. When now-Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D-Va.) was governor, he was scrutinized for devoting at least a day and a half of each workweek, by his estimation, to his fundraising and policy duties as DNC chairman. That\u2019s one reason advisers to Kaine\u2019s successor as governor, Robert F. McDonnell (R), put out his public and political schedule every Friday, said Tucker Martin, a longtime Virginia-based consultant who was McDonnell\u2019s communications director. McDonnell found himself performing the juggling act in 2012, when he had to balance the governorship with being chairman of the Republican Governors Association and a chief surrogate for then-presidential candidate Mitt Romney. \u201cWhen you\u2019re governor, you wear two hats. It\u2019s an elected position. You come into office via politics. It\u2019s not like the politics disappears the moment you cross the threshold to the governor\u2019s mansion,\u201d said Martin, who now advises America Leads, the sanctioned super PAC for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R).  If the past is any guide, McAuliffe is likely to continue that balancing act as well \u2014 between cutting ribbons in Virginia, wooing donors for Clinton and making sure Democratic activists don\u2019t get complacent. But if Texas is any guide, Democrats there could have a race on their hands come Super Tuesday. The last person to headline a big fundraising dinner for the party in the county that includes Austin?
