{"body": "A few months ago I wrote that the 2016 presidential primary looked to come down to Bloody versus Boring. The Republican race would be bloody\u2014more than a dozen candidates scrapping for attention, trying to gain traction, pounding each other. The Democrats would be boring, the long glide of the queen.\nOur late-summer report? Different. So far it\u2019s Exciting (24 million people watched the Republican debate!  Donald Trump set fire to the joint!) versus, I don\u2019t know, Ominous\u2014a big, dark, soggy cloud threatening at any moment to burst. Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign is not boring, but it\u2019s leading a considerable portion of the nation toward suicidal ideation. Do we have to go back there? Do we have to do this again? Will a Clinton candidacy ever be anything but scandal after scandal?\nMrs. Clinton often quotes Eleanor Roosevelt to the effect that a woman is like a tea bag\u2014you never know how strong she is until she gets in hot water. But it\u2019s been noted here that Hillary is the only tea bag that brings the hot water with her. There is always an air of furtive corruption; she dodges the press and then trolls them. This week\u2019s classic moment came when Ed Henry of Fox News persisted in asking whether she had wiped her private email server: \u201cWhat, like with a cloth or something?\u201d For all her experience, she still evades and stonewalls awkwardly.\nAs for the Trump phenomenon, a lot of people are still digesting it. The question has evolved from \u201cWill he have an impact?\u201d to \u201cCan he really win the nomination?\u201d to \u201cCould he actually be elected president?\u201d Philip Klein in the Washington Examiner had a smart piece suggesting Mr. Trump may have reached his peak; assuming his lead holds, it will seem less impressive as candidates begin to drop out and others consolidate their positions. That is possible, as is this: that as people watch Mr. Trump and get used to the idea of him they\u2019ll come to see things they like in his candidacy. No one knows, because we\u2019re in new territory, with a rogue real-estate developer and reality-TV star as a prime presidential prospect.\nA source of Mr. Trump\u2019s strength is that normal people understand how big donors have an impact on policy. Mr. Trump can stand where the people stand on such issues as immigration because the donor class doesn\u2019t have hooks in him. \u201cI\u2019m turning down so much money,\u201d he told reporters last week at the Iowa State Fair. If he accepted a big contribution, \u201cI\u2019d feel obligated, because I\u2019m a loyal person.\u201d On the other hand, \u201cJeb Bush is a puppet to his donors.\u201d On Thursday this newspaper\u2019s Heather Haddon reported that some major GOP donors are growing impatient with GOP candidates who\u2019ve withdrawn their support for Common Core. But Common Core is not popular, and they are trying to survive. I remember when donors just wanted dinner, or an ambassadorship. Now they want policy. Someone, not just Mr. Trump, should bop them hard.\nMr. Trump continued to smack Mr. Bush Wednesday night as they held dueling town halls in New Hampshire: \u201cI don\u2019t see how he\u2019s electable. Jeb Bush is a low-energy person. For him to get things done is hard.\u201d Mr. Bush\u2019s rejoinder seemed sodden, pro forma. \u201cMr. Trump doesn\u2019t have a proven conservative record. .\u00a0.\u00a0. He\u2019s given more money to Democrats than to Republicans. .\u00a0.\u00a0. He was for a tax on assets.\u201d\nMr. Bush appears to be no more gifted a campaigner than Mrs. Clinton, though he lacks the vaguely sinister air. Many people complain about the potentially dynastic nature of the coming election, but unspoken in the complaint is the sense that if it has to come down to two families over and over in a nation of 330 million, couldn\u2019t the families be marked by a special and distinguished genius?\nWe finish with John Kasich, re-elected governor of Ohio last year by 31 points, which speaks, if not of genius, at least of talent. His entrance in the race shook things up in New Hampshire, where a month after his late announcement he went to No.\u00a03 in the polls. What distinguishes him in my mind is that everyone who writes about politics gets phone calls from presidential candidates, and they\u2019re always about big things\u2014immigration, spending, regulation, national security. But whenever Mr. Kasich has called, the conversation has gone to the mentally ill young, the drug-addicted and what\u2019s happening on the ground in America. What is he hearing about the heroin epidemic in New Hampshire, where admissions to state-run rehab facilities are dramatically up? \u201cI talk about it a lot because I know this stuff,\u201d he said in an interview last week. \u201cI got involved five years ago, when a group of ladies in southern Ohio came to me with pictures of their sons, athletes, who died of drug overdoses.\u201d He spoke of \u201can entire generation that is vulnerable to this because of the casual way we treated prescription drugs\u2014then on to heroin.\u201d\nHis answer? Flood the zone with education, treatment, law enforcement, more programs in the schools\u2014\u201c Nancy Reagan was right, talk about it, air it.\u201d He adds: \u201cRevive a sense of citizenship. If you see a kid you don\u2019t know, walk up to him, say, \u2018Please don\u2019t ever do drugs.\u2019 People say, \u2018Why would anyone do that?\u2019 I say, \u2018To help save your country.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nI don\u2019t gather Mr. Kasich is talking about \u201ccompassionate conservatism,\u201d a generalized increase in various forms of spending, but something else: being alive and responsive to actual crises in American society. \u201cThere\u2019s an arithmetic side of this but there\u2019s a moral side,\u201d he said. It costs more to keep drug addicts in prison than to get them \u201con their feet and paying taxes.\u201d And \u201cyou don\u2019t throw people away. At least I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did conservatives allow themselves to be put in a trap,\u201d he asks, in which they\u2019re afraid to talk about these things? \u201cI balanced the budget in Ohio, I spent 10 years trying to balance the U.S. budget, I\u2019ve cut taxes more than any living governor, we have a rock-solid credit rating. And because I care about the mentally ill and drug addicted and those in prison, that\u2019s not conservative? I believe that helping people have opportunity is all about conservatism. My mother used to say it\u2019s a sin not to help people who need help but equally a sin to continue to help people who need to learn how to help themselves.\u201d Mr. Kasich has an unembarrassed heart.\nThere\u2019s some interesting talent in the Republican field, and maybe something else is going on. Americans are political but they aren\u2019t ideologues, they don\u2019t walk around with a list. Various candidates, under the pressure of the rise of Mr. Trump, are refiguring their emphasis and approach on certain issues. Something in Mr. Trump himself\u2014the fact that his candidacy has garnered such support in spite of his past and present heterodox stands\u2014has revealed a Republican base that is not as much in lockstep as it has been long portrayed, not as predictable.
