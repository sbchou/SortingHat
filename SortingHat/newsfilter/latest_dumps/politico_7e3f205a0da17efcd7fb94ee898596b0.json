And that has major implications for House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, likely the next speaker of the House, as Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan write for POLITICO: \u201cCongress will need to figure out how to increase the nation\u2019s borrowing limit, prevent a government shutdown, and keep money flowing to highway projects. Any one of those issues would an enormous lift; now all three will fall on a House Republican Conference in flux, with a new speaker, majority leader and majority whip expected to be elected next week but not take over until November.\u201d \nStory Continued Below\n--\"Should Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) ascend to the speakership, which looks more likely by the day, he'll have to decide whether to spend valuable \u2014 and limited \u2014 political capital in the first few days of his speakership on a treacherous debt limit vote, or to leave it to Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to jam it through in the waning days of his reign \u2026 Some aides wonder if Boehner will push a debt ceiling increase across the floor and then immediately resign, handing McCarthy the speakership before Nov. 1.\u201d http://goo.gl/imRkk5\n--Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) wants a budget deal that would also increase the debt limit into 2017, per CNN\u2019s Manu Raju: http://goo.gl/Hln0xQ\nOBAMA CHASTISES INACTION ON GUN VIOLENCE \u2013 The New York Times\u2019 Gardiner Harris and Michael D. Shear: \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s rage about gun massacres, building for years, spilled out Thursday night as he acknowledged his own powerlessness to prevent another tragedy and pleaded with voters to force change themselves \u2026 Mr. Obama admitted that he was unable to do anything to prevent such tragedies by himself. And he did little to try to hide the anger and frustration that have deepened as he returns again and again to the White House lectern in the wake of a deadly mass shooting.\u201d http://goo.gl/boszXH\n--From the Washington Post, \u201cThere\u2019s been no calendar week without a mass shooting during President Obama\u2019s second term.\u201d http://goo.gl/hrK67w\n--@ChrisMurphyCT: \u201cThis is on us. Silence from Congress has become quiet endorsement of those whose minds unhinge and veer toward mass violence.\u201d\n--Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) rips Congress in a statement last night: \u201cAfter each shooting, I\u2019ve been hopeful that Congress would act to close the gun show loophole, mandate universal background checks and remove high-capacity magazines and military-style assault weapons from our streets. But each time the will of the American public, who overwhelmingly support reform, is trumped by politics. Rather than taking real action, Congress remains hostage to the gun lobby. And that is the undeniable truth.\u201d\nHOUSE RENEWS EX-IM PUSH \u2013 The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Nick Timiraos and Kristina Peterson: \u201cA vote to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank by using a rarely successful legislative procedure gained support Thursday from centrist House Republicans \u2026 Rep. Stephen Fincher (R., Tenn.) introduced a bill in January to reauthorize the bank until 2019 and last week filed a slightly different bill with the same text the Senate approved in July. The process Mr. Fincher initiated on Wednesday requires him to wait seven legislative days before he can file the [discharge] petition and another seven days before it can come up for a vote.\u201d\n--In addition to [Illinois GOP Rep. Adam] Kinzinger, Reps. Ryan Costello (R., Pa.), David Jolly (R., Fla.) and Frank Lucas (R., Okla.) also said Thursday they planned to support the discharge petition. And House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) signaled support for Mr. Fincher\u2019s petition Thursday \u2026 [House Majority Leader Kevin] McCarthy strongly discourages lawmakers from participating in any effort to force a vote on the bill, a spokesman said.\u201d http://goo.gl/BkhFj2\n--HuffPost Hill on Ex-Im: \u201cThat thing Republicans fight amongst themselves about that nobody else understands or cares about is in the news again.\u201d\nHAPPY FRIDAY, October 2, 2015, and welcome to the Huddle.

Watch it here: http://goo.gl/Kwykak\nMCCARTHY\u2019S BENGHAZI MESS, DAY 2 \u2013Alan Fram of the AP writes about the continued fallout over McCarthy\u2019s comments tying the House investigation into the Benghazi attacks to Hillary Clinton\u2019s poll numbers: \u201cHouse Republicans called on the chamber's likely next speaker Thursday to apologize for crediting the House Benghazi investigation panel with wounding Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential campaign \u2026 \u2018I think it's a total mischaracterization of the good work that's been done on the Benghazi committee,\u2019 Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said.\u201d \n--\u201cRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., expressed similar sentiments to Chaffetz on Thursday, saying, \u2018I think he should apologize to the families because his statement jeopardizes the committee's work and trivializes it.\u2019 \u2026 [Speaker John] Boehner sought to move beyond McCarthy's comments, saying Thursday that the Benghazi panel's work has not been driven by a focus on Clinton and that its work will continue.\u201d http://goo.gl/MtjAJY\n--Chaffetz said he personally told McCarthy that he should apologize for the Benghazi remarks. CQ Roll Call\u2019s Emma Dumain: http://goo.gl/xfM74r\nBERNIE OPEN TO OBAMACARE FOR UNDOCUMENTED \u2013 Ed O\u2019Keefe and John Wagner for WaPo: \"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders supports allowing some of the nation's undocumented immigrants to obtain health-care coverage under the Affordable Care Act, he told [the Congressional Hispanic Caucus] on Thursday \u2026 Aides later said that Sanders believes that in certain cases, undocumented immigrants should be able to purchase health insurance through the exchanges set up under Obamacare, using their own money. The senator has not advocated allowing the undocumented immigrants to receive federal subsidies, his aides said.\u201d http://goo.gl/yCQxQr\nSENATE HOLDS SYRIAN REFUGEE HEARING \u2013 USA Today\u2019s Alan Gomez: \u201cThe first congressional hearing examining President Obama's plan to bring more Syrian refugees into the U.S. came down to a debate between security and compassion \u2026With so many people coming from the war-torn region, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, used Thursday's hearing to question how the U.S. government could possibly screen so many people for terrorist ties with so little access to their backgrounds.\u201d http://goo.gl/es2tVt\nTHURSDAY\u2019S TRIVIA WINNER \u2013 So, there were a couple of correct answers to the question of which perennial candidate has the record for number of times on a presidential ballot. (Our bad). The answer we had was Norman Thomas, who ran as a candidate for the Socialist Party of America six times, and James Casto was the first to respond with that answer. Senate Majority Leader (and Huddle trivia player extraordinaire) Mitch McConnell also chimed in with Thomas as the response. \nWe should\u2019ve clarified that we were seeking the record of the candidate who actually got the nomination, not who ran in the primaries. So a lot of people responded with Harold Stassen, who ran for the Republican Party nomination 10 times (Ron Lattin was the first to point this out). \nTODAY\u2019S TRIVIA \u2013 John Clark has today\u2019s question: What congressman from what state and in what year introduced a bill to abolish the Senate, and which constitutional amendment did it ultimately trigger?
