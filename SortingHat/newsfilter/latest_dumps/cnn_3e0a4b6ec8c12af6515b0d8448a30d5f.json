{"body": " (CNN)Donald Trump's campaign said Saturday it has fired top political adviser Roger Stone.\n\"Mr. Trump fired Roger Stone last night. We have a tremendously successful campaign and Roger wanted to use the campaign for his own personal publicity. He has had a number of articles about him recently and Mr. Trump wants to keep the focus of the campaign on how to Make America Great Again,\" a campaign spokesperson told CNN.\nStone, however, told CNN that he quit, and provided what he said was his resignation letter.\n\"Unfortunately, the current controversies involving personalities and provocative media fights have reached such a high volume that it has distracted attention from your platform and overwhelmed your core message. With this current direction of the candidacy, I no longer can remain involved in your campaign,\" the letter says. \nStone added: \"I care about you as a friend and wish you well. Be assured I will continue to be vocal and active in the national debate to ensure our nation does not again turn to the failed and distrusted Bush/Clinton families.\"\n", "byline": "", "description": "Donald Trump's campaign said Saturday it has fired top political adviser Roger Stone.\n    \n", "title": "Top adviser fired?", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/08/politics/donald-trump-campaign-roger-stone/index.html", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Roger Stone"], "orgs": ["America Great Again"], "authors": [{"author_id": 3149, "fullname": "mj lee", "primary_org": "cnn"}, {"author_id": 2527, "fullname": "dana bash", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-08-08 19:54:48", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "3e0a4b6ec8c12af6515b0d8448a30d5f", "date_access": "2015-08-08 19:00:04.629215"}
