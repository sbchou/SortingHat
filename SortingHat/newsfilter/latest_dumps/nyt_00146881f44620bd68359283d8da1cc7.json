{"body": "Good Wednesday morning. The fate of the nuclear deal with Iran was high on the to-do list of lawmakers returning from vacation. But on Wednesday, the debate leaps to the front of the campaign trail as Hillary Rodham Clinton is set to speak to its merits, and Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are holding a rally at the Capitol to tell the expected crowd of thousands what they think about the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d deal.\n\nMrs. Clinton will give a sweeping speech in Washington on Wednesday on the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 the seeds of which were sown while she was secretary of state \u2014 and will call for measures \u201cdeterring Iran and its proxies,\u201d bolstering allies in the region, and strengthening enforcement to ensure the accord works.\nAccording to excerpts from her speech released by her campaign on Tuesday evening, Mrs. Clinton plans to say that she supports the deal \u201cas part of a larger strategy toward Iran.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to be clear eyed about what we can expect from Iran,\u201d Mrs. Clinton is expected to say. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the start of some broader diplomatic opening. And we shouldn\u2019t expect that this deal will lead to a broader change in their behavior. That shouldn\u2019t be a premise for proceeding.\u201d\n\nA senior campaign official laid out key points in her speech. Chief among them is that part of the enforcement of the deal should include reaffirming a commitment to Israel, including bolstering support to its defense systems, as well as finding new ways to cut off lifelines to Hezbollah, a militant group in Lebanon with close ties to Iran. She will also call for other enforcement measures, including closely monitoring human rights abuses and other offenses.\n\nFor Mrs. Clinton, backing the deal comes with the risk of angering some of her more conservative supporters of Israel who have opposed the accord, and some of her major donors. But the talks that led to the agreement began under her watch, when she dispatched Jake Sullivan, now her campaign policy adviser, to Oman for secret negotiations in 2012. She can claim a piece of the deal\u2019s legacy if it is seen as effective.\n\nAnd giving a strong speech as she hopes to begin moving past the controversy over her emails could help remind her supporters why they see her as a strong potential president.\n\n\u2014 Maggie Haberman\n\nWhat We\u2019re Watching Today\n\n\u2013 Jeb Bush will outline a series of tax policy proposals at a manufacturing business in Garner, N.C., as part of an economic plan that would \u201ccreate 19 million new jobs and raise middle-class incomes,\u201d according to his campaign. He previewed the policies in an op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday evening.\n\n\u2013 Mr. Obama and Jill Biden will travel to Warren, Mich., where they will deliver remarks at the Michigan Technical Education Center announcing \u201cnew steps to expand apprenticeships and to continue to build momentum nationwide to make community college free for responsible students,\u201d the White House says.\n\nOur Favorites From Today\u2019s Times\n\n\u2013 A forthcoming biography of Mr. Trump, who received draft deferments for the Vietnam War, quotes him as likening his time at a military school to military service, and portrays him as preoccupied by winning and self-promotion since childhood.\n\n\u2013 Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, captured the political spotlight on Tuesday, rallying to the side of Kim Davis, the Kentucky clerk who was jailed after refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples, and casting her fight as a choice between tyranny and religious freedom.\n\n\u2013 And Mr. Bush appeared on the premiere of \u201cThe Late Show\u201d with Stephen Colbert, where his host asked him policy questions about education and gun control, and advised him to be \u201cTrumpier\u201d and say things like \u201cI will build a wall between the United States and Iran.\u201d\n\nBulletins: Hillary Clinton in the News\n\n\u2013 Mrs. Clinton presented a set of campaign finance overhaul proposals on Tuesday that would curb anonymous political donations and bolster the influence of small donors.\n\n\u2013 Mrs. Clinton also apologized for using a private email server while secretary of state, saying what many supporters had been wanting to hear in hopes that she would quell the controversy that has overshadowed her presidential campaign.\n\n\u2013 On Tuesday afternoon, she taped an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, to air on Thursday, in a show that offers Mrs. Clinton an opportunity to reach female voters who do not consume traditional news media.\n\n\u2013 And in a new national poll, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lead among Democrats has slipped, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has climbed.\n\nWhat We\u2019re Reading Elsewhere\n\n\u2013 Mr. Cruz invited Mr. Trump to share the Iran rally stage with him, The Associated Press writes, in an attempt to court Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters and present himself to them as a viable alternative.\n\n\u2013 Rick Perry has closed his campaign office in South Carolina, CNN reports, soon after cutting staff members and payroll there.\n\n\u2013 And Ben Carson criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals to deport all illegal immigrants, NBC News reports, saying that the idea \u201csounds really cool,\u201d but that it would be too costly and unpractical.", "byline": "THE NEW YORK TIMES", "description": "The debate over the Iran nuclear deal leaps to the front of the campaign trail as Hillary Rodham Clinton is set to speak to its merits, and Donald J.
