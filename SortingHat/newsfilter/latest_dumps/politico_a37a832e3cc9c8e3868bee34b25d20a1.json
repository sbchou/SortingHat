This course has proven that every Soldier, regardless of gender, can achieve his or her full potential. We owe soldiers the opportunity to serve successfully in any position where they are qualified and capable, and we continue to look for ways to select, train, and retain the best Soldiers to meet our nation\u2019s needs,\u201d Army Secretary John McHugh said in a statement on Monday evening. \n The women, however, are not eligible to apply to join the 75th Ranger Regiment, a special operations force, as the Defense Department has not yet decided on combat roles for women. Those decisions are expected later this year. \nPOLITICO PRO\n Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush hailed their impending graduation, remarking that they should be allowed to serve in combat roles. \n The comments came at an event Tuesday sponsored by the South Carolina chapter of Americans for Peace, Prosperity and Security. \n \u201cThese decisions ought to be made by the military,\u201d not by Washington politics, Bush said, noting that he would place the troops\u2019 esprit de corps above imposing a political agenda. \n This was the first year that women could enter Ranger School, after President Barack Obama asked the Pentagon in 2013 to open up all service branches to women in combat roles by 2016. \n \u201cI am very pleased; it is proof that if we open up these opportunities to women that there are qualified women that can be able to engage in combat,\u201d former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told Foreign Policy, adding that opening the door to women who wish to serve in combat roles is to the benefit of the country. \n From 2010 to 2014, the course had a 42 percent graduation rate, according to Fort Benning\u2019s website. \n\n                                            By \nAmb.
