When I was out at the conference at Maryland's National Harbor, I heard Chris Christie say he doesn\u2019t subscribe to the New York Times. I heard Rep. Marsha Blackburn tick off the names of the television networks: CNN (Clinton News Network), NBC (Nobody But Clinton), CBS (Clinton BS network...) And while Scott Walker mostly bashed Washington, he said in a USA Friday op-ed that \u201cwhen we refuse to take the media's bait, we suffer\u2026.\n\n\u201cI will always choose to focus on what matters to the American people, not what matters to the media.\u201d\n\nThe Donald has a strangely symbiotic relationship with the media. He loves the attention, basks in the spotlight, has a genius for generating headlines. At the same time he loves to pick fights with journalists, attack them on Twitter, and assume the role of aggrieved party.\u00a0\n\nRight now he is courting the media, or at least trying to persuade them that he may well be a full-fledged presidential candidate this time around. Never mind that Trump makes these noises every four years. Never mind that he sustained the tease for a long period in 2011, before re-upping his NBC deal for \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nTrump told the Washington Post he is \u201cmore serious\u201d this time:\n\n\u201cEverybody feels I\u2019m doing this just to have fun or because it\u2019s good for the brand,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not fun. I\u2019m not doing this for enjoyment. I\u2019m doing this because the country is in serious trouble.\u201d\n\nBut the press pack remains skeptical, and as much as I'd enjoy covering a campaign of Trumpian dimensions, I'm in that camp as well. A zillionaire is going to put himself through a two-year grind, share a stage with a dozen or two dozen opponents, and disclose his finances?\u00a0\n\nLet's say Trump actually does run. His approval ratings are lousy: 68 percent unfavorable among Iowa Republicans, 69 percent unfavorable among New Hampshire Republicans. So there\u2019s not exactly a draft.\n\nTrump is the epitome of the 1 percent. He lost plenty of luster when he touted the birther questions against President Obama. Some of his casinos have gone bankrupt. And what happens when the press starts digging into his business dealings and tax breaks?\n\nSome people will undoubtedly be drawn to his bombastic style and us-and-them rhetoric. He can blanket the airwaves with ads and not have to beg a bunch of donors for cash.\u00a0\n\nBut Trump is 68, slightly older than Hillary, and has long since come to be viewed as an entertainer who dabbles in politics. Can he turn that image around?\u00a0\n\nTrump probably benefits more from the flirtation phase of 2016 than the consummation phase. I suspect that before long he\u2019ll be back on TV firing people. But I\u2019m happy to be proven wrong.\n\nClick here for more Media Buzz\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmedia-buzz\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMedia Buzz, hosted by Howard Kurtz, airs on Sundays at 11AM and 5PM ET on Fox News Channel.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore on this show\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t", "byline": "", "description": "Donald Trump is riding to the rescue \u2014 of the country (as he sees it), of the Republicans (as few see it), of the media (as I see it).", "title": "Trump\u2019s tantalizing talk of running: Why the media aren\u2019t buying", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/p0b7C111FO4/", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "personality"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Chris Christie", "Marsha Blackburn", "Scott Walker", "Howard Kurtz"], "orgs": ["New Hampshire Republicans"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-02-27 10:00:03", "org": "fox", "article_id": "e54f3b7d1bc2eb3107ae6af2abbf6469", "date_access": "2015-02-27 18:27:10.437403"}
