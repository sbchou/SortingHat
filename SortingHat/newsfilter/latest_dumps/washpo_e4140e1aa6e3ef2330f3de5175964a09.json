{"body": "   Sen. Marco Rubio this spring (Reuters/Gary Cameron)  DANA POINT, Calif.\u2013 Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) pronounced\u00a0himself \u201cdeeply\u201d concerned about racial profiling Sunday but then said that he is not sure Congress can do much about it. Fielding questions during the Koch network donor summit at a luxury resort on the Pacific Ocean, the Republican presidential candidate was asked about the spate of African American deaths at the hands of law enforcement, from Texas to Ohio and Missouri.   \u201cI don\u2019t think we as a society can ignore that in many communities across this country the relationship between local law enforcement and the African American community is at an all-time low,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bottom line is you have millions of Americans, particularly young African-American males, who feel like police departments target them on a regular basis.\u201d  After saying he has \u201ctremendous respect\u201d for law enforcement, Rubio volunteered that he personally knows people \u201cwho have told me they have been stopped, in any given year, 10 to 12 times.\u201d  \u201cAnd they believe they are being targeted because of their race,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is deeply concerning.\u201d   But Rubio had no federal prescription to treat this dire diagnosis.    \u201cI don\u2019t know if there is a law we can pass in Congress to change that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do think it is incumbent upon local communities to improve the relationship between law enforcement and the community that they are there to serve and protect.\u201d   \u00a0 \n   David Koch in 2013 (Phelan M. Ebenhack/AP)  DANA POINT, Calif. \u2014 Seven sitting governors, six incumbent senators and two House members \u2014 all Republicans \u2014 have flown\u00a0here this weekend for the Koch donor network conference. There are 450 donors at a seaside resort here, and the network of conservative advocacy groups they fund aims to spend $889 million in advance of the next White House election.

The Washington Post is one of nine news organizations allowed in to cover the traditionally private confab, on the condition that the donors present not be named without their permission. \nAnother batch of Hillary Clinton e-mails released by the State Department Friday included this little gem showing her inner circle waxing effusive over her dancing skills. With the subject line: \u201cSecretary of Awesome,\u201d a Clinton top aide e-mailed around a glowing article in New York Magazine (this one) with a video of her boss dancing with locals in Nairobi, Kenya. In the August 2009 e-mail chain, the Clinton allies offer lavish praise for Clinton\u2019s \u201cboogieing\u201d skills. (She does get pretty low, low, low.) Minyon Moore, who is African-American, wrote back, \u201cshe moves like a Sistah\u2026.. this is fabulous.\u201d Kiki McLean, another confidante, replied, \u201cShe is the Secretary of Awesome\u2026..and us blondes like to see our fellow fair hairs boogy.\u201d Cheryl Mills, who sent the link around to the group, forwarded it to Clinton too. \u201cYou shake your tail feathers girl,\u201d she wrote. Perhaps that encouragement inspired the former secretary to shimmy down again three years later in South Africa, as the Loop reported at the time.
