{"body": "\u201cIn Latin America, Gego is like a goddess, in the same way Frida Kahlo has a myth around her, but she is not so known in America,\u201d the gallerist Dominique L\u00e9vy said of the artist Gertrud Goldschmidt, whose delicate, three-dimensional geometric compositions expanded the possibilities of kinetic art. Born in Germany, Gego \u2014 the childhood nickname stuck \u2014 escaped anti-Semitism in Hamburg in 1939, at age 27, and fled to Venezuela, where she lived until her death in 1994.\n\nNow the Fundaci\u00f3n Gego is collaborating with the Dominique L\u00e9vy galleries on complementary exhibitions in New York (Sept. 10) and London (2016). Gego trained as an architect and experimented with techniques of \u201cdrawing\u201d in space using metal wire, nylon thread and telephone cables that she engineered into labyrinths.\n\nHer sculpture \u201cSphere\u201d was acquired in 1959 by the Museum of Modern Art, which included her in its landmark 1965 exhibition of Op Art, \u201cThe Responsive Eye.\u201d\n\n\u201cGego completely redefined what drawing can be,\u201d said Ms. L\u00e9vy, who for the New York show will reconstitute the artist\u2019s entire \u201cChorros\u201d (\u201cStreams\u201d) series \u2014 18 sculptures that have not been seen together since 1971, at the Betty Parsons Gallery in New York.\n\nIntertwined segments of aluminum, stainless steel, iron and bronze will rain down from ceiling to floor, creating a kind of forest. Another floor will include \u201cdrawings without paper,\u201d made from rods, copper wire, metal beads and washers suspended precariously inside frames.\n\nGego\u2019s art reflected flux in her own life, \u201cbeing expelled and making a new culture as an immigrant,\u201d Ms. L\u00e9vy said. \u201cA lot of these wires are about displacement and dismantlement and recreating roots.\u201d", "byline": "HILARIE M.
