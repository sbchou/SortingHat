Heidi Heitkamp told the Fargo Forum on Tuesday that she will decide soon whether to run for governor next year \u2014 which could lead to a special election for her vulnerable Senate seat in 2017 (Heitkamp is up for reelection to the Senate in the 2018 midterms). \u201cI know that there is a need for me to say, to actually make this decision so that others who might be considering it in the Democratic Party can have the most amount of time.\u201d\n\u2014 The Forum asked her if she\u2019s facing pressure from national Democrats to stay in the Senate, Heitkamp said she\u2019s heard from people on both sides of the debate, but, she added: \u201cThe wishes of the national Democratic Party are the furthest thing from my mind as I make this decision.\u201d\n\u2014 One name to strike from the list: at-large GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer. He told the Forum he would stay put in the House.\n\u2014 The full story: http://bit.ly/1Ieq8cH\nSEE YOU BACK IN ARLINGTON? \u2014 Former Rep. Davis loses Montgomery, Ala., mayoral race: Five years ago, then-Democratic Rep. Artur Davis gave up his safe House seat for an ill-fated run for Alabama governor, seeking to become that state\u2019s first African-American chief executive. Davis then moved to Virginia, became a Republican and immediately flirted with bids for Congress and the General Assembly. He never pulled the trigger on those and moved back to Montgomery last year to run for mayor \u2014 a campaign that came to a crashing conclusion Tuesday night, when the incumbent, Todd Strange, easily dispatched Davis. With about 90 percent of the vote counted, Strange led Davis, 56 percent to 27 percent, the Montgomery Advertiser reports. As for Davis\u2019 future plans, he pledged \u201cyou will see me four years from now.\u201d http://on.mgmadv.com/1JkOO7k\n\u2014 Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton was also easily reelected Tuesday night, in what the Arizona Republic called \u201cone of the least competitive city contests in recent years.\u201d http://azc.cc/1JjF2lX\nDays until the 2015 election: 69.

It\u2019s a rare instance of foreign policy driving the debate in congressional races \u2014 in an off year, no less \u2014 and a potential preview of things to come if the Iran pact continues to generate heat into next year. Republicans are trying to portray Democrats backing the deal as weak on Israel and national defense. And some Democratic hopefuls are going after opponents for not taking a stand.\u201d http://politi.co/1K1VDOA\nTALLAHASSEE TURMOIL \u2014 A Florida circuit judge will request further directions from the state Supreme Court on how to respond to the state legislature\u2019s failure to pass a new congressional map during a special session this month. \u201cI\u2019m just going to ask them what they want me to do,\u201d Judge Terry Lewis said at a hearing Tuesday afternoon in Tallahassee. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give me a lot of discretion, that I can see.\u201d\n\u2014 \u201cGraham chides Florida Legislature for redistricting failure,\u201d by POLITICO Florida\u2019s Christine Sexton in Tallahassee: \u201cRep. Gwen Graham chastised Florida legislators on Wednesday for not agreeing on a new congressional map, but made clear that she has no plans to try to influence the eventual outcome. \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a congressperson\u2019s place to be advocating one way or another,\u2019 Graham said on Tuesday when asked whether she would join the lawsuit that Rep. Corrine Brown filed in federal court. ... \u2018I find it unfortunate that a non-gerrymandered district has been cut in half,\u2019 Graham said. \u2018This is just common sense looking at it that is not in line with what Fair Districts intended to accomplish.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/1hd1zHo\n2016 IN TWO MINUTES \u2014 \n\u2014 \u201cBehind the Biden hype,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Glenn Thrush: \u201cThe Joe Biden who has been reaching out to Democratic operatives and would-be donors for a potential 2016 bid isn\u2019t quite the happy warrior of bygone days. Mourning the loss of his eldest son Beau, who succumbed to a brain tumor three months ago, and under intense pressure from the presidential hype he\u2019s helped stoke, Biden is more subdued, grayer, and grimly on-task than usual \u2014 this while occupying political center stage for the first time since the promising open days of his doomed 1988 campaign. ... Several people Biden has talked to in the past month say he starts off conversations by conceding that \u2018some days are better than others,\u2019 mixing recollections of Beau with logistical questions about mounting a state-by-state challenge to a vulnerable yet still formidable Hillary Clinton. \u2018He\u2019s just not himself,\u2019 says a longtime friend of Biden\u2019s. \u2018He\u2019s sort of all over the place. He\u2019s engaged but not in that child-like, manic way he usually is. He\u2019s taking it all in and soaking up information, but he\u2019s hard to read. And Joe Biden isn\u2019t usually that hard to read.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/1PSEmq9\n\u2014 \u201cGOP revels in Biden buzz,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Katie Glueck: \u201cAfter enduring months of ridicule fueled by Donald Trump, whose frequent outrageous comments have forced a number of GOP rivals into a corner, and as a seemingly endless parade of Republican contenders have jumped into the presidential race, there\u2019s a sense of schadenfreude at the idea of Biden mounting a late-in-the-game run and mixing up the Democratic field. \u2018We\u2019re constantly denounced as a circus, a clown show, a clown car,\u201d said GOP pollster Kellyanne Conway, adding that competition has been good for the Republican field. But, she went on to add, \u2018Pardon us if we\u2019ve got the giggles over watching the Democrats, the so-called Democratic front-runner, hear [competitors\u2019] footsteps and what was meant to be a runaway victory, what was meant to be a coronation, becomes their own\u2026version of a clown car.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/1LwrvIL\n\u2014 \u201cTrump\u2019s newest media brawl,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Annie Karni in Dubuque, Iowa: \u201cThe Univision anchor in the front of row of Donald Trump\u2019s pre-rally press conference in Iowa piped up to ask a question as the Q&A began. Then Jorge Ramos quickly became the surprise star of the news cycle, the latest to present itself in Trump\u2019s unapologetic, take-no-prisoners spectacle of a campaign. ... Tension in the room mounted as it became clear to reporters that it would not be Trump\u2019s answers, but the fight itself, that was becoming the story. After almost two minutes of heated back and forth, Trump\u2019s security detail grabbed Ramos and physically removed him from the room.\u201d http://politi.co/1EjRxPJ\n\u2014 \u201cPerry presidential run on death watch,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Alex Isenstadt and Katie Glueck: \u201cThe former Texas governor, who hoped he would fare better in this presidential election than in his disastrous 2012 try, is poised to reorganize his already under-funded and under-manned staff in Iowa \u2014 a development that some of his top aides concede may be the beginning of the end. ... While the campaign did not detail the changes, some on the call said they expect them to be dramatic. One Republican operative in Iowa said that half a dozen Perry staffers currently working in the state contacted him on Monday to inquire about job prospects. Also on Monday, Sam Clovis, Perry\u2019s Iowa co-chairman and a prized operative, announced that he was departing the campaign, and on Tuesday confirmed that he was defecting to be national campaign co-chair and senior policy adviser to Donald Trump, who has zoomed to the top of the pack.\u201d http://politi.co/1JtYQA1\n\u2014 \u201cColorado Republicans cancel 2016 presidential caucus vote,\u201d by the Denver Post\u2019s John Frank: \u201cColorado will not pick a Republican candidate for president in its 2016 caucus after party leaders approved a little-noticed shift that is likely to diminish the swing state's clout in the most open nomination contest in the modern era. The GOP executive committee voted [last] Friday to cancel the traditional presidential preference poll at the caucus after the national party changed its rules to require a state's delegates to support the candidate that wins. The move makes Colorado the only state so far to forfeit a role in the early nomination process, according to experts, but other states are still considering what to do.\u201d http://dpo.st/1PQS5O6\n\u2014 \u201cJeb Bush set to release \u2018Reply All,\u2019 an e-book based on emails from his time as governor,\u201d by the Tampa Bay Times\u2019 Alex Leary: \u201cJeb Bush\u2019s e-book about his tenure as governor goes on pre-sale at Amazon at midnight, and his campaign shared a chapter from 2004 \u2014 a year dominated by hurricanes that profoundly tested the state and Bush\u2019s leadership skills. \u2018Eleven years later it still does not seem possible that four major storms slammed into our state in six weeks. They did, though, and we got through it,\u2019 Bush writes in Reply All, which draws on hundreds of thousands of emails to and from Bush from officials and ordinary people. Bush\u2019s handling of the hurricanes drew widespread praise and he intends to highlight it during a town hall [Wednesday] in Pensacola.\u201d http://bit.ly/1fF0aZg\nSNEAK PEEK \u2014 The Democratic National Committee plans to hit the GOP presidential field today on the 95th anniversary of women\u2019s suffrage for \u201cpolicy positions that will take women backwards.\u201d\nCODA \u2014 QUOTE OF THE DAY: \"Ladies and gentlemen, I still intend to be the next mayor of Montgomery, Alabama.\" \u2014 Artur Davis, after losing Tuesday\u2019s mayoral election http://on.mgmadv.com/1JkPda7\nBy BEN WOFFORD\nBy CASEY MICHEL\nBy PETER SUDERMAN\nBy JACK SHAFER\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Heitkamp promises decision on governor's race 'sooner rather than later.'", "title": "Heitkamp promises decision on governor\u2019s race \u2018sooner rather than later\u2019 -- How the Iran deal is playing in Senate races", "url": "http://www.politico.com/morningscore/0815/morningscore19793.html", "topics": ["trade", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Jeb Bush", "Burgess Everett", "Kellyanne Conway", "Gwen Graham", "Todd Strange", "Elena Schneider", "John Frank", "Kevin Cramer", "Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton", "Steven Shepard", "Christine Sexton", "Joe Biden", "Kevin Robillard", "Jorge Ramos", "Annie Karni", "Katie Glueck", "Alex Isenstadt", "Beau Biden", "Donald Trump", "Glenn Thrush", "Heidi Heitkamp", "Sam Clovis", "Terry Lewis", "Alex Leary", "Artur Davis", "Corrine Brown", "Hillary Clinton"], "orgs": ["Montgomery Advertiser", "General Assembly", "The Univision", "Congress", "Florida Legislature", "Senate", "Democratic Party", "Supreme Court", "Q&A", "Colorado Republicans", "Democratic National Committee", "Beau", "Denver Post", "GOP"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30902, "fullname": "steven shepard", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-08-26 15:11:57", "org": "politico", "article_id": "d569dfec8bb61548b001ce6352ec6f66", "date_access": "2015-08-26 14:20:36.956336"}
