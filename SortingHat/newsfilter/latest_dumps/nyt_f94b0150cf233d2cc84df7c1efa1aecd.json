{"body": "Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s initial primary campaign spending total, $18.7 million, is a lot of money. And she is using it very differently from her rivals.\n\nWhile others spend their money to raise more money, she has built a campaign organization with an eye toward the general election. Her campaign\u2019s \u201cburn rate,\u201d the amount spent divided by what is raised, was just a little less than 40 percent through June 30. That\u2019s only a bit higher than the campaigns of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney at the same point four years ago, and very close to the 38 percent burn rate of Mr. Obama\u2019s campaign in the first half of 2007. But comparing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s spending with those of her rivals is complicated, because she is running a different campaign so far.\n\nMost of the presidential candidates have emphasized spending money to raise more money, whether online or through direct mail, over other kinds of spending. Ted Cruz, a Republican, reported spending $835,798 on postage and an additional $678,730 on fund-raising phone calls. Ben Carson, another Republican hopeful, spent $1.47 million on his digital efforts and $788,114 on printing and postage. Still, Mrs. Clinton isn\u2019t ignoring fund-raising; she spent more than $2.5 million on \u201cdirect marketing\u201d and additional amounts on events and catering.\n\nShe has spent millions of dollars on staff, advertising and polling, establishing a much broader campaign at this point than any other 2016 presidential candidate. Much of the money has gone toward mounting an effective operation in the early primary and caucus states, and for building the foundation for a broad general election campaign should she become the Democratic nominee. Her $3.7 million in staff salary expenses (not including payroll taxes and service fees) is more than 10 times the amount of Mr. Cruz, who has the next-largest campaign in terms of staff payments.\n\nThe 20 percent Mrs. Clinton spent on staff dwarfs that of all but the campaigns of the Republican Mike Huckabee (21 percent) and the Democrat Martin O\u2019Malley (20 percent). Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign employed 343 people, according to Federal Election Commission data. The address of nearly all campaign workers listed in F.E.C. records is the New York campaign headquarters, which is a tactic that Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, used. That makes it harder to tell exactly how much of a footprint the campaign has in say, Iowa, where it has paid $64,369 in rent.\n\nAs of June 30, the Clinton campaign paid at least 58 field organizers, had spent more than $1 million on online advertising and paid a total of $370,000 to state parties in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina for voter data.\n\nJeb Bush, who spent just more than $3 million, devoted much of it to travel and other expenses related to \u201ctesting the waters\u201d for his candidacy. He did spend $372,647 on IT equipment and consulting services.\n\nThe campaign of Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who is also seeking the Democratic nomination, put its largest investment into digital advertising and consulting, spending $1.3 million. Its payroll expenses were just $61,045, although Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign has not been operating as long as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s. Overall, the Sanders campaign spent 20 percent of the money it raised through June 30.", "byline": "DEREK WILLIS", "description": "Instead of spending money to raise money, the focus is on building a campaign organization with an eye toward the general election.", "title": "Road to 2016: Clinton Campaign Spending: Big, and Different", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/18/upshot/clinton-campaign-spending-big-and-different.html", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Mitt Romney", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Barack Obama", "Bernie Sanders", "Ben Carson", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": ["Federal Election Commission"], "authors": [{"author_id": 344, "fullname": "derek willis", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-07-17 16:26:33", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "f94b0150cf233d2cc84df7c1efa1aecd", "date_access": "2015-07-17 15:40:11.339058"}
