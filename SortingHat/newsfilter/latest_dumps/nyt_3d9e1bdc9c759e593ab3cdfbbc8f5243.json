{"body": "The Iowa straw poll, a Republican party tradition for nearly forty years, is dead for the 2016 presidential cycle, party officials said Friday.\n\nThe move was made as candidates in one of the largest presidential fields in modern Republican history showed diminishing interest in participating in the August event.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said since December that we would only hold a straw poll if the candidates wanted one, and this year that is just not the case,\u201d Jeff Kaufmann, the Republican Party chairman in Iowa, said in a statement emailed shortly after a special meeting of the party\u2019s state central committee.\n\nThe vote to end the event was unanimous.\n\n\u201cThis step, while extremely distasteful for those of us who love the Straw Poll, is necessary to strengthen our first-in-the-nation status and ensure our future nominee has the best chance possible to take back the White House in 2016,\u201d said Mr. Kaufmann.\n\n\u201cMany candidates are still concerned about participating in an event that carries significant media-driven expectations well ahead of our first-in-the-nation caucuses,\u201d Mr. Kaufmann added. \u201cWhile we still deeply believe that the straw poll offers a fantastic opportunity for candidates, we need to focus on strengthening our first-in-the-nation status and putting a Republican back in the White House.\u201d\n\nThe event \u2013 which historically has required candidates to make large investments in order to have a place in the straw poll, held in Ames for years \u2013 has had dwindling impact since 2012. That year, Michele Bachmann, the former Minnesota congresswoman, won the poll, but finished at the back of the pack in the caucuses. Mitt Romney, the eventual Republican nominee, skipped it that year, and former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas announced his presidential candidacy the same day of the poll, knocking the wind out of Ms. Bachmann\u2019s sails.\n\nThis year, Jeb Bush has said he will skip it, and others are more focused on husbanding resources to lift their standings in national polls to make the cut for the early debates.\n\nThe death of the poll is a victory for the state\u2019s governor, Terry Branstad, who has argued it is diminishing the state\u2019s political standing because it has little impact on the caucuses results.\n\nYet in 2007, Mike Huckabee won the caucuses after a surprise showing in the straw poll.\n\n\u201cIf there ever was a year that we needed an event to winnow the field it was this cycle,\u201d said Matt Strawn, a former party chairman. \u201cCampaigns should not view this as an excuse not to continue organizing throughout the summer. In a field that is this crowded, no matter which lane of the party you\u2019re running in, organization is more important than ever.\u201d\n", "byline": "MAGGIE HABERMAN", "description": "The Iowa straw poll, a Republican party tradition for nearly forty years, is dead for the 2016 presidential cycle, party officials said Friday.", "title": "First Draft: Iowa Straw Poll Is Canceled for This Cycle", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/06/12/iowa-straw-poll-is-canceled-for-this-cycle/", "topics": ["personality", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Jeff Kaufmann", "Matt Strawn", "Jeb Bush", "Rick Perry", "Michele Bachmann", "Mike Huckabee", "Mitt Romney", "Terry Branstad"], "orgs": ["Republican Party", "Iowa Straw Poll"], "authors": [{"author_id": 7421, "fullname": "maggie haberman", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-06-12 15:47:22", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "3d9e1bdc9c759e593ab3cdfbbc8f5243", "date_access": "2015-06-12 15:02:29.398430"}
