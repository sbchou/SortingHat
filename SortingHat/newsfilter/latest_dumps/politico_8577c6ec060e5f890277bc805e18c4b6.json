Chris Christie said Sunday.\nDuring a speech to supporters in Ohio on Thursday, the Democratic presidential frontrunner said \"extreme views about women\" are to be expected from \"some of the terrorist groups,\" but not the Republicans running for the White House.\n\"Well, there's a uniter, isn't it? Comparing Republicans to terrorist groups. There's a real uniter. That's the woman you want sitting in the Oval Office to bring our country back together,\" the governor told host Chris Wallace on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \n\"That's a disgrace, and she's a disgrace,\" Christie added. \"She's a disgrace for saying that, for comparing Republicans to terrorist groups. Don't let her go on that, Chris. That's awful.\"\nImagine the mainstream media outrage if Republicans had compared Democrats to terrorist groups, Christie said. Invoking one of the recent Planned Parenthood videos showing officials discussing how to alter an abortion procedure to faciliate the donation of fetal tissue, Christie said he'd welcome a debate with Clinton if she believes a majority of mainstream Americans would support that.\n\"She just wants to talk about these vague generalities on war on women,\" Christie said. \"I can't wait until next September to get on stage with Hillary Clinton\" as the GOP nominee, he said.\nChristie touted his defunding of Planned Parenthood as governor, declining to answer whether he'd support shutting down the federal government, as some conservative Republicans have pledged to do this fall.\nThe governor also blasted Clinton's \"arrogance\" in handling questions from Fox News' Ed Henry last week, when the former secretary of state said she would answer one of a series of questions because that's what he was \"entitled to.\"\n\"This is not royalty in the United States,\" Christie declared. \"his is not a familial ascendancy.\"\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\nHe also said he's not worried about making the primetime CNN debate on Sept. 16, despite slipping poll numbers in his race for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\"First off, I'll be on the stage at the Reagan Library, and I'm not worried about that,\" Christie said.\nFellow Republican contender Carly Fiorina, who earned wide praise for her performance in the first early debate on Aug. 6, has raised the issue of her possible exclusion from CNN's debate with the top candidates because of previously set criteria.\n\"She deserves to be heard as well,\" Christie said.\nHe also downplayed the role of Donald Trump in drowning out the other 16 candidates in the race, including himself.\n\"Everyone's going to have their moment to be able to speak their mind,\" the governor said. \"Now, it's Donald. In three weeks, it could be anyone else.\"\n\n                                            By \nAaron MaK\n\n\n                                            By \nPOLITICO Magazine\n\n\n                                            By \n                                                    Mitch Landrieu\n                                             and \n                                                    Judith Rodin\n\n\n                                            By \nBen Wofford\n\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Christie: Hillary's 'a disgrace'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/christie-fox-213166", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "personality"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Chris Wallace", "Sean Parnell", "Jake Sherman", "Jennifer Shutt", "Henry C.
