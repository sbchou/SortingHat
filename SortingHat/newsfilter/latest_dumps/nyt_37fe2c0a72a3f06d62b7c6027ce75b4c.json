{"body": "DES MOINES \u2014 Is Iowa for sale?\n\nThat is the perception sending shudders through the state\u2019s Republicans, after the leader of Rick Perry\u2019s Iowa campaign quit when Mr. Perry suspended pay to staff members, then quickly went to work for Donald J. Trump, who he had earlier said lacked a \u201cmoral center.\u201d\n\nThe head-spinning dismount and remount came three weeks after another embarrassing episode for the state\u2019s Republicans. A long-running scandal over under-the-table payments to a state senator to endorse Ron Paul\u2019s presidential bid in 2011 led to the federal indictment this month of Mr. Paul\u2019s former campaign manager.\n\nOn Tuesday, at a meeting of the Polk County Republican Party in Des Moines, the two events were linked in many conversations \u2014 as they have been all week by Iowa\u2019s political insiders, who are hypersensitive about the state\u2019s privileged role as the first to vote in presidential races.\n\nMany non-Iowans resent the attention paid to the state, which will hold its caucuses Feb. 1. To deflect the doubters, party officials and the state\u2019s ranks of paid strategists strive for an image of ethical professionalism and a level playing field for all candidates, which is now being questioned.\n\n\u201cI think it sends a perception that we\u2019re pay-for-play, and if that\u2019s the case, we lose credibility as the first-in-the nation caucuses,\u201d said a top Republican official in Iowa. That sentiment was echoed in more than a dozen interviews with Iowa officials and political strategists, nearly all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of offending people they would invariably work with again one day.\n\nMr. Perry\u2019s former state chairman, Sam Clovis, did nothing illegal in switching to Mr. Trump, Republican officials said. But many who know and like Mr. Clovis, a college professor who ran unsuccessfully in the Republican primary for the United States Senate in 2014, accused him of hypocrisy.\n\nIn private emails last month, Mr. Clovis denounced Mr. Trump for shortcomings as a conservative. After Mr. Trump said Senator John McCain was \u201cnot a war hero\u201d because he had been a prisoner in North Vietnam, Mr. Clovis, a 25-year Air Force veteran, wrote, \u201cI was offended by a man who sought and gained four student deferments to avoid the draft and who has never served this nation a day \u2014 not a day \u2014 in any fashion or way.\u201d\n\nAfter Mr. Trump said he had never sought God\u2019s forgiveness, Mr. Clovis, an evangelical Christian, wrote, \u201cHis comments reveal no foundation in Christ, which is a big deal.\u201d\n\nThe private emails were first reported by The Des Moines Register. The New York Times obtained copies.\n\nMr. Clovis declined to explain why he had switched to Mr. Trump. In a written statement, he said, \u201cWhy I changed campaigns is personal, and thus I will not comment further on this matter.\u201d\n\nMr. Clovis joined Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign as a national chairman, endorsing him at a rally in Dubuque on Tuesday. Some 35 days earlier, he had emailed an acquaintance about Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cWhy should I not be suspicious of a person who advocates for universal health care?\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhy should I not be suspicious of someone who says he hates lobbyists and yet has spread millions of dollars around to Republicans and Democrats to enrich himself? Why should I not be suspicious of someone who cannot come to say that he believes in God, that he has never asked for forgiveness and that communion is simply wine and a cracker?\u201d\n\nIt is unusual, though not unheard-of, for political operatives to change campaigns, especially when a poorly performing candidate\u2019s money dries up. Strategists have to pay their bills.\n\nStill, Mr. Clovis\u2019s leap to a candidate so apparently out of step with his own principles has stunned many.\n\n\u201cNobody has to be wedded to somebody through an entire caucus, but to effectively resign and the next day be in Dubuque announcing you\u2019re for another candidate, it doesn\u2019t pass the smell test,\u201d said Will Rogers, the chairman of the Polk County Republican Party.\n\nIowa lawmakers were so concerned about a potential pay-to-play reputation that the State Senate passed an ethics rule after the 2008 caucuses prohibiting sitting legislators from being paid by candidates they endorsed.\n\nMitt Romney, Mr. McCain and other candidates had generously compensated Iowa lawmakers in 2007, who signed on to campaigns in roles that often involved little more than making an occasional introductory speech at a rally.\n\nIt was Senate Ethics Rule 6, forbidding such payments, that unraveled the effort by Ron Paul aides in 2011 to pay a state senator, Kent Sorenson, to jump from the campaign of Michele Bachmann. Just days before the caucuses, Mr. Sorenson, who was Mrs. Bachmann\u2019s Iowa chairman, dramatically announced his support of Mr. Paul.\n\nMr. Sorenson resigned from the State Senate in 2013 in the midst of an investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee. He later pleaded guilty in federal court to concealing payments of more than $70,000, and faces 25 years in prison.\n\nEarly this month, the Justice Department indicted three former Paul aides on charges of violating federal laws in making the payments to Mr. Sorenson. They included Jesse Benton, a relative by marriage of Mr. Paul and the head of a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting the 2016 campaign of his son, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.\n\nThis week, the Sorenson case was being tied to Mr. Clovis\u2019s in political circles, though Iowans were quick to say there was no appearance of illegality in what Mr. Clovis had done.\n\nInstead, it was a matter of seeing the state\u2019s image tarnished. \u201cThis perception that support is for sale, to see such a blatant display of that, it\u2019s exactly the kind of thing that\u2019s harmful to the Iowa caucuses,\u201d said a leading Republican official who is not affiliated with a campaign.\n\nOther political professionals pointed out that cases like Mr. Sorenson\u2019s and Mr. Clovis\u2019s were rare.\n\n\u201cI can think of less than five instances of this in all my years,\u201d said Steve Grubbs, a longtime Iowa strategist who is running Rand Paul\u2019s campaign in the state. \u201cBut when it happens, it\u2019s big news.\u201d\n\nThe condemnations seem connected to a high state of anxiety over the Trump phenomenon. Ever anxious about losing Iowa\u2019s status as the nation\u2019s first nominating state, campaigns have been pressing undecided activists to get off the fence to stop Mr. Trump\u2019s rise. Many believe if he wins the caucuses, Iowa\u2019s legitimacy in the eyes of national Republican leaders will erode.\n\nMr. Perry, who called Mr. Trump a \u201ccancer\u201d on conservatism in July, told his staff members in mid-August that he did not have enough money to continue paying them. Jamie Johnson, a senior aide to Mr. Perry, said four campaigns had immediately tried to poach him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a psychological two-step,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first thing they say is how sorry they are you\u2019ve been treated this way. Then they pivot and say, \u2018How would you like to come on board a campaign that will pay you what you\u2019re worth?\u2019 \u201d\n\nMr. Johnson, an ordained minister, said he would not leave Mr. Perry. \u201cI will not abandon my captain on the battlefield,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t walk away from the wounded. I will stand with Rick Perry come hell or high water.\u201d\n\nDuring Mr. Clovis\u2019s own Senate primary race last year, funds ran out. The staff of about half a dozen continued as volunteers or with reduced pay. One staff member, Kolby DeWitt, recorded and paid for a radio ad out of his own pocket.\n\n\u201cSam Clovis has spent a lifetime exemplifying service,\u201d the ad said.\n\nIt ended: \u201cThis ad has been paid for by Kolby DeWitt and not authorized by any candidate or candidate\u2019s committee.\u201d", "byline": "TRIP GABRIEL", "description": "The defection of Rick Perry\u2019s top campaign aide in the state to Donald Trump \u201csends a perception that we\u2019re pay-for-play,\u201d a Republican official said.", "title": "Iowans Fear Allegiance Swap Erodes Clean Political Image", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/us/politics/iowans-fear-allegiance-swap-erodes-clean-political-image.html", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "terrorism"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Ron Paul", "Mitt Romney", "Woody Johnson", "Sam Clovis", "Kent Sorenson", "Jamie Johnson", "Rick Perry", "John Mccain", "Donald Trump", "Donald J.
