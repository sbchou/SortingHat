{"body": "The chairman of the Senate\u2019s homeland security committee has asked a small, 13-year-old Denver technology company that managed tens of thousands of emails for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to describe what measures it took to safeguard national security information. \nThe FBI, which has embarked on its own scrutiny of Clinton\u2019s private server, also has shown interest in the company, Platte River Networks, which began managing Clinton\u2019s emails in 2013, according to published reports.\nHer use of a private, non-governmental server to conduct official State Department business is causing increased turbulence for Clinton as she pursues what many thought would be a relatively smooth ride to the Democratic presidential nomination.\nClinton said late Tuesday that she would turn over to the Justice Department her private server as part of a widening security investigation into her use of private emails to conduct official business. McClatchy reported Tuesday that two emails found on Clinton\u2019s server were classified as \u201cTop Secret,\u201d heightening concerns that Clinton may have improperly shared classified information or stored them on vulnerable Internet equipment that might be open to hacking.\n\u201cGiven that the server was used to conduct official State Department business, questions have been raised regarding whether classified information was stored on the private server,\u201d Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin wrote Platte\u2019s president in a letter Tuesday. He said he also wants to know \u201cif that data was secure, who had access to that material and whether all official documents were appropriately preserved.\u201d\nClinton has said that after she turned over all of her official emails to the State Department last December, she wiped clean her server which contained over 61,000 emails. Clinton said she permanently deleted about half because they were personal and turned over the rest because they were related to State Department business. Senior Republicans in Congress now want to know whether Platte River has a backup file containing the deleted emails.\nIn the letter obtained by McClatchy, Chairman Johnson asked company President Treve Suazo to respond to detailed questions within two weeks.\nHe requested all communications referring to the server \u201cbetween or among employees or contractors of Platte River\u201d and between company employees and the family\u2019s global charity, the Clinton Foundation. Johnson also sought an explanation of whether the company is \u201cauthorized to maintain or access classified information.\u201d\nSuazo and other company officials did not respond to phone requests seeking comment.\nPlatte River\u2019s role grew more crucial Tuesday when the inspector general for the U.S. Intelligence Community advised Congress that two emails contained information it deemed \u201cTop Secret.\u201d The emails were not marked as classified when they were written, and Clinton has repeatedly denied ever sending or receiving classified information.\n\nWas Platte River Networks ever made aware that the information on Secretary Clinton\u2019s private server may contain classified or sensitive security data? Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin\nAt a State Department briefing Wednesday, Mark Toner, a spokesman, said the two emails designated as Top Secret \u201cweren\u2019t sent by her.\u201d\nThe declaration by Inspector General I. Charles McCullough III, however, ramped up the stakes, because security officials had been less concerned about the arrangement if information was classified no higher than \u201cSecret.\u201d \nPlatte River\u2019s services were sought in early 2013 to improve security of the server, which was installed for former President Bill Clinton at the couple\u2019s home in New York state years earlier, The Washington Post reported recently.\nThe Colorado firm\u2019s hiring coincided with the discovery that an email account for Clinton\u2019s longtime confidant, private consultant Sidney Blumenthal, had been hacked by a Romanian national Marcel Lazar Lehel, known as Guccifer.\nBrian Reid, a cybersecurity expert with Internet Systems Consortium, said Clinton\u2019s use of a reputable company to manage her server means it was less likely to be vulnerable to hackers.\nReid and a second security expert said that if Platte River used a backup server for extra security, it\u2019s likely that some data Clinton had deleted could be retrieved.\nDarren Hayes, a cybersecurity professor at Pace University\u2019s Seidenberg School of Computer Science and Information Systems, said it\u2019s very common \u201cin this day and age\u201d for a company working with a client to back up their materials.\nEDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE\nNonetheless, it\u2019s unclear what investigators might find on the server.\nHayes said what might be found will be determined by how the deletions were done. \n\u201cIt depends on what kind of tools they used,\u201d Hayes said. \n\nWe have the facts, our principles, and you on our side. And it's vital that you read and absorb the real story so that you know what to say the next time you hear about this around the dinner table or the water cooler. Campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri to Clinton supporters\nReid, a cybersecurity expert with Internet Systems Consortium, said there are two types of back-ups.\nOne is a physical security back-up, which protects against the loss of data during a computer crash. That type of back-up is short-term.\n\u201cEvery company in the managed IT business will do physical security back-ups,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s similar to the concept of security video from the cops shows. If a cop subpoenas it, there are only very recent backups. A physical security backup can be overwritten in a matter of weeks.\u201d\nAnother type archives data farther back in time and is intended to be a record of what the data was at certain times in the past, Reid said. Companies dedicated to archival backups store the data in high-security warehouses.\n\u201cArchival back-ups can be subpoenaed. They are evidence,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re extremely hard to wipe clean.\u201d\nIf Clinton had a backup, the type likely would be specified in her contract with the company that provided the server, Reid said.\nClinton\u2019s campaign did not respond to questions Wednesday.\nBut her communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, sent a lengthy email to supporters to dispel \u201cmisinformation,\u201d explaining why she used a private email account, what emails she turned over and assuring that there is no criminal inquiry into Clinton\u2019s conduct.\n\u201cLook, this kind of nonsense comes with the territory of running for president ... and we expect it to continue from now until Election Day,\u201d she said.\nGreg Gordon: 202-383-0005, @greggordon2\nMarisa Taylor: 202-383-6164, @marisaataylor\nAnita Kumar: 202-383-6017, @anitakumar01", "byline": "", "description": "The tech question: Were emails backed up and can they be retrieved?\nThe FBI also interested in firm that managed Clinton\u2019s server\nEmail flap roils Clinton campaign yet again\n\u2026\nClick to Continue \u00bb", "title": "Senate committee seeks email facts from Clinton\u2019s tech company", "url": "http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article30964044.html", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Greg Gordon", "Ron Johnson", "Mark Toner", "Bill Clinton", "Brian Reid", "Sidney Blumenthal", "Hillary Clinton", "Treve Suazo", "Anita Kumar", "Marisa Taylor", "Jennifer Palmieri"], "orgs": ["Congress", "Senate", "State Department", "Clinton Foundation", "Justice Department", "McClatchy", "FBI"], "authors": [{"author_id": 33931, "fullname": "marisa taylor", "primary_org": "mcclatchy"}, {"author_id": 33925, "fullname": "greg gordon", "primary_org": "mcclatchy"}, {"author_id": 33912, "fullname": "anita kumar", "primary_org": "mcclatchy"}], "date_written": "2015-08-13 01:56:42", "org": "mcclatchy", "article_id": "8e1d16299ee189823aa8f6e0c662c4ff", "date_access": "2015-08-13 01:00:05.543899"}
