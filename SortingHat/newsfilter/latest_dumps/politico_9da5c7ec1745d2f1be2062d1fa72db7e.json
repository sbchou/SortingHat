And goodbye Tropical Storm Erika (for now at least). Though the storm did little to South Florida, Dominica needs help. It\u2019s a busy political week in South Florida: Jeb Bush has a Monday Coral Gables fundraiser and a Tuesday school visit in Miami; Ted Cruz has a Tuesday Bal Harbor fundraiser (his first in Florida) on Wednesday; Vice President Joe Biden headlines a Senate Democratic fundraiser in Miami on Tuesday and then holds two events in South Florida on Wednesday, including a trip for Debbie Wasserman Schultz to pitch the president\u2019s Iran-nuke deal.\nDWS PR FAIL \u2013 \u201cWasserman Schultz caught up in Iran-deal controversy,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Marc Caputo: A new Democratic controversy has erupted over President Obama\u2019s nuclear Iran deal, and once again Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz is in the middle of it. On Saturday at the DNC\u2019s summer meeting, Wasserman Schultz made a procedural ruling against a show of support for the president\u2019s signature foreign-policy initiative\u2013 a decision she and her press shop have refused to explain openly. \nSome Democrats, already upset that the South Florida representative hasn\u2019t said if she\u2019ll back the Iran deal in Congress, began trashing her and even calling for her ouster as DNC chair. The problem with the accusations from her fellow Democrats: they\u2019re not really accurate, according to those who spoke on the record about what happened Saturday. http://politi.co/1NR6UBhAnd as Wasserman Schultz stayed silent, the bad headlines poured in:\n\u201cDems say party chair blocked Iran resolution at DNC meeting,\u201d The Washington Post first reported. http://wapo.st/1ItvaCl\n\u201cWasserman Schultz blocked Iran resolution at DNC meeting: report,\u201d The Hill followed.\n\u201c\u2018Dump Debbie\u2019: Dems are livid with Wasserman Schultz over blocking Iran deal resolution, lack of debates,\u201d the conservative Twitter aggregation website, Twitchy, wrote. http://bit.ly/1JqIHfI\nDWS PRIMARY? \u2013 Miami-Dade School Board Member Martin Karp, a Democrat and Wasserman Schultz constituent, is sending out mailers to organize people to rally against the Iran deal at her office. Asked if he\u2019d challenge Wasserman Schultz in a Democratic primary for opposing the deal, he said, \"That\u2019s not my intention. ... My only interest at this time is to get her to make a decision as soon as possible.\u201d Well, that\u2019s not a no.

There are different versions of what transpired. The Florida-based fundraising consultants \u2014 Kris Money, Trey McCarley and Debbie Aleksander \u2014 have said that they voluntarily quit the campaign and were still working with Bush's super PAC, Right to Rise Super PAC. Others said the three, who worked under the same contract, were let go because they were no longer needed for the current phase of the campaign. None of the three responded to requests for comment. Bush spokesman Tim Miller would only say that \u201cGovernor Bush has the widest and deepest fundraising operation of any candidate in the field. Ann Herberger \u2014 a longtime aide with more than two decades of experience in state and national politics \u2014 will continue to lead the operation in Florida with our team in Miami.\u201d http://politi.co/1PEucc2\n JEB\u2019S MISCALCULATION? The departures and news of cutbacks raise a question that we can\u2019t yet answer: Did Jeb\u2019s clever campaign strategy of delaying his official candidacy announcement -- to raise unlimited money form top-dollar donors for the super PAC -- backfire? Because raising super PAC money is more difficult as an announced candidate, Jeb made his candidacy official June 15, late in the game because it left only a few weeks to raise hard money for his campaign. And he did a great job: $11.4 million in just 16 days. At the same time, Bush hired as many top-level staffers as possible to make sure he had the best he could \u2013 and so that his opponents couldn\u2019t. That costs money that only hard-dollar donations pay for. So, relative to his campaign staff (by far the largest in the GOP field), was his fundraising too little? Is Jeb\u2019s burn rate too high, prompting the recalculations, resizing of the campaign? The campaign says no, and that it\u2019ll have plenty of money, etc. So we\u2019ll have to see at the end of the quarter. Meantime, Bush and the family have a grueling fundraising schedule.\nBUSH FUNDRAISING LIST: Southampton, NY (Sept. 28); Sagaponack & Quogue, NY (Sept. 29); Wilmington, NC (Saturday); Boston (Weds); President George W.

TRUMP -- \u201cLatino business group denounces \u2018ignorant\u2019 Trump campaign, cancels contract,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Marc Caputo: \u201cIn a stinging denunciation of Donald Trump, the nation\u2019s largest Hispanic construction trade group, the Latin Builders Association, announced Friday that it would cancel its gala at his resort in Doral due to his \u201crecent pattern of bigoted, sexist and ignorant verbal assaults on immigrants, women and veterans.\u201d The Miami-based LBA made the announcement after the 650-member association\u2019s executive board made the decision to \u201crescind\u201d a contract to hold its annual gala Nov. 14 at the Trump National Doral Miami. The letter was released at the LBA\u2019s monthly luncheon to explain to members that the group is seeking a new venue. A spokeswoman for Trump, first approached for comment Thursday by phone and email, still could not be reached. The LBA\u2019s decision could prompt a lawsuit, but the nonprofit\u2019s board made clear it was willing to risk that fight.\u201d http://politi.co/1fNqWP8\nO\u2019CONNELL CALLS IT QUITS -- \u201cFlorida lottery secretary steps down after travel report,\" by POLITICO\u2019s Matt Dixon and Jessica Bakeman: Florida Lottery Secretary Cynthia O\u2019Connell is stepping down in the wake of a POLITICO Florida report that she took nine weeks of vacation and racked up nearly $30,000 in travel bills last year while her agency was struggling with a fund scandal and audit. Her resignation takes effect Oct. 1. She will leave to pursue opportunities in the private sector.\n\u201cCynthia has been part of my team since my first year in office and she has done a tremendous job serving Florida families,\u201d Gov. Rick Scott said in a statement announcing the resignation. He did not ask her to resign, his office said. http://politi.co/1NI5ERM\nTESTING TURMOIL \u2013 \u201cSeminole County furthers push to replace state exams with national alternatives,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Jessica Bakeman: \"National tests like the SAT are closely enough aligned to Florida\u2019s academic standards to replace the state\u2019s own exams, the leaders of a high-performing school district neighboring Orlando argued in a recent letter to state education officials. Seminole County Public Schools leaders last week renewed their push for the state to ditch the Florida Standards Assessments, computer-based exams offered for the first time this spring. The leaders want to replace the state\u2019s tests with the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, the PSAT and the SAT, respectively at appropriate grade levels. Since the district leaders first proposed the plan in July, they\u2019ve rebranded their idea, originally dubbed the \u2018Seminole Solution,\u2019 as the \u2018Sunshine Solution,\u2019 hoping to reflect growing support from other school districts statewide. Key state lawmakers have also expressed support for the plan, as POLITICO Florida first reported. Their letter comes just days before the state is expected to receive the results of a third-party study of the validity of Florida\u2019s state exams, which came into question after technical problems plagued their administration earlier this year.\u201d http://politi.co/1Euc9Vu\nCOUP, ME? -- \u201cIngoglia: \u2018I am not running for speaker\u2019,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Matt Dixon: Republican Party of Florida chairman Blaise Ingoglia said Saturday that he will not actively seek the post of House speaker, and will remove himself from a reform push being considered by that chamber\u2019s G.O.P. members. \u201cI am not going to offer myself as a candidate for speaker of the House,\u201d Ingoglia told the state GOP board at its quarterly meeting. \u201cI am not running for speaker.\u201d Ingoglia, also a state representative from Spring Hill, was one of the faces of a reform effort organized by lawmakers who say they want to change the way House speakers are selected. That movement has stirred anxiety among supporters of state Rep.

As the meeting adjourned Oliva, a Miami Lakes Republican, suggested they might do better to take the meeting to his house, where they could light up a cigar. \u2018As long as they are Oliva cigars,\u2019 mused Galvano, R-Bradenton, a reference to the Nicaraguan tobacco cultivated and sold by Oliva\u2019s family.\u201d http://bit.ly/1JuGhPs\nSMACK ATTACK -- \u201cTo combat overdose epidemic, Manatee officials call for increased use of \u2018heroin antidote\u2019,\u201d by Bradenton Herald\u2019s Kate Irby: \u201cDr. Mark Sylvester can\u2019t count the number of patients he's lost to heroin overdoses in the past year. One patient was 16 years old. After five years of working with addictions as a psychiatrist, Sylvester knows how complicated treatment can be. Saving addicts from dying of an overdose can be extremely simple by comparison, requiring only a quickly administered heroin antidote of naloxone, or Narcan. ... The Florida Legislature made access to those overdose extinguishers much easier during the 2015 session. Gov. Rick Scott signed a bill into law in June allowing doctors to prescribe naloxone to third parties such as family members and friends of addicts. That way, if someone is concerned about someone they know overdosing on heroin, they can have it on hand if an overdose occurs.\u201d http://bit.ly/1KVDvAK\nREMEMBERING STEVEN SOTLOFF -- \u201cSteven Sotloff\u2019s parents open up as 1-yr anniversary nears,\u201d by AP: \u201cSouth Florida residents Shirley and Arthur Sotloff have spoken little since the Islamic State group released a video showing a jihadi behead American-Israeli journalist Steven Sotloff on September 2, 2014.\u201d http://apne.ws/1KVDIUw\nDEMS PLAY TRUMP CARD -- \u201cDemocrats Alan Grayson, Patrick Murphy play the Donald Trump card in Senate primary,\u201d by Palm Beach Post\u2019s George Bennett: http://pbpo.st/1O1VGaT\n--\u201cJoan Jett and the Wall Streeters pony up for Wall Street-bashing Alan Grayson,\u201d by The Tampa Bay Times\u2019 Adam C.

US REP BASHES FL \u2018DYSFUNCTION\u2019 -- \u201cBuchanan discouraged by dysfunction,\u201d by The Sarasota Herald Tribune\u2019s Zac Anderson: \u201cU.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan is familiar with dysfunctional governing bodies. Congress has a 19 percent approval rating and Buchanan believes that the dysfunctional tag is well earned \u2018in a lot of aspects \u2026 But when you look at the state, they\u2019ve always seemed like they\u2019ve been better about resolving these issues,\u2019 said the Longboat Key Republican. The latest legislative meltdown over congressional redistricting has Buchanan questioning that assessment of the GOP-controlled Legislature, though, and fuming over the uncertainty that continues to surround his congressional district.\u201d http://bit.ly/1Kmyoiv\nNELSON: BIDEN WON\u2019T RUN -- \u201cBill Nelson on Hillary Clinton emails, Joe Biden, Rick Scott, Iran nukes,\u201d by Palm Beach Post\u2019s George Bennett: \u201cDemocratic Sen. Bill Nelson believes Hillary Clinton\u2018s explanations for using a homebrew email server as secretary of state but is \u2018concerned\u2019 with the way her campaign has handled the issue. Speaking to a Forum Club of the Palm Beaches lunch today, Nelson predicted that Clinton will \u2018overcome\u2019 the email questions and that Vice President Joe Biden will not enter the presidential race. Nelson also shrugged off the possibility of Republican Gov. Rick Scott challenging him for Senate in 2018 and defended President Barack Obama\u2018s nuclear deal with Iran.\u201d http://pbpo.st/1Eu0E0g\nFL\u2019S INVESTMENTS OK -- \u201cFlorida\u2019s financial outlook is strong,\u201d by Herald Tribune\u2019s Lloyd Dunkelberger: \u201cA little volatility in the stock market may have unnerved many Floridians as they watched their retirement accounts rise and fall with the recent abrupt moves in the financial markets. But the market volatility didn\u2019t seem to faze Ben Watkins, one of the state\u2019s key financial managers. ... Watkins told the aides in preparation for next week\u2019s Cabinet meeting in St. Augustine that the state government\u2019s financial well-being is strong.\u201d http://bit.ly/1NQsQMG\nLAND WARS -- \u201cEnvironmental groups sue Legislature over Amendment 1 spending,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Marc Caputo: \u201cA coalition of environmental groups sued the state of Florida on Friday and asked a judge to stop what they claim is unlawful spending of state conservation money.\u201d http://politi.co/1X2FhsL\nWEST NILE WARNING -- \u201cPinellas records first human case of West Nile Virus in 2015,\u201d by The Tampa Bay Times\u2019 staff: \u201cA 32-year-old man in Pinellas County recently tested positive for West Nile Virus, the first confirmed human case of the mosquito-borne illness this year, according to local health officials. To date, county analysts have recorded 23 positive tests for West Nile in sentinel chickens, which serve as a first line of defense to determine the prevalence of the virus in Tampa Bay. According to the Florida Department of Health, many people do not show symptoms of West Nile Virus when infected. Those who do experience ill effects typically suffer from headache, pain and fatigue as a result of West Nile Fever.\u201d http://bit.ly/1IpUbOW\nFL SENATE WARS -- \u201cRepublicans: Latvala courting Dems in bid for Senate presidency,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Matt Dixon: As the ongoing battle to become the next state Senate president approaches its third legislative session, a handful of Republicans say fellow GOP Sen. Jack Latvala is courting Democrats in a \u201cdesperate\u201d attempt to win the race. \u201cI think he is throwing a Hail Mary,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Brandes, a St. Petersburg Republican who has quarreled politically with Latvala in the past and could run against him in the future. Brandes, like other senators who say Latvala is wooing Democrats, supports Joe Negron, a Stuart Republican who has been fighting with Latvala for nearly three years over the Senate president's term that begins in 2017. The fight changed on Wednesday, however, when Negron proclaimed he had the support of 14 of the chamber\u2019s 26 Republicans. As a result, Senate President Andy Gardiner of Orlando called for a Republican designation vote in December, which could effectively end the battle. http://politi.co/1PYs0ge\nERIKA\u2019S WAKE -- \u201cDominica digs out from storm damage that killed at least 20,\u201d by AP\u2019s Carlisle Jno Baptiste and Danico Coto: \u201cRescue crews jumped off boats and trudged through mud, rocks and uprooted trees Saturday to reach communities cut off by a tropical storm that killed at least 20 people and left nearly 50 missing in the eastern Caribbean island of Dominica. Volunteers helped carry food, water and clothes for dozens of Dominicans who have been isolated for up to three days after Tropical Storm Erika dumped some 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain on the mountainous island. Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit pleaded for international aid, saying the damage pushed Dominica back by two decades, and he warned of more rain in upcoming days. He met Saturday with members of a newly created committee charged with helping rebuild an island devastated by floods and landslides.\u201d http://apne.ws/1Eu1kmp\nSHOULDA PREDICTED THIS \u2013 \u201cPsychic Readers Network sues General Mills over Miss Cleo,\u201d by AP: \u201cThe South Florida company that owns the rights to the popular TV psychic \u2018Miss Cleo\u2019 is suing General Mills alleging copyright infringement for hiring the psychic to promote its breakfast cereal. According to a complaint recently filed in federal court, Psychic Readers Network, Inc. said General Mills disregarded the intellectual property rights of others with a series of online ads where Miss Cleo amazes callers with her confident prediction that they will be filling their bowls with French Toast Crunch. The cereal was discontinued in 2006 but made a comeback earlier this year with help of Miss Cleo, and a Facebook fan page. The lawsuit alleges the videos look very similar to the Psychic Readers Network's commercials featuring Miss Cleo from the early 2000s. The Psychic Readers Network said it has spent more than $100 million to promote Miss Cleo since hiring her in the late 1990s and making her the company spokesperson. Psychic Readers Network said it copyrighted Miss Cleo Creatives in 2002, according to the lawsuit.\u201d http://apne.ws/1JvjqmK\n\n                                            By \nSam Nunn\n                                             and \nRichard Lugar\n\n\n                                            By \nMatt Latimer\n\n\n                                            By \nAaron MaK\n\n\n                                            By \nPOLITICO Magazine\n\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Wasserman Schultz\u2019s Iran troubles deepen;", "title": "POLITICO Florida Playbook: Wasserman Schultz\u2019s Iran troubles deepen; Jeb\u2019s fundraiser woes & schedule; testing trouble; RPOF chair backtracks in coup; West Nile virus alert; when psychics sue", "url": "http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/florida-playbook/2015/08/politico-florida-playbook-wasserman-schultzs-iran-troubles-deepen-jebs-fundraiser-woes-schedule-testing-trouble-rpof-chair-backtracks-in-coup-west-nile-virus-alert-when-psychics-sue-210046", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "trade"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "George Mitchell", "Wasserman Schultz", "Kris Money", "Zac Anderson", "Rachael Bade", "Ali Breland", "Jack Latvala", "Debbie Wasserman Schultz", "Matt Latimer", "Ann Herberger", "Hadas Gold", "Joe Negron", "Jeremy Corbyn", "Bill Nelson", "Jose Oliva", "John Kasich", "Marc Caputo", "George W.
