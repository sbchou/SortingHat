{"body": "The top Republican presidential candidates will debate for the first time on Thursday, and the Democratic Party wants you to watch.\nAn email signed by President Barack Obama, with the subject line \u201cI\u2019m going to need you for this,\u201d was sent to Democrats on Tuesday, saying \u201cthe other side is counting on folks like you sitting this one out, so I need you to say that you\u2019ll be watching on Thursday.\u201d\nDemocrats don\u2019t seem to be worried about party members suddenly hearing something they like and switching party affiliations. Instead, Mr. Obama, who has about 18 months left in his presidency, implores Democrats to watch the debate, and keep an eye on Republicans who want to undo the \u201cprogress we\u2019ve made together over these past six years.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna bet that they\u2019ll all promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Mr. Obama says in the email. \u201cThey\u2019ll all tell us that even though they aren\u2019t scientists, we shouldn\u2019t believe in the science behind climate change. They\u2019ll all want to reverse course on immigration reform and marriage equality.\u00a0\u201d\nThe email doesn\u2019t mention any of the Democratic candidates running for office, but focuses on simply not supporting Republicans running for office, many who are campaigning on undoing many of the measures that the president mentioned in the email. The message warns viewers to watch out for that.\n\u201cWhile these Republicans may have bad ideas, they\u2019re still smart politicians,\u201d Mr. Obama says in the email. \u201cThey know how to make policies that will take us in the wrong direction sound like they might actually be pretty good ideas.\u201d\nThe email ends with a solution to make watching 10 more exciting \u2014 the promise of debate bingo. A link to the bingo card, along with a reminder to watch the debate will be sent to those who promise to watch. After signing up to watch the debate, the link redirects to the fundraising page for the Democratic party.\nMore\nEvent Horizon: Who\u2019s on the GOP Debate Bubble?\nFive Ideas Worth Debating on the GOP Stage\nVideo:\u00a0Trump Leads but Rubio Lurks in New WSJ/NBC Poll\n______________________________________________________\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.
