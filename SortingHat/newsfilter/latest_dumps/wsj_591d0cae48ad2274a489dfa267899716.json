{"body": "CLEVELAND \u2013 Donald Trump\u2019s place at the center of 2016 Republican politics can be measured by the number of people knocked down in the stampede to get close to him.\nThe surprise GOP presidential front-runner\u2019s post-debate gaggle sent reporters and photographers into a crush of humanity that sent several tumbling to the ground as the New York developer moved.\nWhile the other leading candidates sent surrogates to spin the press on their debate performance, 40 minutes after the debate concluded Mr. Trump emerged himself, painting himself once again as the victim of a coordinated attack from the Fox News moderators, particularly Megyn Kelly, who pressed him about derogatory comments he\u2019d made about other women.\n\u201cThe questions to me I think were much tougher than they were to anybody else,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\nWhy would that be, he was asked. He didn\u2019t know. \u201cStory of my life, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cThe questions to me were not nice, I didn\u2019t think they were appropriate,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought Megyn, I think Megyn behaved very badly.\u201d\nThere would be no campaign strategist explaining Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks or touting his performance. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker had four different people explaining to reporters why his low-key style will eventually be considered to have delivered debate\u2019s finest performance. But once Mr. Trump emerged into the spin room, the reporters fled for four minutes of commentary from the GOP frontrunner \u2013 perhaps the shortest press conference he\u2019s held since becoming a presidential candidate.\nLike a seasoned political professional, Mr. Trump remained on message. To every question about the questions, the answer was the same: His questions were toughest, they were unfair, and he won the debate anyway.\n\u201cThe questions to me were far tougher and I, supposedly, according to what everyone\u2019s telling me, I won the debate,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\nIn the debate, Mr. Trump refused to say he would support the eventual GOP nominee if he doesn\u2019t win and sparred with several of the other contenders.\nMr. Trump told reporters after the debate that he\u2019d for sure win the White House as a Republican but still wouldn\u2019t rule out trying as a third-party candidate.\nMore on the Debate\nVideo: Trump Says He Won\u2019t Pledge Support to GOP Nominee\n\n______________________________________________________\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.
