{"body": "Getty\nHe is charting a progressive course on financial issues.\nBy Ben White\n7/9/15 12:02 AM EDT\nUpdated 7/9/15 12:02 AM EDT\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley on Thursday unveiled a sharp attack on Wall Street, looking to gain ground on a surging Sen. Bernie Sanders and to increase pressure on Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s campaign said the former governor would send \u201can open letter to the Too Big To Fail Wall Street mega-banks telling them how \u2014 as President \u2014 he will pursue every avenue to put in place real structural and accountability reforms that will rein in their reckless behavior.\u201d O\u2019Malley also released what the campaign billed as \u201ca comprehensive policy plan\u201d that would \u201cbring real enforcement to Wall Street and implement critical reforms to limit taxpayer exposure to Too Big To Fail banks.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\nPreviously, O\u2019Malley has suggested re-implementing the Glass-Steagall Act\u2019s wall between investment and consumer banking, something Sanders also supports. O\u2019Malley\u2019s new push could pressure Clinton, who is preparing to release her economic policy ideas, to take a tougher approach to Wall Street.\nCritics on the left say Clinton is too close to the financial industry after earning large fees for herself speaking to banks and representing them while she served as a senator from New York. The former first lady has to walk a fine line on the issue, given strong financial support from the industry for her campaign. But muscular Wall Street reform is among the most motivating issues for progressive voters, and Clinton cannot afford to be seen as weak on the issue.\nReforms outlined in O\u2019Malley\u2019s 10-page policy proposal include a three-year \u201crevolving door ban\u201d on regulators going to work for financial firms; making the general counsel of the Fed and the president of the New York Fed presidential appointees; doubling funding for the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; creating a stand-alone \u201ceconomic crimes\u201d division in the Justice Department; reinstating Glass-Steagall; and instituting a financial transactions tax.\nThe full paper can be found at http://bit.ly/1Cq3li1.\nBy SEAN TRENDE\nBy GUSTAVO ARELLANO\nBy MICHAEL J.
