{"body": "POLITICO\nPolitical intelligence on the intersection of Washington and Wall Street\nBy Ben White\n7/16/15 8:00 AM EDT\nTHE BIG IDEA: WHY GREECE WILL ULTIMATELY GO \u2014 Former White House CEA Chair Austan Goolsbee emails on his belief that Greece (and other peripheral euro nations) are almost certain to drop out of the currency union: \u201cBecause of the economics of monetary unions. There are only 4 things you can do if you don't have an exchange rate channel to release the pressures from different productivity growth rates/unit labor costs:\n1) labor mobility 2) subsidies (U.S. doesn't break apart when one region gets slammed even though no exch rate channel because of 1 and 2) 3) differential inflation (Germany has 4-5pct inflation for a few years while periphery at 0) 4) deflation in the periphery/\"internal devaluation\"\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cThat's it. There is nothing else. 1 is limited from language and culture. Germany refuses 2 and 3. 4 involves massive pain for decades. That's why I say either Germany decides it's so important that they are willing to subsidize forever to hold it together or else they stay on 4 and have another crisis every 9-12 mos until Greece cries uncle. And in my view, once Greece is out, then the same thing happens in Portugal or Italy or Spain within a few more years.\u201d\nGOLDMAN HEARTS JEB \u2014 Bloomberg\u2019s Max \u201cAction Jackson\u201d Abelson:\u00a0\"Important people at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. want Jeb Bush to be the next U.S. president. And they\u2019re giving him a lot of money to make it happen. More than 50 Goldman Sachs executives and employees gave the Republican more than $144,000 in the second quarter, with most of them sending $2,700, the maximum allowed, according to Federal Election Commission filings. The company that was the next-best source of money for the former Florida governor, Neuberger Berman, is run by George Walker, Bush\u2019s second cousin.\" http://bloom.bg/1gCCLbX\nTOP TWEET \u2014 FT\u2019s @MeganMurhy: \u201cI've got @HillaryClinton with 21 donors from Goldman Sachs, less than half Jeb's total. So there's that fact which matters to no one really.\u201d Oh it matters, Megan. It matters a lot.\nGREEK PARLIAMENT VOTES YES \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Helen Popper: \u201cGreece\u2019s parliament voted overwhelmingly early Thursday morning to back the bankrupt nation\u2019s third bailout agreement despite a major revolt by left-wing allies of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. \u2026 Lawmakers voted 229-64 in favor of the package of budget cuts and tax hikes with six abstentions, clearing another obstacle to the three-year financing deal that aims to avert a \u2018Grexi\u2019\u201d and escalating default. About 40 lawmakers from Tsipras\u2019s Syriza party were among the dissenters.\n\u201cTsipras, 40, a former student Communist elected in January on vows to end years of biting austerity, is expected to oust the rebels from his cabinet. The scale of the rebellion and the loss of his parliamentary majority may also force him to call a fresh election, perhaps as soon as September. Tsipras told lawmakers he signed the controversial agreement despite having serious reservations because he thought it was the only way to avoid a disorderly departure from the eurozone. \u2026 Flamboyant former Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, who accused the creditors of \u201cfiscal waterboarding\u201d was heckled as he addressed the house. He later voted No. A lawmaker from the radical Golden Dawn party ripped up a copy of the bill and threw the pieces across the benches. \u2026 The European Union said Wednesday that it would lend more than \u20ac7 billion to Greece for the country to cover critical repayments in the next weeks\u201d http://politi.co/1Lb7Ujq\nBAFFLING IMF MOVE \u2014 FT\u2019s Shawn Donnan in Washington and Peter Spiegel in Brussels: \u201cThe International Monetary Fund is no stranger to giving lessons to its members. But its latest Greek intervention was extraordinary. The release of a new report concluding that Greece\u2019s mountain of debt had become even more unbearable than thought and required far-reaching debt relief from reluctant European creditors came only hours before contentious parliamentary debates in Athens and Berlin on a new Greek \u20ac86bn bailout. \u2026 The Fund has consistently argued for Greece\u2019s European creditors to provide it with debt relief.\n\u201cAt the expense of its own crediblity \u2014 especially with its non-EU members \u2014 it has bent its rules that prevent lending to countries with unsustainable debt. What baffled European officials was that IMF appeared to be sitting on an explosive document at the very moment when its contents could have changed the course of the weekend\u2019s marathon bailout talks, although IMF staff insist the new assessment was widely distributed. Whether the IMF would stay involved in Greece after its current programme expires in March was one of the most contentious issues in the negotiations\u201d http://on.ft.com/1I3S2i8\nFOCUS SHIFTS TO ECB \u2014 Bloomberg: \u201cGreek lawmakers passed a bailout agreement that keeps the country in the euro for now, shifting attention to the European Central Bank as it weighs whether to pump more money into the country\u2019s hobbled financial system. \u2026\n\u201cThe vote puts the onus on the ECB and other euro-region governments to deploy more emergency funds that will help Greek banks gradually re-open and repair the country\u2019s battered coffers. The ECB\u2019s Governing Council meets in Frankfurt later on Thursday and Germany\u2019s parliament will vote Friday on whether to start bailout negotiations to help Greece cover its debts and pay pensions and salaries.\u201d http://bloom.bg/1So82ey\nFIRST LOOK: BUSINESWEEK ON LYNN TILTON \u2014 Per release: \u201cIn\u00a0Bloomberg Businessweek\u2019s new cover story, embattled private equity firm owner\u00a0Lynn Tilton\u00a0sits down with\u00a0Businessweek national correspondent Sheelah Kolhatkar to discuss the SEC\u2019s fraud allegations, her countersuit, and her mission to defend herself as the savior of American manufacturing companies. Is Tilton enriching herself, while wrapping herself in the flag? Or is she, as she claims, \u2018misunderstood\u2019?\u201d Full story at 6am: http://bloom.bg/1GmQvfG Cover image: http://bit.ly/1JiRHmh\nMM SIDE NOTE: Tilton was photographed in front of \u2026 two photographs over herself. You really can\u2019t make it up.\nFINK ON LIQUIDITY \u2014 Blackrock\u2019s Larry Fink from the CNBC\u2019s Delivering Alpha Conference: \u201c[T]his whole debate about liquidity is a good example of what Dodd-Frank has done. So, we have made banks safer and society more protected and banks have more capital now.\u00a0They are restricted on what they can do now. It has a lot of side effects and some people say they are unintended they should be expected like the liquidity issues and the bond market.\u00a0\n\u201cI get angry when the Federal Reserve talks about this liquidity problem and how disastrous this should be. They created it and you should expect it. We have reduced the power of the bank to play the role as the buffer \u2014 because of higher capital standards they're not lending as much so we're more reliant on the capital markets than ever before.\u201d\nGOOD THURSDAY MORNING \u2014 We made it to Pluto! It has crazy icy mountains! Space is cool! http://read.bi/1Lkj5VC\nTHIS MORNING ON POLITICO PRO FINANCIAL SERVICES\u00a0\u2013 \u00a0Jon Prior on a possible Senate plan to use mortgage-aid funds to offset a bill restoring the Highway Trust Fund [ http://politico.pro/1f5CCgb] .\u2026 For Pro's subscriber-only coverage -- and to get Morning Money every day before 6 a.m. -- please contact Pro Services at (703) 341-4600 or info@politicopro.com\nDRIVING THE DAY \u2014 Fed Chair Janet Yellen continues her two-day testimony before Senate Banking at 2:30 p.m.. Top takeaway continues to be that she is absolutely set on a rate hike this year, probably in September, to get it over with and preserve some room to move back down if things go south. It would take a really massive blowup in Greece or China or somewhere else to change her mind. Crummy U.S. jobs data could do it as well but there is no reason to think the current trend will flag \u2026 Treasury Secretary Jack Lew \u201cwill meet separately with officials in Berlin, Germany and Paris, France to discuss the ongoing situation in Greece and the global economy. In the morning, Secretary Lew will be in Berlin, Germany to meet with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. \u2026\nM.M. SIDEBAR \u2014 Lew, like his predecessor Tim Geithner, will likely have a very hard time convincing Sch\u00e4uble that Germany should get on board with serious Greek debt reduction. Schauble is likely to tell him: Mind your own business and go fix Puerto Rico.\nIn the afternoon, Secretary Lew will travel to Paris, France and meet with Mexican Secretary of Finance and Public Credit Luis Videgaray Caso. \u2026 In the evening, Secretary Lew will meet with French Minister of Finance Michel Sapin. \u2026 President Obama is in Oklahoma to talk economic opportunity \u2026 Initial Jobless Claims at 8:30 a.m. expected to dip to 285K from 297K \u2026 Philadelphia Fed Survey at 10:00 a.m. expected to drop to 12.0 from 15.2 \u2026\n** A message from Better Markets: The Dodd-Frank financial reform law was necessitated by the irresponsible, reckless and, in some cases, illegal conduct of Wall Street\u2019s biggest too-big-to-fail banks. Now they\u2019re fighting to undermine these protections and put America\u2019s families at risk of a repeat of the 2008 financial crash.

Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign reported on Wednesday that it had raised more than $11.4 million during the second quarter of this year. Bush announced his candidacy June 15, giving his campaign just over two weeks to raise funds before the June 30 deadline. \u2026 When combined with the super PAC supporting him, Right to Rise \u2014 which announced two weeks ago that it had raised $103 million \u2014 Bush\u2019s war chest far exceeds any of his Republican rivals. His campaign\u2019s per-day fundraising total was just under $714,000.\u201d http://politi.co/1TDhLQq\nCRUZ DEFENDS TRUMP \u2014 From interview with CNBC\u2019s John Harwood: \u201cOh, Donald and I have become friends. We sat down a number of times before he was a candidate. And we're sitting down again today. I have sat down with an awful lot of the candidates who are running for president. I try to be friends with all of them. \u2026 Well, you know, sometimes it seems there's no sport that the media enjoys more than Republican-on-Republican violence. You are right. There are some 2016 candidates who have gone out of their way to wack Donald Trump with a stick. I'm not one of them. He's got a colorful way of speaking. It's a different way than I speak\u201d http://cnb.cx/1TDiktu\nM.M SIDEBAR \u2014 Lots of polls now show Trump at or near the lead for the GOP nomination. Similar polls in 2012 gave early leads to Herman Cain, Sarah Palin and other non-serious, novelty candidates. Trump\u2019s time in the lead will fade as the debates begin and the Republican Party starts to get serious. And then all this coverage of the big-mouth billionaire will be exposed as largely ridiculous. If Trump somehow gets the GOP nod, M.M. will eat a bag of rusty nails.\nGOP BEATS HILLARY ON MONEY \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Daniel Strauss: \u201cHillary Clinton, the dominant front-runner in the Democratic field, is facing a massive pile of money on the Republican side, with early numbers showing that the GOPers have outraised Clinton more than four times over. So far, the 15 candidates vying for the Republican nomination have raked in more than $280 million to Clinton\u2019s $69 million, through a mix of campaign fundraising, super PAC donations, and other money groups. Yes, the field is lopsided, but that doesn\u2019t diminish this fact: Hillary\u2019s squaring off against a lot of Republican cash.\n\u201cAmong the sea of numbers, one has stood out: Jeb\u2019s. Bush\u2019s Right to Rise super PAC, which will take on an unprecedented role in tandem with his presidential campaign, announced last week that it had banked $103 million in the past six months, exceeding its own ambitious goal of $100 million. On top of that, Bush\u2019s official campaign announced it raised $11.4 million over 16 days since he announced his bid for the White House \u2026 A third money group raised $5 million, bringing his total amount to a formidable $119 million. \u2026 Sen. Ted Cruz was not far behind with a $51 million pull, while Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s combined haul was $43.8 million\u201d http://politi.co/1TDirW0\nHIGHWAY CLIFF AHEAD \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Seung Min Kim and Heather Caygle: \u201cFunding for the nation\u2019s crumbling roads and highways is about to run out in two weeks, and Congress is in disarray on how to prevent it: House Republicans are pushing a plan that GOP senators oppose, Democrats are scrambling for a unified response, and both parties are grasping for a way out. \u2026 The most likely outcome, as always, is the path of least resistance: Another stopgap extension for the trust fund that would set up the same highway cliff at the end of the year.\n\u201cBut Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who promised to end the constant cycle of legislative cliffs, is making a last-ditch effort to avoid another punt, as well as another round of election-year votes on expensive highway bills. To that end, McConnell hosted Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and two top senators on transportation policy Wednesday to discuss how to pay for a highway bill that runs for at least two years \u2014 part of a ramped-up outreach to Senate Democrats on a plan to shore up the sputtering Highway Trust Fund\u201d http://politi.co/1O7miqO\nYELLEN STILL SEES 2015 HIKE \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Jon Hilsenrath: \u201cFederal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen signaled that recent turbulence in Greece, China and elsewhere overseas isn\u2019t threatening the U.S. economy enough to divert the central bank from plans to raise short-term interest rates later this year. \u2026 Fed officials have indicated they could move rates as early as September, though many investors expect the Fed to wait until December. Ms. Yellen, testifying Wednesday before a House panel, avoided being pinned down on a date, but did yield some insight into her tactical thinking on the timing. She was more inclined to move rates up soon and proceed slowly than to wait a long time and move aggressively to catch up if the Fed finds itself behind the curve in preventing the economy or markets from overheating \u2026\n\u201c\u2018If we wait longer, it certainly could mean that when we begin to raise rates we might have to do so more rapidly,\u2019 Ms. Yellen said in response to a lawmaker\u2019s question. \u2018An advantage to beginning a little bit earlier is that we might have a more gradual path of rate increases.\u2019 A gradual path, she added, was a prudent approach. \u2026 While sticking with expectations for at least one rate increase in 2015, Ms. Yellen also maintained her stance in a deepening standoff with Congress.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1K8J4R0\nFED CHAIR PUSHES BACK ON CALLS FOR MORE OVERSIGHT \u2014 Reuters: \u201cYellen \u2026 resisted calls for more congressional oversight \u2026 While some lawmakers aggressively questioned Yellen, it was a gentler session than the grilling she received before the same panel in February. The most heated exchange occurred when Representative Sean Duffy, a Wisconsin Republican, lambasted the Fed and Yellen for what he described as a failure to properly respond to the 2012 leak of sensitive information to a private financial newsletter. \u2026 \u2018We've said that we plan to give (the documents) to you as soon as we're able to do so and not compromise an open criminal investigation,\u2019 Yellen responded. \u2018We want to see this investigation succeed.\u2019\u201d http://reut.rs/1RAkPPS\nMERKEL UNDER FIRE \u2014 FT\u2019s Stefan Wagstyl in Berlin: \u201cWhen the planned\u00a0Greece rescue programme\u00a0is put to the Bundestag on Friday, German chancellor Angela Merkel will have little doubt about winning the vote. But she will come under intense pressure to defend her handling of the crisis and answer the serious questions it raises for the eurozone, the EU and its central axis \u2014 the relationship between Germany and France. \u2026\n\u201cWhile the chancellor enjoys the strong support of her conservative CDU/CSU party \u2014 and much of the public \u2014 her tough behaviour at a marathon eurozone Brussels summit that ran through the night into Monday morning has provoked critics at home and abroad to accuse her of intimidating Greece and shumiliating its leader.\u201d http://on.ft.com/1f5n0co\nALSO FOR YOUR RADAR \u2014\nO\u2019MALLEY ON WALL STREET REFORM \u2014 BI\u2019s Hunter Walker: \u201cFormer Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland has made Wall Street reform a central component of his Democratic presidential campaign. \u2026 On Tuesday, O'Malley sat down with Business Insider for his first interview about\u00a0his Wall Street-policy push. In that conversation, he railed against what he described as \u2018lawbreakers\u2019 in the industry, whom he likened to bank robbers. O'Malley also discussed several aspects of his push for Wall Street reform including: His thoughts on Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton's policies and how he believes she should \"be forced to\" weigh in on Glass-Steagall.\n\u201cThe fact he believes Wall Street wants Clinton and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida (R) to win their presidential primaries. His desire to have a \"sit-down\" with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts). O'Malley's fiery rhetoric about clamping down on what he describes as the \"dangerous activities\" of \"megabanks\" has\u00a0caused some to brand him\u00a0an \"enemy\" of Wall Street. In his conversation with Business Insider, O'Malley said he didn't mind that label and would also be content if taking on Wall Street were seen as his major issue in the presidential campaign\u201d http://read.bi/1Ofb0RY\nCLINTON GETS BIG MONEY FROM BANKS THAT GOT OFF EASY \u2014 IBT\u2019s Andrew Perez\u00a0and David Sirota: \u201cOn the campaign trail, Hillary Clinton is selling her version of economic populism, including calls for Wall Street executives who engage in financial wrongdoing to be held accountable more than they have been under President Barack Obama. Clinton\u2019s outrage, though, did not stop her family's foundation from raking in donations from many of the same banks that secured government fines rather than face full-scale prosecution.\n\u201cThe Clinton Foundation has accepted $5 million worth of donations from at least nine financial institutions that avoided\u00a0such prosecution \u2014 even as they admitted wrongdoing. These include Barclays, HSBC and UBS, all of which entered into agreements with the Justice Department that allowed their employees to avoid criminal charges. The Clintons also personally accepted nearly $4 million in speaking fees from those firms since 2009. http://bit.ly/1RAiWTg\nNETFLIX POPS \u2014 Netflix added nearly a third more subscribers than expected in the second quarter, sending its shares up 9.4 percent as the video streaming service said its investment in original television programs and movies was paying off. Net subscriber additions rose about 94 percent year over year to about 3.3 million in the second quarter, beating the company's forecast of 2.5 million. \u2026 Netflix\u00a0also is aggressively expanding around the world, accounting for the bulk of new subscriptions. A trend of slowing U.S. growth was halted in the quarter as the number of new U.S. customers rose about 50 percent higher than the company had forecast. The company by the end of 2016 plans to reach 200 countries, including\u00a0China, where it said it was \"continuing to explore options.\" http://reut.rs/1RAktsC\n** A message from Better Markets: Soon after Dodd-Frank financial reform was signed into law just five years ago, Wall Street unleashed an army of lobbyists to attack, gut and weaken it with loopholes, all while falsely claiming to support reform. They\u2019ve been at it ever since, irresponsibly aiming their fire at the agencies responsible for policing Wall Street and, when all else fails, suing the agencies in court.\nThe biggest banks on Wall Street claim that Dodd-Frank financial reform harms their business, but they actually posted record profits in both 2013 and 2014. They are right about one thing: Dodd-Frank does make it harder for banks to profit from reckless, socially useless trading and lending.\nThat\u2019s a good thing. Dodd-Frank limits Wall Street\u2019s highest risk gambling so that America\u2019s families don\u2019t have to suffer from another financial crash and economic calamity or pay for more bailouts.
