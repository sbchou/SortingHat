{"body": "Which  Donald J. Trump will show up at Thursday night\u2019s Republican debate in Cleveland?\nThere\u2019s the Trump who calls the other GOP candidates \u201cclowns\u201d and responds to criticism with schoolyard insults. Then there\u2019s the Trump who last week tweeted about the coming debate: \u201cit is certainly my intention to be very nice & highly respectful of the other candidates.\u201d Mr. Trump seems to have recognized that as the candidate atop the Republican heap, he now will be held to a higher standard than he was as a celebrity polling in low single digits.\nEven more interesting than the style Mr. Trump brings to the stage is what opinions he has with him. Over the years he\u2019s held many conflicting positions on many important issues.\nWill the Trump who walks on stage Thursday night be the one who in 1999 told CNN\u2019s  Larry King that \u201cI\u2019m quite liberal and getting much more liberal on health care\u201d? The one who wrote in his 2000 book, \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d that the U.S. should consider a single-payer health system like Canada\u2019s government-run plan? That system \u201chelps Canadians live longer and healthier than Americans,\u201d this Trump wrote. \u201cWe need, as a nation, to re-examine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing.\u201d Or will debate viewers instead get the Donald Trump who earlier this year called ObamaCare a \u201cfilthy lie\u201d and \u201ctotal catastrophe\u201d?\nThe Trump who shows up Thursday night could be the one who in 1999 told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d during a conversation on abortion that \u201cI\u2019m very pro-choice.\u201d Or it could be the Trump who told Bloomberg Politics in January that \u201cI\u2019m pro-life and I have been pro-life,\u201d and who now says he\u2019s willing to shut down the federal government to defund Planned Parenthood.\nThe Trump who in 2000 wrote, \u201cI support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun\u201d might be there. Or it might be the Trump who told AmmoLand last month that \u201cthe Second Amendment is a bedrock natural right of the individual to defend self, family, and property.\u201d\nOn Thursday night Trump the taxman could show up. \u201cI would impose a one-time, 14.25 percent tax on individuals and trusts with a net worth over $10 million,\u201d he wrote in that 2000 book. But so might the antitax Trump. \u201cI fight like hell to pay as little as possible for two reasons. Number one, I\u2019m a businessman,\u201d he said on Sunday. \u201cThe other reason is that I hate the way our government spends our taxes. I hate the way they waste our money. Trillions and trillions of dollars of waste and abuse.\u201d\nOne Trump opposed the flat tax offered by  Steve Forbes in 2000, writing in his book that \u201conly the wealthy would reap a windfall.\u201d The other Trump said on Fox News earlier this year that he favors \u201ca fair tax, a flat tax or certainly a simplified code.\u201d\nThe Trump who tweeted last Sunday that GOP presidential candidates who spoke at the Koch donor conference were \u201cpuppets\u201d might attend the debate. But so might the Trump who was a registered Democrat for most of the 2000s, who donated thousands of dollars to  Harry Reid, Hillary Clinton, Ted Kennedy and  John Kerry, and who explained those gifts recently by saying, \u201cI\u2019ve contributed to everybody. They did whatever I said.\u201d It would be worth knowing what this Trump told Sens. Reid, Clinton, Kennedy and Kerry to do.\nThis may be the same Trump who gave $20,000 in 2006 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to help elect a Democratic majority in the House and make Rep.  Nancy Pelosi speaker, and the one who says he knows politicians are controlled by their big donors because \u201cI used to be one of those people.\u201d\nThursday night, Americans could see the Trump who criticized  Mitt Romney in a November 2012 interview for his \u201ccrazy policy of self deportation which was maniacal. It sounded as bad as it was, and he lost all of the Latino vote. He lost the Asian vote. He lost everybody who is inspired to come into this country.\u201d\nIn this same interview, this Trump said Republicans need to back comprehensive immigration reform \u201cto take care of this incredible problem that we have with respect to immigration, with respect to people wanting to be wonderful productive citizens of this country.\u201d Or viewers could see the Trump who characterized immigrants this way in June: \u201cYou have people coming in, and I\u2019m not just saying Mexicans\u2014I\u2019m talking about people that are from all over that are killers and rapists, and they\u2019re coming into this country.\u201d\nThere\u2019s even a Trump out there who was a registered Democrat in 2004 because, as he told CNN, \u201cIt just seems that the economy does better under Democrats.\u201d\nWhichever version of Trump appears at the debate Thursday, it will be interesting to see how Republicans react\u2014and whether the moderators drag any of the other Trumps on stage, too.\nMr. Rove, a former deputy chief of staff to President  George W.
