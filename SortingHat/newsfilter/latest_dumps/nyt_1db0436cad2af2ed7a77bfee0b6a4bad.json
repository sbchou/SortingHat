{"body": "In Fred Davis\u2019s imagination, a whole new Donald J. Trump would have announced for president last week: a softer, humbler version of \u201cthe Donald,\u201d with a common touch and a demeanor far removed from (in Mr. Davis\u2019s words) the \u201cproudly egotistical showman\u201d of reality television fame.\n\nMr. Davis, a top adviser and creative director to Senator John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign and known for his arresting television commercials, laid out his vision for overhauling Mr. Trump in a three-page memo last month to the real estate mogul\u2019s campaign manager.\n\n\u201cNo braggadocio, no 757s or helicopters (as much as I love them), a different Mr. Trump would be portrayed,\u201d Mr. Davis wrote. \u201cRemember this morning when you said he was really \u2018down to earth\u2019? Right now that is simply unbelievable, it would be my job to make it believable and authentic.\u201d\n\nThat pitch was as far as things went: Mr. Davis now advises Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, another likely Republican presidential candidate. \n\nIn Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign kickoff last week, he eschewed humility entirely, announcing that he was \u201creally rich\u201d and estimating his net worth at nearly $9 billion, and offending Hispanics by saying that Mexican immigration means more crime, drugs and rapists in the United States. \n\nIn an interview, Mr. Davis confirmed that he had met with Trump advisers \u2013 as well as a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Senator Ted Cruz of Texas \u2013 after his longtime client, Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, announced he would not run for president. But Mr. Davis\u2019s proposal for a toned-down Mr. Trump never gained traction.\n\n\u201cI never met or talked to Trump, but somebody over there didn\u2019t seem to agree,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cMy guess is that it was the Donald, but I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAt least superficially, Mr. Davis and Mr. Trump might have seemed an intriguing match: Mr. Davis is known for producing quirky and creative ads, which often garner intense attention online and in the political press.\n\nCorey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, described Mr. Davis as \u201cone of the best in the business,\u201d but said the campaign planned to take its own distinctive approach to advertising.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked to a number of firms, but Mr. Trump, because of his success in business \u2013 he has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, he\u2019s doing O.K. \u2013 he wants to do things a little differently,\u201d Mr. Lewandowski said.\n\nIn his memo, Mr. Davis proposed an extensive \u2013 and presumably costly \u2013 media campaign, including immediate advertising in Iowa and New Hampshire, and on national cable.\n\n\u201cI envision something beautiful and elegant, not like any political ad ever, with minimal visuals of Mr. T. Instead it would feature a lot of people across the country talking about finally needing this place to work,\u201d Mr. Davis wrote, adding of Mr. Trump, \u201cHe is present in the film in an understated way, causing people to think, \u2018maybe I was wrong about that man.\u2019\u201d\n\nFlashing enthusiasm, Mr. Davis added: \u201cThis is a very exciting project. Almost life-defining, if you\u2019ll pardon a touch of hubris.\u201d", "byline": "ALEXANDER BURNS", "description": "In one political consultant\u2019s imagination, a whole new Donald J.
