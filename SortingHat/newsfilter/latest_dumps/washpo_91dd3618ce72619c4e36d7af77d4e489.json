{"body": "  ROBERTSDALE, Ala. \u2014 Kim and Renee Byrd had wanted to see Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Mobile, but there were vegetables to sell. The Byrds were third-generation farmers, and the traffic down Route\u00a090, toward the Gulf of Mexico, brought in travelers who wanted fresh honey, fresh peaches, fresh okra. Driving 45\u00a0minutes to Mobile was asking a little much, even if the next president of the United States was calling. \u201cHe runs an empire,\u201d said Renee Byrd, 44, of Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s what the country needs, someone who runs an empire.\u201d The Byrds thought the country needed someone who was realistic about immigration, too. Officially, fewer than 1 in 10 Robertsdale residents were Hispanic. According to Kim Byrd, 45, that did not account for the trailer parks \u201csaturated with Mexicans\u201d or for \u201call the convenience stores\u201d bought by immigrants with mysterious tax breaks. \u201cThey all work under the table and make [loads] of money,\u201d said Renee Byrd. \u201cThe poor white people who work around here are all screwed.\u201d A mile down the road, a lunchtime crowd was arriving at a Mexican restaurant called El Rodeo. The Latino wait staff took orders in English and Spanish, from customers who would not care to see Trump if he were speaking in their living rooms. \u201cHe\u2019s no good,\u201d said carpenter Miguel Chabac, 27, through a translator. \u201cI think he\u2019s a person who doesn\u2019t value our work.\u201d Chabac and his friends had had plenty of experience with people like that. Alabama, which hosted the largest rally of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign Friday night, had been a test kitchen for Trump-style crackdowns on undocumented workers \u2014 and it had not gone well. In 2011, a new Republican legislature and governor enacted HB\u00a056, the Alabama Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act. Chief sponsor Micky Hammon warned the undocumented that he would \u201cmake it difficult for them to live here so they will deport themselves.\u201d Renting a house or giving a job to an \u201cillegal\u201d became a crime. Police were empowered to demand proof of citizenship from anyone who looked like he or she might lack it. School administrators were instructed to do the same to children. The backlash was massive \u2014 a legal assault that chipped away at the law, a political campaign that made Republicans own its consequences. Business groups blamed the tough measures for scaring away capital and for an exodus of workers that hurt the state\u2019s agriculture industry. After Mitt Romney lost the 2012 presidential election, strategists in his own party blamed his support for the Alabama attrition policy. Those critics included Donald Trump. \u201cHe had a crazy policy of self-deportation, which was maniacal,\u201d Trump told reporter Ronald Kessler after the election. \u201cIt sounded as bad as it was.\u201d Asked about the law, Alabama voters rarely say that it worked. Large farms spent millions training new workers. The Byrds conceded that agriculture suffered after some immigrants fled the state. \u201cMost of them left and didn\u2019t come back,\u201d said Terry Darring-Rogers, who works at a Mobile law firm specializing in immigration. The debate seemed to be over \u2014 nice try, lesson learned \u2014 until the summer of Trump. He\u2019s run as a standard-bearer for tough, clinical immigration reform that includes mass deportation. Trump has also kick-started a debate about \u201cbirthright citizenship,\u201d which is granted to any child born in America under the 14th\u00a0Amendment. \u201cWe could tell him a hundred of the things that went wrong in Alabama, and he wouldn\u2019t listen,\u201d said Frank Barragan, Mobile\u2019s regional organizer in the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice. \u201cBut our biggest concern is not really Donald Trump. Our concern is that the other candidates are jumping on that bandwagon.\u201d By speaking so plainly, Trump ushered in a new discussion about who deserved to be in the country, no matter who might be offended by \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d talk. Supporters of Alabama\u2019s reforms, after years of retreat and apology, welcome the opportunity to defend themselves. They can challenge, at last, the conventional wisdom that the bill did not work. \u201cOur bill got eviscerated by the federal government,\u201d said Jim Carns, a Republican state representative who came to Mobile to endorse Trump. \u201cIt was like 95\u00a0percent within the federal standards, but those standards weren\u2019t being enforced. We enforced them, and it worked for several months until the feds did their thing.\u201d The voters and legislators who rallied Friday argued that the theory of HB\u00a056 \u2014 ending any incentives for people to work illegally in the United States \u2014 remained sound. Secretary of State Jim Merrill, who attended Trump\u2019s event but endorsed no candidate, said that Alabamans were welcoming to foreign workers but wanted them to get real visas and work through the citizenship process. \u201cIllegals have stepped up and they\u2019ve said, \u2018we\u2019ll do that work,\u2019\u2009\u201d said Merrill. \u201cBut some of those jobs used to be performed by people in the lower economic strata of our communities. We want to make sure that every American who wants to work has a job.\u201d To Republicans, the lesson of HB\u00a056 was no longer that it failed. The lesson was that it had not been permitted to work, stymied by the Obama administration. That theory took shape in the displays in some Robertsdale stores, where a sign declaring compliance with E-Verify was posted above an even larger ad from the Civil Rights division of the Department of Justice. \u201cIf you have the right to work, don\u2019t let anyone take it away,\u201d read the ad. \u201cNo employer can deny you a job or fire you because of your national origin or citizenship status.\u201d Trump\u2019s fans were letting themselves imagine what Alabama might have looked like had then-Attorney General Eric Holder not declared war on HB\u00a056 \u2014 and what the whole country might look like if a president took the law national. They saw, in the tycoon-candidate, someone who would not be bowed by complaints from the business community. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing an invasion, which is exactly what the Chamber of Commerce wants,\u201d said Dean Young, a conservative activist and HB\u00a056 supporter who nearly won a 2012 special election for southern Alabama\u2019s seat in Congress. \u201cI\u2019m told by a lot of the business people that actually live here that HB\u00a056 did help. I trust them, because if we don\u2019t stop the flow of illegal immigrants into this country, we\u2019re going to lose it.\u201d Still, even the people who wanted to take Alabama\u2019s immigration experiment to the national level had some qualms about the implementation. After the rally, retirees Philip Payne and Roberta Payne debated how much of HB\u00a056 needed to change in order to become federal policy. \u201cThey need to do it gradually,\u201d said Roberta Payne, 75. \u201cI\u2019ve heard someone say, get rid of the bad ones \u2014 the ones that are killing, maiming, robbing, stealing. You make it slow and easy. You\u2019ve got to find out who the people are and how long they\u2019ve been there. You can\u2019t just send the people back.\u201d Her husband, 71, sounded convinced, but he brought the issue back to its core. \u201cHow much do we spend on illegals in this country?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s billions of dollars.\u201d Trump, who did not specifically discuss the Alabama law in his speech, took credit for at least focusing the debate on the cost of immigration. He took credit for forcing his rivals to discuss \u201cbirthright citizenship\u201d and to go on record that it was a problem when undocumented workers crossed the border to have children. \u201cYou know, he put out a memo, you cannot use \u2018anchor baby,\u2019\u2009\u201d said Trump, referring to former Florida governor Jeb Bush. \u201cNow that I\u2019m using it, he\u2019s using it! Politicians.\u201d Across southern Alabama, even as people debated how far immigration law should go, many conservatives vehemently agreed with Trump. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be able to come here,\u201d said Kim Byrd, \u201cif you just want to have a damn baby.\u201d ", "byline": "", "description": "Alabama backed off the 2011 measure, but the rise of Trump has given supporters a second wind.", "title": "Alabama tried a Donald Trump-style immigration law.
