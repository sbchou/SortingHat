{"body": "T. Boone Pickens made billions drilling for oil and gas and squaring off in bare-knuckled corporate takeover bouts.\n\nNow the 87-year-old tycoon is embroiled in what may be the last big battle of his career. Only this one is aimed thousands of miles north of his Texas home. And it is over wind power.\n\nIt is an unusual fight for the former wildcatter. Mr. Pickens is using his rights under the North American Free Trade Agreement to bring claims against the Canadian province of Ontario. And a Florida company that has provoked his ire is one that is usually on the same side as Mr. Pickens when it comes to regulation and politics \u2014 in particular, in helping Jeb Bush get elected president.\n\nLike other investors who have challenged governments, Mr. Pickens has taken his dispute to an international court. He is seeking $700 million in damages for future losses related to bids that his wind power company, Mesa Power, lost in wind power auctions in Ontario.\n\nMr. Pickens and Mesa Power contend that the Florida company, NextEra, was granted exclusive access through private meetings with important government officials that ultimately tilted the bidding in its favor.\n\nThe province of Ontario granted NextEra $3.8 billion in energy contracts. Mesa Power contends that $18,600 in donations that NextEra made to the ruling Liberal Party in Ontario before elections in 2011 had undue influence on the auction.\n\nNextEra did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMesa Power\u2019s notice of arbitration also includes allegations of favoritism toward two Korean companies, Samsung C&T and Korea Electric Power Corporation, that entered a separate energy deal with the government.\n\nMr. Pickens says his long-running dispute is a matter of principle.\n\n\u201cIt makes no difference whether the amount is $7 billion or $700 million,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about fighting for fair and equitable treatment.\u201d\n\nBut Mesa Power\u2019s loss in Ontario was also personal \u2014 the projects would have been the cornerstone of a wind energy business that he extolled back home in the United States and that ultimately failed.\n\nIn other circumstances, NextEra, a sprawling energy company based in Juno Beach, Fla., has been aligned with Mr. Pickens. Both NextEra and Mr. Pickens have close ties to the Bush family and have been generous donors to Mr. Bush\u2019s current campaign for president. And both Mr. Pickens and NextEra have at times advocated the same regulatory policy changes.\n\nA fixture in local Florida politics, NextEra has donated more than $1 million this year alone to Right to Rise USA, a super PAC set up to assist Mr. Bush\u2019s presidential campaign. The company\u2019s ties to the candidate extend beyond politics, too: One longtime executive, Armando Olivera, was a limited partner in one of Mr. Bush\u2019s private equity funds, BH Global Aviation, according to British filings.\n\nAs for Mr. Pickens, he recently donated $100,000 to Mr. Bush\u2019s efforts in the hope that if he wins, Mr. Bush will approve the construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline between the United States and Canada. He is also close to Mr. Bush\u2019s brother, George W. Bush, and recently posted pictures of himself with the former president on Twitter.\n\nMr. Pickens first pushed into wind power in 2007, creating Mesa Power to develop and finance wind and other renewable energy projects.\n\nWhen Ontario enacted a Green Energy Act in 2009, both Mesa Power and NextEra saw an opportunity. As part of its policy change, the government created a program to provide incentives for companies to invest in renewable energy projects. Companies that were awarded contracts would be paid premium guaranteed prices set by the government. In one auction, more than 500 applications were submitted, exceeding the government\u2019s expectations, according to statements filed with the court.\n\n\u201cIt was a very, very attractive price,\u201d said Cole Robertson, vice president of finance for Mesa Power, noting that the government\u2019s set price in 2011 was double that in Texas at time.\n\nMesa Power submitted several project proposals through the program. But when the first rankings came out in late 2010, its executives disputed the assessments, arguing that Mesa Power\u2019s projects should have been higher.\n\nOntario government officials have countered that Mesa Power did not submit its applications properly.\n\n\u201cIn my view, many of Mesa Power\u2019s failures were caused by its sloppiness and lack of care in preparing its application, and the consequent failure to satisfy clearly defined criteria,\u201d said Richard Duffy, a manager of procurement at the Ontario Power Authority, the agency charged with evaluating energy project proposals, in a witness statement.\n\nMesa Power later disputed an auction in the spring of 2011, complaining of a lack of transparency around the process of awarding contracts and insufficient time for public consultation. Mesa Power executives wrote to Shawn Cronkwright, an official with the power authority, seeking clarification and meetings with the agency and the Ministry of Energy. Mr. Cronkwright told Mesa Power executives that these meetings would not be possible because the agency had yet to award contracts, according to court documents.\n\nThe same month that the government rejected his projects in 2011, Mr. Pickens took his case to an international tribunal, a forum where the judges are appointed by both parties in the case and a judgment can\u2019t be appealed.\n\nOntario says the claims are without merit. The international tribunal is expected to rule as soon as this month.\n\nUnder Nafta, investors can bring claims directly against a government in an international forum, under a clause intended to provide a substitute judicial system for investors in countries where the local court is not independent from executive power. These tribunals have become contentious because investors increasingly use them in disputes with countries where the legal system is robust.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a unique regime,\u201d said Andrew Newcombe, an associate professor at the Faculty of Law at the University of Victoria who has served as an arbitrator in international disputes. He noted that \u201cinvestors have used treaties to challenge health and safety and environmental issues.\u201d\n\nA review of documents and emails between NextEra executives, lobbyists and government officials show that NextEra met and held calls with high-level officials at the Ontario Ministry of Energy, the premier\u2019s office and the power authority, even as Mesa Power executives were told they could not speak to officials until contracts were awarded. When NextEra lobbyists requested more information, officials sometimes responded within hours.\n\nMr. Pickens\u2019s lawyers argue that NextEra was able to wield influence because of its chief lobbyist, Bob Lopinski at Counsel Public Affairs. A former adviser to the Ontario premier, Dalton McGuinty, Mr. Lopinski was hired in 2010. He contacted former colleagues in the premier\u2019s office to set up meetings for senior NextEra executives including Mitch Davidson, the chief executive. He also arranged for meetings at the Ministry of Energy and the power authority.\n\n\u201cThroughout this arbitration process the government of Canada has been working closely with the government of Ontario to vigorously defend this case,\u201d said John Babcock, a spokesman for the Canadian government.\n\nFor NextEra, whose operations include electricity plants in Hawaii and wind farms in North Dakota \u2014 such political contributions are not unusual. In the United States, the company has spent millions of dollars in political donations to both the Republican and Democratic parties.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t win an election in Florida without the support of NextEra,\u201d said William Pentland, managing partner at Brookside Strategies, an energy consulting firm. NextEra\u2019s subsidiary, Florida Power and Light, came under criticism in 2009 when former Governor Bush argued for rate increases for the company in an opinion piece in The Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nInvoking rolling blackouts in Brazil at the time as a warning sign, he wrote, \u201cIt might surprise a lot of Floridians to know that our state may face a similar fate.\u201d He added, \u201cWith power, the cash registers open and close.\u201d\n\nMr. Pickens, too, has taken his share of public criticism for his business ventures. In the 1980s he waged relentless campaigns against some of the biggest oil companies like Unocal and Gulf Oil, being called a \u201ccorporate raider\u201d and once a \u201csoul-sucking ghoul.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just part of the business. I never cried,\u201d Mr. Pickens said in the interview.\n\nWith that same attitude, he abandoned his wind energy projects when the price of natural gas fell, changing his prospects for making a profit with wind energy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve drilled dry holes before and I didn\u2019t quit drilling wells,\u201d Mr. Pickens said. \u201cWind? Sure, if the economics get right, I\u2019ll get back in.\u201d\n\nFor now, though, he\u2019s back to oil and natural gas. Speaking to an audience of hedge fund managers in Las Vegas earlier this year, Mr. Pickens declared that he was about to \u201cgive up on Washington,\u201d because of its failure to approve the construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, a contentious cross-border project with Canada that would extract oil from the Canadian oil sands.\n\nHe\u2019s setting his sights on Mr. Bush to make it possible. But he is keeping his options open, most recently donating $25,000 to support Carly Fiorina. Mr. Pickens is also considering a donation to another Republican candidate, Ben Carson, according to a representative.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already passed the House and the Senate,\u201d Mr. Pickens said back in May. \u201cSo a new president would fix it.\u201d", "byline": "ALEXANDRA STEVENSON", "description": "T.
