{"body": "DUBUQUE, Iowa \u2014 Donald J. Trump, it is abundantly clear, is not a conventional candidate. And neither is his approach to recruiting campaign workers.\n\nA co-chairwoman of Mr. Trump\u2019s Iowa campaign, Tana Goertz, who has no prior political experience, picks the campaign\u2019s county leaders \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d-style \u2014 in head-to-head tests of public speaking, organizing and salesmanship. A stopwatch is involved.\n\n\u201cA couple of guys came out and said, \u2018This isn\u2019t for me,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Goertz, who was once a finalist on Mr. Trump\u2019s reality show. \u201cI said, \u2018Dude, if not now, when? Do it.\u2019 I forced them. One of the guy\u2019s wife emailed me and said, \u2018You put some passion back into my husband I hadn\u2019t seen in 15 years.\u2019\u201d\n\nA major challenge for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, in Iowa and elsewhere, is how to convert support in polls and raucous crowds into votes in primaries and caucuses. And picking a determined staff is central to that mission.\n\nMuch of the support for Mr. Trump, who returned to Iowa on Tuesday for another large rally, is from people who are fed up with politics as usual. They are estranged from the Republican Party leadership. He must transform their anger into a resolve to vote, starting with the Iowa caucuses, which historically have low turnout and are driven by party stalwarts \u2014 the opposite of many of the people flocking to him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of buzz,\u201d Chuck Laudner, Mr. Trump\u2019s Iowa director, said in an interview this summer. \u201cTransforming that into caucus support is going to be the heavy lift.\u201d\n\nMany traditional operatives are skeptical of Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to organize ranks of volunteers and activists, who are needed for the unglamorous field work of wrangling voters to attend a caucus in the state\u2019s nearly 1,700 precincts in early February.\n\nAt an Iowa rally of 2,300 evangelical Christians for Senator Ted Cruz last week, Mr. Cruz\u2019s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, said he would rather have those supporters, who were committed to a family values \u201cmovement,\u201d than the thousands more who turn out at a Trump rally to be \u201cpart of a show.\u201d\n\nTo convince a new wave of caucusgoers to participate, Mr. Trump would have to defy history. Only about one in five registered Republicans have attended past caucuses; the dream of bringing in thousands of marginal voters and boosting the turnout beyond about 120,000 Republicans has eluded many past efforts.\n\n\u201cThe entertainment value of a Trump event is high, but the reality of his issues is a real challenge to him,\u201d said Steve Grubbs, the director for Senator Rand Paul\u2019s Iowa campaign, citing Mr. Trump\u2019s past support for gun restrictions and abortion rights. \u201cAt the end of the day you can like the concept of Donald Trump, but voting for him at the caucuses will be a lot tougher for people.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, despite his flamboyant politics and a strategy that seems focused on appearing, every hour of every day, in the national spotlight, Mr. Trump has actually put in place a robust field operation in Iowa, grounded in the most time-proven methods.\n\nHe was the only candidate of 17 Republicans to plant a volunteer for all 11 days of the Iowa State Fair at the state Republican Party booth this month. Even as Mr. Trump\u2019s bravura flyby of the fair in a helicopter produced headlines, his little-noticed volunteers collected hundreds of cards with voters\u2019 email addresses, providing invaluable contact data to activate more volunteers. It was a far cry from the early days of his campaign, when actors were reportedly hired to fill out the crowd when he announced his presidential run.\n\nIn Ms. Goertz, a motivational speaker, Mr. Trump has a political newcomer helping to lead his organizing in Iowa, but his state director, Mr. Laudner, is a 30-year veteran of Iowa campaigns. He has built one of the largest field teams of any Republican candidate this year: 10 paid staff members.\n\nA former executive director of the state Republican Party, Mr. Laudner is known for his enormous spreadsheets of supporters. He is well connected to evangelical and Tea Party conservatives and is known for calling through a list of people every day to get a feel for what is happening on the ground.\n\nAfter directing Rick Santorum\u2019s 2012 victory in the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Laudner said he signed on with Mr. Trump because he was frustrated with the failure of Republicans to change Washington even with a majority in Congress. \u201cWe haven\u2019t put any points on the board,\u201d he said. \u201cI was determined to do something different.\u201d\n\nAmong the campaign\u2019s Iowa field staff is Elizabeth Davidson, an organizer in Bettendorf, who is doing just what field staff members are supposed to: recruiting a captain for every one of the 63 precincts in her assigned territory, Scott County.\n\n\u201cOur candidate\u2019s really doing a tremendous job to make our job easy,\u201d Ms. Davidson said. \u201cPeople reach out to you when they figure out you\u2019re working for Trump.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s celebrity has been harnessed in other ways as a recruitment tool. The campaign has leased a blue bus that it parks at shopping centers throughout the state. Scores of curious people are drawn by the large \u201cTrump\u201d logo, and are given caucus information packets.\n\n\u201cTrump doesn\u2019t have to come here. He parks his bus in a parking lot and they come to him; it\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d said an adviser to a rival candidate, speaking on condition that he not be named.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Mr. Trump\u2019s rally in Dubuque, for which the campaign has received 3,000 responses, is practically in the backyard of Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who long held the lead in polls of Iowa Republicans but recently relinquished it to Mr. Trump. The Trump campaign denied the appearance was meant as a snub to Mr. Walker, who lived not far away as a boy in northeast Iowa.", "byline": "TRIP GABRIEL", "description": "Donald J.
