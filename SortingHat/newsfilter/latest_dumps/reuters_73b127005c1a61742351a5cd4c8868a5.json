{"body": "(Recasts with Border Patrol controversy)\nBy Alistair Bell and Susan Heavey\nWASHINGTON, July 23 (Reuters) - Republican presidential\ncandidate Donald Trump accused the union that represents Border\nPatrol agents of bullying its members to pull out of hosting a\nvisit by him to the U.S.-Mexican border in Texas on Thursday.\n\nThe developer and reality TV star said leaders of the\nNational Border Patrol Council in Washington put pressure on its\nlocal representatives in Laredo to scrap their participation in\nthe \"boots on the ground\" border trip.\nTrump caused an uproar with accusations last month that\nMexico sends rapists and other criminals to emigrate to the\nUnited States. He has also promised to build a wall on the\nborder and make Mexico pay for it.\nLocal members of the Border Patrol union had been ready to\naccompany Trump, who has outraged Mexicans with incendiary\ncomments about immigrants, but announced early on Thursday that\nthey had abandoned the plan after discussions with union\nleaders.\n\"They were totally silenced directly from superiors in\nWashington who do not want people to know how bad it is on the\nborder --- every bit as bad as Mr. Trump has been saying,\" the\ncandidate said in a statement.\nHe said he would go ahead with the visit on Thursday\n\"despite the great danger.\" A spokesman for the union's national\noffice was not immediately available for comment.\nThe TV host is at or near the top of many opinion polls of\nthe 16 Republican candidates for the November, 2016 presidential\nelection, worrying the party establishment, which fears he could\nturn off moderate voters.\nTrump threatened in an interview published on Thursday\nto run as a political independent if he does not get \"fair\"\ntreatment from the Republican Party.\nHe said any third-party bid would depend on the Republican\nNational Committee's actions during the party's primary\nselection process, according to The Hill.\n\"I'll have to see how I'm being treated by the Republicans,\"\nTrump was quoted as saying. \"Absolutely, if they're not fair,\nthat would be a factor.\"\nThe comments followed rebukes by the party establishment\nover his criticism of Mexican immigrants and U.S. Senator John\nMcCain's war record and for personal attacks against fellow\nRepublican White House contenders.\nAn independent run could split Republican voters and give\nleading Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton an edge in the 2016\nelection.\n\n (Additional reporting by Emily Stephenson; Editing by John\nWhitesides and Christian Plumb)", "byline": "", "description": "WASHINGTON, July 23 (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump accused the union that represents Border Patrol agents of bullying its members to pull out of hosting a visit by him to the U.S.-Mexican border in Texas on Thursday.", "title": "UPDATE 1-Trump in fight with Border Patrol union over Texas visit", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/financialsNews/~3/PaDY3wxTSUI/story01.htm", "topics": ["mexico"], "people": ["Susan Heavey", "Emily Stephenson", "Christian Plumb", "Hillary Clinton", "Alistair Bell", "Donald Trump"], "orgs": ["Republican Party", "National Committee", "National Border Patrol Council", "Border Patrol union", "United States."], "authors": [{"author_id": 33346, "fullname": "reuters editorial", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-07-23 17:12:47", "org": "reuters", "article_id": "73b127005c1a61742351a5cd4c8868a5", "date_access": "2015-07-23 16:30:57.582107"}
