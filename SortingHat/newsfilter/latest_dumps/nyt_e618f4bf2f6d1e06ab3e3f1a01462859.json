{"body": "Good Wednesday morning. On the day the pope came to Washington and drew nearly all the nation\u2019s cameras with him, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont\u00a0did their best to stay in view, covering the high costs of prescription drugs, the Keystone XL oil pipeline, and low-wage workers. But, on Wednesday, all eyes, including President Obama\u2019s and those of the gathering thousands, will be on the man in white.\n\nPope Francis will celebrate his first full day in the nation\u2019s capital on Wednesday, meeting at the White House with Mr. Obama and participating in a parade for thousands of adoring admirers before canonizing the Rev. Jun\u00edpero Serra, an 18th-century Spanish missionary, in a Mass at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.\n\nMr. Obama is expected to welcome the pope, who received a rock-star greeting as he arrived in Washington on Tuesday, complete with chants and shrieking crowds, by taking note of his unique standing in the world and his unifying presence. White House officials said the president had not mapped out any political agenda.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for two men who have so many values in common to talk about the efforts that they are taking in the respective and quite different roles to advance those shared values,\u201d said Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman.\n\nThe pope\u2019s visit has stirred the sometimes-jaded capital, which can be blas\u00e9 or even hostile about the presence of foreign leaders and dignitaries. In fact, congressional officials are trying to tamp down enthusiasm for the pope\u2019s address to a joint meeting of Congress on Thursday, urging their colleagues to conduct themselves with dignity \u2014 a trait not always exercised.\n\n\u201cWe actually hope that we can show a little more decorum to the pope than we sometimes do at State of the Union addresses,\u201d Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, a member of the Republican leadership, said on Tuesday. \u201cIt is our hope on this side of the aisle and the Democratic side of the aisle that we can avoid the dueling ovations, the jack-in-the-box standing for this and for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen to one of the most famous and most respected voices on the face of the earth with the respect and decorum that is due,\u201d Mr. Wicker said.\n\n\u2014 Carl Hulse\n\nWhat We\u2019re Watching\n\n\u2013 \u00a0Donald J. Trump, who canceled an appearance in South Carolina last week in the wake of criticism over his views on Muslims,\u00a0will speak to the\u00a0state\u2019s African-American Chamber of Commerce in Charleston.\n\n\u2013 \u00a0Carly Fiorina, who has soared in the polls after her success in the debate last week, will also hold an event in South Carolina.\n\n\u2013 \u00a0Elsewhere, Rick Santorum will be in Iowa, Ben Carson will make two appearances in Michigan as he also struggles with reaction to his comments on Muslims, and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina will be in New Hampshire.\n\nClinton Covers Lots of Ground in Rare Interview\n\nMrs. Clinton was in a sharing mood on Tuesday, releasing a detailed plan on prescription drugs and, at a town-hall-style meeting in Iowa, revealing that she opposed\u00a0the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nThen, perhaps to erase criticism that she was avoiding interviews, Mrs. Clinton sat for about two hours with the editorial board of The Des Moines Register, holding court on a raft of topics including Mr. Trump, Mr. Sanders, immigration, education and foreign policy. Some highlights to cap a busy day of Clinton news:\n\nOn the success of political outsiders: Mrs. Clinton said that economic frustration was real and that politicians were paying a price in some polls. But she said that ultimately she thinks people will be drawn to a candidate with experience working with Congress and negotiating on the global stage.\n\nImmigration: Mrs. Clinton would preserve and expand Mr. Obama\u2019s executive actions to protect immigrants. She argued that mass deportations were wrong. \u201cThe only way you could do that would be with intensive, intrusive police and maybe even military action, which I do not think anybody would support,\u201d she said.\n\nPlanned Parenthood: \u201cI defend and I will continue to defend Planned Parenthood,\u201d she said, referring to calls from Republicans to defund the group in the face of videos accusing it of selling fetal tissue for a profit. The group provides broad health planning and screening services, Mrs. Clinton said, and the attacks against it are \u201ca direct assault on a women\u2019s right to choose health care.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders: Mrs. Clinton said that he should share more about his plans to make college free for everyone and that she does not believe, as she suggested he does, that rich kids should get a free ride.\n\nMr. Trump: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t propose anything specific,\u201d she said. \u201cHe offers assertions.\u201d\n\nJoseph R. Biden Jr.: \u201cIt\u2019s totally up to him; whatever he decides.\u201d\n\nOn transparency if elected: \u201cWell, you can count on me not to have a private email server,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.\n\n\u2014 Alan Rappeport\n\nWhite House Seeks Quick Appeal Over Health Care Ruling\n\nThe Obama administration, which was handed a significant legal setback by a Federal District Court judge in Washington this month, is moving to quickly appeal the ruling that gave the Republican-led House standing to sue over the new health care law.\n\nIn new filings, the Justice Department asked\u00a0Judge Rosemary M. Collyer\u00a0to allow the administration to quickly appeal her decision to the federal appeals court for the District of Columbia rather than move ahead with arguing the merits of the House\u2019s claim that the administration is distributing billions of health care dollars that Congress did not appropriate. Administration lawyers said the judge\u2019s ruling is so potentially far-reaching that it needed to be challenged immediately instead of waiting on a final outcome that could reset the constitutional balance of powers.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in our nation\u2019s history, one House of Congress has been permitted to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts to resolve a disagreement between the political branches arising out of the executive branch\u2019s administration of a federal program,\u201d the administration told the judge. \u201cAllowing such a suit to proceed is a momentous step.\u201d\n\nThe House intends to oppose the request for an immediate appeal and instead wants to first fight out in court whether the administration had the authority to spend the money.\n\n\u2014 Carl Hulse\n\nOur Favorites from The Times\n\n\u2013\u00a0 Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin\u2019s departure from the presidential race shows the limits of \u201csuper PACs,\u201d as outside fund-raising groups cannot pay rent, phone bills, salaries, airfares or ballot access fees, and are not entitled to preferential rates on advertising.\n\nAnd as Mr. Walker heads back to his day job, there might also have been some lessons he could have learned, The Times magazine writes, from George W. Bush.\n\n\u2013\u00a0 Mr. Trump, who\u00a0is threatening to sue the conservative group Club for Growth unless it stops running political advertisements asserting that he wants to raise taxes if elected president, grew up in a Queens neighborhood that contrasts with the diverse area around it.\n\n\u2013\u00a0 In Congress,\u00a0Senate Republicans took the first steps to avert a government shutdown, scheduling a\u00a0vote on a temporary spending plan, while Senate Democrats offered a climate change bill that had no chance of passing but that they said would push for policies that could help them in 2016.\n\n\u2013\u00a0 And the F.B.I.\u00a0recovered work-related and personal emails that Mrs. Clinton said had been erased from the server she used as secretary of state, two officials said.\n\nUncommitted Donors Offer Insight Into G.O.P. Race Uncertainty\n\nOne of the most striking illustrations of the uncertainty of Republican presidential race is the number of high-dollar donors still on the sidelines \u2014 or who are at least not yet fully committed to a single candidate.\n\nThis fact of political life was driven home on Tuesday afternoon on the 43rd floor of a Manhattan office tower, in the offices of the Blackstone Group, a private equity firm.\n\nA few dozen prominent New York business executives came to see Gov.\u00a0John R. Kasich of Ohio\u00a0at an event organized by the Partnership for New York City, an organization of chief executives in the city. It was not a fund-raiser, but a get-to-know-you session.\n\nThe gathering, hosted by\u00a0the Blackstone chief executive Stephen\u00a0A. Schwarzman, included\u00a0Henry Kravis\u00a0of the private equity firm K.K.R., the hedge-fund manager\u00a0Daniel S. Loeb, and\u00a0Howard J. Rubenstein\u00a0of Rubenstein, the media relations company.\n\nSome of the attendees have already raised money for other Republicans. But that they would still take the time to take the measure of Mr. Kasich highlights just how fluid the Republican contest is as fall approaches.\n\n\u2014 Jonathan Martin\n\nWhat We\u2019re Reading Elsewhere\n\n\u2013 \u00a0After a rough few days,\u00a0New York Magazine writes,\u00a0Mr. Trump\u00a0\u201cneeded\u201d\u00a0Mr. Walker\u00a0to suspend his campaign to take some attention away from the negative coverage.\n\n\u2013\u00a0 When\u00a0Jeb Bush\u00a0defended his brother\u00a0at the debate last week against attacks by Mr. Trump, it was a moment,\u00a0The Washington Post writes, that \u201crefocused a campaign in desperate need of a \u2018moment,\u2019 and signaled the extent to which Jeb Bush has become comfortable \u2014 even eager \u2014 to highlight rather than play down his family ties.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u00a0And\u00a0BuzzFeed takes a look\u00a0at past comments by Mr. Carson that the wide acceptance of evolution \u201cwas something that was encouraged by the adversary,\u201d and that the Big Bang theory was a \u201cfairy tale.\u201d", "byline": "FIRST DRAFT", "description": "All eyes, including President Obama\u2019s and those of the gathering thousands, on Wednesday will be on the pope.", "title": "First Draft: Today in Politics: A First-Time Visitor to Washington Plans to Hit All the Sights", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/09/23/today-in-politics-a-first-time-visitor-to-washington-plans-to-hit-all-the-sights/", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Alan Rappeport", "Josh Earnest", "Jonathan Martin", "Roger Wicker", "Carl Hulse", "John R.
