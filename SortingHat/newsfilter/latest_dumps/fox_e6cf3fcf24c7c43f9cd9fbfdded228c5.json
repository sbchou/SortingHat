Scott Walker gets a post-announcement bump and businessman Donald Trump claims more of the spotlight.\u00a0\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still dominates the Democratic race.\u00a0 Yet the poll also warns trouble may be ahead for her.\nAmong Republican primary voters, Trump captures 18 percent. He\u2019s closely followed by Walker at 15 percent and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at 14 percent. No one else reaches double-digits.\u00a0\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS\nSupport for Trump is up seven percentage points since last month and up 14 points since May.\u00a0 He\u2019s also the candidate GOP primary voters say they are most interested in learning more about during the debates.\nWalker\u2019s up six points since he officially kicked off his campaign. That bump gets him back to the support he was receiving earlier this year. In March, he was also at 15 percent.\u00a0\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul gets eight percent, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio receives seven percent, former neurosurgeon Ben Carson comes in at six percent, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee get four percent a piece.\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie launched his campaign June 30.\u00a0 Even so, he comes in at three percent -- mostly unchanged from his two percent last month (June 21-23).\u00a0 Ohio Gov. John Kasich (who is announcing Tuesday) and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum each get two percent.\u00a0 Businesswoman Carly Fiorina, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former New York Gov. George Pataki each receive one percent or less.\u00a0\nOn the Democratic side, Clinton captures 59 percent among Democratic primary voters compared to 19 percent for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\u00a0 Last month, 61 percent backed Clinton and 15 percent Sanders (June 21-23). Eight percent would like to see Vice President Joe Biden as the nominee (he\u2019s undeclared).\u00a0 Former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb each get one percent.\u00a0\nBut here\u2019s the possible trouble for Clinton in the general election: 70 percent of voters overall say that a candidate who is sometimes less than honest is a \u201cdeal breaker\u201d for their vote -- and a 58-percent majority believes Clinton\u2019s natural instincts lean more toward \u201chiding the truth\u201d than \u201ctelling the truth\u201d (33 percent).\u00a0 Democratic primary voters are more likely to think her natural instincts lean toward telling the truth (61 percent) -- but even here, 29 percent say Clinton is more prone to hide the truth.\u00a0\nThe Fox poll also asks voters their second choice candidate, which allows us to look at what happens to the lineup if someone were to drop out.\u00a0 For example, if Trump decides to get out, Bush moves to the top spot at 19 percent, followed by Walker at 16 percent, Paul at 9 percent, Rubio at 8 percent, Carson at 7 percent, Cruz at 6 percent, Huckabee at 5 percent, Christie and Perry at 3 percent, and Fiorina, Kasich and Santorum get 2 percent.\u00a0\nTrump\u2019s June 16 announcement speech included provocative comments on illegal immigration that people are still talking about a month later, including the suggestion that the Mexican government is sending criminals and rapists to the United States.\u00a0 Whatever the blowback, his views resonate with many: 44 percent of voters think Trump is \u201cbasically right\u201d on the issue. A 53-percent majority disagrees.\u00a0 Among Republican primary voters, 68 percent say he is right.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nImmigration\nThere\u2019s been a major shift in the last five years in how voters want to handle illegal immigrants currently working in the United States.\u00a0 Today 64 percent favor setting up a system for them to become legal residents, up from 49 percent in 2010.\u00a0 And now 30 percent favor deportation, down from 45 percent five years ago.\u00a0\nCompared to 2010, support for setting up a system for legalization is up 21 points among Democrats, 11 points among independents and 8 points among Republicans.\u00a0\nThe top concerns about illegal immigration are strain on the government and, increasingly, crime.\u00a0 The poll shows 55 percent of voters are very concerned about illegal immigrants overburdening government services.\u00a0 That\u2019s down from 61 percent who felt that way in 2006.\u00a0\nFifty percent are very concerned about increased crime associated with illegal immigration.\u00a0 That\u2019s up from 39 percent almost 10 years ago.\u00a0 Views are about the same when voters are asked about illegal immigration leading to an increase in terrorism:\u00a0 50 percent are very concerned, up from 34 percent in 2006.\u00a0\nPeople also see significant benefits to the country from legal immigration: 43 percent say adding needed skills is a major benefit and another 43 percent feel that way about immigration adding to the entrepreneurial spirit of the U.S.\u00a0 About a third thinks a major upside is that legal immigrants perform jobs that Americans mostly don\u2019t want (35 percent) and bring new cultures (34 percent).\n\u00a0\nPollpourri\nVoters are divided over whether Congress should continue to investigate then-Secretary of State Clinton\u2019s handling of the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi that killed four Americans.\u00a0 Nearly half -- 47 percent -- want lawmakers to keep investigating Clinton.\u00a0 A slightly larger number -- 49 percent -- think it\u2019s time for Congress to move on.\nMost Republicans (74 percent) say continue investigating, while most Democrats (74 percent) say move on. Views among independents split: 47 percent investigate vs. 48 percent move on.\u00a0\nAfter being on the campaign trail for about a month, how do voters feel about the Donald?\u00a0 Fifty-four percent dismiss him as \u201cjust a loud mouth.\u201d\u00a0 Yet just over a third -- 34 percent -- admire Trump because \u201che\u2019s got guts.\u201d That jumps to 59 percent among GOP primary voters.\u00a0\nBy a 15-point margin, Republican primary voters (82 percent) are more likely to say they are extremely or very interested in the upcoming election than Democratic primary voters (67 percent).\u00a0\nThe Fox News poll is based on landline and cell phone interviews with 1,019 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from July 13-15, 2015. The full poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. The margin of error is higher among the subgroups of Democratic (+/-5%) and Republican primary voters (+/-4.5%).\n\u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "FOX NEWS POLLTrump tops GOP as many back immigration views", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/17/fox-news-poll-reshuffling-gop-field-many-agree-with-trump-on-immigration/", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Rick Perry", "Mike Huckabee", "Ted Cruz", "Chris Christie", "Joe Biden", "Bobby Jindal", "Bernie Sanders", "Scott Walker", "Rand Paul", "Martin O'Malley", "Jeb Bush", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Jim Webb", "Carly Fiorina", "Rick Santorum", "George Pataki", "Hillary Clinton", "John Kasich", "Lindsey Graham", "Ben Carson", "Lincoln Chafee"], "orgs": ["Shaw & Company Research", "Anderson Robbins Research", "GOP", "Congress", "United States."], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-07-17 10:06:58", "org": "fox", "article_id": "e6cf3fcf24c7c43f9cd9fbfdded228c5", "date_access": "2015-07-17 09:20:03.152363"}
