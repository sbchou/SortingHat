{"body": "A \u201csuper PAC\u201d set up by allies of Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky raised just over $3 million in the first six months of the year, according to a report filed with the Federal Election Commission on Friday \u2014 far less than most of the outside groups backing Mr. Paul\u2019s rivals for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nAlmost half of the money came from a single donor: George Macricostas, a Nevada-based businessmen and technology entrepreneur. Most of the rest came from Jeff Yass, an investor from Pennsylvania, who contributed $1 million. \n\nA handful of other donors \u2014 some of them also raising money directly for Mr. Paul\u2019s campaign \u2014 made six-figure contributions, including Robert Arnott, a California investor, and Kenneth Garschina, a longtime Paul backer in New York.\n\nThe super PAC, America\u2019s Liberty, filed more than a week before the official deadline. It had about $2.7 million in cash at the end of June, according to the filing.\n\nThe haul was relatively low in the high-dollar, high-stakes world of super PACs, which have taken center stage in this year\u2019s Republican primary contest.\n\nA super PAC backing Jeb Bush announced this month that it had raised $103 million, while Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is backed by a network of super PACs that brought in $37 million.
