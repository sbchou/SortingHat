{"body": "HIGHLIGHTS\nCLINTON TO TURN OVER PRIVATE EMAIL SERVER TO AUTHORITIES: Hillary Clinton is turning over to federal authorities the private computer server she used to handle her emails when she served as secretary of state, an unexpected move and an attempt to quash concerns that her unorthodox approach included insufficient safeguards to protect government secrets.\u00a0A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign on Tuesday said she had directed her team to give to the Justice Department both the computer server\u2014which had been kept at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y.\u2014and a thumb drive containing copies of her emails.\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s decision to relinquish her computer server is a surprise twist in a controversy that has shadowed her presidential bid. For months she has rebuffed congressional Republican leaders who have called on her to turn over the server to a neutral third party to verify her assertion that she had given the State Department all her work emails. She also has said the server was wiped clean of more than 31,000 emails that involved personal matters such as wedding plans, vacations and yoga routines.\u00a0Her assurances have so far failed to put the issue to rest, and even some Democrats worry that her email practices, in which she used a private account for her official emails, are one reason polling shows fewer people have come to see her as honest and straightforward.\u00a0Peter Nicholas and Damian Paletta report.\nPlus: Mrs. Clinton pledged\u00a0 to elevate the issue of substance abuse, saying she wants to hear from people on the front lines as she develops policies to help people dealing with addiction or mental illness.\nAARON ZITNER\u2019S EARLY HIT: WHY THE DEBATE OVER COLLEGE COSTS IS ABOUT MORE THAN COLLEGE\nEven if you don\u2019t carry student debt or have a kid headed to college, the debate over college costs is worth following. More than any issue, it\u2019s revealing how candidates in both parties plan to show an unhappy public that they have solutions to the current strain of economic anxiety, one arising from wage stagnation, disruptive technologies and tepid growth. And this debate is yielding a rarity in politics\u2014new ideas\u2014as well as some surprising areas of agreement between the parties.

Mr. Bush, a former Florida governor, used a policy speech last night to argue Mrs. Clinton is partly responsible for the rise of the Islamic State militant group from her time as secretary of state. His speech follows broadsides from Mrs. Clinton about Mr. Bush\u2019s stance on women\u2019s health, immigration, his comment that Americans should \u201cwork longer hours\u201d and his call to repeal the 2010 health law. The back-and-forth helps both candidates present themselves as leaders despite the very real threats from within their parties that could block their route to the nomination. It also offers a preview of what the general election would look like if, in fact, they become the nominees. Patrick O\u2019Connor and Laura Meckler report.\nTRUMP IS FRUGAL WITH HIS CASH IN GOP RACE: Donald Trump never skips a chance to remind audiences of his wealth, but he is proving reluctant to spend his own money on campaign essentials typical of a major presidential candidate. The New York developer has rejected paid television advertising as unnecessary, and he has resisted investing in efforts to secure ballot access, which can be expensive in some states, according to people familiar with his campaign. He also is rejecting appeals from his staff to appear at more in-person events, the people said, building his campaign instead on his ubiquitous cable-TV appearances. Reid J. Epstein and Heather Haddon report.\nFORMER TOP CLINTON FUNDRAISER SAYS \u2018I WAS GREEDY\u2019: Norman Hsu was in the middle of the action in national politics eight years ago, as a top fundraiser for Hillary Clinton and other Democrats. These days, he is holed up in a federal penitentiary here on charges of operating a Ponzi scheme and breaking campaign finance laws, and the action is anything but heated. The government said Mr. Hsu stole between $50 million and $100 million from individuals by claiming he was making short-term loans to retail companies\u2014and then pressured the investors to make political contributions. \u201cI was greedy,\u201d said Mr. Hsu, sitting in a small meeting room at the low-security correction institution on a recent day, wearing a beige prison-issued jumpsuit and the same round-framed glasses in the photos with Mrs. Clinton that remain indelibly online. \u201cI made a huge mistake.\u201d Ianthe Jeanne Dugan reports.\nPRO-PERRY SUPER PACS TO BOOST ROLE IN EARLY NOMINATING STATES: Super PACs backing Rick Perry\u2019s presidential bid are planning to take over several core campaign responsibilities in early nominating states after news that the former Texas governor\u2019s campaign is no longer paying its staff. The pro-Perry super PACs recently hired staff in Iowa and have plans to expand their payrolls in New Hampshire and South Carolina. The groups are also planning to launch a ground-game effort in Iowa and to air more TV ads there. The moves illustrate how the 2016 presidential race is likely to further blur the line between campaigns and the independent outside groups that control the majority of the funds backing a candidate.

Rand Paul, whose Republican presidential campaign has been buffeted by fundraising disappointments and falling poll numbers, faces new challenges in his home state of Kentucky \u2026\u00a0With his presidential stock rising after last week\u2019s Republican debate, Ohio Gov. John Kasich is set to announce a key New Hampshire endorsement Wednesday: former state attorney general Tom Rath.\nKERRY SAYS REJECTION OF IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL COULD HURT U.S. DOLLAR: Secretary of State John Kerry warned the U.S. dollar\u2019s status as the global currency could be threatened if Congress blocks the nuclear deal with Iran. The nation\u2019s chief diplomat doubled down on President Barack Obama\u2019s comments last week that scuttling the deal would bolster the case against the dollar as the reserve currency, a sentiment \u201calready bubbling out there,\u201d Mr. Kerry said. Mr. Kerry said if Congress prevents the U.S. from implementing the deal it could put the U.S. at odds with European allies, China and Russia. Felicia Schwartz and Nick Timiraos report.\nPlus:\u00a0Mr. Kerry said he believed that Russian and Chinese hackers read his emails.\nALSO IN THE NEWS\nChina intervened to prop up the yuan in the last minutes of trading, according to people familiar with the matter, in an apparent attempt to prevent an excessive fall in the currency.\u00a0Beijing signaled with its currency devaluation that the domestic economic slowdown it has failed to reverse is no longer a problem confined within China\u2019s borders. It is now the world\u2019s problem, too. Plus, China\u2019s surprise move to weaken the yuan threatened to further strain Washington\u2019s relations with Beijing, drawing quick condemnation from U.S. lawmakers and likely hurting the Obama administration\u2019s push to seal a sweeping trade agreement with Pacific nations.\nU.S. government officials have intervened in a long-running lawsuit against the Palestinian Authority, asking a federal judge to \u201ccarefully consider\u201d the bond he would require the group to pay as it appeals a jury verdict awarding hundreds of millions of dollars in damages to terror victims.\nFederal prosecutors filed charges against two alleged hackers and seven other people who allegedly traded on stolen corporate secrets.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy apologized Tuesday for a mine spill in Colorado that her agency caused last week and planned to travel to the area today, amid increasing criticism from lawmakers about the EPA\u2019s response.\nDemographic Intelligence predicts that ultimately around 60% of the children of millennials will be born to married parents, up from around 45% today.\nLawrence Lessig wants to be president\u2014for a day.

Washington Bureau Chief Jerry Seib explains what this tells us about the future of the 2016 foreign-policy debate.\nHERE\u2019S A LOOK AT THE DAY AHEAD\nOBAMA ADMINISTRATION:\u00a0President\u00a0Barack Obama\u00a0is vacationing with his family on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Mass., through Aug. 23.\u00a0Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0is on vacation in South Carolina through Thursday.

The New Yorkers\u2019s James Surowiecki examines the question and says part of the answer is that \u201cTrump\u2019s riches allow him to portray himself as someone who can\u2019t be bought, and his competitors as slaves to their donors. (Ross Perot pioneered this tactic during the 1992 campaign.)\u201d\nA new Gallup poll finds that just 14% of Americans approve of the job Congress is doing, down slightly from 17% in July, and 54% have an unfavorable opinion of House Speaker John Boehner.\nThe Washington Posts\u2019s Ruth Marcus writes that President Obama\u2019s comments that those who oppose the Iran nuclear deal are either ideological or illogical diminishes his case for congressional approval. \u201cObama once understood, even celebrated, this gray zone of difficult policy choices,\u201d she writes. The new Obama \u201chas close to zero tolerance for those who reach contrary conclusions.\u201d\nIn the WSJ\u2019s Think Tank, Aaron David Miller writes that the Iran nuclear deal is likely to survive a congressional vote of disapproval because President Obama will muster the votes needed to sustain a veto of that resolution of disapproval: \u201cThis accord is most likely unstoppable.\u201d\nMILESTONE\n9.5%:\u00a0The decline in U.S. farm workers is reducing fruit and vegetable production by 9.5%, or $3.1 billion, a year, according to a soon-to-be published analysis.\nFEEDBACK:\u00a0The Capital Journal Daybreak newsletter is The Wall Street Journal\u2019s\u00a0morning rundown of the biggest news stories and exclusive features from Washington on politics, policy, financial regulation, defense and more.
