{"body": "To the Editor:\n\nRe \u201cUnions Subdued, Walker Turns to Tenure at Wisconsin Colleges\u201d (front page, June 5):\n\nIt is unfortunate and sad that academic freedom is being trammeled at the University of Wisconsin, where tenure and shared governance are under attack.\n\nOn the Madison campus is a plaque that states one of the university\u2019s tenets: \u201cWhatever may be the limitations which trammel inquiry elsewhere, we believe the great State University of Wisconsin should ever encourage that continual and fearless sifting and winnowing by which alone the truth can be found.\u201d In the 1890s the university was pressured to censure a professor accused of being a pro-union radical, and the Board of Regents\u2019 response is on that plaque.\n\nThe state capital is less than a mile from the university campus, and there has always been animosity toward the liberal faculty and students. Gov. Scott Walker showed how much he values college education when he became a college dropout, and he is showing it again with his politically motivated proposal that shows disdain toward the university.
