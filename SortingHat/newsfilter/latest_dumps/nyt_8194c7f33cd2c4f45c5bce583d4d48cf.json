{"body": "Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday blamed Republicans for \u201c35 years\u201d of policies that have exacerbated income inequality by giving \u201cmore wealth to those at the top\u201d through tax cuts and corporate loopholes.\n\n\u201cTwice now in the past 20 years Democratic presidents have had to come in and clean up the mess left behind,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in New York, as she called for tax relief for middle-class families, an increase in collective bargaining and other incentives to raise middle-class wages.\n\n\u201cI believe we have to build a growth and fairness economy \u2014 you can\u2019t have one without the other,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a speech intended to lay the groundwork for the economic message she will carry throughout her 2016 campaign, Mrs. Clinton singled out by name three of her potential Republican rivals: Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.\n\nMrs. Clinton alluded to comments Mr. Bush made last week about Americans needing to work longer hours.\n\n\u201cLet him tell that to the nurse who stands on her feet all day or the teacher who is in that classroom or the trucker who drives all night,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t need a lecture, they need a raise.\u201d\n\nMr. Bush later clarified that he was referring to the 6.5 million Americans \u201cstuck in part-time work\u201d who haven\u2019t been able to find a full-time job. A spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMrs. Clinton called Mr. Rubio\u2019s economic plan a \u201csure budget-busting giveaway for the super wealthy\u201d and said Mr. Walker had embraced \u201cmeanspirited, misguided attacks on worker\u2019s rights\u201d in clashing with unions in Wisconsin. But Republican officials warned that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s approach will cost the taxpayer. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear: she will have to raise taxes on American families,\u201d Allison Moore, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, said of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposals. \u201cThere\u2019s no way around it.\u201d\n\nThe singling out of Republican candidates was sprinkled into a wide-ranging and at times dense policy speech that presented the goal posts of the economic agenda Mrs. Clinton would advance in her administration.\n\nThe policies, intended to \u201cdrive strong and steady income growth that lifts up families,\u201d ranged from relatively new ideas, like incentives for corporations to increase profit sharing, and populist ones, like criminalizing misconduct in the financial industry.\n\n\n\nMrs. Clinton included an extended plea to empower labor unions in collective bargaining, saying that the \u201cdecline of unions may be responsible for a third of the inequality among men.\u201d\n\nShe also called on eliminating the loophole that allows for lower taxation of carried interest (profits that a private equity adviser makes from investing in companies), reining \u201cin excessive risks on Wall Street,\u201d and giving regulators greater power to oversee big banks and the so-called \u201cshadow banking\u201d industry of hedge funds and private equity firms. \n\n\u201cI will appoint and empower regulators who understand that \u2018too big to fail\u2019 is still too big a problem,\u201d she said.\n\nThe speech was the result of months of conversations with policy advisers that long predated the official announcement of her candidacy in April. And her remarks were a work-in-progress until the minute she delivered them, according to multiple advisers who helped  craft the address.\n\nEarlier versions of the speech included criticism of only Mr. Bush and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, and did not go as far as the final draft in plans to criminalize bad players in the financial sector, according to these advisers, who could only discuss private discussions without attribution.\n\nAmong the many advisers who weighed in was Gary Gensler, the campaign\u2019s chief financial officer and a former Wall Street regulator known for his aggressive streak, who helped persuade Mrs. Clinton\u2019s to go further in her remarks on financial industry regulation.\n\n\u201cThose rules have been under assault by Republicans in Congress and those running for president,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.\n\nThe remarks are intended to appease the liberal base of the Democratic Party, as one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s opponents, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, surges in the polls with his socialist message.\n\nAt one point a protester interrupted Mrs. Clinton in the auditorium of the New School, yelling a question about whether she would reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act. President Bill Clinton signed legislation that repealed parts of Glass-Steagall in 1999, leading to the commingling of commercial and investment banking, a move widely criticized by some liberals.\n\nBut those regulations seem increasingly antiquated in a financial industry defined by the emergence of a \u201cshadow banking\u201d sector including hedge funds and high-frequency traders that have thrived in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\u201cThe problems are not limited to the big banks that get all the headlines,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cSerious risks are emerging from institutions in the so-called shadow banking system.\u201d\n\nAnother economic adviser to Mrs. Clinton, Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate in economics who has written extensively about inequality, said \u201cthe speech showed a clear understanding that our economy is not working for most Americans\u201d and that \u201cwe need to fundamentally rewrite the rules.\u201d", "byline": "AMY CHOZICK", "description": "Hillary Rodham Clinton called for tax relief for middle-class families, an increase in collective bargaining and other incentives to raise middle-class wages during an economic address at the New School in New York.", "title": "First Draft: Hillary Clinton Blames Republicans for Promoting Inequality", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/07/13/hillary-clinton-blames-republicans-for-promoting-inequality/", "topics": ["economy"], "people": ["Bill Clinton", "Gary Gensler", "Chris Christie", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Marco Rubio", "Joseph E.
