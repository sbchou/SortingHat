In addition, Obama will point to Massachusetts as an example of a state that has passed similar sick leave laws, calling on other cities and states to do the same.\nThe order set to be issued would grant employees of federal contractors at least one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked, though individual contractors could opt for more. It also takes into account absences related to stalking, sexual assault or domestic violence, the White House said.\nThe pay-for is not directly addressed by the White House in a fact sheet, which told The Associated Press that it could not estimate how many federal contractors did not currently offer paid sick leave, due to a host of state and local laws that complicate the count.\nThe policy will begin with federal contractors in 2017, as Obama leaves office.\n\n\n\n            By \nTheodoric Meyer\n\nObama's order is another in a series pushing his agenda on the workplace, following a Labor Department proposal earlier this summer to raise the threshold for overtime pay, which would expand wages for as many as 5 million people starting in 2016. He has also signed an executive order to raise the minimum wage for federal contractor employees to $10.10.\nBoston Mayor Martin Walsh and Sen. Elizabeth Warren are set to attend the same event, while Vice President Joe Biden, who is considering a presidential bid, is slated to appear with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka at a parade in Pittsburgh on Monday.\n\n                                            By \nLarry J.
