Rick Perry earlier this month \u2015 highlights the limitations of the new strain of megadonor-subsidized presidential politics. Big-money outside groups devoted to the two failed candidates combined to raise more than $43 million through the end of June. But when they began looking for ways to spend the bounty to boost their respective candidates\u2019 flagging poll numbers, their efforts were complicated by tricky election laws, quirky debate qualification rules and the unpredictable rise of Donald Trump as the GOP primary leader. When Walker and Perry bowed out, the big money groups supporting them were left with significant unspent reserves that they\u2019re expected to return to donors.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad to me, because I feel Scott Walker is eminently qualified to be president, but it\u2019s healthy because super PACs alone should not keep candidates in the race if they can\u2019t stay in by themselves,\u201d former George W. Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer. \u201cThere is something democratic about grass-roots, widespread money support. There is something anti-democratic about one person propping up a candidate who can\u2019t make it.\u201d \nFleischer helped lead a Republican National Committee forensic analysis of factors that stymied the GOP in the 2012 election. A significant conclusion was that rich donors could use super PACs to prop up weak candidates in primary elections, which it said \u201cweakens our eventual nominee.\u201d That\u2019s what happened in the 2012 GOP primary, and some party elders worry it could be worse this time around since there are more candidates who, after studying 2012, spent months assiduously courting billionaires and multimillionaires. \nThe operating assumption was that, just before the campaign officially kicked off, these affluent patrons would pour six- and seven-figure checks into super PACs and other big-money groups that would absorb many of the core functions of the campaigns during the early months. That would give candidates the time and space to do the type of traditional retail politicking necessary to gain traction with the regular voters and small- to medium-dollar donors who traditionally powered campaigns. \nThe megadonors held up their end of the bargain. The 67 biggest donors of the race \u2015 each of whom gave $1 million or more \u2015 donated more than three times as much to big-money groups as the 508,000 smallest donors combined, according to a POLITICO analysis of filings with the Federal Election Commission and Internal Revenue Service. Partly as a result, the super PACs and other big-money groups devoted to specific candidates have raised more than twice as much as those candidates\u2019 own campaigns through the end of June \u2015 $271 million vs. $126 million.\nBut those groups cannot pay for the candidates\u2019 travel, staff salaries, speechwriting or office space. And at times, they have struggled to find ways to complement their chosen candidates\u2019 strategies \u2015 a task made more difficult by legal prohibitions against candidates coordinating their spending with big-money groups, and advertising rules that give lower rates to candidates than outside groups.\nA trio of super PACs devoted to Perry with derivations of the name \u201cOpportunity and Freedom PAC\u201d through the end of June had raised nearly $17 million \u2015 most of which came from a pair of wealthy Texans. That dwarfed the $1.1 million raised by the candidate\u2019s campaign, which was so cash-strapped that it stopped paying its staff last month. The super PAC tried to fill the void, expanding its paid organizing operation on the ground in Iowa, where he and Walker were banking on strong showings in the state\u2019s pivotal February caucuses.\nWalker once led the polls in the Hawkeye State. But, as his campaign faltered under the weight of lackluster debate performances, so, too, did his Iowa polling and his campaign\u2019s fundraising, which struggled to sustain the campaign\u2019s 90-person payroll. Walker resisted suggestions from donors and others to reduce his staff or shift his operation to Iowa.\nWalker's fundraising and spending figures won\u2019t be officially released for another few weeks (the FEC deadline for filing is Oct. 15). But it\u2019s unlikely that it raised anywhere near as much as the $26 million raised by a pair of big-money groups devoted to supporting him. A pro-Walker super PAC called Unintimidated PAC, which raised the bulk of that (with $13 million coming from seven-figure donors), this month began a planned $9-million television and digital advertising campaign in Iowa. It also planned to focus on South Carolina, another early voting state with a significant population of religious conservatives \u2015 a demographic where Walker had some early appeal.\nThe original idea, according to a source familiar with Unintimidated\u2019s strategy was to use advertising to inform voters in key early states about Walker\u2019s record as a reformer in Wisconsin, beyond just his well-known efforts to rein in spending and limit union power. \u201cSo that, once the voters got beyond this beauty contest summer, and it came time for them to make a decision, they could judge the governor\u2019s complete conservative record and make an informed decision,\u201d said the source. But the source said that once Walker began struggling to get to that point, Unintimidated began planning for other possibilities.\n \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the luxury of knowing what the hard-dollar side was going to do. Had the decision been made to reduce or move staff, we were prepared to institute a ground game strategy or to shift paid media from other early states to Iowa, if that was what was required,\u201d said the source. \u201cWe had the resources and flexibility to do that. We had a loyal group of supporters who were willing to stick with it, and a low burn rate.\u201d\nThe source said Unintimidated was on track to raise $35 million to $40 million this year.\nA spokesman declined to say how much the PAC had in the bank, but said it plans to \u201cwind down our existing efforts and return remaining resources to supporters.\u201d\nIn his Monday news conference announcing his decision to drop out, Walker cited a desire to help unite the GOP behind a single front-runner. But in a staff conference call beforehand, he also cited a more practical motivation. \u201cFinances just aren\u2019t there,\u201d he said, according to a source who participated.\nYet, a GOP operative who worked with Walker\u2019s campaign suggested the Wisconsin governor could have scaled back his campaign to a bare-bones operation while counting on an expanded super PAC operation. \u201cThe super PAC could have done Fox News advertising to get his numbers up nationally, and his campaign could have cut down his staff, lived off the land and waited for the field to reshuffle,\u201d said the operative, pointing out that the top candidates in averages of national polls were invited to participate in the GOP primary debates. \u201cWalker and Perry both could have gone on, and, at least for Walker, there\u2019s a good argument that he got out too early.\u201d\nMinnesota broadcasting billionaire Stan Hubbard, who donated $50,000 to the PAC, suggested the only way it could have helped stanch Walker\u2019s polling drop would have been to air national advertising. \u201cIf they had enough money, it would have been very effective in my opinion,\u201d Hubbard said.\nBut Hubbard suggested Walker\u2019s freefall was his own doing, and could be traced largely to his flat debate performance.\n\u201cWhen push came to shove, all that mattered is how he did in the debates,\u201d said Hubbard. \u201cIn national politics today, you have to be a TV star and you have to have that certain something that turns people on. And for whatever reason, Scott didn\u2019t have that,\u201d said Hubbard, who added that he was disappointed by Walker\u2019s withdrawal, nonetheless. \u201cHe would be a good president in my opinion.\u201d\nWhile Hubbard said he\u2019s a fan of a few other GOP presidential prospects, he said he\u2019s not in a rush to donate to any of their super PACs. \u201cWe did that with Scott, lost our money. We\u2019ll see who comes through,\u201d he said, arguing that none of the other candidates\u2019 super PACs are making much impact at this stage of the race, either.\n\u201cWhat a super PAC can do, in my opinion, is it can buy a lot of great TV advertising once you have a race in a given market. But, until you get to the public going to the polls and voting, a super PAC can\u2019t do a helluva lot, except maybe raise money by doing mailings.\u201d\nKenneth P.
