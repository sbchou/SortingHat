But as weakness in China and elsewhere rattles investors, the expectation is now that the bank will wait until December or even the spring of next year.\nThe delay is likely to please liberals who\u2019ve been urging the central bank to hold off on increasing borrowing costs until more Americans get raises and jobs.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Federal Reserve to leave its main borrowing rate near zero", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/federal-reserve-to-leave-its-main-borrowing-rate-near-zero-213791", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "personality"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Lauren Gardner", "David Kendall", "Kevin Robillard", "Kate Bennett", "Hadas Gold", "Elvis Presley", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "Marc Caputo", "Tim Starks", "Ted Cruz", "Ben White", "Chris Christie", "Connie Milstein", "Jenny Hopkinson", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Theodoric Meyer", "Josh Gerstein", "Annie Karni", "Donald Trump", "James Panichi", "Brianna Ehley", "Xi Jinping", "Jeff Flake", "Nick Gass", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Toby Eckert", "Seung Min Kim", "Jeremy Herb", "Todd S.
