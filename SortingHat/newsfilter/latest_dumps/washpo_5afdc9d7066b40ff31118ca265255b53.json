{"body": " Former president Bill Clinton had a private telephone conversation in late spring with Donald Trump at the same time that the billionaire investor and reality-television star was nearing a decision to run for the White House, according to associates of both men. Four Trump allies and one Clinton associate familiar with the exchange said that Clinton encouraged Trump\u2019s efforts to play a larger role in the Republican Party and offered his own views of the political landscape. Clinton\u2019s personal office in New York confirmed that the call occurred in late May, but an aide to Clinton said the 2016 race was never specifically discussed and that it was only a casual chat.  The talk with Clinton \u2014 the spouse of the Democratic presidential front-runner and one of his party\u2019s preeminent political strategists \u2014 came just weeks before Trump jumped into the GOP race and surged to the front of the crowded Republican field.  The revelation of the call comes as many Republicans have begun criticizing Trump for his ties to Democrats, including past financial donations to the Clintons and their charitable foundation. Trump took the call from his office in Trump Tower in New York, according to the four allies, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly. The call came as Trump was making a final decision about whether to run, and he was candid about his political ambitions and his potential interest in seeking the White House during the talk, these allies said. The 42nd president listened intently and then analyzed Trump\u2019s prospects and his desire to rouse the GOP base, the Trump allies said. The tone of the call was informal and Clinton never urged Trump to run, the four people said. Rather, they said, Clinton sounded curious about Trump\u2019s moves toward a presidential bid and told Trump that he was striking a chord with frustrated conservatives and was a rising force on the right.  One person with knowledge of Clinton\u2019s end of the call said the former president was upbeat and encouraging during the conversation, which occurred at a time Trump was speaking out about GOP politics and his prescriptions for the nation.   Clinton aides declined to speak on the record about the call, saying the conversation was personal. \u201cMr. Trump reached out to President Clinton a few times. President Clinton returned his call in late May,\u201d a Clinton employee said. \u201cWhile we don\u2019t make it a practice to discuss the president\u2019s private conversations, we can tell you that the presidential race was not discussed.\u201d One Trump adviser said Clinton called Trump, but did not provide specifics about how the call came about. Those with knowledge of the call in both camps said it was one of many that Clinton and Trump have had over the years, whether about golf or donations to the Clinton Foundation. But the call in May was considered especially sensitive, coming soon after Hillary Rodham Clinton had declared her own presidential run the month before.  At the time, Trump was touting a \u201cfoolproof\u201d but undisclosed plan to defeat Islamic State terrorists and ramping up his presence on the airwaves, including interviews where he was asked about his donations to the Clinton Foundation. He entered the race June 16.   Neither side would provide an exact date for the call, but both Bill Clinton\u2019s office and a person close to Trump described it as \u201clate May.\u201d  Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, declined to comment. The campaign of Hillary Clinton did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump is a longtime acquaintance of the Clintons, both of whom attended the businessman\u2019s third wedding in 2005. Since Trump entered the presidential race, however, he and Hillary Clinton have increasingly traded barbs. She has condemned Trump\u2019s racially charged remarks about Mexican immigrants and tut-tutted about his remark that Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is not a war hero. \u201cDonald Trump. Finally, a candidate whose hair gets more attention than mine,\u201d Clinton joked at a Democratic dinner in Arkansas in July. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing funny about the hate he is spewing at immigrants and families, and now the insults he has directed at a genuine war hero, Sen. John McCain.\u201d That was a rare instance in which Clinton mentioned Trump by name. Also in July, before a largely Hispanic audience, Clinton had this to say: \u201cI have just one word for Mr. Trump. Basta!\u201d In June, she criticized Trump, without using his name, over his references to Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals during his June campaign launch speech. \u201cA recent entry into the Republican presidential campaign said some very inflammatory things about Mexicans. Everybody should stand up and say that\u2019s not acceptable,\u201d Clinton said in an interview with Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston. Clinton demurred when asked to specify to whom she was referring. Instead, she has frequently sought to tie Trump\u2019s views to the broader GOP field. \u201cI think he is emblematic,\u201d she said. \u201cI want people to understand it\u2019s not about him \u2014 it\u2019s about everybody.\u201d Clinton has reserved her sharpest attacks for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and other candidates she has called out by name for their policies on immigration, abortion and other issues. For his part, Trump said little about Clinton until recent weeks. \u201cWow, it\u2019s pretty pathetic that Hillary Clinton just blamed me for the horrendous attack that took place in South Carolina,\u201d Trump wrote in a post on Instagram, following that interview. \u201cThis is why politicians are just no good. Our country\u2019s in trouble.\u201d And on Wednesday, Trump wrote in a Twitter message: \u201cDo you notice that Hillary spews out Jeb\u2019s name as often as possible in order to give him status? She knows Trump is her worst nightmare.\u201d That\u2019s a long way from the cordial, even cozy, relationship between the two when Clinton was a New York senator and Trump was a constituent and supporter. At Trump\u2019s 2005 wedding, Hillary Clinton sat in the front row for the ceremony, and Bill Clinton reportedly joined her for festivities later. The Clintons were photographed laughing chummily with Trump and new wife Melania Knauss at the reception, with Bill Clinton clasping Trump\u2019s shoulder. Trump also donated to Hillary Clinton\u2019s New York Senate campaigns and to the Clinton Foundation.  Tom Hamburger, Alice Crites and Karen Tumulty contributed to this report.
