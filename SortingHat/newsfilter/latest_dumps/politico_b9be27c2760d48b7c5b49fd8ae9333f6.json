Jeff Miller will enter the race to replace GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, joining what promises to be a crowded primary field.\u00a0 Rep. Ron DeSantis entered the contest first and has sought out the right flank. Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez Cantera is planning to enter the race on July 15. http://roll.cl/1RxxSMv\n\u2014 Meanwhile, a Jacksonville TV affiliate is questioning Lopez-Cantera\u2019s work schedule, arguing that he\u2019s working fewer than half the days a full-time employee would. http://bit.ly/1BOk1jo\nRAINBOW SUPPORTERS \u2014 \u201cClinton\u2019s gay supporters: What enthusiasm gap?\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Annie Karni: \u201cHillary Clinton won\u2019t be marching in New York City\u2019s Pride Parade Sunday in Manhattan, and has no plans to march in any pride parades across the country, but her absence hasn\u2019t diminished the community\u2019s enthusiasm for her. Indeed, many gay leaders are so on board for her campaign that they prefer that she spend time building support elsewhere than marching alongside them.\u201d http://politi.co/1Nem4Oc\nCAMPAIGN TREASURER SUED BY BOSS \u2014 Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) filed a criminal complaint against Jack Wu, his campaign treasurer, for allegedly embezzling $170,000 in campaign funds, the Voice of the OC reported: \u201cRohrabacher and his campaign committee filed criminal complaints with county and state prosecutors Wednesday against Wu, who served as treasurer until accounting discrepancies were discovered last month, according to Charles Bell, a Sacramento-based attorney who represents the congressman and his campaign committee. \u201cI am disappointed and dismayed by this betrayal of trust,\u201d Rohrabacher said in a news release sent out [Wednesday] afternoon.\u201d http://bit.ly/1Cu0uj3\n\r\nDays until the 2015 election: 131.

Of the nearly $2.7 million Bevin, a businessman, brought in for the primary, less than $150,000 was raised from outside contributors, the report shows. As of June 18, Bevin\u2019s account was $111,000 in debt. Bevin will be forced to self-fund in the general election \u2014 or build a heretofore nonexistent fundraising operation \u2014 in order to stay afloat in what is expected to be a neck-and-neck race against Democratic state Attorney General Jack Conway.\u201d\n\u2014 The man Bevin says he supported in the 2004 presidential race, Constitution Party nominee Mike Perutka, is classified by watchdog groups as an \u201cactive white supremacist,\u201d the Lexington Herald Leader reports. http://bit.ly/1HfLigL\n\u2014 Also in Kentucky: One day after Kentucky GOP gubernatorial candidate Matt Bevin said a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis should be removed from the Kentucky state Capitol building, Democrat Jack Conway joined Bevin in calling for the statue\u2019s removal.\u201d\nFICTION BREAK \u2014 Former Sen. Jim Webb (D-Va.), a potential presidential candidate, contributed a short story, \u201cTo Kill A Man,\u201d to POLITICO Magazine\u2019s \u201cWar Issue.\u201d Read it here: http://politi.co/1SM1kko\nNAT SEC MONEY \u2014 John Bolton, former U.N. ambassador and fundraiser, endorsed eight more Republicans in their reelection bids, including Sens. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Pat Toomey (R-Penn.), and Reps. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.), Will Hurd (R-Texas), Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), the Washington Examiner reported. He said he will spend $40,000 on the candidates. http://washex.am/1NgSMz1\n\u2014 \u201cPartisan vets groups, backed by big donors, prepare for battle in 2016,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Austin Wright: \u201cWhen VoteVets, the group that helps elect Democratic veterans to Congress, squares off against Concerned Veterans for America, which runs attack ads against vulnerable Democrats, they will be backed by some of the nation\u2019s brand names among billionaire political activists: Tom Steyer and the Koch brothers. The effectiveness of the two groups, which are increasingly important to their respective parties in promoting national-security strategy, is a testament to the ability of military issues to sway public opinion \u2014 and the willingness of mega-donors on both sides to pour money into causes that tap into that power. But the fact that billionaires can so successfully harness the credibility of those who\u2019ve fought in wars doesn\u2019t sit well with some veterans advocates.\u201d http://politi.co/1J7sZrq\nAFTER CHARLESTON \u2014 WALKER EXPANDS GUN RIGHTS IN WISCONSIN \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Daniel Strauss reported: \u201cScott Walker expanded gun rights in Wisconsin on Wednesday by signing into law two bills that, respectively, get rid of the state\u2019s 48-hour waiting period and let retired or off-duty law enforcement officials carry concealed firearms into public schools. Walker\u2019s move was long in the making \u2014 Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke announced on June 11 that the Wisconsin governor would sign the 48-hour waiting period bill into law. But it also comes a week after a gunman killed nine people at an historic African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina, setting off a national debate over race and gun control.\u201d\n\u2014 \u201cToomey says gun control measures worth another try,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Nick Gass: \u201cPennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey is not holding his breath when it comes to new gun control measures, but he said it\u2019s worth another try, following last week\u2019s mass shooting in South Carolina. \u2018Honestly, I don\u2019t want to build up any false expectations. I\u2019m not aware that we\u2019ve got the votes to do what Senator Manchin and I attempted,\u2019 the Republican said on MSNBC\u2019s \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 on Wednesday when asked if the prospects for passing new legislation are better than they were in early 2013, after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. \u2018Is it possible that some portion of that, some subset of what we were focused on is possible ... honestly, probably not likely.\u2019 http://politi.co/1dfVWWO\nPRESIDENTIAL SPEED READ \u2014 JINDAL ENTERS THE RING \u2014 \u201cLouisiana longshot,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Katie Glueck and Eli Stokols in New Orleans: \u201cBobby Jindal is used to being the smartest guy in the room. A less familiar feeling: being written off as an afterthought before his next campaign even begins. But that\u2019s the reality now for Jindal, who was once considered one of his party\u2019s most promising and upwardly mobile officeholders. \u2026 Jindal is widely viewed as the longest of long shots, a candidate with a glittering resume but almost no chance of winning the GOP nomination in 2016. ... Jindal now enters a far more competitive and crowded presidential field, not as a wunderkind but as an asterisk who barely registers in national polls. He is running as a reform-minded, social conservative armed with detailed policy proposals \u2014 and betting that his wonky approach will enable him to break through \u2014 but many question whether it\u2019s too late to gain a foothold in the 2016 race.\u201d http://politi.co/1LEsFku\n\u2014 Jindal attacked former Florida Jeb Bush in his announcement speech, POLITICO\u2019s Eli Stokols reported from Kenner, La. http://politi.co/1KeyqIj\n\u2014 Jindal\u2019s power map, by Katie Glueck: Curt Anderson, strategist; Timmy Teepell, campaign manager; Wes Anderson, lead pollster; Gail Gitcho, senior adviser. http://politi.co/1fEHUzQ\n\u2014 Right to Rise, the pro-Bush super PAC, is out with a web ad targeting Iowa and New Hampshire, NH1 reports. http://bit.ly/1FCLgZ1\nCODA-QUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cPolitical battles are one thing. Trying to ruin someone is quite another. This is unprecedented. Where does it all end?\u201d \u2014 Maine state Sen. Roger Katz (R), after a charter school in the state rescinded a job offer to Democratic state House Speaker Mark Eves. GOP Gov. Paul LePage had allegedly threatened to withhold state funds from the school if it hired Eves as its president. http://bit.ly/1BBRJYW\nBy DAN EPHRON \nBy MARK PERRY\nBy HELEN BENEDICT\nBy POLITICO MAGAZINE\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Report: Miller will enter Florida Senate race.", "title": "Frank Guinta hangs tough \u2014 Report: Miller will enter Florida Senate race", "url": "http://www.politico.com/morningscore/0615/morningscore18886.html", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Carlos Lopez Cantera", "Kelly Ayotte", "Emily Cahn", "Hillary Clinton", "Elena Schneider", "Tom Steyer", "Frank Guinta", "Austin Wright", "Will Hurd", "Mark Eves", "Steven Shepard", "Eli Stokols", "Theodoric Meyer", "Richard Burr", "Annie Karni", "Gail Gitcho", "Bobby Jindal", "Pat Toomey", "Dana Rohrabacher", "Katie Glueck", "Nick Gass", "Jack Conway", "Florida Jeb Bush", "David Clarke", "Marco Rubio", "Jim Webb", "Jeff Miller", "Janet Cowell", "Barbara Comstock", "Curt Anderson", "Timmy Teepell", "Rob Portman", "Daniel Strauss", "John Bolton", "Ron Johnson", "Steve Shepard", "Scott Walker", "Lee Zeldin", "Wes Anderson", "Jefferson Davis", "Matt Bevin", "Joe Manchin"], "orgs": ["Veterans for America", "Congress", "Senate", "Campaign Pro", "Reps", "Florida Senate", "GOP", "U.S. Senate", "Washington Examiner", "Milwaukee County", "MSNBC", "U.N."], "authors": [{"author_id": 30901, "fullname": "elena schneider", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-06-25 15:02:53", "org": "politico", "article_id": "b9be27c2760d48b7c5b49fd8ae9333f6", "date_access": "2015-06-25 15:30:18.518581"}
