(Getty)\n\n            By \nHadas Gold\n\n10/12/15 08:26 AM EDT\nBuzzFeed will begin creating native video ads for politicians and political causes, the website will announce Monday.\nRena Shapiro, most recently of advertising director for Pandora, has been named Vice President, Politics & Advocacy for BuzzFeed.\nShapiro will oversee native political ads, created in conjunction with BuzzFeed's product and branded video teams from BuzzFeed Motion Pictures.\n\"BuzzFeed is the top place millennials and influentials are reading and sharing news, and with the smart and thoughtful reporting from BuzzFeed Politics, there is a huge demand for political and advocacy groups to tap into that audience. From our shareable videos to our social posts, there's a massive opportunity and I can't wait to get started,\" Shapiro said in a statement.\nBuzzFeed stressed that native political ads will be clearly marked as such, to distinguish it from content created by the editorial team for the site.\nIt's not the first time BuzzFeed has ventured into native ads for politicians. In 2012, the site hosted several native advertisements for candidates, which consisted of BuzzFeed style articles. This will take things a step further and more akin to BuzzFeed's successful Friskies cat food native ads. \nBuzzFeed maintains they keep a strict firewall between their traditional news reporting sides and the rest of BuzzFeed, including BuzzFeed Motion Pictures, and that native political ads will be clearly marked as such. \nHadas Gold is a reporter at\u00a0Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "This is not the first time BuzzFeed has ventured into native ads for politicians.", "title": "BuzzFeed launches native video political advertising", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2015/10/buzzfeed-launches-native-video-political-advertising-214658", "topics": ["economy", "immigration"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Mary Jo White", "Ron Paul", "Joe Pompeo", "Rachael Bade", "Hillary Clinton", "Jason Rezaian", "Spiro Agnew", "Hadas Gold", "Angela Merkel", "Henry Kissinger", "Richard Nixon", "Patrick Temple", "Kimberly Hefling", "John Boehner", "Josh Gerstein", "Katie Glueck", "Nick Gass", "Jack Shafer", "Trey Gowdy", "Isaac Dovere", "David Rogers", "Andrew Glass", "Donald Trump", "Nicholas Vinocur", "Eliza Collins", "Paul Ryan", "Richard M.
