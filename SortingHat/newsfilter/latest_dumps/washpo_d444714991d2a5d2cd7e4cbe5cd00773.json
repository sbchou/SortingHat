{"body": "   Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump greets a supporter after a rally in Manchester, N.H., on June 17, 2015. (Dominick Reuter/Reuters)  Since we launched our Loop contest last week to re-brand Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, lots has happened in Trump world. [Loop Contest: Help Donald Trump pick an original campaign slogan] Defying all the naysaying that he\u2019d never really officially run, Trump filed his paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Monday. Then, on Tuesday, a legitimate independent poll placed him second among GOP voters in New Hampshire. (The same poll found him with the highest unfavorability rating, but, SECOND!) So Trump is not only a real-life candidate for the office of leader of the free world but also a potentially serious contender. And it\u2019s not just because he\u2019ll force the other candidates into corners and make them respond to his more outrageous statements. But because outside Washington, it may stunningly be that some Americans don\u2019t view his run as a joke. Just over 25 miles from the Pennsylvania Avenue address he\u2019d like to call home, Trump was on hand Tuesday morning for the unveiling of a new course at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling. A red baseball cap with his name emblazoned on it covered his famous locks. He walked through the ornate club \u2014 which is decorated with framed magazine covers that feature him \u2014 for his news conference (on a stage atop a man-made waterfall) to anoint the course. We asked him about his reputation as a bully. \u201cI\u2019m being very nice now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be presidential. I have to be very different.\u201d He said it deadpan, but it\u2019s possible he meant it tongue-in-cheek. Now, being presidential for Trump means calling people out when he thinks they deserve it, especially if he deems they are being dishonest. (This will be the theme of a speech he\u2019s giving tonight in Baltimore for the Maryland Republican Party\u2019s annual Lincoln dinner.) He told us a story about singer Neil Young, an avowed liberal, who, after Trump\u2019s announcement rally, asked that Trump not use his song \u201cRockin\u2019 in the Free World\u201d again at campaign events. A week ago, Trump claimed, Young visited his office in the Trump Tower asking for money for a new project. \u201cHe came up to my office, he was in my office. There\u2019s this tremendous dishonesty,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe difference between me and someone else is that I\u2019ll tell that story. And I don\u2019t think Neil Young would deny it.\u201d (We left a message for Young\u2019s manager, Elliot Roberts of Lookout Management, for comment.) So Trump is serious. Very serious. And Loop fans seem to have known that all along. Entries for our contest to find a new catchphrase for Trump have been, much to our initial surprise, overwhelmingly positive. Now, Trump is pretty wedded to his current slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again!\u201d He used it in\u00a0 conversation: \u201cIf they want to make the country great again, that\u2019s my message,\u201d he told us. But we still feel strongly that he is deserving of a theme never used before \u2013 remember, this was first a Ronald Reagan mantra. And there\u2019s still plenty of time to enter. Until midnight Wednesday, June 24, you can send suggestions for Trump\u2019s new slogan to intheloop@washingtonpost.com. Subject line: Trump for President. A panel of judges will pick the top 10 suggestions. Winners will get a Loop T-shirt, a mention in the column and eternal bragging rights.
