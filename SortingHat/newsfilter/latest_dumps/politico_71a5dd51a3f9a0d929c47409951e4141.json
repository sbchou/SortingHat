Nancy reports that Walter Isaacson, CEO of the Aspen Institute and famed biographer of Steve Jobs, was approached by people close to the White House about filling the post. Current Librarian James Billington is retiring at the end of the year after 28 years on the job. Isaacson, maybe the highest-profile name rumored for the spot, decided not to go forward with it, Nancy writes. \nThe White House has faced pressure from tech groups and others to pick someone who can fix the Library\u2019s reputation as an arcane, tech-averse institution and, among other things, prepare it to deal with copyright policy in the digital age.\n\u201cAccording to a source familiar with the process, the White House is hunting for someone to fill the position that meets a varied set of criteria: The person should be something of a public intellectual with a scholarly bent, know how to manage a sprawling institution, and have an understanding of the complexities of both copyright policy and public access to information in the digital age,\u201d Nancy writes.

That\u2019s what Rep. Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the House Energy & Commerce Committee, wants to know, and he\u2019s asking for a hearing to discuss it. The legal landscape surrounding fantasy sports is \u201cmurky,\u201d making it \u201cripe for congressional review,\u201d Pallone said Monday in a letter (http://1.usa.gov/1Qdb3OG) to committee leadership. \nHe\u2019s pointing to three separate laws, including the Interstate Wire Act, that ban interstate gambling and sports betting online, but also run up against a carve-out for fantasy sports in the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act. Another area of concern, he said, is how cozy professional sports leagues are getting with fantasy sports networks. He\u2019s also questioning whether pro athletes and league personnel, \u201cwho may be able to affect the outcome of a game,\u201d should be able to take part. Don\u2019t bet on swift action that threatens fantasy sports, but we\u2019re tracking to see if a hearing reaches the books.\nHOW ABOUT FANTASY POLITICS? \u2014 For a short while, it looked like there might be another ostentatious billionaire \u2014 and another tech figure \u2014 in the 2016 circus. Alas, Mark Cuban told CNBC that he\u2019s \u201cnot at all\u201d considering a run for the White House (http://bit.ly/1M7ATTb), despite saying earlier that he\u2019d easily beat Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton (http://for.tn/1M7BhRE). Cuban did tell POLITICO\u2019s Ben Schreckinger he\u2019d be open to serving in a Trump administration \u201cif he promises to do exactly what I tell him to do\u201d (http://politi.co/1M7CQix) \u2014 so it\u2019s safe to bet that won\u2019t happen. But with Republican Carly Fiorina, Democrat Larry Lessig and \u201cCyber Party\u201d candidate John McAfee, there are plenty of long-shot techies to keep track of, and only (ugh) 419 days until Election Day.\nFCC TO COURT: NET NEUTRALITY RULES ARE \u2018NECESSARY SOLUTIONS\u2019 \u2014 The FCC dropped a 218-page filing with the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on Monday night arguing the agency \u201chas the authority to ensure that the Internet, the central means of communication in the 21st century, remains open to all Americans.\u201d Dropping the names of Google, Amazon, Apple and Netflix, the commission told the court it should reject a legal challenge to the controversial rules lodged earlier this year by several large telecommunications trade groups and some of their members.\n\u201cIt is the Order \u2014 not USTelecom\u2019s rhetoric \u2014 that is before this Court,\u201d the FCC argues in the brief. \u201cThe Order concludes that the Internet \u2018must remain open: open for commerce, innovation and speech; open for consumers and for the innovation created by applications developers and content companies; and open for expansion and investment by America\u2019s broadband providers.\u201d\u2019\nThe commission argues its net neutrality rules are \u201cfocusing on the threats to Internet openness\u201d but \u201cusing a light-touch version of Title II.\u201d The filing: http://bit.ly/1EZ2TZM \nTODAY: PAI ROAD TRIP TO FARGO \u2014 Republican FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai will make an appearance in the Upper Midwest today, joining Rep. Kevin Cramer for a series of meetings and speeches in Fargo, N.D.. It\u2019s Pai\u2019s second appearance with a Republican lawmaker in two days (he spent Monday with Sen. Steve Daines in Montana). Pai is scheduled to speak at the Fargo Connect luncheon. Among the issues likely to come up: plans to reform the Universal Service Fund, which Cramer has raised in FCC hearings at the House Energy & Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications. \nHOUSE JUDICIARY EYEING THURSDAY MARKUP \u2014 The House Judiciary Committee is planning to mark up the Judicial Redress Act on Thursday, sources tell Kate, who had the scoop late Monday afternoon. The tech industry has supported the bill, which would extend some privacy protections to citizens of U.S. allies. The bill -- or something like it -- is critical to closing a deal reached by U.S. and EU officials last week on data protection. The committee hasn\u2019t announced details yet, but we\u2019re tracking. For pros: http://politico.pro/1NsGO6U \nIA\u2019S BAY STATE WARNING \u2014 The Internet Association is taking issue with proposals in the Massachusetts Legislature that it says would place burdensome regulations on ride-hailing services (and IA members) Uber, Lyft and Sidecar. The trade group is urging lawmakers on the Massachusetts Joint Committee on Financial Services to reject measures backed by the taxi industry that would require fingerprint background checks on drivers and outlaw surge pricing. Uber has threatened to stop operating in the state if those measures are approved. \nUber is backing a bill by Gov. Charlie Baker that would require background checks, insurance for riders and drivers, and assign the state\u2019s Department of Public Utilities as a regulator. IA President Michael Beckerman writes that any measures beyond that would \u201crequire duplicative and expensive procedures that add bureaucracy at the expense of innovation.\u201d The letter: http://bit.ly/1M7GF7i \nSURVEY: VENTURE CAPITALISTS TRACKING IMMIGRATION, IoT \u2014 Venture capitalists reported low confidence in the federal government\u2019s ability to enact policies that support their work in the next year, according to a report out this morning by Deloitte and the National Venture Capital Association. Immigration is their top policy concern, with over 60 percent of those surveyed saying they want to see reforms \u2014 a cause the tech industry has championed because of its need for visas for high-skilled workers. Another key finding: Cloud computing still holds its place as the strongest sector for tech investment, with mobile technologies finishing in a close second.
