(http://www.politicopro.com/proinfo)\nStory Continued Below\nFIRST IN SCORE \u2014 SECOND RGA AD IN KENTUCKY HITS CONWAY ON HEALTH CARE, OBAMA: The Republican Governors Association is out with its second ad of the Kentucky governors' race and it has a similar theme: Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway is an \"Obama liberal\" who puts \"Kentucky last.\" But there's a notable twist: The ad attacks Conway over his support for Obamacare, even when Kentucky's state health exchange, Kynect, has proven popular and Kentucky has seen one of the largest drops in the percentage of uninsured since Obamacare's implementation. Conway's opponent, GOP businessman Matt Bevin, has said he would dismantle Kynect and put state residents on the federal exchange. The spot blames Obamacare for hospitals \"cutting services\" and \"laying off staff.\" https://youtu.be/qDNXFiFzyJU\nTODAY ON CAMPAIGN PRO \u2014 \u201cClinton hones the climate change wedge,\u201d by POLITICO Pro Energy\u2019s Darren Goode: http://politico.pro/1IozMtO\n\u2014 But there are holes in Clinton\u2019s climate plan, while Sanders and O\u2019Malley hope to outflank her with more ambitious plans, Pro Energy\u2019s Elana Schor reported: \u201cDoes Clinton support or oppose the Keystone XL oil pipeline? Or Arctic offshore drilling? Or tougher restrictions on fracking? Or the oil industry\u2019s push to lift the 1970s ban on exporting U.S. crude oil? Clinton avoided all those questions in the solar-heavy climate plan she outlined Sunday night, and in her speech promoting it Monday in Iowa \u2014 and she declined yet again Monday to say where she stands on Keystone.\u201d http://politi.co/1fB6Rf1\nDays until the 2015 election: 98.

David Vitter had $5 million in his gubernatorial campaign account as of mid-July, an amount the New Orleans Times-Picayune noted was more than the other three leading candidates combined. Monday was the filing deadline for gubernatorial candidates for a period stretching from April 17 to July 16. GOP Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne pulled in just under $400,000 and has $1.8 million on hand. Democratic state Rep. John Bel Edwards collected $237,000, giving him $1 million on hand. And Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle also $1 million on hand after pulling in the $432,000 and taking out loans worth $375,000 \u2014 his campaign has spent early on television advertising, helping him rise in the polls. All three are also backed by PACs, none of whom have more than $200,000 on hand. A super PAC supporting Vitter has $4.4 million on hand. http://bit.ly/1HWPAa2\nAD WAR \u2014 The League of Conservation Voters, as part of a larger campaign aiming to boost the EPA's clean power plan rule, is airing ads accusing Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.) \u2014 both up for reelection in 2016 \u2014 of \"put[ting] polluters\u2019 profits ahead of your family\u2019s health\" and encouraging voters to call Burr and Johnson's offices. But the buy only includes satellite television, not cable or broadcast. Satellite buys allow campaigns and outside groups to target specific viewers and air ads whenever that person is watching, not just during a specific show or block of time. The group is spending about $100,000 on the ads in both North Carolina and Wisconsin.\nHere's the set of ads targeting Johnson: http://bit.ly/1IoCC1S\nAnd the pair targeting Burr: http://bit.ly/1SKGJv2\nAD WAR, PART II \u2014 Americans for Prosperity is up with an ad this week on Facebook and YouTube, a rollicking spot feature a bobbleheaded Jack Conway in a car headed to Fancy Farm. But the car keeps getting sidetracked and diverting back toward Washington and in the direction of cap-and-trade energy policies, Obamacare and spending. It\u2019s a prelude to what\u2019s likely to be a sharp-elbowed affair at the annual political gathering and a hail of negative advertising in 2015\u2019s marquee statewide race. https://youtu.be/pDZeVQDefXk\n\nAD WAR, PART III \u2014 The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is celebrating Medicare's 50th anniversary on Thursday by hitting incumbent Republicans who have \"sought to undermine and dismantle Medicare,\" including paid ads on Twitter and Facebook. The week-long campaign ... targeted at New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey and Ohio Sen. Rob Portman. On Tuesday, the DSCC slammed Toomey for voting to turn Medicare into a voucher program.\nIN PLAY? \u2014 \u201cAfter Garrett\u2019s comments on gay Republicans, Dems look to cash in,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Anna Palmer and Jake Sherman: \u201cRep. Scott Garrett\u2019s private complaint that D.C. Republicans should not support gay candidates is about to bring a pile of cash for his Democratic opponent. Veteran Democratic lobbyist Steve Elmendorf and top political operative Patti Solis Doyle are co-hosting a Washington fundraiser Wednesday for Josh Gottheimer, Garrett\u2019s Democratic opponent. The event, which will be held at Elmendorf Ryan\u2019s offices, has suggested contribution levels of $1,000, $500 and $250 for attendees, according to a copy of the invitation obtained by POLITICO.\u201d http://politi.co/1D8y9nS\nPRESIDENTIAL SPEED READ \u2014 IF YOU\u2019RE NOT FIRST, YOU\u2019RE 10TH \u2014 \u201cThe GOP\u2019s battle for 10th place,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Katie Glueck: \u201cRick Perry called Donald Trump a \u201ccancer.\u201d Rick Santorum racked up five national TV hits in a single day. And Lindsey Graham filmed himself lighting his cellphone on fire. Welcome to the race for 10th place. The 11th-hour scramble for attention among the longer-shot candidates comes ahead of a major early test in the Republican presidential primary: qualifying for the first debate, slated for Aug. 6 in Cleveland. ... Christie and Perry are in for now, but only barely. Those still with a chance to make the stage are John Kasich, Rick Santorum and Bobby Jindal. For the other candidates \u2014 Carly Fiorina, George Pataki, Lindsey Graham, and Jim Gilmore \u2014 it would be very difficult to get to Cleveland.\u201d http://politi.co/1IpWLZZ\n\u2014 \u201cWhat Trump bump?\u201d by Campaign Pro\u2019s Steve Shepard: \u201cJudging from a spate of recent polls, Donald Trump is riding a wave of popular support. But if you ask Republican campaign pollsters and other political consultants, it\u2019s just a mirage, nothing more than a reflection of faulty public polling about how actual Republican primary voters feel about Trump and the other candidates. ... The problem, Republican political professionals say, is that Trump\u2019s rise to the top has been driven by intense media coverage of his often circus-like campaign. That media attention, some Republicans gripe, causes his poll numbers to rise \u2014 which, in turn, leads to more media attention. But polling methodology, these critics argue, is also skewing the numbers.\u201d http://politi.co/1KvfIg4\nMONEY, PLEASE? \u2014 \u201cBush, Cruz, Rubio and Walker to court Koch donors,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Kenneth P. Vogel: \u201cFour leading GOP presidential candidates \u2014 Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker \u2014 are traveling to a Southern California luxury hotel in coming days to make their cases directly to the Koch brothers and hundreds of other wealthy conservatives planning to spend close to $1 billion in the runup to the 2016 election. The gathering \u2014 hosted by Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the umbrella group in the Kochs\u2019 increasingly influential network of political and public policy outfits \u2014 represents a major opportunity for the candidates at a pivotal moment in the presidential primary.\u201d http://politi.co/1eu3DsV\n\u2014 Speaking of money, Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s backers started a third super PAC, called PurplePAC, run by Cato Institute co-founder and president emeritus Ed Crane, which will focus on digital media. It raised roughly $1.2 million from four donations last month, POLITICO\u2019s Daniel Strauss reported.\u00a0\nPOINTING FINGERS \u2014 \u201cClinton campaign redirects email blowback at GOP,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Rachael Bade: \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s campaign is seizing on the backlash to a faulty New York Times report regarding her email practices at the State Department by trying to link the controversy to a familiar culprit: overzealous Republicans. And the campaign\u2019s prime target, unsurprisingly, is Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican who heads the House Select Committee on Benghazi. ... The move by the Clinton camp to turn the tide of bad press back on her Republican adversaries \u2014 despite citing no specific knowledge of the Times\u2019 sourcing \u2014 came after a brutal end of last week for the campaign. ... But last weekend was perhaps the first time the campaign led the charge against reports that cast her in a negative light.\u201d http://politi.co/1Jqi7qP\nCODA \u2014 QUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cI will not apologize and I will not recant.\u201d \u2014 Mike Huckabee, pressed about his comments over the weekend that President Barack Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran \u201cwill take the Israelis and march them to the door of the oven.\u201d http://politi.co/1MsFMI6\nBy BEN WOFFORD\nBy BRUCE BARTLETT\nBy JACK SHAFER\nBy THOMAS GEOGHEGAN\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Vitter is winning Louisiana cash race.", "title": "RGA back up on airwaves in Kentucky \u2014 Vitter winning Louisiana cash race", "url": "http://www.politico.com/morningscore/0715/morningscore19333.html", "topics": ["trade"], "people": ["Kelly Ayotte", "Mark Kirk", "Kenneth P.
