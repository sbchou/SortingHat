SCOTT WALKER moved quickly to continue the fight. The decision was \u201ca grave mistake,\u201d he said in a statement, and the \u201conly alternative left for the American people\u201d is a constitutional amendment reaffirming the states\u2019 ability to define marriage.\nStory Continued Below\nThe resolute, unflinching language left no doubt about where Walker stands on an issue of great consequence to social conservatives.\nBut there\u2019s one problem: His demeanor wasn\u2019t quite so unyielding back in October 2014, during his close reelection campaign, when the high court refused to hear a set of same-sex marriage cases effectively allowing homosexual couples to marry in Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia, and Walker\u2019s home state of Wisconsin. At the time, Walker sounded a far more resigned note. Asked if there should be a U.S. constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, Walker told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, \u201cI think it\u2019s resolved.\u201d\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s over in Wisconsin,\u201d he said. \u201cOthers will have to talk about the federal level.\u201d\nGood Friday afternoon, and welcome to The 2016 BLAST. Your guide for the campaign is Jonathan Topaz (@JonathanTopaz). Send tips, ideas and gripes to jtopaz@politico.com.\nToday marked the second straight day the Supreme Court dominated the news cycle, as it ruled in favor of a national right to same-sex marriage. It\u2019s likely a political boost for HILLARY CLINTON, but a potentially thorny issue for Republicans. In other 2016 news, MARTIN O\u2019MALLEY outlined his foreign policy vision with a speech in D.C. and the Republican Party establishment struggled to deal with the sudden and unwelcome rise of DONALD TRUMP.\nTRAIL MIX: A look at what's popping on the campaign trail\nSTORY OF THE DAY: SAME-SEX MARRIAGE\nAnother day, another meaningful Supreme Court victory for progressives. Justice Anthony Kennedy sided with the liberal wing to deliver a 5-4 decision that same-sex marriage is a constitutional right. The ruling was immediately hailed by Democrats but there were unmistakable Republican divisions: the more muted statements came from JEB BUSH and MARCO RUBIO and the more fiery ones vowing to fight came from social conservatives like SCOTT WALKER and MIKE HUCKABEE.\nTHE SPECTRUM OF 2016 REACTION \n\u00a0SCOTT WALKER: \u201cI believe this Supreme Court decision is a grave mistake. Five unelected judges have taken it upon themselves to redefine the institution of marriage \u2026 As a result of this decision, the only alternative left for the American people is to support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to reaffirm the ability of the states to continue to define marriage.\u201d\nMIKE HUCKABEE: \u201cI will not acquiesce to an imperial court any more than our Founders acquiesced to an imperial British monarch. We must resist and reject judicial tyranny, not retreat.\u201d\nRICK SANTORUM: \u201cToday, five unelected justices decided to redefine the foundational unit that binds together our society without public debate or input \u2026 Marriage, the family and our children are too central to a healthy society to not fight for what is best.\u201d\nCARLY FIORINA: \u201cThis is only the latest example of an activist Court ignoring its constitutional duty to say what the law is and not what the law should be \u2026 The Court did not and could not end this debate today.\u201d\nRICK PERRY: \u201cI fundamentally disagree with the court rewriting the law and assaulting the 10th Amendment. Our founding fathers did not intend for the judicial branch to legislate from the bench.\u201d\nBOBBY JINDAL: \u201cMarriage between a man and a woman was established by God, and no earthly court can alter that. This decision will pave the way for an all out assault against the religious freedom rights of Christians who disagree with this decision.\u201d\nJEB BUSH: \u201cGuided by my faith, I believe in traditional marriage.\u00a0 I believe the Supreme Court should have allowed the states to make this decision.\u00a0 I also believe that we should love our neighbor and respect others, including those making lifetime commitments.\u00a0 In a country as diverse as ours, good people who have opposing views should be able to live side by side.\u00a0 It is now crucial that as a country we protect religious freedom and the right of conscience and also not discriminate.\u201d\nMARCO RUBIO: \u201cWhile I disagree with this decision, we live in a republic and must abide by the law. As we look ahead, the priority of the next president to nominate\nLINDSEY GRAHAM: \u201cThe Supreme Court has ruled that state bans on gay marriage are unconstitutional, and I will respect the court\u2019s decision. Furthermore, given the quickly changing tide of public opinion on this issue, I do not believe that an attempt to amend the U.S. Constitution could possibly gain the support of three-fourths of the states or a supermajority in the U.S. Congress.\u201d\nBEN CARSON: \u201cWhile I strongly disagree with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, their ruling is now the law of the land.\u201d\nFOR MORE: 2016 Roundup from POLITICO\u2019s Nick Gass and Jonathan Topaz: politi.co/1HkRmmi\nTHE DAILY CLINTON \nHILLARY CLINTON today sat in the front row at the funeral service for Rev. Clementa Pinckney \u2014 the South Carolina senator killed in last week\u2019s shooting at his church. President Barack Obama spoke at the funeral and Vice President JOE BIDEN also attended. MARTIN O\u2019MALLEY visited the Palmetto State earlier this week to pay his respects.\nA BOON FOR HILLARY: POLITICO\u2019s Annie Karni reports on how today\u2019s Supreme Court ruling helps HILLARY CLINTON: \u201cIt gives her a chance to stress the importance of nominating liberal Supreme Court justices, and creates a moment of enthusiasm in the LGBT community that her campaign needs to ride. It places her squarely in the mainstream of public opinion. And it puts her stance in sharp relief against the Republicans fulminating, to various degrees, at the majority\u2019s break with tradition.\u201d politi.co/1Hl1Y4K\nIOWA BLITZ: Des Moines Register: \u201cHILLARY CLINTON\u2019s campaign is having prominent Democratic supporters host volunteer organizing events over the next two weeks. The supporters will host open houses at offices around the state, spokeswoman Lily Adams said.\u201d dmreg.co/1BSx9E8\nGORE BALKS: Page Six: Al Gore, asked whether he\u2019d refuse to answer who he\u2019ll support for president: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t refuse to answer that question, I would try to cleverly dodge the question \u2026 I would say it\u2019s actually too early.\u201d After the moderator said he believes HILLARY CLINTON will win and it will be great to have a female president, the report says, \u201cGore merely smiled, but didn\u2019t comment further.\u201d pge.sx/1dlt6Ez\nTHE PROGRESSIVE RESISTANCE\nO\u2019MALLEY\u2019S FOREIGN POLICY VISION: MARTIN O\u2019MALLEY today gave the biggest foreign policy speech of his campaign this morning at the Truman Conference in D.C., devoting a significant amount of the speech to issues for international cooperation \u2014 immigration, climate change, trade and cybersecurity. While he never mentioned HILLARY CLINTON by name, he lobbed a few shells her way.\nHILLARY ATTACK LINE #1: \u201cThe invasion of Iraq \u2014 along with the subsequent disbanding of the Iraqi military \u2014 will be remembered as one of the most tragic, deceitful, and costly blunders in U.S. history. We are still paying the price of a war pursued under false pretenses and acquiesced to by \u2018the appalling silence of the good.\u2019\u201d\nHILLARY ATTACK LINE #2: \u201cWe must recognize that there are real lessons to be learned from the tragedy in Benghazi.\u201d\n\u2018IMPLICIT NEGATIVE\u2019: Mother Jones on BERNIE SANDERS\u2019 plan to counter HILLARY CLINTON despite the candidate\u2019s refusal to do negative ads: \u201cSanders won't even do a straight-up contrast ad \u2014 as in, BERNIE SANDERS believes X about subject Y, but HILLARY CLINTON believes Z. \u2018If we do that, we're done,\u2019 [Sanders adviser Tad] Devine says. \u2018If we do a classic comparative ad, it's over. We'll have to be smarter.\u2019 And Team Sanders does have what it considers to be a smarter way: implying a contrast \u2026 In the campaign against Clinton, Devine notes, \u2018There will be a lot of implicit negative. But it won't look negative. It won't feel negative.\u2019\u201d bit.ly/1Ja9yyq\nTHE CHRISTIE CHRONICLES\nHOW NOT TO ANNOUNCE YOU\u2019RE ANNOUNCING: NJ.com looks at how the rollout of CHRIS CHRISTIE\u2019s presidential announcement plans \u2014 June 30 at his old New Jersey high school, as reported yesterday \u2014 went so wrong. \u201cThe news day started with a local media outlet breaking news of Christie's upcoming announcement \u2026 and ended with Christie brushing off reporters who gathered outside of New Jersey radio station to get a word from the governor \u2026 Spokespeople for the governor's office and those tied to his 2016 political action committee refused to provide comment on the story. The spokespeople maintained their silence throughout the day \u2026 Despite the silence from official spokespeople, news outlets began confirming the details of Christie's upcoming announcement.\u201d bit.ly/1GxLnXB\nFEEL THE EXCITEMENT: NJ.com: \"It's the governor,\" said O'Neill. \"If he wants to make an announcement from his hometown, who are we to say no?\u201d http://bit.ly/1dmi0ik\nVETO PEN: NJ.com: \u201cLess than 24 hours after the Legislature sent\u00a0Gov.

He has virtually zero chance of winning the presidential nomination. But insiders worry that the loud-mouthed mogul is more than just a minor comedic nuisance on cable news; they fret that he\u2019s a loose cannon whose rants about Mexicans and scorched-earth attacks on his rivals will damage the eventual nominee and hurt a party struggling to connect with women and minorities and desperate to win.\u201d politi.co/1BHmT16\nLATINO OUTREACH: POLITICO\u2019s Dylan Byers reports: \u201cDONALD TRUMP sent a letter to Univision CEO and president Randy Falco on Friday informing him that \u2018no Univision officer or representative\u2019 is allowed to use his Trump National Doral, the resort and golf club\u00a0immediately adjacent\u00a0to Univision offices in Miami, the On Media blog has learned.

He\u2019s building an outreach, big tent brand and would have helped himself with an immediate, unequivocal call to banish the Confederate symbol once and for all.\u201d\nCHRIS CHRISTIE, from a New Hampshire Republican: \u201cMr. Tell-It-Like-It-Is was a ghost.\u201d politi.co/1GNW1vz\nWALKER\u2019S WEEK: SCOTT WALKER will announce his decision on a presidential bid on the week of July 13, he told Fox News last night.

It has no connection to the United States Constitution. They are simply making it up.\u201d bit.ly/1TStYSk\nNEW HAMPSHIRE ENDORSEMENTS\nCARLY FIORINA: State Sens.
