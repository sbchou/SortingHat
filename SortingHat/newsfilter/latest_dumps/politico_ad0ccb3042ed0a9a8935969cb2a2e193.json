The session was required after the Florida Supreme Court \u2014 situated just west of the statehouse \u2014 ruled that eight congressional districts drawn during last summer\u2019s redistricting special session favored Republicans, which is at odds with anti-gerrymandering provisions in the state constitution. \u2026 Legislative leaders say the third time drawing districts will be the charm, in part, because they put in place a number of safeguards to insulate the map-drawing process from the political consultants and partisan considerations that derailed the past two attempts.\u201d\n\u00a0\u2014 \u201cBoth the [state] House and [state] Senate agreed to a set of transparency rules, including allowing redistricting and legal staff to draw an initial \u2018base\u2019 map without any lawmaker input, and requiring any member who submits a map or amendment to outline every person involved in crafting the plan, among other strictures. \u2026 [State] Senate Majority Leader Bill Galvano of Bradenton agrees the new rules will limit amendments, but says he thinks some tweaks will be made. The base map \u2018is a starting point for discussion,\u2019 said Galvano, chair of the Senate redistricting committee. \u2018I have my own desire to understand where staff and attorneys were coming from, but I expect that there will be questions and amendments offered.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/1J5Uh52\nFIRST IN SCORE \u2014 DSCC HITS AYOTTE ON HEROIN PREVENTION: Outside GOP groups have lined up in recent weeks to hit Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan over New Hampshire's struggle to deal with a heroin and opioid crisis and GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte has promoted her own efforts on the issue. Democrats are trying to turn the tables, with the DSCC putting out a release later today attacking Ayotte for failing to speak out against an appropriations bill that would cut $150 million for substance abuse prevention funds. \"New Hampshire deserves better than a Senator who refuses to speak out as her party cuts federal funding necessary to address the most pressing public health and safety challenge facing New Hampshire,\" DSCC press secretary Sadie Weiner says in the release.\nFIRST IN SCORE \u2014 OHIO DEMS GO AFTER \"DARK MONEY\u201d: \"A memo from the Ohio Democratic Party tallies up how much outside groups have spent backing incumbent GOP Sen. Rob Portman. The total? Somewhere between $5.3 million and $8 million, not including a number of buys with unclear amounts. The NRSC, the Portman-specific Fighting for Ohio Fund super PAC, the Karl Rove-linked One Nation and the Chamber of Commerce have all spent in the race.

The plan, which would change the way a large swath of Americans pay for college, borrows ideas from the left and the right and even expands a program enacted by her husband. It includes ideas already being discussed in Congress and for which groundwork has been laid by the Obama administration. The proposal, dubbed the New College Compact, is unlikely to win over many in the GOP because the $350 billion over 10 years would come from cutting tax deductions for the wealthiest Americans. Clinton will discuss the plan, a litmus test of sorts for progressives, at campaign stops Monday and Tuesday in New Hampshire.\u201d http://politi.co/1gW4wN3\nDays until the 2015 election: 85.

Pete Gallego lost to Republican Will Hurd. The study found that among the 400 voters in the district who didn\u2019t vote in the most recent election, 12.8 percent cited a lack of appropriate ID for their reason not to vote, the San Antonio News-Express reported. But the study found most of those voters did have the appropriate ID, but didn\u2019t know it. For voters who chose not to participate in 2014, they preferred Gallego, a 5-1 margin. http://bit.ly/1Tc43HA\nPRESIDENTIAL SPEED READ \u2014 TRUMP CAMP IN CRISIS \u2014 By POLITICO\u2019s Ben Schreckinger and Katie Glueck: \u201cHis is a campaign in crisis. He needs credible defenders,\u201d said Bruce Haynes, a South Carolina Republican strategist and the president of Purple Strategies. \u201cBut he has not invested in organization and relationships. The result is he\u2019ll have to crawl out of the hole he\u2019s digging alone. And the hole is getting mighty deep.\u201d http://politi.co/1f0xLfZ\nHere\u2019s how it happened:\n\r\n\u00a0\u2014 In a tweet, he apparently insinuated that the Megyn Kelly had been menstruating when she questioned him during Thursday\u2019s first Republican debate, by POLITICO\u2019s Ben Schreckinger: http://politi.co/1IUQwxe\n\u00a0\u2014 He was uninvited from Erick Erickson\u2019s conservative RedState event, POLITICO\u2019s Katie Glueck reported: http://politi.co/1KWhkwH\n\u00a0\u2014 He lost a top aide, POLITICO\u2019s Marc Caputo reported: \u201cSources: Roger Stone quit, wasn\u2019t fired by Donald Trump in campaign shakeup.\u201d http://politi.co/1hqhZNg\n\u00a0\u2014 But he\u2019s not backing down: \u201cI said nothing wrong whatsoever,\u201d Trump said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d insisting he was referring to Kelly\u2019s nose, POLITICO\u2019s Jon Prior reported. http://politi.co/1ISXZsj\n\u00a0\u2014 And he had some choice words for Bush, too. \u2014 \u201cTrump hits Bush on his fundraising,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Jon Prior: \u201cBillionaire real estate developer Donald Trump criticized Republican rival Jeb Bush on Sunday for his lucrative fundraising, while vowing to be immune from outside influences should he be elected president.\u201d http://politi.co/1DH3ZbC\nMeanwhile, Rubio wants to avoid Trump altogether, by POLITICO\u2019s Jon Prior: \u201cSen. Marco Rubio says that while he hesitates to respond to every comment from Donald Trump in his bid for the Republican presidential nomination, the real estate mogul did boost ratings at the first GOP debate in Cleveland. ...Rubio did defend Fox News host Megyn Kelly for asking tough questions during the debate after Trump\u2019s harsh criticism about her have sparked fresh outrage at the Republican front runner.\u201d http://politi.co/1PfbRTl\n\u00a0\u2014 And he stepped out of Jeb\u2019s shadow, post-debate, by POLITICO\u2019s Marc Caputo and Eli Stokols: \u201cIn the first presidential debate of 2016, the apprentice beat the master. ...\u201cLuke Skywalker beat Obi Wan-Kenobi,\u201d said Enrique \u201cRick\u201d Yabor, a Miami lawyer and Spanish-language TV and radio commentator. \u201cNot only did Marco win that but, when you look at it the next day, you can argue Jeb lost. Here\u2019s why: No one is talking about him.\u201d After a summer in which he lost ground to Bush, Rubio suddenly created an opportunity to close the gap between them. In a rare convergence, many elite conservative and mainstream media analysts designated Rubio as the winner of the 10-candidate debate \u2014 or at least the clear victor over Bush.\u201d http://politi.co/1ItkQxK\nWHILE TRUMP WAS AWAY \u2014 \u201cRedState convention: 5 takeaways,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Katie Glueck in Atlanta: \u201cIt was the Donald Trump show that wasn\u2019t. The RedState Gathering, a high-profile annual convention of conservatives held here in Atlanta this weekend, drew nine presidential candidates. But the one driving the conversation was the one who wasn\u2019t there.\u201d But even so, five more takeaways \u2026 1. This was Ted Cruz turf \u2026 2. Keep an eye on Scott Walker in the South \u2026 3. Jeb held his own in hostile territory \u2026 4. There were lots of Carly Fiorina fans, but not necessarily Carly Fiorina voters \u2026 5. The Trump tide may be turning.\u201d http://politi.co/1DzLBBS\n\nCODA \u2014 QUOTE OF THE DAY: \"You'll just have to wait and see.\u201d \u2014 Louisiana businessman John Georges, considering a bid for governor. http://s.nola.com/EyCVrpX\nBy MICHAEL KRUSE and  MANU RAJU\nBy SUSAN SOUTHARD\nBy BILL SCHER\nBy MAYA PARK and  BEN WOFFORD\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Florida redistricting special session kicks off.", "title": "Florida redistricting special session kicks off \u2014 DSCC attacks Ayotte on heroin prevention \u2014 Ohio Dems go after \u2018dark money\u2019", "url": "http://www.politico.com/morningscore/0815/morningscore19518.html", "topics": ["personality", "campaign_finance", "economy"], "people": ["Kelly Ayotte", "Karl Rove", "John Georges", "Elena Schneider", "Bruce Haynes", "Marc Caputo", "Ted Cruz", "Obi Wan", "Kevin Robillard", "Kimberly Hefling", "Theodoric Meyer", "Scott Walker", "Katie Glueck", "Allie Grasgreen", "Rob Portman", "Nirvi Shah", "Jeb Bush", "Donald Trump", "Sadie Weiner", "Megyn Kelly", "Bill Galvano", "Roger Stone", "Carly Fiorina", "Luke Skywalker", "Ben Schreckinger", "Erick Erickson", "Matt Dixon", "Pete Gallego", "Hillary Clinton", "Eli Stokols", "Jon Prior", "Marco Rubio", "Maggie Hassan"], "orgs": ["Purple Strategies", "Congress", "Senate", "GOP", "PAC", "Chamber of Commerce", "One Nation", "Florida Supreme Court", "DSCC", "Ohio Democratic Party"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30901, "fullname": "elena schneider", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-08-10 15:01:31", "org": "politico", "article_id": "ad0ccb3042ed0a9a8935969cb2a2e193", "date_access": "2015-08-10 14:10:29.160197"}
