{"body": "Candidates, welcome to Iowa. Now meet the governor\u2019s son, who is tracking you.\n\nEric Branstad, a Republican like his father, Gov. Terry E. Branstad, has lurked at candidates\u2019 events across the state, sometimes with colleagues recording video. But rather than collecting opposition research, the younger Mr. Branstad is representing Iowa\u2019s prized ethanol industry, which faces increasing pressure to wean itself of government support.      \n\nMr. Branstad, 39, popped up at four appearances in Iowa this week by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Mr. Branstad was there on behalf of  America\u2019s Renewable Future, a pro-ethanol group that also planted supporters in the audience to press Mr. Cruz about his opposition to the Renewable Fuel Standard, a federal mandate benefiting farmers. At a stop in Dubuque, two people recording for Mr. Branstad were shown the door.   \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to record \u2018gotcha\u2019 moments,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Branstad, who promised that supporters of his group would attend political events throughout the year. He said the group  was part of a grass-roots advocacy campaign that has a multimillion-dollar budget from Iowa\u2019s agriculture industry. The group posted recordings of Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee last week talking about the Renewable Fuel Standard. \n\n\u201cThis is a very important subsidy to Iowa agriculture, to Iowa farmers,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Branstad said.  \u201cThe price of corn and soybeans are selling well below production value today.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe mandate requires that corn-based ethanol and other biofuels be blended with gasoline. Supporters say it keeps corn and soybean prices high and gas prices low. But the Environmental Protection Agency is considering reducing the volume of biofuels required in the mix. At the same time, some conservatives oppose the regulation as a federal subsidy.  \n\nIn Des Moines on Thursday evening, an audience member asked Mr. Cruz why he opposed the mandate. The senator said he supported legislation \u201cto phase out\u201d the fuel standard. And he contrasted his willingness to take an unpopular position with other candidates who he said tell different groups of voters what they hope to hear. \n\nMr. Branstad said that to him, Mr. Cruz sounded inconsistent. The senator co-sponsored a bill in 2013 to repeal the fuel mandate, not phase it out. And he seemed to have toned down a harsher message he delivered at an agriculture forum in Iowa last month, when he said ethanol should compete for itself in a free market without Washington \u201cpicking winners and losers.\u2019\u2019 \n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Cruz, Catherine Frazier, said the senator had been consistent on this and other issues. \n\n\u201cVoters deserve elected leaders who will tell them the truth,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cThat is what Senator Cruz does no matter where he goes, and his positions are the same no matter where he travels.\u2019\u2019", "byline": "TRIP GABRIEL", "description": "Candidates, welcome to Iowa.
