{"body": "WASHINGTON \u2014  House Republicans on Tuesday will unveil a proposed budget for 2016 that partly privatizes Medicare, turns Medicaid into block grants to the states, repeals the Affordable Care Act and reaches balance in 10 years, challenging Republicans in Congress to make good on their promises to deeply cut federal spending.\n\nThe House proposal leans heavily on the policy prescriptions that Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin outlined when he was budget chairman, according to senior House Republican aides and members of Congress who were not authorized to speak in advance of the official release.\n\nWith the Senate now also in Republican hands, this year\u2019s proposal is more politically salient than in years past, especially for Republican senators facing re-election in Democratic or swing states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Illinois and New Hampshire, and for potential Republican presidential candidates.\n\nMr. Ryan\u2019s successor, Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, promised on Monday \u201ca plan to get Washington\u2019s fiscal house in order, promote a healthy economy, protect our nation and save and strengthen vital programs like Medicare.\u201d\n\nDemocrats \u2014 and those Republicans who support robust military spending \u2014 will not see Mr. Price\u2019s \u201cBalanced Budget for a Stronger America\u201d in those terms. Opponents plan to hammer Republican priorities this week, as the House and Senate budget committees officially begin drafting their plans on Wednesday, and then try to pass them through their chambers this month.\n\nOn Monday, President Obama tried to get ahead of the debate by criticizing Republican plans to abide by strict domestic and military spending caps.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that if the budget maintains sequester-level funding, then we would actually be spending less on pre-K to 12th grade in America\u2019s schools in terms of federal support than we were back in 2000,\u201d the president said in a speech to the Council of the Great City Schools. \u201cThe notion that we would be going backward instead of forwards in how we\u2019re devoting resources to educating our kids makes absolutely no sense.\u201d\n\nBut Republican aides said they have weathered those attacks ever since Mr. Ryan released his first budget plan in 2011. They said the easiest way to prevail in the House, at least, is to put forward the budget plan most House members have voted on multiple times.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had House people vote on these four years in a row. We\u2019ve held on to our majority and even expanded it,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma and a Budget Committee member. \u201cThe idea you\u2019re going to lose an election on this is more political theater than political reality.\u201d\n\nCongressional budgets do not have the force of law and are largely advisory documents, but they represent the broadest statement of governing philosophy each year and set overall spending levels for the coming fiscal year. And in coming months, this one may contain language easing passage of taxation and entitlement legislation.\n\nUnder congressional rules, a budget cannot be filibustered in the Senate, so Republicans would bear most of the responsibility if they failed to pass one.\n\nHouse Budget Committee members previewed their plans in an unusual, campaign-style video on Monday. The plan envisions a remaking of the federal government. Future recipients of Medicare would be offered voucherlike \u201cpremium support\u201d to pay for private insurance rather than government-provided health care.\n\nSpending on Medicaid would be cut substantially over 10 years, with the money turned into block grants to state governments, which in turn would have much more flexibility in deciding how it is allocated.\n\nThe budget \u201crepeals all of Obamacare,\u201d Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee, said the same day the Obama administration announced that the law had provided coverage to 16.4 million previously uninsured people.\n\nTo placate advocates of the military who say strict budget caps are hurting national defense, the House budget adds \u201cemergency\u201d war spending through the \u201coverseas contingency operations\u201d account, which does not count against the spending limits.\n\nThe budget will also include language that orders members of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee to draft a \u201cfairer, simpler tax code,\u201d said Representative Todd Rokita, Republican of Indiana.\n\nAnd it will include parliamentary language \u2014 called \u201creconciliation\u201d \u2014 aimed at allowing legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act to pass the Senate with a simple majority. If that bill is passed, it will still be subject to a presidential veto.\n\nConservative groups insist Republicans must keep their promise and repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cRepublicans owe their majorities to their unwavering opposition to Obamacare, a reality that must be reflected in the budget,\u201d declared Heritage Action, the political arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation. \u201cA throwaway line that the budget \u2018repeals Obamacare in its entirety\u2019 is not enough.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans conceded on Monday that the Senate was not likely to propose such extensive cuts. Even before the Senate plan is unveiled, deep rifts are appearing. Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, reiterated his demand on Monday that any budget raise military spending well above the statutory caps. And he said he would not accept an approach that raised spending through the war-fighting emergency account or by shifting money from already squeezed domestic programs.\n\nLast year, Mr. Ryan called \u201cemergency spending\u201d increases \u201ca backdoor loophole that undermines the integrity of the budget process.\u201d\n\nRepublican leaders worry that the Republican senators making moves to run for president \u2014 Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Marco Rubio of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina \u2014 will never find a budget to their liking. At the same time, Republican senators from Democratic states, such as Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, will be hard-pressed to agree to the House\u2019s conservative vision.\n\nIn 2013, when the Senate was presented an amendment to prohibit replacing Medicare\u2019s guaranteed benefits \u201cwith the House passed budget plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program,\u201d 96 senators agreed. Only three, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Paul and Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, supported the House\u2019s vision.\n\n\u201cHistorically, the Senate has been less willing to take on the tough issues, and the early sounds are they\u2019re not going to do a Ryan-type Medicare-Medicaid plan,\u201d Mr. Cole said. \u201cThey face a very difficult election atmosphere next year.\u201d", "byline": "JONATHAN WEISMAN", "description": "House Republicans on Tuesday will unveil a proposed budget for 2016 that partly privatizes Medicare, turns Medicaid into block grants to the states, repeals the Affordable Care Act and reaches balance in 10 years.", "title": "House Republican Budget Overhauls Medicare and Repeals the Health Law", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/17/us/politics/house-republican-budget-overhauls-medicare-and-repeals-the-health-law.html", "topics": ["health"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Tom Price", "Mark S.
