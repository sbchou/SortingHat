{"body": "With her poll numbers down and interest in her campaign seeming to plateau, Carly Fiorina on Friday sought to explain, in explicitly political process terms like \u201cfave and unfave ratings,\u201d why everything was fine.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after addressing an auditorium of seniors at a residential community dotted with bocce ball courts and golf carts in Bluffton, S.C., Ms. Fiorina responded to reports that Jeb Bush was scaling back part of his campaign by talking about having \u201cthe lowest burn rate of any campaign.\u201d She added, \u201cWe are spending our money very carefully, because we have to go the long haul.\u201d\n\nBut the wisdom of Ms. Fiorina\u2019s decision not to spend money on advertising is debatable, given the momentum she gained after her performance in the first Republican debate. Asked when she would buy air time, she said: \u201cWell, not for awhile. I think we have spent our time between the efforts of the campaign, and what I understand the \u2018super pac\u2019 Carly Fiorina is doing, we have spent our time making sure we have people on the ground.\u201d \n\nShe added: \u201cOf course, I take advantage of earned media any chance I get. The debates are a really important opportunity for me. Every time I get out on that debate stage more people say \u2018Oh, I didn\u2019t know she was running for president. I kind of like her.\u2019 So there will come a time for ads but honestly, other candidates have already spent millions on ads and it\u2019s done nothing for them. So I think the time is not yet.\u201d\n\nSo why the dip in the polls? Ms. Fiorina argued that it had nothing to do with attacks on her business record.\n\n\u201cIf the attacks were working, you\u2019d start to see it in my favorable and unfavorables,\u201d she said, referring to poll data. \u201cAnd in fact I have very, very strong fave and unfave ratings. I think what you are seeing is that in the debate, half the audience saw me for the first time. And you don\u2019t make a sale in one impression. Also we have been off national television for the last couple of weeks. We have been doing more regional media and more on the ground town halls. \n\n\u201cSo I think you have to look at not every little bump in a poll \u2014 you have to look at a trajectory.\u201d", "byline": "JASON HOROWITZ", "description": "With her poll numbers down and interest in her campaign seeming to plateau, Carly Fiorina sought to explain why everything was fine.", "title": "First Draft: Carly Fiorina Defends Decision to Hold Off on Ads", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/10/23/carly-fiorina-defends-decision-to-hold-off-on-ads/", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Jeb Bush", "Carly Fiorina"], "orgs": ["S.C."], "authors": [{"author_id": 761, "fullname": "jason horowitz", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-10-23 23:52:20", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "324d3b309fab67b424ff1239e0a1ebaa", "date_access": "2015-10-23 23:05:30.416569"}
