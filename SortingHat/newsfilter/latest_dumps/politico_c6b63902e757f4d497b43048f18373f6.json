Concerns about the actions of U.S. officials \u2014 including claims that families of hostages were threatened with prosecution if they tried to pay ransoms \u2014 led to the review and a number of policy recommendations.\nIn a statement, Secretary of State John Kerry said O'Brien, who previously served as a special presidential envoy for the Balkans and helped formulate the 1995 Dayton Accords that ended the war in Bosnia, would now focus on \"one overriding goal: using diplomacy to secure the safe return of Americans held hostage overseas.\" \n\"Jim is exactly the right person for a job that demands a high level of diplomatic experience and the ability to analyze and find effective remedies to complex problems,\" Kerry said. \"He will be in close contact with the families of American hostages, meet with foreign leaders in support of our hostage recovery efforts, advise on options to enhance those efforts, participate in strategy meetings with other senior U.S. policymakers, and represent the United States internationally on hostage-related issues.\"\n\nAlso on POLITICO\n\n            By \nBurgess Everett\n             and \nSeung Min Kim\n\nO'Brien, who is currently vice chairman of the Albright Stonebridge Group, is expected to work with the interagency Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, which was created as a result of the policy review. He will report to the secretary of state.\n\nNahal Toosi is the\u00a0Foreign Affairs Correspondent\u00a0for Politico.
