They want to pave the way to impose themselves,\u201d Khamenei was quoted as saying during a speech to Navy commanders from the hard-line Revolutionary Guards, according to the IRNA state news agency.\nStory Continued Below\nDuring the course of the negotiations, he is quoted as saying, the U.S. \"made attempts to infiltrate at any spot they were able to; thanks God, the Iranian side was vigilant enough but still at certain points they somehow managed to get chances and did a move contrary to our national interests.\"\nIt's not clear to what incident Khamenei was referring; U.S. officials have long boasted of their ability to spy on Iran.\n\"Ayatollah Khamenei stressed that at the present juncture, enemies were trying to transform the revolutionary attitudes of officials and religious beliefs of people,\" the IRNA report says. \"Urging the youth to stay quite vigilant, he noted that he has nothing to worry about in this regard thanks to the awareness of universities and army forces.\"\nThe comments come as hardliners in Iran's parliament try to stop the deal and would appear to put him at loggerheads with President Hassan Rouhani, who has publicly endorsed the agreement. Khamenei has not come out in favor of it, however.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Iran's supreme leader: No more talks with the U.S.", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/iran-ayatollah-khamenei-no-us-talks-negotiations-214495", "topics": ["trade", "immigration", "personality", "terrorism"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Michael Froman", "Mary E.
