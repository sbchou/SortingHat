There is going to be an avalanche,\" he wrote, and offered to help tamp down the speculation: \"We should have a strategy for responding. Keep it out of State. Happy to help if you wish.\"\nMills' response: \"Folks have to know she would never do it - I thought cheney was poking potus\"\nThe chief of staff long opposed her boss seeking another presidential bid, as The Associated Press reported that she would say Clinton was \"crazy\" for considering it.\n\"Honestly, nine out of ten people who are not on the 'in' think she will. It is only going to build,\" Barnett wrote in the email, which Mills forwarded to Clinton. \"So, we should have some strategy based upon, of course, her wishes.\"\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Cheryl Mills' email shoots down speculation that Clinton would take on Obama in a 2012 primary.", "title": "Hillary would 'never' run, top aide says in email", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/hillary-clinton-2012-emails-cheryl-mills-obama-214298", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "personality"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Kenneth P.
