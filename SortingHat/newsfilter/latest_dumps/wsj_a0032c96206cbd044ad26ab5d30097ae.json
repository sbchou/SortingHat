Those companies won at least $227 million in government contracts last year, according to an analysis of state records. The political committee backing Gov. John Kasich in Ohio raised $1.5 million from contractors and companies that received business subsidies from the state. In Louisiana, 20% of the largest 100 contributors to Gov. Bobby Jindal\u2018s campaign work for corporate outlets that received $30 million in state tax subsidies, while the super PAC backing Mr. Jindal received $75,000 from such businesses. More than $580,000 of the $20 million raised by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\u2018s friendly super PAC came from companies that benefited from state contracts, or tax credits and loans from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., state records show. Mr. Walker pushed to form the public-private entity in 2011 and headed it until earlier this year.

The retired pediatric neurosurgeon isn\u2019t generating the headlines or drawing the crowds of Donald Trump, but his numbers in some surveys suggest the appetite for his presidential candidacy might be just as great, if not greater. Consider a recent survey by TargetPoint Consulting, a top Republican polling and data-research firm. Roughly two-thirds of likely Republican primary voters polled said they would consider backing Mr. Carson, the highest level of support for any candidate in the field. Just 16% said they wouldn\u2019t, the lowest such tally. Those results include voters who didn\u2019t know who Mr. Carson is. By comparison, 54% of GOP primary voters would consider voting for Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0094a big jump from the 20% who said that in May\u00e2\u0080\u0094but a third said they wouldn\u2019t, twice the level of resistance as for Mr. Carson.
