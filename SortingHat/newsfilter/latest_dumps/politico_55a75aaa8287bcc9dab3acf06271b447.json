While the pro-Clinton group Correct the Record has set up an entire 30-person war room to rebut any GOP accusations during the hearing, Benghazi panel Democrats are the only ones who can come to her rescue in real time if the hearing breaks down into bickering. \n\n\n\n            By \nJosh Gerstein\n\nA committee spokesperson for the Democrats did not respond to requests for comment, but ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings in a brief interview Tuesday said any counters they make will be in the name of fairness, not Clinton personally. \n\u201cI believe that Hillary Clinton can defend herself,\u201d the Maryland Democrat said. \u201cI\u2019m not in the business of defending Hillary Clinton; I\u2019m in the business of defending the truth.\u201d\nWhile panel Republicans have been on the defense for several weeks amid accusations that they\u2019re out to hurt Clinton on the campaign trail, Clinton also needs to make her case to some voters: A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday shows Americans are unsatisfied with her response to the 2012 terrorist attack by a 2-to-1 margin. \nAhead of the hearing, it\u2019s unclear how far Democrats will go when they face with their GOP counterparts on Thursday \u2014 that, Schiff said, will depend on how the majority behaves.\nRepublicans have said Clinton is simply one witness in their investigation, that they\u2019re not out to get her and that she\u2019ll be treated fairly on Thursday. \nThe question is how long the hearing will stay civil and professional, given weeks of partisan rhetoric around the investigation and Clinton's appearance.\nDemocrats are expected to bring up evidence they say acquits Clinton of wrongdoing on certain long-held GOP Benghazi theories. They may, for example, point back to a report they released Monday claiming the 50-plus interviews the committee has conducted have turned up \u201cno evidence\u201d of Clinton ordering a stand-down order for help the night of the attack.\nSources close to Clinton have said she will try to stay above any bickering and carry herself in a presidential manner. Panel Democrats agree that\u2019s the way it should be.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about correcting the record on the facts on Benghazi, yes, she\u2019ll be doing that \u2014 but she\u2019s not going to engage on the partisan stuff,\" Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.), who dismissed the panel as a \u201ccolossal waste of taxpayer money.\u201d \n\nCongress\n\n            By \nRachael Bade\n\nWhile Democrats have long accused panel Republicans of targeting Clinton, they\u2019ve sharply escalated their attacks in the weeks leading up to her appearance, blanketing the press corps with news releases and repeatedly highlighting GOP gaffes that suggested the panel has partisan motivations. \nJust the day before Clinton\u2019s hearing, for example, Democrats released the entire transcript of a closed-door Cheryl Mills\u2019 interview with the committee \u2014 an effort to show Clinton was not personally denying requests for additional security at the U.S. Benghazi compound or had ordered the military to stand down the night of the Sept. 11, 2012 attack. Republicans had asked them not to.\nAnd they\u2019ve capitalized on Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s brag that the panel hurt Clinton in the polls as well as allegations from a fired GOP staffer that the committee was narrowing in on Clinton. Those, they\u2019ve said, are proof that the panel has lost its way and is focused only on hurting Clinton.\nThey\u2019ve also gone hard after Chairman Trey Gowdy, highlighting the South Carolina Republican\u2019s mistakes. For example, when Gowdy claimed during a television appearance that he had interviewed 50 new witnesses, Democrats called those numbers \"inaccurately inflated.\" A number is closer to about 45, but it shrinks to about 30 if one takes into account interviews conducted during State's own internal investigation.\nJust this week, Democrats on Tuesday said Gowdy was \u201cinaccurate\u201d when he said he had new, never-seen emails from Ambassador Chris Stevens, who was killed along with three other Americans in the Benghazi attacks. That, they said, was because the Oversight Committee years ago had received a small batch of some Stevens emails. Gowdy has received more than 7,000. \nAnd when the CIA over the weekend contradicted Gowdy\u2019s claim that Clinton had a classified CIA source's name on her email, Democrats made sure everyone knew about the goof. \nSchiff brought that very example up in a phone call with POLITICO, saying it\u2019s fair game for Thursday: \u201cThese are things we have to point out, and clarify, and rebut.\u201d\nWhile he would not comment on strategy, Cummings said his goal is to ensure the hearing doesn't become an exercise in bashing the witness, as he said House Oversight Committee Republicans recently did with Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood. \n\"I\u2019m hoping they will not treat her like Republicans treated Ms. Richards ... It's like a machine-gun questioning and then she didn\u2019t have a chance to answer,\" he said. If that happens, he added, they will ensure Clinton has a chance to defend herself, and \"if there are things that are not accurate, we will point them out.\u201d\nAt least one Democrat expressed interest in learning new information from Clinton \u2014 if there is any, she said. Panel Democrat Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, who lost parts of both her legs serving in Iraq, said although she feels the committee has been a \u201ccampaign against the secretary on the Republican side,\u201d she\u2019s \u201cnot going to let that stop me from doing my job, which is to make sure we safeguard Americans who work in our embassies abroad into the future.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to focus my questioning on what we can do better,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very mission focused \u2014 me, broken-down old soldier \u2014 my mission is to how we can save Americans \u2026 I refuse to dishonor our heroic dead by getting into a partisan battle.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Dems will have Clinton&#8217;s back at Benghazi hearing", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/benghazi-committee-democrats-support-hillary-clinton-214999", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Ray Takeyh", "Katy O'Donnell", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Jack Dorsey", "Joe Pompeo", "Rachael Bade", "Cecile Richards", "Anna Palmer", "Hadas Gold", "Paul Demko", "Tim Starks", "Tammy Duckworth", "Chris Stevens", "Steven Shepard", "Adam Schiff", "Joe Biden", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Theodoric Meyer", "Nahal Toosi", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Patrick Temple", "Nick Gass", "Trey Gowdy", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Glenn Thrush", "Cheryl Mills", "John Bresnahan", "Marco Rubio", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Paul Ryan", "Brianna Ehley", "Lauren French", "Adam Sneed", "Adam Smith", "Hillary Clinton", "Jack Lew", "Carl Icahn", "Victoria Guida", "Josh Gerstein", "Eric Wolff", "Bill Tomson", "Darius Tahir", "Maggie Severns", "Caitlin Emma"], "orgs": ["CIA", "EMV", "NRCC", "Congress", "Senate", "UAW", "House Democrats", "Sunlight Foundation", "PAC", "Treasury", "Metro", "GOP", "House Freedom Caucus", "House Select Committee"], "authors": [{"author_id": 32625, "fullname": "eliza collins", "primary_org": "politico"}, {"author_id": 30728, "fullname": "nick gass", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-10-21 20:36:13", "org": "politico", "article_id": "55a75aaa8287bcc9dab3acf06271b447", "date_access": "2015-10-21 20:04:44.250930"}
