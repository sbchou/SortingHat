Multinational corporations make this move in an effort to pay a lower tax rate offered in other countries.\n\u201cIn the last few years over 50 companies have left the country through 'inversions,' representing over half a trillion dollars in market value, hundreds of millions in tax dollars, and tens of thousands of jobs\u201d, Icahn explained. \u201cIf this exodus is allowed to accelerate, there will be disastrous consequences for our already fragile economy\u201d.\nHe added, \u201cthis is by far the worst time imaginable to have an exodus of hundreds of companies. It would not only hurt our economy badly but would also meaningfully tarnish our reputation as a world power\u201d.\n\nIcahn could find bipartisan support from the White House. \u201cThey're technically renouncing their U.S. citizenship. They're declaring they're based someplace else even though most of their operations are here. Some people are calling these companies \"corporate deserters,\u201d President Obama told a crowd in July 2014.\nThis issue has also been a focus for Icahn\u2019s friend and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.\nIn September, Trump released his tax reform proposals, which target current loopholes. \u201cToo many companies \u2013 from great American brands to innovative startups \u2013 are leaving America, either directly or through corporate inversions\u201d.\nThe GOP frontrunner has publicly shammed American companies for moving operations outside the states.\n\u201cI'm not eating Oreos anymore. Nabisco is closing their plant in Chicago and moving it to Mexico. Ford is building $2.5 billion plant in Mexico,\u201d Trump told supporters in New Hampshire last month. \u201cYou know I have Carl Icahn lined up. I have some of the greatest business leaders in the country lined up \u2026 they're going to go and negotiate, and we are going to make great deals\u2026\u201d\nIcahn has endorsed Trump\u2019s presidential bid. \u201cYou have this movement toward a guy like Donald Trump, because you want someone that\u2019s not beholden to an establishment,\u201d he said in a recent video on his website. \u201cWe need a president that can move Congress and I think Donald Trump could do it. I disagree with him on certain issues, and certainly would talk to him more, but this is what this country needs -- somebody to wake it up.\u201d\nIt\u2019s yet to be seen if Icahn will join Trump on the campaign trail in the weeks ahead to push for tax and economic reform.Chris Snyder is a producer for Foxnews.com based in New York.
