{"body": "POLITICO\nA daily overview of education policy news\nBy Caitlin Emma\n8/10/15 9:59 AM EDT\nWith help from Allie Grasgreen, Kimberly Hefling and Nirvi Shah\nTHE $350 BILLION PLAN TO KILL COLLEGE DEBT: Hillary Clinton\u2019s new $350 billion proposal [http://politico.pro/1Mf1rmG] is intended to keep people from going into debt to go to college and reduce interest rates for people who already have student loans. The plan borrows ideas from the left and the right and even expands a program enacted by Bill Clinton, AmeriCorps. It includes ideas already being discussed in Congress and for which groundwork has been laid by the Obama administration. The so-called New College Compact is unlikely to win over many in the GOP because the $350 billion over 10 years would come from cutting tax deductions [http://politico.pro/1DGvDpj] for the wealthiest Americans, but a senior campaign official believes the proposal is so powerful it will galvanize voters to sway Congress to adopt the ideas.\nStory Continued Below\n\u2014 The plan: allow students to attend a four-year public college without taking out loans for tuition, attend community college tuition-free, push states to spend more on higher education, encourage institutions to cut costs while boosting graduation rates and reward innovation. But Republicans, including Senate education committee Chairman Lamar Alexander have argued that public college tuition is largely affordable now and that stories of students who have racked up more than $100,000 of debt are outliers. \u201cStudents, taxpayers and voters should react with great skepticism to any proposals that would amount to a Washington takeover of higher education and jeopardize the autonomy and independence that has made our higher education system the best in the world,\u201d a Republican aide said. \u201cThese kinds of ideas usually go hand in hand with higher state taxes, increased costs and fewer choices.\u201d\n\u2014 The campaign praised some Obama administration initiatives, including boosts in Pell Grant spending and the expansion of programs that allow graduates to repay loans based on the size of their paycheck. But Clinton wants to address the underlying issue that led to the need for those changes and the nation\u2019s collective $1.2 trillion in student loan debt. \u201cWe haven\u2019t dealt with crux of the problem: How do we actually stem the cost curve?\u201d the campaign official said.\n\u2014 Clinton will discuss the plan during New Hampshire campaign stops. She visits Exeter High School at 1:30 p.m. ET today and River Valley Community college Tuesday at 11 a.m. She\u2019s also attending a community forum at Keene Middle School on Tuesday at 3:30 p.m. And at a yet-to-be-announced stop later in the week, Clinton will offer additional proposals intended to help nontraditional students \u2014 such as those who are already parents \u2014 complete their degrees, the campaign said.

While progressives have generally supported the initiative \u2014 which was done at Obama\u2019s bidding, by a negotiated rulemaking panel that managed to reach consensus in April \u2014 many observers, including HELP Committee Ranking Member Patty Murray and other Senate Democrats, have criticized the decision to create an entirely new program rather than build on the existing one. Revised Pay As You Earn, or REPAYE, had yielded nearly 2,500 comments as of Friday: http://1.usa.gov/1MfwP69.\n\u2014 \u201cWhile we are strong proponents of allowing more borrowers to cap their payments at 10 percent of income, as REPAYE does, we also strongly support the streamlining of the multiple income-driven repayment plans into one improved income-driven plan,\u201d The Institute for College Access and Success said in its submission [http://bit.ly/1KVY2ud]. \u201cWe recognize that this cannot be achieved through regulation and requires legislative changes. With the incorporation of our recommended changes, REPAYE would become an excellent model for Congress to consider when developing that single, streamlined IDR plan.\u201d TICAS also took issue with the fact that the proposed regulations would tier loan forgiveness, requiring borrowers with any graduate loans to repay for 25 years before having their debt forgiven, as opposed to the 20 required for undergraduate borrowers.\n\u2014 The regulations would also modify the process for colleges issuing challenges and appeals to penalties based on their Participation Rate Index, and require loan holders to proactively use a Defense Department database to apply a 6 percent interest rate cap to military members.\nSTATE CHIEFS LOOK AHEAD: Five newby state chiefs said they\u2019re feeling more settled in the job now that they\u2019re looking ahead to the new school year. They said their first few months in office were like \u201cdrinking out of a fire hose on full blast,\u201d dealing with No Child Left Behind reauthorization, state legislative sessions, budget shortfalls, academic standards updates and equity lawsuits. The five were all elected last November to replace Republican predecessors: Georgia\u2019s Richard Woods, Idaho\u2019s Sherri Ybarra, Oklahoma\u2019s Joy Hofmeister, South Carolina\u2019s Molly Spearman and Wyoming\u2019s Jillian Balow. But now, heading into a new school year, they\u2019re hoping for a steadier, more manageable stream of activity, though many of the issues they faced at first are still lingering.

But the processed food companies have evolved to stay on school lunch trays despite the law, which set the first real nutrition standards in decades. Leading companies like General Mills, Schwan\u2019s and Domino\u2019s are increasing their sales and the industry has dialed down lobbying against the nutrition standards. The pizza chain Domino\u2019s actually got into the K-12 school food business because of the opportunity it anticipated in the shift in nutrition requirements. The company\u2019s Smart Slice, a whole-grain-rich, lower-fat and lower-sodium pizza, was developed just for school cafeterias. The company expects to sell its pizza in 5,000 schools in more than 44 states this year. That\u2019s up from last year\u2019s 3,000 schools in 29 states.

The principal of Ferguson\u2019s Central Elementary School, Krystal Isom, told Morning Education that Brown\u2019s shooting and the racial unrest that followed prompted a lot of questions from her students. The protests kept them up at night. And they didn\u2019t understand the public\u2019s response: They couldn\u2019t comprehend why people were being mean to their beloved school resource officer, Isom said. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t their experience, that wasn\u2019t their story,\u201d she said. \u201cThey began to challenge why people couldn\u2019t come up with more positive ways of expressing what\u2019s going on.\u201d But the students kept coming to school every day. And the teachers and counselors helped students work through the tension. Ultimately, Isom said the experience brought her staff, students and their families closer together. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a racially divided place as it has been depicted,\u201d she said. \u201cI think their takeaway is that their still can be peace, you can still be resilient despite enormous obstacles.\u201d\n\u2014 Media from around the world flocked to Ferguson to cover the protests and racial unrest, but they should\u2019ve been paying attention all along, writes April Saul for POLITICO Magazine. \u201cHarder to tell are the stories of the kids gunned down on the streets of our cities, where murder has become too mundane to be deemed newsworthy \u2014 but is no less heartbreaking than police brutality, and just as worthy of our understanding.\u201d More: http://politi.co/1Pfo8qF.\nREPORT: THE GOOD JOBS ARE BACK: Job growth since the recession has mostly come from good, full-time jobs that pay more than $53,000 and provide health insurance and retirement plans, according to a new report released today by Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce. The vast majority of those jobs have gone to college graduates, the report says, and they\u2019re focused in the managerial, STEM or health care sector. The findings come despite media reports that only low-wage jobs have dominated since the start of the recovery in 2010. The report: http://bit.ly/1INvah2.\nBACK TO SCHOOL SHOPPING? Prepare to pay more: Huntington Bank recently released its annual \u201cBackpack Index,\u201d and when supplies and extracurricular activities are added together, costs are going up this school year compared to last. There was an almost 10 percent increase for high school students because many of them take multiple college entrance exams. Elementary and middle school students saw a more modest increase of a 1 percent and 2.5 percent increase, respectively. The index anticipates costs of $1,402 for high school students, $649 for elementary school children and a $941 for a middle school child.
