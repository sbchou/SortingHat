White women make up about 40% of the electorate\u00e2\u0080\u0094a large constituency prized by both parties. Yet a pair of national polls over the summer showed a drop-off in Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backing among white women, putting her support at levels below that of President Barack Obama in his 2012 re-election bid.\nWhen Mrs. Clinton launched her campaign in April, her advisers had seen white women as a potential point of strength that would enable her to expand on the voting coalition that propelled Mr. Obama to two election victories. Her advisers remain confident that when compared with Republican alternatives, women voters will conclude she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the better candidate and coalesce behind her campaign.

The victory was sealed in a procedural vote, as the Senate voted 58-42, short of the 60 votes needed, on a measure aimed at derailing the international agreement. The vote effectively ends a bitter, partisan fight in Congress over the accord, and spares Mr. Obama from the need for a veto to safeguard the deal.

In a hint of the service\u2019s thinking, the Marine Corps released research data showing that all-male teams outperformed units comprising men and women in 69% of ground-combat tasks, especially those that involve carrying heavy ammunition or weapons. The findings, Marine officers said, show mixed-gender units are less effective in combat and more likely to suffer casualties than traditional all-male units. Michael M. Phillips and Gordon Lubold report.\nOBAMA SEEKS ADMISSION FOR 10,000 MORE SYRIAN REFUGEES: The U.S. is preparing to admit at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next year, a six-fold increase over the number currently in the country, the White House announced, as President Obama comes under pressure to respond more forcefully to a growing global migrant crisis. The proposal follows calls from lawmakers and human rights groups for Mr. Obama to expand the number of Syrian refugees accepted into the U.S. beyond the nearly 1,600 that have been allowed into the country since 2011. The migrant crisis, the worst since World War II, is adding urgency to stymied efforts to address the Syrian civil war, U.S. officials said, and has given a boost to an emerging shift in the international fight against Islamic State militants, as the U.S.-led military coalition begins to focus more heavily on Syria.
