We expect him to remain with us for many, many years.\u201d \nRepublicans have already said that Stephanopoulos\u2019 donations disqualified him from moderating a GOP primary debate, and a spokesman for one candidate, US Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), went even further on Monday. \n\u201cSenator Paul believes that Stephanopoulos\u2019 ties to the Clintons makes it impossible for him to be a fair reporter,\u201d spokesman Sergio Gor said. \n\u201cHe has avoided being on his program for over a year and will continue to do so.\u201d \nDemocrats, meanwhile, were going easy on the hobbled host and his cash connections to Hillary Clinton. \nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is Hillary Clinton\u2019s only declared primary opponent, told CNN that Stephanopoulos \u201cshould have made [his donations] public,\u201d but added that the scandal wasn\u2019t \u201cthe biggest deal in the world.\u201d \nA spokeswoman for former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, who is flirting with a presidential run, said, \u201cWe\u2019ve always found him to be fair.\u201d \nThis article originally appeared in the New York Post's Page Six.", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Stephanopoulos cost ABC $105M?", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2015/05/19/report-abc-spent-105-million-on-george-stephanopoulos/", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "immigration", "economy"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Martin O'Malley", "Bill Clinton", "George Stephanopoulos", "Brian Williams", "Hillary Clinton", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Sergio Gor", "Josh Elliott", "Bernie Sanders", "Matt Lauer"], "orgs": ["Clinton Foundation", "Clintons", "The New York Post", "GOP", "New York Post"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-05-19 13:55:52", "org": "fox", "article_id": "380889fc24eabece1b0a3eb2c272f8b0", "date_access": "2015-05-19 13:20:20.611514"}
