{"body": "MIAMI BEACH \u2014  On his way to an ecologically friendly hotel here on Sunday, Jeb Bush ate a Paleo-diet-approved lettuce-wrapped bison burger served by a drag queen turned waiter.\n\nWhen Mr. Bush gamely posed for a selfie taken by the waiter, Tommy Strangie, Mr. Strangie deliberately left himself just outside of the frame.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to wait for my picture with Hillary,\u201d Mr. Strangie explained later.\n\nThere are buttoned-up, Brooks Brothers-clad, red-meat Republican presidential campaign operations. And then there is Jeb Bush\u2019s approach.\n\nHis inaugural gathering of major donors and fund-raisers here was a sometimes flamboyant, and sometimes inadvertent, spectacle of Republican Party stereotype busting.\n\nThe message: Should he run for president, as widely expected, Mr. Bush will do it on his own, inviting, unconventional, South Floridian terms.\n\nThe two-day retreat here was held at 1 Hotel South Beach, known for its environmental ambitions and colorful design.\n\nInside the beachside hotel, hundreds of Bush supporters found a brochure encouraging them to use complementary electric cars made by Telsa, a longtime Republican Party demon because of its federal tax subsidies.\n\nThey encountered a copy of the sustainability-focused, left-leaning Modern Farmer magazine. (Headline: \u201cCan plant factories save us from climate change?\u201d)\n\nAnd they were surrounded by Floridian kitsch, from white shag pillows to Taschen books celebrating Andy Warhol.\n\n\u201cA Zen vibe,\u201d is how a top Bush adviser put it. (Yoga mats are standard in every room.)\n\nMr. Bush, aides and allies say, is proudly and ideologically conservative, in his legacy as a governor and his message as a likely candidate for president in 2016.\n\nBut he keeps finding ways to telegraph a different, more contemporary brand of that worldview than many of his Republican rivals do \u2014 an endeavor encapsulated by the retreat\u2019s venue and the colorful city he has chosen for his political headquarters.\n\nHow much of this approach is window dressing, rather than a genuine break from his party\u2019s past, remains hazy.\n\nThat murkiness was on display Sunday afternoon, when during a brief news conference, Mr. Bush declared that it was unnecessary to spend $1 billion on a presidential campaign, a figure exceeded by both the Democratic and Republican nominees in 2012. But Mr. Bush may have found a creative way to achieve that goal without reducing the perceived problem of campaigns awash in secret cash from a handful of ultra-wealthy donors.\n\nMr. Bush has acted more aggressively than perhaps any presidential candidate to raise money for a \u201csuper PAC\u201d and a related political nonprofit group run by close aides. In effect, Mr. Bush is offloading major costs of his likely campaign to groups that can raise and spend unlimited money.\n\nAnd while the hotel that Mr. Bush selected for his donor conference might double as an Earth Day convention space, he remains skeptical of how much climate change is caused by humans. \u201cIt is not unanimous among scientists that it is disproportionately man-made,\u201d he said this month in New Hampshire.\n\nBut it was hard to ignore the symbolism on display here. The location of the event itself was intriguing: South Beach, a strip of beach long synonymous with gay life in Miami. On Saturday night, hand-holding gay couples walked through the lobby of the 1 Hotel.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, Mr. Bush had lunch at South Beach\u2019s Burger & Beer Joint. Mr. Strangie, a longtime drag queen, was entrusted with drawing up a no-carb menu for him.. When the restaurant attempted to endear itself to Mr. Bush with a free order of beer-battered onion rings, Mr. Bush eyed them warily, declared \u201cWhoa!\u201d and pushed them off to the side.\n\nAfter the meal, Mr. Strangie offered an unvarnished review of his patron.\n\n\u201cGood tipper,\u201d he said. \u201cTwenty-five percent.\u201d\n\nHe said he had nothing against Mr. Bush, but was drawn to Ms. Clinton\u2019s work on health care when her husband was president.\n\n\u201cHealthwise, she has my back,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Strangie said his career as a local celebrity drag queen has wound down after a fevered few decades when he was earning up to $4,000 a week.\n\nDrag today, he said, \u201cis a young man\u2019s game.\u201d\n\nMr. Strangie said that aides to Mr. Bush did not inform him ahead of time about which V.I.P. needed a Paleo-diet-compliant burger without a bun. But he figured it out. \u201cI don\u2019t live under a rock,\u201d he said.\u00a0", "byline": "MICHAEL BARBARO", "description": "In his inaugural gathering of major donors for a widely expected presidential run, Jeb Bush displayed an unconventional approach that busted many Republican stereotypes.", "title": "Jeb Bush\u2019s Anticipated Campaign Embraces South Florida Style", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/27/us/politics/jeb-bushs-anticipated-campaign-embraces-south-florida-style.html", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "personality", "economy"], "people": ["Brooks Brothers", "Jeb Bush", "Andy Warhol", "Tommy Strangie"], "orgs": ["V.I.P.", "PAC"], "authors": [{"author_id": 316, "fullname": "michael barbaro", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-04-27 02:00:20", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "539e499374b617ded4c9c7551b334410", "date_access": "2015-04-27 01:15:10.850977"}
