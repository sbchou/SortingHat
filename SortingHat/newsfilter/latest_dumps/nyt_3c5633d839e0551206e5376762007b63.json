{"body": "I\u2019ve written a number of pieces and posts on how the Donald Trump phenomenon could represent the irruption of something genuinely interesting\u00a0into Republican politics, with his public promises to be a middle class tax cutter who soaks \u201cthe hedge fund guys\u201d as an exhibit in that case: They\u2019ve seemed like a sign that his populism, with its mix of\u00a0Perotism, Buchananism, and the European nationalist right, would actually challenge the existing conservative-movement policy architecture\u00a0head-on.\n\nBut now we actually have a Trump tax plan, and despite his big populist talk it\u2019s actually rather\u00a0boring and predictable and (by G.O.P. standards) safe. It has some\u00a0populist elements and nationalist flourishes, but overall it\u2019s just another rate-lowering, loophole-closing reform in the style of Mitt Romney 2012 or Jeb Bush 2016, with the characteristically-implausible\u00a0promises of revenue neutrality and the typical distributional effects that you get when you promise sweeping rate reductions for the rich. (My colleague Josh Barro has a good write-up here.) As such, it\u2019s considerably less interesting and innovative than\u00a0Marco Rubio and Mike Lee\u2019s\u00a0tax plan, which for all its flaws does represent\u00a0a real\u00a0priority shift toward middle-class\u00a0parents\u00a0and away from the \u201clower the top bracket at all costs\u201d spirit, and whose supply-side elements (investment tax cuts, above all) are arguably\u00a0more pro-growth than the income-tax rate lowering that Trump prioritizes instead.\n\nOverall, Grover Norquist\u2019s description of Trump\u2019s plan as \u201cdead-center Reagan Republican tax thinking\u201d seems apt, at least if by \u201cReagan Republican\u201d you mean the version of Reaganism (the real version was more complicated) that\u2019s become right-wing orthodoxy since. There\u2019s not much new here, not much to concern the party\u2019s donor class, not much to unsettle its ideological enforcers. After all his huffing and puffing, Trump has delivered, if you\u2019ll pardon the phrase, a remarkably low-energy blueprint.\n\nAs one of the reform conservatives who have been, thus far, cautiously anti-anti-Trump, I suppose I\u2019m a little relieved that a figure as grotesque as the Donald\u00a0hasn\u2019t come out with\u00a0my favorite G.O.P. tax plan of the cycle. But I\u2019m also disappointed, since it lowers the odds that Trump\u2019s populism will significant disrupt the Republican Party\u2019s\u00a0habits of mind (at least in the way I think they ought to be disrupted!), and it shoves the Trump phenomenon more in the direction of the light-on-policy white-identity politics that his harshest critics, libertarian and liberal, have identified as the essential element of his appeal.\n\nI think those critiques have been, overall, too narrow in their analysis of why Trump\u2019s rhetoric has resonated, and why he\u2019s been able to draw support from\u00a0more moderate Republican voters\u00a0as well as the party\u2019s rightward flank; as I\u2019ve said before, I think there\u2019s a legitimate class-revolt element\u00a0at work in Trump\u2019s support, albeit one that deserves a better tribune than the Donald.\n\nBut if his economic plan is just Romneyism with wilder growth assumptions and some bluster about raising his own taxes\u00a0thrown in, then\u00a0he\u2019s\u00a0shifting back into a more predictable lane, and ceding a lot of the territory that a more thoroughgoingly populist right-wing candidate could hope to claim. Maybe someone else will claim it; maybe we\u2019ll get a third party candidate in this space at some point soon. But Trump himself just got a lot less interesting, and a lot more purely\u00a0toxic, than he might otherwise have been.", "byline": "ROSS DOUTHAT", "description": "The Donald turns out to be a lot less populist (and interesting) than his rhetoric suggested.", "title": "Ross Douthat: Donald Trump\u2019s Low Energy Tax Plan", "url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/donald-trumps-boring-tax-plan/", "topics": ["economy"], "people": ["Mitt Romney", "Jeb Bush", "Mike Lee", "Grover Norquist", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Ross Douthat", "Josh Barro"], "orgs": ["Republican Party"], "authors": [{"author_id": 1705, "fullname": "ross douthat", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-09-29 16:15:31", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "3c5633d839e0551206e5376762007b63", "date_access": "2015-09-29 15:41:33.429883"}
