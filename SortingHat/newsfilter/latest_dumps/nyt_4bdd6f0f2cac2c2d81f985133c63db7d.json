{"body": "Very little appears to link Jeremy Corbyn, who has emerged from nowhere to become the favorite to lead the British Labour Party, with Donald Trump, the equally surprising front-runner for the Republican nomination.\n\nCorbyn is a slight, quiet, parsimonious radical leftist who is anti-money, anti-meat, anti-war and pro-nationalization of banks. He has, to put it mildly, deep misgivings about America. Trump is a large, loud, self-promoting businessman who is pro-money, pro-market and wants to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d by unleashing its animal entrepreneurial spirit and putting the red meat back in political discourse clogged by political correctness. He has spoken approvingly of John Bolton, hawk of neocon hawks among Republican foreign policy officials.\n\nBut the two men do have a couple of things in common. Both opposed the Iraq war (Trump thought Mexico might be a more sensible target). More importantly, both speak their minds at a time when a lot of people in Britain and the United States have had it with politics as usual and the mealy-mouthed, finger-to-the-wind calibration of the political persona.\n\nRupert Murdoch recently tweeted that Corbyn would probably triumph in the Labour Party leadership election for this reason: \u201cCorbyn increasingly likely Labor winner. Seems only candidate who believes anything, right or wrong.\u201d The result is to be announced Sept. 12 (elections in Britain are not multiyear affairs as in the United States).\n\nThis is a season of radical discontent. People believe the system is rigged. They have good reason. Rigged to favor the super-rich, rigged to accentuate inequality, rigged to hide huge increases in the cost of living, rigged to buy elections, rigged to put off retirement, rigged to eviscerate pensions, rigged to export jobs, rigged to sabotage equal opportunity, rigged to hurt the middle class and minorities and the poor. Increasingly unequal societies have spawned anger, an unsurprising development. The anger is diffuse, in search of somebody to articulate it, preferably in short declarative sentences.\n\nIt\u2019s the same anger, in many respects, that produced the leftist Syriza government in Greece and the rise of the rightist National Front in France. Enter Corbyn and Trump and, of course, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\nCorbyn has been described as \u201cattractive in a world-weary old sea-dog sort of way.\u201d He\u2019s against everything Tony Blair stood for: the slick, centrist makeover of the Labour Party that allowed it to win election after election, and also allowed Peter Mandelson, a guru of New Labour, to declare that he was \u201cintensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich.\u201d Corbyn wants to go back to socialism. So does Sanders, a socialist in America who is drawing huge crowds.\n\nAs my colleague Jason Horowitz wrote of Sanders: \u201cFor someone who has always had a sweepingly macro, if not entirely Marxist, critique of America, having the largest crowds of the election cheering each description of income inequality, and each proposal to eradicate it, amounts to the validation of a career spent in relative obscurity. Mr. Sanders\u2019s grumpy demeanor, his outsider status and his suspicion of all things \u2018feel good\u2019 are part of the attraction.\u201d\n\nOn both sides of the Atlantic, grumpy is good in politics. Outsider is good. Plain talk is good. Trump\u2019s \u201cDeal with it,\u201d is the phrase du jour.\n\nSanders wants to expand Social Security, take America to a single-payer European-style national health system, invest massively to restore America\u2019s crumbling infrastructure, make public college tuition free, get rid of \u201cstarvation wages\u201d for workers, tax Wall Street trading, end America\u2019s wars, and break up banks that are too big to fail.\n\nHis message is important. It\u2019s resonating because it precisely reflects the current unease. Hillary Clinton cannot ignore it.\n\nTrump is not going away. His base of support is broad. America always wants to dream of some riveting reinvention; he\u2019s captured that longing for now. In polls of Republicans he leads among women, despite his denigration of them; he leads among evangelical Christians; and he leads among the college-educated, not an obvious constituency for his populist anti-immigrant message. He has people nodding their heads, as when he calls his rival Jeb Bush a \u201clow-energy\u201d guy.\n\nCorbyn, however, may well be the only one of the three outsiders who wins anything. He\u2019s likely to be the next Labour leader. That would be a disaster.\n\nHe has almost no support among Labour members of Parliament; no experience of running anything; has called Hamas and Hezbollah \u201cour friends\u201d (but says he was misunderstood); forgot (before remembering) that he\u2019s socialized with a Lebanese extremist who called 9/11 \u201csweet revenge\u201d and has since been banned from Britain; wants Britain out of NATO; and has a European leftist\u2019s de rigueur view of America as the source of the world\u2019s problems. If he\u2019s chosen, Labour could disintegrate. It certainly won\u2019t win an election.\n\nBut Corbynmania shows no sign of abating. It\u2019s a new season in politics.
