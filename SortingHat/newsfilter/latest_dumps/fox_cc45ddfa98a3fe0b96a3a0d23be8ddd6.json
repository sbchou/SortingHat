I figured the campaign chairman was just offering the we-take-no-vote-for-granted refrain, given that no candidate wants to be seen as taking a race for granted.\nNow, however, the rumblings are growing louder. But are they real?\nThe Hill declares that \u201cit may be time for Hillary Clinton to take the challenge from Sen. Bernie Sanders more seriously.\n\u201cSanders is surging in the race for the party\u2019s presidential nomination.\"\n\nBut there\u2019s a risk in Hillary attacking the Vermont socialist head on, the paper says: \u201cDoing so could rally his supporters, alienate liberals the Democratic nominee will need in the fall of 2016 and elevate Sanders as a challenger.\u201d\nRepublican pollster Glen Bolger, according to Roll Call, \u201cmade a bold prediction that Clinton would not win the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary.\u201d\nAnd after Sanders wins the first caucuses and the first primary, \u201cthen Democratic primary voters will go, \u2018Oh my God, what are we doing here?\u2019\u201d\nExcept that, as the lead sentence noted, Bolger still believes that Hillary \u201cis almost certain to be the Democratic nominee,\u201d and he later told the paper he\u2019d just been making a \u201cbold, fun prediction.\u201d\nThe most dramatic statement comes in this Salon headline: \u201cHillary Is Going to Lose.\u201d\nExcept that turns out to be clickbait. Author Bill Curry, a former Clinton White House counselor, doesn\u2019t go that far:\n\u201cDemocratic elites don\u2019t want to hear it but Hillary Clinton\u2019s in trouble ... Bernie Sanders is the only candidate in either party who seems to feel the tectonic plates of our politics shifting, perhaps because he\u2019s expected the change for so long. His is still an improbable candidacy, but less improbable than it was a month or even a week ago.\u201d\nAll right, so this is mostly preseason stuff, like sportswriters chewing the fat over who\u2019s the favorite for the 2016 Super Bowl. But there\u2019s no question that Sanders is drawing large crowds\u2014more than 5,000 at the University of Denver over the weekend--and has some momentum. He hits the right notes for liberal Democrats who don\u2019t like Wall Street, big corporations or Barack Obama\u2019s trade deal. A classic protest candidate\u2014unless it turns out he\u2019s more than that.\nIs Hillaryland adjusting? Democratic strategist Maria Cardona said of Sanders on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d:\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be surprised that there is so much enthusiasm for him, and in fact, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised if he does very well in New Hampshire or in Iowa and perhaps even wins. I think this is good for the Democratic Party \u2026 As a Hillary supporter, I think she will be the nominee, but she will be that much better of a nominee and that much better of a general election candidate because of Bernie.\u201d\nThis smells like lowering expectations, as host Jon Karl noted.\nSanders did raise $1.5 million in the 24 hours after he launched, more than several Republican candidates. And the senator, from a neighboring state, is trailing Hillary by just 41 to 31 percent in one New Hampshire poll. (Keep in mind that Gene McCarthy knocked LBJ out of the race in 1968 with 41.9 percent of the vote to Johnson\u2019s 49.6 percent, in a vastly different situation.)\nLots of successful candidates have lost Iowa but won their party\u2019s nomination. Losing the first two states would be an earthquake.\nI still think this is mainly media hot air, something to match the 90-plus temperatures here inside the Beltway.\nIn fact, in a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll out last night, Hillary leads Bernie among Democrats by a humongous margin, 75 to 15 percent (and holds an 8-point lead over Jeb Bush). But the same survey shows 62 percent of Democrats want her to have a challenging primary.\nThat would include 100 percent of the media. But it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to happen.\nClick for more from Media Buzz\nmedia-buzz\n\nMedia Buzz, hosted by Howard Kurtz, airs on Sundays at 11AM and 5PM ET on Fox News Channel.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this show\n\n\n\n", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "MEDIA BUZZ: The mini-panic over Bernie Sanders - Bon Jovi, Lady Gaga headline Hillary fundraising spree - VIDEO: Is Sanders a threat to Clinton's 2016 nomination?  - Candidates, parties map out social media campaigns in attempt to reach Latino voters", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/23/hillarys-hurting-hillary-could-lose-medias-mini-panic-over-bernie-sanders/", "topics": ["trade"], "people": ["Howard Kurtz", "Jeb Bush", "Glen Bolger", "Hillary Clinton", "Lady Gaga", "Barack Obama", "Maria Cardona", "Bon Jovi", "Bill Curry", "Bernie Sanders", "John Podesta", "Jon Karl"], "orgs": ["Democratic Party", "LBJ", "University of Denver", "Beltway"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-06-23 10:38:07", "org": "fox", "article_id": "cc45ddfa98a3fe0b96a3a0d23be8ddd6", "date_access": "2015-06-23 09:56:48.495887"}
