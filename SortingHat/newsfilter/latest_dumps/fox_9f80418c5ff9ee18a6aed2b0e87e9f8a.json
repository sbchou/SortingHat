The rest, they say, goes mostly to salaries, benefits, travel and fund-raising.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThat claim is demonstrably false, and it is false not according to some partisan spin on the numbers, but because the organization\u2019s own tax filings contradict the claim,\u201d said Sean Davis, co-founder of The Federalist, a conservative online magazine.\n\nThe foundation, originally called the Clinton Global Initiative, has come under close scrutiny as Hillary Clinton prepares for a presidential run. Revelations in the soon-to-be-released book, \u201cClinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich,\u201d by Peter Schweizer, have spurred numerous media investigations into the relationship between Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as Secretary of State, the foundation\u2019s solicitation of foreign money and the ex-president\u2019s lucrative speaking engagements around the world.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like another out-of-control family affair.\u201d- Reg Baker, CPA and board member of non profit organizations\n\nClinton spokesman Brian Fallon defended the charity's work in Africa and elsewhere and said in a statement there isn\u2019t \u201ca shred of evidence\u201d that Hillary Clinton did anything to benefit Clinton Foundation donors while in office.\n\nThe foundation raised $144.3 million \u2013 and spent $84.7 million in 2013 \u2013 allocating $8.8 million to grants for other organizations, Davis said. The Clinton Foundation\u2019s own IRS tax filings show the organization spent $8.5 million, or 10 percent of all 2013 expenditures, on travel, and another $4.8 million -- or 5.6 percent of all expenditures -- on office supplies, Davis said, questioning whether plane tickets, hotel accommodations, ink cartridges and staplers \u201cdirectly change lives.\u201d\n\nOrganizations that rate charities on their effectiveness in spending donations on the causes they champion say gauging the Clinton Foundation is difficult, but they have raised flags.\n\nCharityNavigator.org added the Clinton Foundation to its \u201cwatchlist,\u201d noting the organization officials \u201chad previously evaluated this organization, but have since determined that this charity's atypical business model cannot be accurately captured in our current rating methodology.\u201d\n\nWhile maintaining its removal of The Clinton Foundation from its website is \u201cneither a condemnation nor an endorsement of this charity,\u201d the Clinton Foundation is one of only 23 charities on the watchlist.\n\nAnother charity rating organization, GiveWell, said the Clinton Health Access Initiative declined in November 2012 to participate in its review process, and hasn\u2019t since. The Clinton Health Access Initiative in 2008 and 2009 acted as a drug distribution powerhouse, purchasing $226 million in prescription drugs at a discount to distribute worldwide, a practice ended by 2012.\n\nIn 2012, the Better Business Bureau reported the Clinton Foundation did not meet the standards of an accountable charity, failing on six counts, largely because of a lack of transparent financial reporting. According to the Better Business Bureau website, the charity is again under review and a new report will be released soon.\n\nSome of the financial reporting can be messy to follow, in part because the Clintons created separate entities, such as the Clinton Health Access Initiative, the Haiti relief initiative, Clinton Global Initiative, the Clinton Presidential Center and the Clinton Climate Initiative.\n\nWhile IRS filings show the Clintons do not receive a salary, compensation comes through other means, such as travel, speaking fees and consulting contracts.\n\nAs first noted by Politico, the organization\u2019s 990 forms show travel costs for the Clinton Foundation more than doubled in 2013 to $8.448 million largely because of \u201cextraordinary security and other requirements\u201d for the Clintons.\n\nRelated ImageExpand / ContractThe Clintons don't draw salaries from their family foundation, but critics say they benefit in other ways. (AP)\n\nSchweizer\u2019s book explores one way the foundation brought in money from donors who had business before the State Department, Fox News Channel reported. The charity accepted millions of dollars from the head of Uranium One, and a firm promoting its stock, while the Russians sought approval from U.S. agencies, including the State Department, to take over the company.\u00a0The deal had to be approved by the State Department headed by Hillary Clinton because the sale gave the Russians control of 20 percent of the uranium production in the U.S.\u00a0\n\nDuring negotiations, Uranium One's chairman donated $2.3 million to the Clinton Foundation. Bill Clinton also reportedly received $500,000 from a Russian firm promoting the company's stocks,\u00a0for a speech in Moscow.\u00a0None of these transactions appear in Clinton Foundation disclosures.\n\nA separate investigation by government watchdog group Judicial Watch revealed Bill Clinton earned $48 million from 215 speeches he made while his wife headed the State Department, and State Department officials, who were charged with flagging conflicts and ethics concerns, did not object.\n\nA Washington Post investigation revealed Bill Clinton\u2019s earnings for speeches were closer to $100 million.\n\nIn another controversial deal, Canadian mining executive Stephen Dattels donated 2 million shares of the company Polo Resources to the Clinton Foundation, which the foundation did not disclose, and weeks later, America\u2019s Bangladesh ambassador reportedly used political influence to convince the Bangladesh prime minister to approve open pit mining there, boosting Polo Resources\u2019 profits, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cIt seems like the Clinton Foundation operates as a slush fund for the Clintons,\u201d Bill Allison, a senior fellow at the government watchdog group, Sunlight Foundation, told the New York Post.\n\nReg Baker, a certified public accountant who has offices in Hawaii and Las Vegas and has served on several non-profit boards, told FoxNews.com the foundation is not run like most charities.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like another out-of-control family affair,\u201d Baker said. \u201cIt is totally out of sync with charitable organizations' best practices.\u201d\n\nThe 2014 fundraising numbers for the Clinton Foundation have not been released publicly yet, but the amount raised is likely to increase.\n\nIn 2008, the Clinton Foundation raised $188.2 million, and that revenue spiked to $249 million in 2009. In 2010, while Hillary Clinton headed the State Department, the foundation\u2019s revenue dropped to $140 million in 2010, $56.3 million in 2011, and $51.5 million in 2012. Since she\u2019s returned, the foundation\u2019s revenue jumped back up to $144.4 million, Davis noted.\n\nAfter a barrage of investigative reports across a wide variety of media highlighting the foundation\u2019s lack of transparency and disclosure, including during Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state, the Clinton Foundation announced last week it will amend its tax returns for the last five years.", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "FUNNY MONEY?
