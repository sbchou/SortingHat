Rick Perry\u2019s view on the topic.\n\nAs Bush upheld his position on higher education standards, he also told the crowd that the \u201cfederal government has no role in the creation of standards\u201d and said the government should not dictate what is taught in schools.\n\n\u201cThe role of the federal government, if any, is to create more school choice,\u201d he said to a cheering crowd.\n\nPrior to Bush\u2019s speech, there had been some talk of a walk-out. The National Review reported seeing \u201cscores\u201d of CPAC attendees leaving as soon as Bush began speaking with protesters reportedly chanting \u201cUSA, USA.\u201d\n\nDemocratic National Committee spokesman Ian Sams said Bush\u2019s speech was just more of the same.\n\n\u201cJeb Bush isn\u2019t a new type of Republican, and he certainly isn\u2019t looking out for everyday people in America,\u201d Sams said in a written statement. \u201cInstead, he\u2019s the same Jeb Bush who, as governor, supported slashing funding for urban schools and higher education, while giving massive tax cuts to the wealthy and big corporations. Bush may say he can bring Latino voters into the GOP fold, but with priorities like these, that\u2019s really hard to imagine.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, Duck Dynasty\u2019s Phil Robertson strode onstage to give the conservative crowd a spirited history lesson, which included quotes from and about President John Adams and a lengthy warning about sexually transmitted illnesses.\n\nRobertson\u2019s unconventional speech was among the most well-received at CPAC.\n\nThe patriarch of the \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d franchise was also on hand to receive the \u201cAndrew Breitbart Defender of the First Amendment Award\u201d at the event. During his acceptance speech, he launched into a lengthy monologue about morals, responding to criticism that he was too religious by telling the crowd, \"I'm trying to help you, for crying out loud, America!\"\n\n\u201cYou lose your religion, according to John Adams, and there goes your morality,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there. I hate to admit I got my facts from the CDC the day before yesterday -- 110 million, 110 million Americans now have a sexually transmitted illness.\u201d\n\nRobertson, whose walked on stage dressed down in a dark shirt and bandana, pulled out the Bible and read a passage from it. He exited the stage just as dramatically as he entered it.\n\nHe saluted the crowd and said in his signature dry tone, \u201cGod help us.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, former Texas Gov. Perry, declaring \"our leadership is failing,\" told the crowd that the country needs to do a better job securing the border and fighting terror groups like the Islamic State -- but assured the audience \"we will survive the Obama years.\"\n\nPerry, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, said he was there \u201cto speak plainly about the times we live in\u201d and said the country \u201chas entered a time of testing and our leadership is failing.\u201d\n\nPerry also called out Obama for comments he said have been less than truthful.\n\n\u201cThe president declared that the advancement of ISIS has been stopped and that is not true,\u201d Perry said. \u201cHe is wrong. To deny the nature of the threat and to downplay it is na\u00efve and misguided. That\u2019s the worst threat to freedom since communism.\u201d\n\nPerry also took on the topic of immigration. Perry said when the administration deals with immigration \u201cpeople literally die.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to deal with this issue last summer when there were literally tens of thousands of people showing up [at the border], \u201c he said. \u201cThe country was being impacted by it.\u201d\n\nPerry was among a handful of Republican presidential hopefuls courting the conservative crowd at this year\u2019s conference.\n\nAs a parting shot, Perry told the crowd, \u201cWe survived Depression, we even survived Jimmy Carter and we will survive the Obama years too!\u201d\n\nAlso making waves Friday morning at CPAC was Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.\n\nRubio used his time to target Obama\u2019s foreign policies, focusing mostly on Iran\u2019s nuclear threat. During his speech, Rubio said America needed a leader who understands that the way to defeat the Islamic State \u201cwasn\u2019t to give him a job,\u201d referencing comments made by State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf who suggested a way to fight the Islamic State was by creating jobs and economic opportunity.\n\nRubio also said negotiations between the Obama administration and Iran\u2019s leaders to curb Tehran\u2019s nuclear program were \u201cfoolish\u201d and said the U.S. should leave no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind that it fully backs Israel.\n\nRubio also blamed Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s foreign policies for weakening America\u2019s standing on the world\u2019s stage.\n\n\u201cBecause of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy, our allies no longer trust us and our enemies no longer fear us,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nMeanwhile, former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton told reporters he\u2019s considering a presidential run of his own and said those in the crowd were once again focusing on global threats.\n\nRep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., is scheduled to speak on Saturday \u2013 the final day of the three-day conference.\n\n\u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Jeb Bush stands firm on controversial immigration, education policies at CPAC - FOX NEWS FIRST: High wire act for Jeb", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/27/perry-rubio-highlight-islamic-state-threats-immigration-in-fiery-speeches-at/", "topics": ["terrorism", "immigration"], "people": ["Phil Robertson", "John Adams", "John Bolton", "Jeb Bush", "Rick Perry", "Marie Harf", "Marco Rubio", "Ian Sams", "Hillary Clinton", "Duck Dynasty", "Andrew Breitbart", "Jimmy Carter"], "orgs": ["CDC", "State Department", "National Review", "Democratic National Committee", "GOP", "United Nations"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-02-28 06:33:45", "org": "fox", "article_id": "4813f4e4092e125bf9434c62e7ed2867", "date_access": "2015-02-28 07:27:34.057415"}
