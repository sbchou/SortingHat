(Jim Cole/AP)  MANCHESTER, N.H. -- An energized Hillary Rodham Clinton didn't sound at all\u00a0like a presidential candidate losing ground as she delivered a rousing speech here Saturday to the\u00a0state Democratic convention, casting herself as\u00a0a candidate prepared to fight for solutions to a wide array of problems confronting\u00a0the middle class. \u201cIf you want a president\u00a0who will tell\u00a0you \u00a0everything that\u2019s wrong with America and who to blame for it, you\u2019ve got plenty of other choices,\" Clinton told a crowd of more than 4,000 delegates and guests. \u00a0\u201cIf you want a president who will listen to you and work her heart out to make a better and fairer country, \u00a0then you\u2019re looking at her.\u201d Clinton's appearance at the convention capped off a three-day swing through New Hampshire, where a string of recent polls have showed her\u00a0trailing Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont who's call for\u00a0economic justice has fueled his rapid rise in the nation's first presidential primary state. [As worries rise, Hillary Clinton camp says stick to the plan] Clinton's speech on Saturday echoed some of the same themes Sanders has been hitting on the campaign trail, including a pledge to reform the tax code so that \"everyone pay their fare share.\" \u201cI\u2019m sick of multi-millionaires\u00a0paying\u00a0a lower tax rate than a teacher or a nurse,\" Clinton told a crowd in which many wore T-shirts and held placards adverting their allegiances to Clinton or Sanders. But Clinton pledged action on a far wider range of issues, for example touting her commitment\u00a0to addressing a heroin overdose epidemic that has hit New Hampshire particularly hard -- an issue she said she never intended to make a centerpiece of her campaign. \u201cI want to be the president who takes on the big challenges,\" Clinton said, \"but I also want to be the president who keeps listening.\u201d [How Bernie Sanders is plotting his path to the Democratic nomination] Clinton, who didn't mention any of her Democratic rivals by name, directed several barbs at Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, whom she accused of \"trafficking in prejudice and paranoia throughout this campaign.\u201d Clinton mocked Trump's statements that he \"cherishes women.\" \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stop cherishing women and start respecting women?\u201d Clinton said to the delight of the crowd. Following her address, Clinton could be seen dancing with supporters along the rope line that separated her from the crowd.
