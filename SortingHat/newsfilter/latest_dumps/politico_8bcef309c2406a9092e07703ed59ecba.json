A September survey had Trump at 27 percent, and Carson at 21 percent. \nStory Continued Below\nAlso scoring a boost \u2014 Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who comes in at third with 13 percent, after attracting only 5 percent support in last month's poll. Following Rubio in the most recent survey was Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul with 6 percent and Carly Fiorina and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush both with 5 percent. All other candidates are under 3 percent.\nThe strong showing from Carson, who has gotten accolades for his debate performance and campaign style despite tossing out some inflammatory comments about Muslims and mass shootings, comes in part from his support from women, who back Carson 33 percent to Trump's 13 percent.\nCarson also has \u201calmost unheard of\u201d favorability numbers according to Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.\n\u201cThose who know Carson seem to like him. He has an almost unheard of 84 \u2013 10 percent favorability rating among likely Republican Caucus-goers, compared to Trump\u2019s 53 \u2013 43 percent rating. To borrow the line from Madison Avenue, \u2018Almost no one doesn\u2019t like Ben Carson,\u2019\u201d Brown said.\nWhile Carson and Trump have been jockeying for support from evangelical voters, Carson received 36 percent of the vote from white, evangelical Christians \u2014 double Trump\u2019s 17 percent.\nAnd while Trump may sit towards the top of the poll, 30 percent of voters said they \u201cwould definitely not support\u201d the businessman. Bush comes in second as a no-support candidate with 21 percent.\nA candidate who shares their values is most important to 28 percent of caucus-goers, 23 percent think being honest and trustworthy is key. \nBut Carson doesn\u2019t have to worry about which quality is more important because 84 percent of those polled said he shares their values and 89 percent felt he was honest and trustworthy. He also topped other candidates when it came to caring about voters' needs and problems \u2014 87 percent felt he did.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Ben Carson\u2019s turn in the spotlight,\u201d Brown said.\nThe poll of 574 likely Iowa Republican caucus-goers took place Oct. 14-20 via land lines and cell phones. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Carson surges past Trump in Iowa poll", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/carson-trump-iowa-quinnipiac-gop-poll-1022-215029", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Don Beyer", "Jack Dorsey", "Jesse Rifkin", "Rachael Bade", "Henry C.
