{"body": "Nashua, New Hampshire (CNN)It's come to this. How much time has Rand Paul spent practicing his Donald Trump impression? \nAt a Wednesday night town hall campaign stop, Paul unveiled his impression of the GOP presidential opponent while slamming him for buying access to politicians and taking Democratic positions on issues such as Obamacare and bank bailouts. \n\"We have now people up there who say such profound things as, 'You're stupid, you're fired, you're a pig, you look terrible, you only have half a brain,' and then when you respond with an argument it's like \"You're stupid,'\" Paul said. \n\"My favorite is, 'You know the reason I tell women they're ugly is I'm so good-looking, everybody knows I'm good-looking, right?'\" Paul continued, with laughter from the crowd. \"Another one is, \"You know I must be smart, I'm rich.\"\nThe comments follow a digital ad released earlier in the day by Paul's campaign that contrasts Trump's past statements supporting Hillary Clinton and Democrats with Paul, who has positioned himself as a libertarian reformer, scaling back large government in Washington and championing tea party values. \n\"You may have noticed that the presidential debate has gotten kind of foolish. All right I'm all for levity, I'm all for humor but I think reality TV and the presidential election should be separate,\" Paul said at the event in Nashua. \"We have to have an argument in our country, we have to have a discussion. I don't know, does he want government to be bigger or smaller? Does he want taxes to be higher or lower? Is he for Obamacare or against it? He's been both.\"\nRecent polls have shown disappointing numbers for Paul in early-voting states and nationally, while his fundraising has stalled out. Meanwhile, Trump has continued to enjoy front-runner status in the 2016 race even as pundits say he is too controversial. \nLast week's Thursday debate showed a new side of Paul, one where he attacked Trump head on. That same strategy has been on display on the campaign trail in New Hampshire this week. \n\"Here's what gets me. People say, oh, we're going to have a truth teller, Trump's a truth teller because he calls people fat and stupid and ugly. But here's the problem with that. He's given $1.5 million to candidates to both parties. When you ask him, though, this is the crassness, this is what's wrong with government, what's wrong with out country, what's wrong with Washington,\" Paul said. \"He paid the Clintons a hundred grand for access, got them to come to a wedding, I'm guessing there's more involved. But the thing is that's what's wrong with Washington -- buying and selling access. It's despicable that Clinton will sell access and that's she's enriched herself on her government service. But isn't it equally despicable for the person who's buying the access?\"\nAfter the release of Paul's digital ad, Trump said on CNN that tea party voters support him and that the issues Paul has brought up are in the past. At the same time, Trump admitted that the ability to buy access to politicians is not necessarily good for the country. \n\"I don't think it's a great thing for the United States. I'm not sure the system should work that way. But as a businessman, I did what other businessman did, and I contributed to everybody. Everybody liked me, everybody took my call.\" Trump said. \nTrump attacked Paul on CNN and said he had made a \"significant donation\" to an eye center Paul is affiliated with. Trump  argued that Paul's positions on the military, Israel and veterans are \"weak\" and called for him to drop out of the race. \n\"Senator Paul has no chance of wining the nomination and the people of Kentucky should not allow him the privilege of remaining their senator. Rand should save his lobbyist's and special interest money and just go quietly home,\" Trump said in the statement. \"Rand's campaign is a total mess, and as a matter of fact, I didn't know he had anybody left in his campaign to make commercials who are not currently under indictment!\" This was a reference to several senior officials for Paul's super PAC who were indicted on federal charges of conspiracy and falsifying campaign records.\n", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Rand Paul pulls out his Trump impression", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/12/politics/rand-paul-donald-trump-impression/index.html", "topics": ["women"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Donald Trump", "Hillary Clinton"], "orgs": ["Clintons", "PAC", "GOP", "United States."], "authors": [{"author_id": 2557, "fullname": "cassie spodak", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-08-13 03:42:17", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "719795fd15ab9f94938a553496336a1f", "date_access": "2015-08-13 03:10:07.337967"}
