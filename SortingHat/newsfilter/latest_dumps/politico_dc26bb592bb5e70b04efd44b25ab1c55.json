This time, it's 67 percent. Republicans, whose approval of the court hit a record low in July at 18 percent, saw their share of approval climb slightly to 26 percent in the latest survey.\nThe court is expected to take up a variety of hot-button issues this session, including cases pertaining to capital punishment, affirmative action and redistricting.\nThe poll was conducted Sept. 9-13 via telephone, surveying 1,025 adults nationwide with an overall margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Poll: Disapproval of Supreme Court reaches new high", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/poll-supreme-court-approval-rating-214363", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Trevor Noah", "Kim Davis", "Robert B.
