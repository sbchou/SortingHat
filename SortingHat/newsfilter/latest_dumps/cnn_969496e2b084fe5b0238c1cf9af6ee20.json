{"body": "Washington (CNN)The remaining campaign funds for Beau Biden's potential run for governor of Delaware will be donated to the newly formed charity in his name, an aide to the family said Wednesday.\nBiden, the son of Vice President Joe Biden, died late last month from brain cancer at the age of 46. He had served two terms as Delaware's attorney general, and although he was not an announced candidate for governor, he was widely expected to seek the office in 2016.\nAs of Dec. 31, 2014, the balance for two groups associated with Beau Biden, Biden for Delaware and Beau PAC Inc., totaled nearly $660,000. It was not immediately clear how much will end up being transferred to the Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of Children, as some bills still need to be paid, the aide said.\nOn Wednesday, Biden's widow, Hallie Biden, released a statement.\n\"The campaign money will be used to continue the work Beau loved most -- protecting children -- and the natural place to do that is the foundation,\" she said.\nWednesday was Joe Biden's first day back at work after Beau's death on May 30.\nCNN's Sophia Tatum contributed to this report.", "byline": "", "description": "\n    \n", "title": "Beau Biden campaign funds to be donated to charity", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/10/politics/beau-biden-campaign-funds-charity/index.html", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Joe Biden", "Beau Biden"], "orgs": [], "authors": [{"author_id": 22912, "fullname": "sunlen serfaty", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-06-10 18:35:10", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "969496e2b084fe5b0238c1cf9af6ee20", "date_access": "2015-06-10 17:46:01.834338"}
