John Kasich is picking up the endorsement of former New Hampshire senator Gordon J. Humphrey on Friday.\nThe endorsement further illustrates Kasich's hard push in New Hampshire, and his efforts to secure a strong lead over rival Jeb Bush there. The RealClearPolitics average finds Kasich polling in fourth place in the state, behind Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina. Bush is in fifth place with an average of 7.7 percent support, to Kasich's 9 percent.\nStory Continued Below\nAt the press conference Kasich took a jab at the former Florida governor when asked about Bush opposition researchers going through old Kasich files in Ohio. \n\"I would think they're in there because they're getting nervous. When you're trailing in places like New Hampshire where [New Hampshire Kasich chairman] John Sununu is building a great team and you're not doing so hot in other places of course they're going to go looking around at who might be the mature adult who knows how to fix things \u2014 and be a leader rather than an administrator,\" Kasich said. \n\n\n\n            By \nBen Schreckinger\n\nHumphrey is a two-term senator who in August said he was \"leaning\" toward endorsing Kasich for president, saying the Ohio Republican and 2016 presidential candidate is \"Reaganesque.\"\n\u201cI\u2018ve known John Kasich since our time together in Congress. I greatly admired and liked him then, and my admiration has only grown during his highly acclaimed five years as Governor of our nation\u2019s seventh-largest state. I can sum up John Kasich in three Cs. Character. Conservative principles. Competence and experience I completely trust. Impressive as the other candidates may be, no other candidate can match John Kasich,\" Humphrey said in a statement. \nThe endorsement came in Concord, New Hampshire, on Friday morning. \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Kasich picks up endorsement of former N.H. senator Humphrey", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/john-kasich-endorsed-by-gordon-humphrey-214372", "topics": ["immigration", "personality"], "people": ["Trevor Noah", "Kim Davis", "Helena Bottemiller Evich", "Elena Schneider", "Hadas Gold", "Gordon J.
