But he has clamped down hard on media access.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT\n\nKind of like, well, that other person who is running on the Democratic side.\n\nHey, maybe some candidates don\u2019t need the press to run for president, at least at this early stage.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to figure out why Walker might be media-shy. After shooting up in the polls much earlier than he had expected, Walker had a series of stumbles, refusing to answer questions about evolution and President Obama\u2019s Christianity. He started complaining loudly about \u201cgotcha\u201d questions, which pleased the right but also fueled doubts about his readiness for prime time. In another interview, Walker had to admit to Fox\u2019s Chris Wallace that he had flipped on immigration, now taking a harder line. \u00a0\n\nNow he is keeping the press at arm\u2019s length. The Wall Street Journal reports, \u201cMr. Walker\u2026on Friday returned from a European trip to Germany, France and Spain during which he held no public events and didn\u2019t take questions from reporters. Mr. Walker is also planning a trip to Israel in May. An aide said last week that the trip is his first time visiting the country and he will focus on educating himself about Israeli issues and won\u2019t hold public events or take questions from reporters.\u201d\n\nAn all-but-official presidential contender goes abroad to bolster his international prestige. By not doing interviews, Walker practically erases the benefits of such foreign travel.\n\nAnd one of Walker\u2019s top rivals has no such hesitation.\u00a0As the Washington Examiner notes, \u201cWalker's aversion to the national press at large stands in contrast to [Jeb] Bush, who is known to be highly accessible to politics reporters. Bush is scheduled for his own tour of Europe in June and is scheduled to appear at several public events and take questions from reporters.\u201d\n\nNow Walker has spoken to some local news outlets, such as the Des Moines Register, and he\u2019s also done interviews with Fox\u2019s Megyn Kelly and with Glenn Beck.\n\nBut what he\u2019s not doing is chatting with national reporters who are following him on the trail or sitting down with the national newspapers, broadcast networks, CNN or MSNBC.\n\nIf the media are going to carp that Hillary Clinton is largely ignoring them, then the same complaint applies to Walker.\n\nWhich brings us to the existential question: Does a presidential candidate really need the media at all?\n\nIn Hillary\u2019s case, she could choose not to take a single question from the press and yet be nominated in Philadelphia in July 2016. Of course, she would take a beating from the media for being in the bunker, and she would ultimately look secretive and defensive. But she may be the best-known woman on the planet and hardly needs to \u201cintroduce\u201d herself to voters.\n\nWalker, on the other hand, is new to the national stage. Sooner or later, he needs the media megaphone.\n\nIt\u2019s not that candidates have some grave responsibility to keep reporters happy. Nobody likes us these days anyway.\n\nBut Walker, like his rivals, has a prime opportunity to use that bandwidth to define himself, rather than letting his critics define him. Part of proving yourself as a potential president is showing that you\u2019re a good communicator\u2014and making people comfortable with the idea of your presence in their living rooms for the next four years.\n\nSo it makes little sense for Scott Walker to forfeit that opportunity.\u00a0Howard Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).
