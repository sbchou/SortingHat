And the family is not there yet.\n\"I mean, I've just got to be certain that if I do this, I'm able to look in the eye and everyone else and say I'm giving all my passion, all my, all my energy and will not be distracted. And secondly, equally as important, the other piece is: Is this moment, is this the best thing for the family as a unit?\" Biden said in the interview with America magazine published Monday.\nBiden remarked that he has known \"almost every person\" who has made a White House bid since the age of 29, and the decision always hinges on \"personal considerations.\"\n\"Your whole family is implicated. Your whole family is engaged. So for us it\u2019s a family decision, and I just have to be comfortable that this will be good for the family,\" he explained.\n\"We\u2019re just not there yet and may not get there in time to make it feasible to be able to run and succeed because there are certain windows that will close. But if that\u2019s it, that\u2019s it. But it\u2019s not like I can rush it. It\u2019s not like it either happens or it doesn\u2019t happen. I know that\u2019s not satisfying to anybody, but people who have been there, I know they understand,\" the vice president said.\nA spokesman for Dr. Jill Biden on Sunday did not deny a report from NBC News that had sources stating that Biden's wife \"would not be an obstacle\" should he decide to pursue the Democratic nomination. Earlier this month, Biden told Stephen Colbert, \"I would be lying if I said that I knew I was there.\"\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Biden on 2016: 'We\u2019re just not there yet'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/joe-biden-2016-no-decision-yet-213875", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "abortion"], "people": ["Kirsten Gillibrand", "Erin Mershon", "Karen G.
