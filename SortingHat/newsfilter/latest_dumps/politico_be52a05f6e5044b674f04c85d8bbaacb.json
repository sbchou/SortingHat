{"body": "POLITICO\nA daily overview of education policy news\nBy Caitlin Emma\n6/11/15 10:01 AM EDT\nWith help from Eliza Collins, Allie Grasgreen, Kimberly Hefling, Maggie Severns and Nirvi Shah\nCLINTON WILL BANK ON STUDENT DEBT: Hillary Clinton\u2019s policy team has been soliciting input from economic experts and liberal policymakers tied to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, with the goal of making student loan reform the core of Clinton\u2019s economic mobility agenda, POLITICO\u2019s Annie Karni reports. The effort to make college more accessible comes as the Clinton campaign finds itself under increasing pressure to accommodate progressive demands. Bonus: It also could provide Clinton with a signature domestic policy issue, similar to healthcare for Barack Obama in 2008. Clinton\u2019s camp views the issue as one where the former secretary of state could drive the conversation and create a mandate for reform.\nStory Continued Below\n\u2014 In one of the clearest signs of the importance the policy team \u2014 headed by senior advisor Ann O\u2019Leary \u2014 is placing on the issue, student loan reform is expected to be one of the earliest policy rollouts after Clinton\u2019s campaign kick-off Saturday. The campaign is expected to unveil its student loan plans in detail in mid-July, multiple sources said. Clinton\u2019s campaign has sought out policy experts with strong ties to Warren. The Clinton campaign has also been seeking advice from Rohit Chopra at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Other experts who have also been speaking regularly with O\u2019Leary and her team, sources said, include Mark Huelsman, a senior policy analyst at Demos; economist Gene Sperling; James Kvaal, who was Obama\u2019s policy director in the 2012 election; and longtime Clinton advisor Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress. None of the policy details have been finalized, and it\u2019s still unclear how Clinton plans to pay for any of the proposals being discussed.\n\u2014 On the table: A plan to support debt-free college. That goes further than what either of Clinton\u2019s Democratic opponents, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, or former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, have proposed when they speak about debt-free college \u2014 their proposals cover just the cost of tuition. It\u2019s not clear yet exactly what form Clinton\u2019s debt-free college proposal will take \u2014 whether students will pay based on a percentage of their income, or carry some obligation based on their ability to pay. But covering the cost of attendance is appealing to the progressive policy makers advising Clinton. \u201cThe total cost of attendance is a more expansive view of the actual cost of higher education,\u201d Huelsman said. Also under discussion is allowing students to refinance their loans, an issue that Warren championed in a bill that was defeated last year by Republican opposition. http://politi.co/1JM8xh7\n\u2014 Warren laid out her own detailed and extensive proposal Wednesday to address the nation\u2019s $1.2 trillion in student debt. An aide to Sen. Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Senate education committee, said the chairman \u201cbelieves Sen. Warren makes an important contribution\u201d to the committee\u2019s work to reauthorize the Higher Education Act. \u201cHer support for legislation he has introduced with Sen. [Michael] Bennet and others to simplify the process for applying for federal financial aid \u2014 as well as her contributions to discussions around reducing burdensome regulations and giving colleges and universities more \u2018skin in the game\u2019 \u2014 are critical,\u201d the aide said. Allie Grasgreen has more: http://politico.pro/1e467Pu.\n\u2014 On a call with supporters Wednesday night, hosted by MoveOn.org, Warren vowed to keep pushing the refinancing issue and urged listeners to quiz presidential hopefuls on where they stand. \u201cNobody was talking much about this two years ago \u2026 we put it on the agenda,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to get this one through the United States Congress \u2026 We\u2019ve got our work cut out for us, but we\u2019re not going to back up on this one.\u201d\n\u2014 Does free college mean more students attend? Not in Norway, where all residents have have the same tuition-free access to college, no matter their background, and students get the same allowance for living expenses. \u201cEven though tuition is almost completely free here, Norwegians whose parents did not go to college are just as unlikely to go themselves as are Americans whose parents did not pursue higher education.\u201d More in The Atlantic: http://theatln.tc/1cMq1wS.\nCOMMON CORE BACKERS SPEND THE MOST IN IOWA: The Collaborative for Student Success \u2014 a non-profit, pro-Common Core powerhouse based in D.C. \u2014 has outpaced all other political spenders in Iowa so far this year. While the group wouldn\u2019t confirm a total spending figure, a Sunlight Foundation review of ad contracts shows that the group has spent more than $764,000 on about 1,500 ads in the state. While most super PAC ads are yet to come, the collaborative\u2019s Iowa investment trounces that of super PACs supporting Common Core opponents Bobby Jindal and Rick Perry. The collaborative hasn\u2019t favored a particular presidential candidate. Instead, the ads target conservative voters who\u2019ve revolted against the Common Core.\n\u2014 Collaborative spokeswoman Blair Mann told Sunlight that the standards have been \u201cgrossly\u201d misrepresented. \u201cIt's important that the public have the facts and that public officials be held accountable when they employ wildly inaccurate and deliberately misleading descriptions of the standards,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think it's important \u2014 and far more effective \u2014 to be part of the conversation early, rather than trying to correct the record after the issue has been distorted and misrepresented.\u201d More: http://bit.ly/1KXooZ4.\nGOOD THURSDAY MORNING, JUNE 11.

That\u2019s according to a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Students at three Canadian universities took these classes at the beginning of their freshman year and were then surveyed a year later. There were incidences of rape in 5 percent of the women who participated in the program, compared with 10 percent of their peers. \u201cOnly 22 women would need to take the program in order to prevent one additional rape from occurring within one year,\u201d the authors said. The study: http://bit.ly/1Iw0zXR.\nWASH, DRY, READ: The Clinton Foundation\u2019s Too Small To Fail initiative is using an uncommon setting to push early literacy: laundromats. TSTF will partner with the Coin Laundry Association and others to encourage low-income families to use trips to the laundromat as opportunities for talking and engaging with young kids. The project involves an array of activities. Jumpstart and First 5 Alameda County in California will host monthly story times in laundromats, and Jumpstart\u2019s annual \u201cRead for the Record\u201d campaign will launch at laundromats in Oakland later this year. Two other new Clinton Foundation initiatives focus on playgrounds as opportunities for learning and teaching math to students at bedtime.\nCTB/McGRAW-HILL WILL PAY FOR GEORGIA TESTING MISTAKES: Test \u201cfreezing\u201d and connectivity issues caused angst this year for many Georgia test takers. Georgia education officials say vendor CTB/McGraw-Hill is working to make it up to them: The company will provide $4.5 million in services at no cost to the department. State Superintendent Richard Woods said the problems weren\u2019t widespread, but still problematic. \u201cThe vendor has worked with us to make sure those safeguards are in place, and to ensure Georgia is compensated for the services that were not rendered effectively,\u201d Woods said in a statement.\n\u2014 The affected students were taking Georgia Milestones end-of-grade tests. The free services include $2.7 million to develop new tests and up to $60,000 toward an analysis of the problems.\nFIRST LOOK: CAP PUSHES FOOD PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS: The Child and Adult Care Food Program feeds more than 3 million children by providing snacks and meals to child care centers, family daycares, Head Start programs and more. The Center for American Progress says the program can be improved via the coming reauthorization of the federal Child Nutrition Act. Some priorities for CAP: increasing reimbursement rates, reducing the area eligibility test, reducing paperwork and utilizing CACFP to ensure safe child care settings. \u201cWithout proper meals and snacks, children are unable to learn the skills needed to be ready for school at kindergarten,\u201d said Katie Hamm, director of CAP\u2019s early childhood education policy team. The report: http://ampr.gs/1Mq6vSV.\n\u2014 CAP also says providers should serve three meals a day if they have children for eight hours or more at a time, an option that was eliminated a while back. Now it reimburses for two meals and a snack or one meal and two snacks a day. The exception: Emergency shelters can provide three meals.\nIN TODAY\u2019S FEDERAL REGISTER: Some \u201cnecessary\u201d technical changes to the Impact Aid program, which the National Association of Federally Impacted Schools says have been nearly a dozen years in the making.

[http://politico.pro/1Izjeou] \u201cNo one should be in debt to a college that defrauded them \u2014 forgiving students is the right decision. Thx, @usedgov. http://nyti.ms/1MjvreX \u00a0-H\u201d\n\u2014 New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will speak about education reform today at Iowa State University at 11 a.m. CT. On Wednesday, he told the Latino Coalition at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that they should flex their political muscle and \"start offending people\" to fix the country's education system. \"This can't be an intellectual conversation alone, everybody,\" Christie said. \"You've got to decide you want to stand up and fight for better schools for your kids. That's going to mean breaking some china.\" More: http://bit.ly/1Kr8xnm.\n\u2014 Thanks but no thanks: A Wisconsin teacher renews her plea that Gov. Scott Walker stop using her as an example. In an op-ed [http://dmreg.co/1L1eDvX] in the Des Moines Register, Walker opens a piece about his education accomplishments with the story of Megan Sampson, a first-year teacher of the year who was laid off a week after earning the honor. Walker writes that changes to so-called last-in, first-out policies that favor teachers with seniority in his state would now prevent a situation like Sampson\u2019s. In a letter to the Associated Press, Sampson asked Walker to back off. \"I do not enjoy being associated with Walker's political campaign.\" She said Walker \"not have permission from me to use my story in this manner, and he still does not have my permission.\" More: http://dmreg.co/1L2pdmt\nREPORT ROLL CALL\n\u2014 The Fordham Institute says it\u2019s time to deregulate in Ohio, with possible suggestions that include expanding opportunities for schools to use non-licensed workers: http://politico.pro/1Iw1UxY.\n\u2014 Millennials spend an average of 35 hours per week on digital media, but 58 percent have few skills when it comes to solving problems with technology.
