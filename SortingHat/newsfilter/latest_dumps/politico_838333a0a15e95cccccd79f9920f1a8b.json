Over the course of two full hours of debate, no one even mentioned Joe Biden\u2019s name. \nStory Continued Below\n\u201cThis debate was about the five people on this stage,\u201d said Clinton strategist Joel Benenson in the spin room after the debate, gingerly not engaging. \u201cVice President Biden has a very personal decision to make.\u201d\nBiden and his advisers knew that waiting until October to make a decision was a gamble: Would Clinton\u2019s late-summer tailspin continue? Would she fumble and stumble through the first debate? And most importantly, would the primary race take off without him? \nNow, Biden's orbit has put out word that he\u2019s going to take another week to make a decision \u2014 right up against Clinton\u2019s appearance before the Select Committee on Benghazi that once seemed like it could become an embarrassing inquisition, but that she's now already framing a tedious partisan fishing expedition. \nWhile Biden may have seen four Clinton opponents without his debating chops struggle to distinguish themselves next to her on Tuesday night, he also saw that he was not, at least to the people on stage, the looming presence that some thought he\u2019d be. Neither was she the wounded shark that Biden backers hoped might leave Democrats crying out for a savior. \n\n\n\n            By \nDaniel Strauss\n\nClinton\u2019s challengers also denied Biden an opening as a \u201cunifier\u201d by opting not to attack her much, or with much fire. On the contrary, their near defense of Clinton at points only accentuated how much Biden would have to come in swinging hard to distinguish himself, which is never the kind of race he\u2019 has liked to run and not one that he\u2019s eager to run now. \nNot even reporters were pushing Clinton aides much about Biden in the spin room afterward. And her team demurred whenever the question did come up. \nBut it\u2019s not like he was so far from their minds\u2014arriving in Las Vegas on Monday evening, Clinton made her first stop at a rally with the Culinary Workers Union, which Biden loyalists would hope to lean on in the Nevada primary if he got in (to the point that the vice president held a long meeting with one of the union\u2019s top officers while in Los Angeles last month).\nTime is ticking, and the vice president and the people looking at the race with him know it. Forget about rushing to put together tens of millions of dollars\u2014they don\u2019t yet have a bank account. Georgia and Michigan filing deadlines are coming up quickly, with others right behind, and they haven\u2019t gotten past the preliminary conversations with most of the handful of people they\u2019ve talked to about staffing a potential campaign. \nInstead of that James Bond-style surprise arrival in Vegas that political reporters spent two weeks obsessing over, Biden, according to his office, watched from the Naval Observatory. And what of that guess by some Democratic odds-makers that Biden would announce his candidacy the day after the debate? Turns out, according to his schedule, he\u2019ll be spending Wednesday speaking at an infrastructure roundtable at the White House, having his weekly lunch with Obama and then sitting in on an Oval Office meeting with Secretary of State John Kerry. \n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\nAnd in a move that would thrill no campaign consultant, especially with a limited timeframe, his office put out word ahead of the debate that he\u2019ll spend next Wednesday as part of a daylong forum in Washington joining Jimmy Carter to honor Walter Mondale. \nAll this as Biden\u2019s hard-earned brand of authenticity and party loyalty is weighed against the theory that he\u2019s just sitting back, waiting to see if Clinton falters.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t think that would be the criteria upon which he\u2019d decide whether to run or not, but at this point he needs to make up his mind,\u201d Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta told Yahoo News in Las Vegas ahead of the debate.\n\u201cPeople\u2019s patience are being tested here,\u201d said former Obama adviser David Axelrod, who\u2019s spoken about the possibility of running with Biden, on CNN ahead of the debate. \nClinton closed what could have been multiple paths for Biden. She wove close to the president repeatedly through the debate, minimizing her policy disagreements and all but claiming his endorsement the first time she brought up his name. \n\u201cHe valued my judgment,\u201d she said, shutting down the complaints from Bernie Sanders and others for that same Iraq War vote Obama beat her up for throughout the 2008 campaign, before picking her to be his secretary of state. \nShe went on over the course of the night to list areas where she and Obama were side-by-side: that decision to go after Osama bin Laden (which, should it ever come to a head-to-head, she can point out that Biden took the other side on), cornering the Chinese to begin caving in on climate change, Obama\u2019s position on Libya, his being \u201ca great moral leader\u201d on issues of race relations and grappling with police violence, all the more he would have gotten done if not for the obstruction of the Republicans. \nShe also directed comments directly at Biden\u2019s potential coalition partners, giving special mention to helping two groups\u2014African-Americans and the LGBT community\u2014that would be core to his support base if he were to run.\n\u201cFor me, this is about bringing our country together again,\u201d Clinton said, denying Biden a chance to cast himself as the one who could overcome divisions in America. \u201cAnd I will do everything I can to heal the divides: the divides economically, because there's too much inequality; the racial divides; the continuing discrimination against the LGBT community.\u201d\n\n\n\n            By \nDaniel Strauss\n\nClinton didn\u2019t linger much on her opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline, her insistence that Obama could go further on immigration and gun control, or on the Trans-Pacific Partnership that she called the \u201cgold standard\u201d back when she was a member of the administration, but now says she's read enough\u2014though the final text is still not public\u2014to know she's against it. \nBiden would be running to build on the work of the Obama administration, a third term with a twist. But Clinton beat him to it. \n\u201cThere's a lot that I would like to do to build on the successes of President Obama,\u201d Clinton said. \u201dBut also, as I'm laying out, to go beyond.\u201d\nGabriel Debenedetti contributed reporting from Las Vegas.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Time is ticking, and the vice president and the people looking at the race with him know it.", "title": "Clinton&#8217;s boxing Biden out", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/clintons-boxing-biden-out-214778", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "James Bond", "Walter Mondale", "Matt Latimer", "Tom Steyer", "Hadas Gold", "Carla Marinucci", "Austin Wright", "Charles Schwab", "Joe Biden", "Brian Mahoney", "Theodoric Meyer", "Nahal Toosi", "Caitlin Emma", "Darius Tahir", "Joel Benenson", "Victoria Guida", "Nick Gass", "Alex Isenstadt", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Isaac Dovere", "Toby Eckert", "Jeb Bush", "Jeremy Herb", "Marco Rubio", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Jeff Greenfield", "David Axelrod", "Eric Wolff", "Ivanka Trump", "Tim Starks", "John Podesta", "Jimmy Carter", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "John Kerry", "Brianna Ehley", "Tony Romm", "Daniel Strauss", "Hillary Clinton", "Ben White", "Glass Steagall", "Anna Palmer", "Bill Tomson", "Bernie Sanders"], "orgs": ["DOJ", "CNBC", "FEC", "Select Committee", "Oval Office", "FTC", "Culinary Workers Union", "Naval Observatory", "U.N.
