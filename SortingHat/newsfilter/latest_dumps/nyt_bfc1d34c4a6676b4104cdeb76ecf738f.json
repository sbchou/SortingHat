{"body": "Plunging stocks have rattled investors on Monday, but Donald J. Trump sees them as one more reason he is needed in the Oval Office.\n\nAs the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 1,000 points in early trading on Monday, the billionaire developer who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination said that such volatility was another sign that the fortunes of the United States are too closely tied to the rest of the world. The declines of U.S. stocks have followed a market correction in China, which has also put pressure on European markets. \n\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 24, 2015\n\n\n\nMr. Trump, who made most of his money in real estate rather than investing, argued that markets are crashing because the United States has planned poorly and allowed China and Asia to dictate the global agenda.\n\n\u201cThis could get messy,\u201d he said. \n\nMr. Trump has said that bad trade deals with China and Mexico are to blame for a sluggish American economy and weak job creation. He has promised to make \u201cgreat\u201d deals with other countries to protect American workers and has threatened to raise taxes on imports to the United States to bolster domestic production. \n\nHis remarks are something of a change in tune, with Mr. Trump previously highlighting how the United States is constantly falling behind China as it ascends economically. In the Aug. 7 Republican debate, he declared that the United States \u201cis in big trouble.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe don\u2019t win anymore. We lose to China.\u201d ", "byline": "ALAN RAPPEPORT", "description": "Donald J.
