Clinton could lose both heavily white Iowa and New Hampshire, and still have a fairly unobstructed path to the nomination because of her mighty position with women and minorities. This is true even if Vice President Joe Biden enters the race. This is not to say Hillary can\u2019t find a way to blow it. Her inept early campaigning and bungled handling of the email controversy underline the inadequacies that helped Obama beat Clinton in 2008. ...\n\u201cTrump is still unlikely to be the nominee: ... Out of ... 17 GOP candidates, five come closest to meeting the usual metrics required to win a ... nomination: Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz and John Kasich. As concerned as many are about Bush\u2019s dynasty burdens and Jeb\u2019s uneven, unexciting performances on the trail, he still has the best chance to win over the party establishment (big donors and big-name politicians). ... \n\u201cRubio is widely acknowledged to have the most political talent on the debate stage ... Like Bush, Scott Walker has been somewhat wooden, but his hero status as the union vanquisher ... carries weight with financiers and rank-and-file Republicans alike. ... Cruz has raised more money than any Republican but Bush ... Kasich is more of a longshot, but he has impressed many senior Republicans ... \n\u201cThe 2016 election will be unique: ... Trump might bolt the GOP eventually despite his pledge not to. However, Trump knows, whatever the exit polls may eventually show about his independent run, he\u2019ll be blamed if Hillary Clinton secures the White House in a three-way race.\u201d http://politi.co/1IT1ezJ\n**SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://bit.ly/1W3LMuZ\nSHOT \u2013 NBC-Marist poll, \u201cSanders Leads Hillary Clinton by 9 in New Hampshire, Gains in Iowa,\u201d by NBC\u2019s Mark Murray: \u201cIn New Hampshire, the Vermont senator gets ... 41 percent of Democratic voters, Clinton gets 32 percent and ...
