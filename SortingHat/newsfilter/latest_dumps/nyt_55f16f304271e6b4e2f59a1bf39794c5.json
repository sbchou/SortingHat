{"body": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Senator Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader who announced his retirement last week, settled into a corner booth at the Triple George Grill here, his faced masked by dark sunglasses, evidence of lingering injuries from a workout accident that left him blind in one eye. For the next hour, in a conversation that veered from Washington to Nevada and back again, Mr. Reid made clear that he would deploy all of his resources to make sure Democrats hold on to his seat \u2014 critical to any hopes his party has of winning back the Senate in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe are going to do everything we can,\u201d said Mr. Reid, 75, as he slowly ate a bowl of chicken soup in this downtown restaurant. \u201cI have to make sure I take care of the person running for Senate in Nevada.\u201d\n\nThe comments came from a historically proud and partisan Democrat who has been Nevada\u2019s senator since 1987 and who has repeatedly displayed his command of the politics of this quickly changing battleground state. Over the past 28 years, he has put nearly as much effort into the Democratic politics of Nevada as he did in Washington.\n\nIn a race that has personal resonance for him, Mr. Reid has anointed a candidate, Catherine Cortez Masto, a former state attorney general who is now executive vice chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education, as his successor, and said he would put his organizational and fund-raising machine behind her. That is the same apparatus that helped Mr. Reid win re-election in 2010 despite an enormous effort by national Republicans to defeat him.\n\nAppearing relaxed, if still somewhat unsteady on his feet after his accident in January, Mr. Reid spoke at what was a leisurely \u2014 at least for him \u2014 lunch. It was his first trip to Nevada since he announced he would retire at the end of his term. He arrived in a two-van security motorcade, the trappings of a job that will fade at the end of next year, to a reminder that he was no longer in Washington: A waiter greeted him as \u201cHarry\u201d as he slid him his bowl of soup.\n\nThroughout the lunch, Mr. Reid fired off the kind of observations that have, for better and worse, marked his soon-to-end career in Washington.\n\nJeb Bush, the Florida Republican expected to run for president, would be the \u201ceasiest opponent\u201d for Hillary Rodham Clinton to beat in 2016, Mr. Reid said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d have to wake up every morning and find out what he\u2019s for,\u201d Mr. Reid said. Not to mention the record of President George W. Bush. \u201cHow can his brother Jeb get away from that?\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cI\u2019ll take Clinton baggage over that any day.\u201d\n\nHe said President Obama wasted 18 months in his first term trying to accommodate political intransigence from Republicans, but suggested the president would nevertheless be remembered as the best chief executive in at least 50 years, presumably including Bill Clinton, the husband of the woman likely to be the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee. \u201cHe has a legacy that they\u2019ll have to write about, more so than any modern-day president,\u201d Mr. Reid said of Mr. Obama. \u201cMore so than Ronald Reagan.\u201d\n\nHe called Mrs. Clinton, the secretary of state under Mr. Obama, the obvious favorite to win the presidency, for one overwhelming reason: \u201cThis is the time for a woman to run.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen and some men, like me, if they are anything like me,\u201d he said, \u201cthey have come to the realization that women have qualities that we\u2019ve been lacking in America for a long time, to be the leader of the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen are much more patient,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cThey can be, if they are pushed the wrong way, combative, but they are not combative. A lot of we men are combative just by nature.\u201d\n\nBut more than anything, Mr. Reid said, he would spend much of his remaining time in public life working to ensure the installation of his anointed successors. He said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York was certain to succeed him as Senate minority leader. \u201cHe can\u2019t lose,\u201d Mr. Reid said.\n\nHe said he was confident about a Democratic victory in Nevada, as well \u2014 but less so, particularly if Brian E. Sandoval, the popular Republican governor, changes his mind and bows to pressure from national Republicans to enter the race. Republicans here say that seems unlikely at the moment.\n\n\u201cHe beat my son, and I understand that,\u201d Mr. Reid said, referring to Mr. Sandoval\u2019s victory over Rory Reid in the 2010 race for governor. \u201cBut he has done some courageous things. He has done a good job as governor.\u201d\n\nOver the years, Mr. Reid has proved himself to be a partisan scrapper with a deep understanding of Nevada politics, particularly when it comes to get-out-the-vote efforts, organizing and fund-raising. Mr. Reid oversaw the turnaround in the Democratic Party here by championing the presidential caucus system in 2008, which resulted in a sharp increase in registered Democrats. That was as good for the party as it was for Mr. Reid, who inevitably had to claw his way to re-election, and presumably it would be good for Ms. Cortez Masto, as well.\n\nIf the prospect of a Sandoval candidacy gives Republicans some hope, the fact that Mr. Reid has stepped aside, some party members have said, is a disappointment, depriving them of an opponent who has proved to be a polarizing motivator for Republican voters.\n\nMr. Reid has never displayed any reluctance with trying to meddle in the machinations of the opposition. As such, his suggestion that Mr. Bush might be the weakest candidate should be taken advisedly: It is quite possibly, several analysts have said, an attempt to nudge Republican voters against a candidate Mr. Reid thinks is, in fact, formidable.\n\n\u201cI would not want to get in front of a chess board with him,\u201d said Michael Green, a professor of history at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \u201cI have the feeling my king would have several amputations before I made a move.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Jeb Bush declined to comment.\n\nMr. Reid seemed neither nostalgic nor regretful as he parried questions about politics and what many of his friends see as the improbability of Harry Reid, a man who sometimes seems to be in perpetual motion, in retirement. He said he did not know what he wanted to do next.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had calls from lots of people,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cFor example, Al Gore called me. Maybe I want to do something with Al Gore? I have no idea.\u201d\n\nBut on one matter he was clear: He said he would not be a lobbyist.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather go to Singapore and have them beat me with whips,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Reid has long identified himself with Nevada, even as he kept homes here and in Washington, and said in retirement, he would not leave the state where he grew up. Which is not to say Mr. Reid is about to leave his Washington life. \u201cThere\u2019s good health care there,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I made a lot of friends there.\u201d", "byline": "ADAM NAGOURNEY", "description": "The Senate minority leader, who announced his retirement last week, vowed to deploy all of his resources to make sure Democrats hold on to his seat.", "title": "Harry Reid Hopes to Ensure Democrats\u2019 Success as Tenure Winds Down", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/03/us/harry-reid-hopes-to-ensure-democrats-success-as-tenure-winds-down.html", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Michael Green", "Catherine Cortez Masto", "Bill Clinton", "Jeb Bush", "Harry Reid", "Brian E.
