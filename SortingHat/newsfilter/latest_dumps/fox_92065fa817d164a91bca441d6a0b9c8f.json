It was co-written with his wife Candy Carson.\nA political follow-up to \"One Nation,\" released in 2014, Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, says \"A More Perfect Union\" is supposed \u201cto encourage every citizen to read and think about the Constitution, and to help defend it from those who misinterpret and undermine it.\u201d\nThe ABC News report said Carson\u2019s campaign likes to maintain a bright line between the book promotion and his GOP bid, and that beyond private fundraisers, he would not be making any public campaign appearances until the next CNBC-sponsored Republican debate on Oct. 28.\nThe story also points out that Carson\u2019s last public campaign appearance was Oct. 2.\nBut Carson fired back Friday on Facebook, calling the ABC report \u201ccarelessly false.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the next three weeks, I have 25 fundraisers, a national debate, several public appearances and dozens of book signings from Texas to Iowa,\u201d he writes to his supporters on Facebook. \u201cI don\u2019t see any time off in the coming three weeks.\u201d\nThe ABC News story suggested that the campaign did not want to be perceived as \u201cusing campaign assets to sell books,\u201d and noted that none of Carson's campaign staff would be accompanying him during promotional appearances.\nCarson spokesman Doug Watts said he has been raking in the donations, raising $3 million so far in October, and has been ubiquitous in the media throughout the month.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been on TV. I think Wednesday through Friday I got sick of looking at him on TV,\u201d Watts said. \u201cSo it\u2019s pretty hard to suggest that he\u2019s not out and about. Whether you make a distinction of it as a campaign thing or not.\u201d", "byline": "", "description": "GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson, who just announced that he raised $20.2 million in the last quarter and is one point behind GOP front runner Donald Trump in the latest Fox News poll, pushed back Friday against a report he has put his campaign on hold to promote his new book.", "title": "Carson fires back on report he is taking time off to promote book", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/z4HPAzMHS64/", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Ben Carson", "Doug Watts", "Candy Carson"], "orgs": ["CNBC", "GOP"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-10-17 05:15:55", "org": "fox", "article_id": "92065fa817d164a91bca441d6a0b9c8f", "date_access": "2015-10-17 06:31:22.128772"}
