{"body": "Jeb Bush\u2019s presidential campaign has brought with it a resurgence of the idea that he\u2019s the smarter of the two political Bush brothers. Experts on the Bush family say it\u2019s an old idea, but it may not be correct.\n\nThe notion that Jeb is the smart one has its roots in the brothers\u2019 youth, according to Bill Minutaglio, the author of \u201cFirst Son: George W. Bush and the Bush Family Dynasty.\u201d \u201cGrowing up,\u201d he said in an email, \u201cJeb\u2019s older brother was given to the kind of backslapping, grinning and preening that led some family members and friends to believe he was not entirely a sober, serious individual with the requisite gravitas to be presidential timber. He was great at social lubrication but a dud in the classroom, and hardly remembered by anyone at Yale for his academic achievements.\u201d\n\nThus, when the family considered the brothers\u2019 futures, \u201cit wasn\u2019t that Jeb was oozing an arching intellect or compelling profundity as he grew up. It was just that, in juxtaposition with his more careening brother George Walker Bush \u2014 the one who drank, who ran into problems with the police, whose fraternity was accused of hazing and branding pledges \u2014 Jeb appeared more stable.\u201d\n\nThe perception that Jeb is smarter \u201chas been out there forever,\u201d said Myra Gutin, author of \u201cBarbara Bush: Presidential Matriarch.\u201d In the Bush family, \u201cthere was always the expectation that Jeb would run for president,\u201d she explained, \u201ccertainly ahead of his older brother.\u201d\n\nThose close to the brothers have been describing Jeb as staid and George as fun for decades, though not always in those words. \u201cJeb\u00a0is more serious,\u201d Barbara Bush told The St. Petersburg Times in 1994. \u201cHe is warm, but he\u2019s not a big Ha-Ha man. But I think he really cares and it shows. \u00a0He is more like his father, if the truth be known.\u201d\n\nShe described George W. as \u201cmore feisty\u201d and more like her.\n\nIn a 2002 article in The St. Petersburg Times, Sara Fritz and Lucy Morgan quoted a former Bush aide who remembered the brothers\u2019 different approaches to a 1987 meeting about their father\u2019s campaign: \u201cJeb\u00a0wanted to talk about issues,\u201d the aide said, while \u201cGeorge kept asking, \u2018When are we going to go skeet shooting?\u2019\u201d\n\nJeb Bush may be more willing to get down to business (and less interested in skeet shooting) than George, but he\u2019s not necessarily more articulate: His unimpressive responses to questions about the Iraq War show that \u201clike his big brother, he, too,\u00a0can slip\u00a0when he speaks,\u201d writes Brian E. Crowley at The Washington Post.\n\nAnd his reputation for seriousness comes with its own problems. Donald Trump \u201cis right in one respect,\u201d said Mr. Minutaglio: \u201cJeb Bush is far lower in energy than his brother George.\u201d The younger Bush is now suffering\u00a0in the polls;\u00a0he\u2019s dropped from 17 percent in July to 8.3 percent last week.\n\nUltimately, it may not matter how smart Jeb is. If he has his brother\u2019s verbal clumsiness without his social skills, all the intelligence in the world may not save his campaign.", "byline": "ANNA NORTH", "description": "Experts on the Bush family say it\u2019s an old idea, but it may not be correct.", "title": "Taking Note: When Did Jeb Bush Become the Smarter Brother?", "url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/14/when-did-jeb-bush-become-the-smarter-brother/", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["Brian E.
