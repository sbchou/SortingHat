Lindsey Graham said Sunday that he\u2019s \u201c91 percent sure\u201d he\u2019ll get into the 2016 presidential race -- inching closer to a longshot challenge to the well-funded Republican front-runners.\n\nGraham, a Republican and a military hawk, told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that his foreign policy will be better than the plans put forth by Republican candidate Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve got a good message,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been more right than wrong on foreign policy.\u201d\n\nGraham also stood behind his more moderate views on climate change, closing tax loopholes and comprehensive immigration reform, declaring he could win South Carolina, which is largely conservative and an early-primary state.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m on the ballot, I\u2019ll win,\u201d said the 59-year-old Graham, a former Air Force pilot and military lawyer.\n\nStill, he acknowledged that challenges of financing a campaign while not being among the handful of leading candidates in early polling.\n\nIf I raise the money, I\u2019ll run,\u201d Graham also told Fox News.\n\nTop Republican challenger Florida Sen.
