Only Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, at 10 percent, is also in double digits. It's likely the final poll to qualify for next week's debate.\nStory Continued Below\nCNBC, which will air the debate on Oct. 28, had hoped that by setting a floor of 2.5 percent in an average of polls conducted since the last debate, they could cull the field somewhat. But that floor is low enough that, again, the debate will feature 10 candidates.\nAnd it's the same 10 candidates who participated last time around (11 candidates were on stage last month, but Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker left the race shortly after the debate).\nAccording to a POLITICO analysis, Trump (25.2 percent) still leads the field and will be center-stage at the 8 p.m. debate next Wednesday, followed by Ben Carson (19.8 percent).\nThe next tier of candidates, according to the polling average, are Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (9.7), former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (8.1), Carly Fiorina (8.1) and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (6.9).\nThe four candidates rounding out the top 10 \u2014 former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (3.6), New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (3.0), Ohio Gov. John Kasich (3.0) and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul (3.0) \u2014 ended up closest to the bubble, but they appear to clear the 2.5-percent CNBC threshold to qualify for the main stage.\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\nEven the undercard debate, set for 6 p.m., will be the same as last month. Set to participate are former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum (0.7), Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (0.3), former New York Gov. George Pataki (0.3) and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham (0.2). (Jindal has threatened to boycott the debate, with his campaign arguing that using national polls to cull the field is inappropriate.)\nFormer Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore \u2014 who was left out of the last debate after participating in the first gathering in August \u2014 has apparently failed to qualify for the undercard debate after he came up short of 1 percent in any of the nine qualifying national polls.\nCNBC is expected to make a final announcement Wednesday or Thursday about the official debate field. An email seeking clarification wasn't immediately returned Wednesday morning.\nThe debate will be moderated by CNBC personalities Carl Quintanilla, Becky Quick and John Harwood.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Poll confirms likely GOP debate participants", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/poll-confirms-likely-gop-debate-participants-214994", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "personality"], "people": ["Ray Takeyh", "Katy O'Donnell", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "John Harwood", "Ben Bernanke", "Joe Pompeo", "Mike Huckabee", "Anna Palmer", "Hadas Gold", "Paul Demko", "Becky Quick", "Rand Paul", "Lauren French", "Ted Cruz", "Steven Shepard", "Chris Christie", "Joe Biden", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Theodoric Meyer", "Nahal Toosi", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Bobby Jindal", "Patrick Temple", "Scott Walker", "Nick Gass", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Rick Santorum", "Lindsey Graham", "Jeb Bush", "Glenn Thrush", "Jeremy Herb", "John Bresnahan", "Marco Rubio", "Carl Icahn", "Eliza Collins", "Paul Ryan", "Nicholas Vinocur", "Brianna Ehley", "Tim Starks", "Carly Fiorina", "Adam Sneed", "Donald Trump", "George Pataki", "John Kasich", "Jim Gilmore", "Jack Lew", "Jake Sherman", "Carl Quintanilla", "Victoria Guida", "Eric Wolff", "Bill Tomson", "Darius Tahir", "Ben Carson", "Caitlin Emma"], "orgs": ["CNBC", "EMV", "NRCC", "Congress", "Senate", "UAW", "House Democrats", "PAC", "Treasury", "Metro", "GOP", "House Freedom Caucus"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30728, "fullname": "nick gass", "primary_org": "politico"}, {"author_id": 31592, "fullname": "gabriel debenedetti", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-10-21 12:54:30", "org": "politico", "article_id": "a60eb5756e97594e54ae29a1ceadf783", "date_access": "2015-10-21 19:00:29.398823"}
