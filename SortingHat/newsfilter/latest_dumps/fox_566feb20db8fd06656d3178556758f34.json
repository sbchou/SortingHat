On the heels of a NYT report Saturday that said Biden was seriously considering another presidential run, a former aide to Biden\u2019s late son Beau Biden announced Sunday he is set to join the Draft Biden super PAC. Josh Alcorn is described by the AP as the younger Biden\u2019s \u201ctop political and fundraising\u201d aide from Delaware. Alcorn\u2019s move, coupled by the revealing write from NYT\u2019s Maureen Dowd on Beau\u2019s urgent dying wish for his father, signals the serious tip the vice president may actually take the plunge into the race. From MoDo: \u201cBeau was losing his nouns and the right side of his face was partially paralyzed. But he had a mission: He tried to make his father promise to run, arguing that the White House should not revert to the Clintons and that the country would be better off with Biden values.\u201d  2016 Democratic Power Index: Joe jumps - 1)\u00a0Hillary Clinton; 2)\u00a0Joe Biden [+1];\u00a03)\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00a0[-1]; 4)\u00a0Martin O\u2019Malley\u00a0[-1];\u00a05) Jim Webb;\u00a0 6)\u00a0Elizabeth\u00a0Warren; 7)\u00a0Lincoln Chaffee  Hillary starts spending - Clinton, who is up 28 points in Iowa, and 15 points in New Hampshire, put out her first television ads late Sunday night in the early states. Both ads center on her mother, Dorothy, who was abandoned as a child and sent to live with relatives, Clinton says her mother\u2019s story inspired her to run for office. It is a familiar narrative for Clinton who talked a lot about her mother in her 2008 run as well. The videos signal that despite reassurances from the Clinton camp that they are not worried about Vice President Biden\u2019s run they are also not taking any chances.  Bernie: \u2018Something happened on the way to a coronation\u2019 - Boston Herald: \u201cVoters filled the large banquet hall yesterday at Southern New Hampshire University to support Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who gave an impassioned speech on income inequality and boasted he\u2019s gaining traction against fellow presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton. \u2018Something happened on the way to a coronation,\u2019 he told the cheering crowd. \u2018It was me.\u2019\u201d  Likens Biden like Hillary - ABC News: \u201cPresidential hopeful\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00a0said he\u2019s \u2018very fond\u2019 of Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden, but that \u2018the American people... want to go beyond conventional establishment politics.\u2019\u201d  O\u2019Malley in Puerto Rico, says they are being treated \u2018unjustly\u2019 - Fox News Latino: \u201cFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley became the first Democratic presidential candidate to make a campaign stop in Puerto Rico this year as part of an effort to woo Latino voters\u2026In a brief interview with The Associated Press, O\u2019Malley said Puerto Rico should receive the same treatment as the U.S. mainland. \u2018Right now, the people of Puerto Rico\u2026are being treated very unjustly by forces on the mainland, forces on Wall Street and the intransigence of this Republican Congress in taking action to restore simple bankruptcy protections,\u2019 he said.\u201d  OBAMA TO ORDER BIG CUTS IN PLANT EMISSIONS Once again wielding his pen in an attempt to cement his legacy, President Obama will finalize an EPA rule today that imposes deep cuts in carbon dioxide emissions from the country\u2019s power plants. Despite political opposition and the virtual certainty of legal challenges from states and industry, the president is upping the ante by announcing steeper reductions \u2013 almost a third of 2005 level carbon emissions \u2013 than previously floated. Reaction from Republican 2016 candidates to the rule was swift, with several accusing the president of pandering to Democratic \u201cenvironmentalist billionaires.\u201d  Out of his hands - Fox News: \u201cThe rule won\u2019t go into effect until long after Obama leaves office, putting its implementation in the hands of his successor. \u00a0Among other Republican critics, 2016 candidate and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has said he would drastically scale down the EPA if elected and shift most of its duties to state regulators. The plan drew almost immediate support from Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, whose 2016 platform includes a so-called \u2018clean energy\u2019 initiative. \u2018The Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan is a significant step forward in meeting the urgent threat of climate change,\u2019 she said in a statement. \u2018It will need defending because Republican doubters and defeatists -- including every Republican candidate for president -- won\u2019t offer any credible solution.\u2019\u201d  [The players - From presidential candidates and lawmakers to governors and legal challengers, National Journal dives into a list of people who will determine the future of Obama\u2019s climate plan.]  TAKE FIVE: WHAT DO YOU SAY?

WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026 American dialects are dying faster than the phone booth. Twenty years ago, a linguist could pinpoint your native roots down to the city or county you were raised in simply from hearing you speak. With the rise of national media, beginning with the radio and growing to cable television, Americans are losing their regional voices.\u00a0Some, like in Appalachia, cling to that accent as a sign of regional pride. There are programs cropping up in schools all over the region to teach children to embrace their dialect instead of feeling inferior. And in Maine, a local linguist says despite older accents dying out young people are clinging to their native tongue to preserve the authenticity of their towns. But in the South, people say that continued migration from their Northern friends seeking warmer climate has changed their dialect and references entirely.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, perhaps benefiting from his symbiotic relationship with Donald Trump. The poll has Cruz bounding up 5 points from June, and recovering much of his initial post-announcement bounce. This is the first evidence that acting as Trump\u2019s defender may have advantages for the freshman senator. Can Cruz benefit even more after the expected end of the Trumptation or will he inherit too many of Trump\u2019s negatives?  As Trump starts acting more cautiously one wonders if the moment we find out about a post-Trump world may be soon approaching.\nBut Cruz\u2019s real advantage is the ongoing struggle of his fellow freshman, Marco Rubio. The latest round of polls has Rubio down again. An average of recent polls puts Rubio in sixth place overall. What\u2019s the matter? The best theory seems to be that Rubio and Jeb Bush are simply too much alike and that Bush\u2019s bankroll and organization have taken on too much gravity.  The recent slide may light a fire under Rubio (and some others) as they head into Cleveland Thursday for the first Republican debate.  Speaking of debate fireworks, also climbing is Ohio Gov. John Kasich, whose campaign and ad blitz seems increasingly likely to get him into the top ten as the cycle kicks off in earnest in his home state.

In addition to shoring up border security with new roads, new technologies and continuous surveillance, Bush would also crack down on sanctuary cities and send home those who enter the country legally but then overstay their visas. Bush will outline the plan in a Medium post on Monday ahead of the Voters First Forum at Saint Anselm College.\u201d  Drops tax hike - WaPo: \u201cJeb Bush said at a Koch network donor summit Sunday that he would not consider raising taxes even as part of a grand bargain to cut the deficit. Although it was not prefaced with \u2018Read my lips,\u2019 the former Florida governor stressed that more revenue should come from growth, not higher taxes. It is a shift for the Republican presidential candidate, coming as he works to expand his appeal beyond the GOP establishment. In June 2012, Bush told the House Budget Committee that he would back a deal that would include $1 in tax increases for $10 in spending cuts.\u201d  [Bush was pressed at the event about the enormous sums he has funneled into various campaign organizations, saying \u201cIf people don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s just tough luck.\u201d Bush may also be close to landing yet another donor whale.]  He\u2019s been everywhere, man - Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., is out with a new video documenting his three-week, 11-state announcement tour. Walker emphasizes his middle-America roots and enthusiastic crowds. Watch here.  Cruz says he\u2019s built Southern strength - WaPo: \u201c[Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas] was a crowd favorite at the Koch network donor summit here. He got the normally mild-mannered donors laughing and cheering with his red\u00a0meat \u2026This money, he explained, will help him run a national campaign, not just one focused on the first four states in the nominating process\u2026Cruz plans to spend a good chunk of the August recess traveling by bus around the South, including South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas.\u201d  Rubio warns: Iran could nuke California - Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., didn\u2019t mince words when talking about the Iran deal Sunday. Speaking at an event in California, Rubio said, \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us wants to live in a country where a radical Shiite cleric in Tehran can have a nuclear weapon and an ICBM that can hit where we are sitting right now.\u201d  [He\u2019s not alone - \u201cAmerican voters oppose 57 - 28 percent, with only lukewarm support from Democrats and overwhelming opposition for Republicans and independent voters, the nuclear pact negotiated with Iran, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today.\u201d]  Trump cans adviser for politically incorrect posts - WaPo: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s campaign fired a staffer Sunday for what it said were racially offensive Facebook posts. \u2018Effective immediately, Sam Nunberg, a low-level political adviser, is no longer associated with the Donald Trump For president campaign,\u2019 Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said in an interview. The firing, first reported by CNN, followed a report Friday by Business Insider that Nunberg had posted slurs and other offensive content on his private Facebook page in entries dating to 2007.\u201d  Perry says he\u2019ll end the Iran deal on day one - Former Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, told Chris Wallace that he would end the Iran deal on his first day in the White House. He said, \u201cTear up that agreement with Iran, that\u2019s the biggest challenge I think that we have in this country, and obviously securing that border with Mexico is incredibly important as well, and those two things can happen on the first day.\u201d  [Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., joins Sens. Joni Ernst, and James Lankford in a TIME op-ed on defunding Planned Parenthood on the heels of the \u201cinhumane treatment\u201d of human life.]  OF COURSE THEY ARE The Age: \u201cA feud has broken out between a founding member of the Village People and one of the group\u2019s old members over who has the right to be a Macho Man. Millionaire playboy Ivan Wilzig, known for his electropop covers of \u201860s and \u201870s peace songs, invited Randy Jones, the original Village People cowboy, to perform at a party held at his Hamptons mansion. The party, scheduled for August 22, will be Studio 54-themed, with all guests invited to dress up as either the cowboy, the Indian, the construction worker, GI, leatherman\u00a0or policeman. Trouble erupted when Wilzig also invited Felipe Rose, founding member and Indian in the Village People. When Rose found out that Jones was performing, he \u2018flipped out,\u2019 according to a\u00a0Page Six\u00a0\u2018source\u2019\u2026Now Wilzig and Jones are waiting to see if Rose will bury the hatchet.\u201d  Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
