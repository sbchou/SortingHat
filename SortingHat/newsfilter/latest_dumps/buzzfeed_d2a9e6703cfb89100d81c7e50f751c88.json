Again, it's the silly idea and notion\u2014and I remember being in a debate with Howard Dean at Northwestern a couple of years ago, and we were asked a question by a student, 'What's the greatest virtue of the United States of America?'\u2014you know what Howard Dean said? 'Diversity.' But that's what they believe.\"\nSantorum said that some people, including Obama, believed that admitting immigrants who \"share none of the values of what made America a unique and great country,\" including those sympathetic to \"radical Islam,\" was a \"good thing for America.\" \n\"They believe that America will be better off if we bring in people that are nothing like and share none of the values of what made America a unique and great country,\" Santorum said. \"And let's be honest, I mean, you know, if you look at radical Islam it's about as antithetical to the American first principles as anything you'd want to see. But in Obama's, in President Obama's mind, that's a good thing for America because America is flawed and needs to be changed and needs to be more influenced by these other cultures and other religions.\"\nEarlier in the interview, Santorum denounced the Iran deal, arguing that it was based in a \"fundamental misunderstanding of the Middle East and certainly of the Islamic world.\" \n\"We can't impose our values on a thousand year old culture and religion and at the same time we can't expect them to reason and negotiate with us in a way that we expect,\" Santorum said. \"And we don't expect\u2014we shouldn't expect them to keep these agreements because fundamentally they don't believe they have to when they're confronting the infidels.\"\nSantorum has traveled to all 99 counties in Iowa during his presidential campaign. but is still polling at about one percent both there and nationally.\n\nw.soundcloud.com", "title": "Santorum: Obama Thinks \"Potential Radical Islamic Sympathizers\" Are \"A Good Thing For America\"", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/christophermassie/santorum-obama-thinks-potential-radical-islamic-sympathizers", "topics": ["terrorism"], "people": ["Howard Dean", "Rick Santorum", "Jan Mickelson", "Nati Harnik"], "orgs": [], "authors": [{"author_id": 22072, "fullname": "christopher massie", "primary_org": "buzzfeed"}], "date_written": "2015-09-02 19:50:28", "org": "buzzfeed", "article_id": "d2a9e6703cfb89100d81c7e50f751c88", "date_access": "2015-09-02 18:55:44.064359"}
