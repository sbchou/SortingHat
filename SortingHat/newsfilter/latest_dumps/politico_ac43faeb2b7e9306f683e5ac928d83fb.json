{"body": "POLITICO\nMike Allen's must-read briefing on what's driving the day in Washington\nBy Mike Allen\n6/27/15 9:52 AM EDT\nBy Mike Allen (@mikeallen; mallen@politico.com), and Daniel Lippman (@dlippman; dlippman@politico.com)\nGood Saturday morning, after one of the most momentous news days and weeks you \u2013 or even your children \u2013 will ever see. Obama aides and former aides, who have been with him from the beginning, tell us this is the biggest week of the eight years.\nStory Continued Below\nLIVING HISTORY \u2013 \u201cTen Days in June,\u201d by New Yorker Editor David Remnick: \u201cWhat a series of days in American life, full of savage mayhem, uncommon forgiveness, resistance to forgiveness, furious debate, mourning, and, finally, justice and grace. ... Obama\u2019s Presidency was surely dwindling, if not finished. His mood was somber, philosophical\u2014which is good if you are a philosopher; if not, not. Obama described himself to me [after the disastrous midterms] in terms of his limits\u2014as \u2018a relay swimmer in a river full of rapids, and that river is history.\u2019 ...\n\u201cBut pause to think of ... the scale of recent events. On Thursday, the Supreme Court ... put an end to years of court cases and congressional attacks against the Affordable Care Act ... On Friday, the Supreme Court ... legalized same-sex marriage nationally ... [T]hroughout the South, governors and legislatures are beginning to lower the racist banner of the Confederate flag. Cruelty on a horrific scale\u2014slaughter committed in the name of racism and its symbols\u2014has made all talk about the valuable \u2018heritage\u2019 of such symbols absurd to all but a very few.\n\u201cThe endlessly revived \u2018conversation about race\u2019 shows signs of turning into something more serious\u2014a debate about institutional racism, and about inequities in the criminal-justice system, in incarceration, in employment, in education. The more Obama leads on this, the more he sheds his tendency toward caution ... the better. The eulogy in Charleston, where he spoke as freely, and as emotionally, as he ever has about race during his Presidency, is a sign, ... that he is prepared, between now and his last day in office, to seize the opportunity.\n\u201cFinally, in recent months Obama has also, through executive action, made solid gains on immigration, wage discrimination, climate change, and foreign-policy issues, including an opening, after more than a half century of Cold War and embargo, to Cuba. These accomplishments\u2014and potential accomplishments, like a ... nuclear arrangement with Iran\u2014will help shape the coming election.\u201d\nOBAMA to REMNICK, in an interview originally published in Jan. 2014: \u201c\u2018I have strengths and I have weaknesses, like every President, like every person ... I do think one of my strengths is temperament. I am comfortable with complexity ... [W]e are born into this world and inherit all the grudges and rivalries and hatreds and sins of the past ... But we also inherit the beauty and the joy and goodness of our forebears. And we\u2019re on this planet a pretty short time, so that we cannot remake the world entirely during this little stretch that we have. \u2026\n\u201cBut I think our decisions matter. ... America was very lucky that Abraham Lincoln was President when he was President. If he hadn\u2019t been, the course of history would be very different. But I also think that, despite being the greatest President, ... it took another hundred and fifty years before African-Americans had anything approaching formal equality, much less real equality.\n\u201c[T]hat doesn\u2019t diminish Lincoln\u2019s achievements, but it acknowledges that ... we\u2019re part of a long-running story. We just try to get our paragraph right.\u201d http://nyr.kr/1SSffp4 ...
