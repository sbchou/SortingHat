{"body": "ATLANTA \u2014 Georgia may not be one of the all-important first four states to vote in the 2016 presidential nominating process starting in February, but Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a Republican candidate, made a quick pit stop here on Wednesday night to say he\u2019ll compete hard in the March 1 primaries in the state and several others.\n\nSpeaking at a campaign fund-raiser before about 100 people at the Buckhead Club, Mr. Walker \u2014 who spent the day on a three-city swing through South Carolina \u2014 said the March 1 primaries through much of the South would be key to his chances of winning the nomination.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t just come here by accident,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cWith March 1 being not long after those first four states, we think that the March 1 primaries \u2014 the S.E.C. primaries, if you will \u2014 are going to be incredibly important, and we feel we can do well.\u201d\n\n\u201cGeorgia\u2019s going to make a difference,\u201d he added, \u201cso get used to seeing us.\u201d\n\nAdvisers say that the March 1 states of Alabama, Minnesota, Tennessee and Virginia are also shaping up well for Mr. Walker, based on endorsements and grass-roots voter support that they are seeing so\nfar. Mr. Walker is focused on winning the first state to hold a nominating contest, Iowa on Feb. 1, and hopes to leave there with momentum to help him in the next states: New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t been campaigning much in New Hampshire, to the consternation of some Republican admirers; after the Atlanta fund-raiser he caught a flight to New Hampshire, where he is doing two meet-and-greet events on Thursday. He\u2019ll hold a fund-raiser in Boston on Thursday night before moving on to Iowa for three days of campaigning.", "byline": "PATRICK HEALY", "description": "Gov.
