Lynn Westmoreland plans to offer an amendment to House Republican Conference rules that would force members running for leadership positions to vacate their current posts and give up any committee gavels they wield.\nThe Georgia lawmaker said the proposed rules change was not directed at House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), or any other specific member.\nStory Continued Below\nBut he did cite the race for House majority leader as an example for why the change needs to happen. Scalise is running against Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price (Ga.) for the position. Under current House rules, Scalise could remain whip if he loses. Alternately, Price would continue to be head of the budget panel if he loses.\n\"I just don't think it's fair that everybody just keeps moving up the ladder with no rise of losing anything,\" Westmoreland said. \"They've been on the phone all weekend, taking away from family time calling people. It's just been a constant thing and it will probably go on for eight days. They've been working their butts off.\"\nReps. Markwayne Mullins (Okla.), Pete Sessions (Texas), Dennis Ross (Fla.) and Patrick McHenry (N.C.), current chief deputy whip, are all running to replace Scalise in the No. 3 leadership slot.\n\"Who do you think they are going to support for leader \u2014 they've got to get [Scalise] out of the whip's chair before they can get in it. So, it really makes it unfair in a way,\" Westmoreland noted about the aspirants for the whip position.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Leadership hopefuls could be forced to give up current posts", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/house-leadership-hopefuls-amendment-vacate-posts-214289", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Kyle Cheney", "Kenneth P.
