But Eric Hothem, now a broker for J.P Morgan in Washington D.C., has a strikingly similar name \u2013 and deep ties to the Clintons\u2019 checkered past. Neither he nor his wife Sue Hothem, a well-connected D.C. fundraiser who works as vice president of membership for TechNet, could be reached for comment Thursday.\n\nEric Hothem\u2019s name first surfaced as part of Clinton lore when, in 2001 as the first lady\u2019s aide, he apparently was tied to the removal of several thousand dollars\u2019 worth of furniture and gifts from The White House to the Clintons\u2019 homes -- property the Park Service and White House Chief Usher Gary Walters maintained belonged to the White House.\u00a0\n\nBarbara Olson, a well-known lawyer and conservative commentator who died in the 9/11 attacks, wrote about the controversy in her book, \u201cThe Final Days: The Last, Desperate Abuses of Power by the Clinton White House.\u201d She noted some of the art items taken were part of a White House Americans Craft Collection.\n\n\u201cThe National Archives confirmed that the art pieces had been shipped to an Arkansas warehouse, and White House curator Betty Monkman said the decision to move them was made by \u2018Mrs. Clinton herself,\u2019\u201d Olson wrote in her book, published after she died in the 2001 attack on the Pentagon.\n\nShe wrote that in January 2000, the Clintons began shipping furniture to their Chappaqua home, \u201cdespite concerns raised by White House chief usher Gary Walters about whether they were entitled to remove the items. Walters rightly believed they were part of a $396,000 White House redecoration project in 1993.\u201d\n\nAccording to Olson\u2019s book, Hothem told Walters the items were the Clintons\u2019 personal property.\n\nWhile the Clintons were forced to return some of the furnishings, and pay $86,000 for the gifts, \u201cNo one for sure knows how much the Clintons got away with,\u201d Olson wrote.\n\nHothem\u2019s name also is associated with a second controversy, detailed in a 2002 House Government Reform Committee report, \u201cJustice Undone, Clemency Decisions in the Clinton White House,\u201d which examined President Clinton\u2019s most controversial pardons and clemencies.\n\nAs a part of its investigation, the committee looked into the finances of Bill Clinton\u2019s brother, Roger Clinton, noting he received $335,000 in \u201cunexplained travelers checks,\u201d \u201cpurchased overseas and likely imported illegally.\u201d\n\nBut Roger Clinton also accepted a $15,000 transfer the president made to him from a Citibank account -- associated with Hothem \u2013 at the time the committee was trying to get Roger Clinton\u2019s cooperation.\n\n\u201cOn March 23, 2001, while the committee was attempting to obtain the cooperation of Roger Clinton, he received a wire transfer of $15,000 from a Citibank account entitled \u2018E.C. 934(A) c/o Eric Hothem. Eric Hothem was an aide to First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton,\u201d the congressional report said.\n\nThe report says that when contacted about the transfer, \u201cHothem\u2019s lawyer referred the Committee to the President\u2019s lawyer, David Kendall.\u201d\n\nKendall told the committee the account was a personal one of the Clintons and the money was a loan by the president to his brother for legal counsel.\n\nThe committee said it was \u201cunclear whether Roger Clinton has repaid or intends to repay the money\u201d but noted \u201cthe payment occurred at the height of public outcry and investigative activity regarding pardons at a time when Roger Clinton was deciding whether to provide testimony to the committee and authorities in that Southern District of New York.\u201d\n\nHothem also was among several \u201cfriends and colleagues\u201d Clinton credited in her autobiography as having checked facts, reviewed drafts and shared memories.\n\nIt remains unclear what role, if any, Hothem might have played in setting up Clinton computer system. The revelation that she relied exclusively on private email, and used her own unique server, has raised transparency questions for the former secretary, who is widely expected to launch a 2016 presidential run.\n\nClinton, though, announced late Wednesday via Twitter that she has asked the State Department to make public the emails she has turned over.\n\n\"I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible,\" she wrote.\n\nA Clinton spokesman could not be reached for comment on Thursday.", "byline": "", "description": "A former aide to Hillary Clinton during her first lady years \u2013 who was tied to two earlier Clinton family political scandals -- has surfaced in connection to the mounting controversy over her Internet and email practices.", "title": "Aide tied to past Clinton scandals surfaces in controversy over emails", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/imWUX-wL55s/", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Bill Clinton", "Roger Clinton", "David Kendall", "Hillary Clinton", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Eric Hoteham"], "orgs": ["Clintons", "State Department", "Pentagon", "National Archives", "Citibank"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-03-05 22:53:08", "org": "fox", "article_id": "2533d9f1ca14f3ab186314421516d9a0", "date_access": "2015-03-05 23:33:50.536331"}
