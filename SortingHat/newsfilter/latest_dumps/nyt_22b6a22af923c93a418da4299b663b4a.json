{"body": "Who in Trumpland really sent The Tweet?\n\nThat is the question now fluttering around the Internet after Donald J. Trump said a campaign intern had sent a Twitter post that mocked Iowans \u2014 and then another intern on his campaign suggested that was not plausible.\n\nThe Twitter tempest started when the popular Twitter account of Mr. Trump, who fell behind Ben Carson in polls of Iowans this week, retweeted a fan who playfully suggested that Iowans had brain impairments because of the corn they eat \u2014  a no-no for any presidential candidate seeking to win over the state.\n\n\u2014 Nicolas R-V (@mygreenhippo) October 22, 2015\n\n\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear whether campaign interns actually have access to Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter account. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Mr. Trump said that he himself tapped out many of his tweets and dictated the rest to his assistant and his head of social media. Neither are interns.\n\nBut a campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said that an intern was among those who controlled Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter profile while he was on the road.\n\n\u201cThere are a handful of people, including an intern, who have access to Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter account,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Friday, the digital news company International Business Times quoted what it said was a Trump campaign intern who said that neither he nor his fellow interns had the ability to use the candidate\u2019s account, casting doubt on Mr. Trump\u2019s explanation.\n\n\u201cAs an intern for the internal headquarters campaign, we do not manage or in that case have any access to Mr. Trump\u2019s personal Twitter,\u201d the intern, identified as Garrison Groeschke, told the Business Times, which said that Mr. Groeschke\u2019s personal website and LinkedIn profile listed him as a 2016 Trump intern.", "byline": "MICHAEL BARBARO", "description": "Who in Trumpland sent The Tweet?
