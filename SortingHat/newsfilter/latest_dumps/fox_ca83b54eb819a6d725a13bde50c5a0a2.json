Now it\u2019s clear his team is setting up an operation that would give Biden the option of a late launch if he decides to hit the go button.\nPerhaps the clearest indication is this leak to the moderator of \u201cMeet the Press\u201d:\n\u201cJill Biden, sources tell NBC's Chuck Todd, is 100 percent on-board with a presidential run, despite reports indicating her hesitation is part of what's keeping Biden from jumping into the race.\u201d The second lady\u2019s office even put out a statement saying she is behind her husband if he chooses to make the race.\nThis followed a Wall Street Journal piece quoting \u201cpeople familiar with the matter\u201d as saying:\n\n\u201cVice President\u00a0Joe Biden\u2019s aides in recent days called Democratic donors and supporters to suggest he is more likely than not to enter the 2016 race, and their discussions have shifted toward the timing of an announcement.\u201d But there was a caveat: \u201cUnless they change their minds.\u201d\nAnd that, in turn, followed a Journal piece in late August saying Biden \u201cis increasingly leaning toward entering the race if it is still possible he can knit together a competitive campaign at this late date.\u201d\nBut now Biden is telling the Catholic magazine America: \u201cWe\u2019re just not there yet, and I may not get there in time to make it feasible to be able to run.\u201d\nSo I\u2019m a little dizzy. But I do know that Biden can\u2019t wait much longer. A series of state filing deadlines is approaching, and if he\u2019s going to run, he should be on stage at the first Democratic debate on Oct. 13.\nA new CNN poll gives Hillary a nice bump to 42 percent among Democrats\u2014maybe doing more interviews wasn\u2019t such a bad move\u2014with Bernie Sanders at 24 percent and Biden at 22. That\u2019s impressive for a guy who isn\u2019t running, but keep in mind it also reflects that he isn\u2019t being attacked.\nLet\u2019s say Biden makes his third bid for the presidency. What is his rationale, other than that Hillary\u2019s campaign is faltering?\nAs the veep complains about income inequality and the middle class getting screwed, how does he explain the Obama-Biden administration\u2019s failure to do more for the last seven years?\nOther than Hillary being a bit more hawkish, how does Biden differentiate his record from hers? Is he willing to personally attack the first potential female president\u2014and if not, why is he running?\nIn a year when voters crave authenticity, Joe is the real deal, a great retail campaigner. But the flip side is that his big mouth has also gotten him into trouble again and again.\nBiden knows the toll of the campaign ordeal, and he knows it\u2019s time to decide. Either way it will be a BFD.\nClick for more Media Buzz\nmedia-buzz\n\nMedia Buzz, hosted by Howard Kurtz, airs on Sundays at 11AM and 5PM ET on Fox News Channel.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this show\n\n\n\n", "byline": "", "description": "Joe Biden is inching closer to a presidential run\u2014or is he?", "title": "Biden\u2019s running!
