{"body": "It\u2019s not known whether Donald Trump is a fan of Ralph Waldo Emerson, but there seems little doubt he would be in total agreement with one of Mr. Emerson\u2019s most famous essays \u201cSelf-Reliance.\u201d\n\u201cA foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen\u2026Speak what you think now in hard words and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict everything you said to-day.\u201d\nIt can be hard to pin down Mr. Trump\u2019s policy positions, and that\u2019s probably the point. Mr. Trump is nothing if not flexible, especially on economic and tax issues.\nMr. Trump\u2019s positions are a reflection of the populist campaign he is running, appealing not only to far-right conservatives but also swing/independents who are open to a soak-the-rich message.\nWhat he doesn\u2019t seem concerned about is appealing to the Republican establishment.\nMr. Trump\u2019s 2011 book \u201cTime to Get Tough\u201d has just been reissued in paperback with a new subtitle to match his campaign slogan \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d\nIn the book Mr. Trump suggests calculating taxes on imports based on how much a country\u2019s currency is devalued and setting a 25% tax on Chinese goods if they don\u2019t set a real market value on their currency. In an interview with The Economist this week, he suggested a 12% tariff on Chinese products.\nUnlike most Republican politicians, he has not shrunk from taking on Club for Growth, an antitax group he called \u201cpathetic\u201d in a recent tweet, and has refused to sign the pledge circulated by Americans For Tax Reform not to raise taxes.\nThe Trump campaign has said it plans to release details of his tax plan sometime in the next few weeks, but in recent statements Mr. Trump has given indications of his thinking. He has said he wants to simplify the tax code and lower rates especially on the middle class.\nIn a recent Fox News interview Mr. Trump said he favored a flat tax but then immediately said such a system would be unfair because the rich would be taxed at the same rate as the poor.\nHe has also said he thinks the wealthy should pay more, a view that polls show is popular with most voters across the ideological spectrum.\nHe has also said corporate taxes should be cut, and has been highly critical of companies that acquire overseas firms and move their headquarters out of the U.S. in order to pay lower taxes. \u00a0Mr. Trump has called for a crackdown on these corporate inversions and has also said tax policy should favor companies that create U.S. jobs and punish those who outsource, but without giving specifics on how to accomplish that.\nA favorite target of Mr. Trump is hedge fund managers (a group less popular with voters than politicians). Calling them \u201cpaper pushers,\u201d Mr. Trump has said in a number of recent interviews and appearances that they should pay more in taxes and he would go after the tax code\u2019s \u201ccarried interest\u201d loophole, which allows investment managers to pay the lower capital gains tax rate on most of their income.\nThe theme running through all of these positions is their appeal to a broad spectrum of voters without concern about hewing too closely to Republican orthodoxy.\nAs The Economist has written, \u201cTrump\u2019s mix of charismatic personal authority and populist pandering has allowed Mr. Trump to rise to the top of the polls while playing fast and loose with conservative doctrine.\u201d\nAnyone who is still writing off Mr. Trump as a political na\u00eff and buffoon had better think again.\nLinda Killian is a journalist and a senior scholar at the\u00a0Woodrow Wilson Center.
