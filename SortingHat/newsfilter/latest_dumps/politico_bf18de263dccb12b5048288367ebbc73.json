The Department of Energy will send $2.48 billion back to the Treasury this week. Pro's Darius Dixon has the story: \"The refunds amount to a small portion of the $31.8 billion sent to DOE in the massive 2009 stimulus law, but they are emblematic of the struggles 'clean coal' has faced in recent years. Of the money that DOE is returning, $1.27 billion was set aside for carbon capture projects that failed to win agency approval because of cost overruns, tricky negotiations and lengthy regulatory hurdles....DOE's authority to spend that money expires with the end of the 2015 fiscal year on Wednesday, and the four projects \u2014 in Louisiana, Illinois, Texas and California \u2014 simply won't meet necessary milestones in time. The rest of the $1.21 billion in unspent DOE funds come from about 8,000 other projects.\" http://politico.pro/1GedY47\nStory Continued Below\nThe EPA's new source rule caps carbon emissions from new coal-fired power plants at 1,400 lbs/MWh, a rate that almost certainly would require carbon capture and storage. The difficulty in developing the technology could create a legal infirmity for the rule. \nJEB TO SHOW HE'S HIGH ENERGY:  Jeb Bush will release his energy policy in Pennsylvania today, and given the general agreement on resource extraction among Republican presidential candidates, there aren'tmany surprises. His campaign previewed the release last night, and Bush will call for lifting the crude oil export ban, getting rid of EPA climate regulations, building the Keystone XL pipeline and giving states more say over where to drill, reports Pro's Darren Goode. \u201cTaken together, these policies will fully unleash the energy revolution creating more jobs, higher wages, cheaper gas and cheaper electricity while better protecting our interests abroad and our environment,\u201d Bush will say. But he avoids delving into climate change, a topic where he's been more moderate than many of his GOP rivals. \nBut else might he say? Francis Dietz, a vice president for public affairs for the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, told ME he expects Bush to promote \"nuclear and natural gas and streamlining the permitting process for upgrades to the transmission grid.\" Bob Inglis, a former Republican Congressman who now works to find free-market solutions to climate change, told ME, \"what I hope to hear is that the plan will rely on market forces to accomplish a repowering of our lives. I think this something he can build on what his brother did in Texas. I understand George W. Bush appointed a public consumer commission that did public choice in electricity \u2014 that's exciting stuff, and it's working in Texas.\"\nRice Energy, where Bush will discuss his energy policy, \"has amassed 121 violations and more than a half a million dollars in fines since 2010,\" according to the Huffington Post. Depending on who you talk to, that makes the company a serial polluter or a victim of regulatory overreach. Either way, it seems fitting that regulatory issues should horn their way into the moment. \nHAPPY TUESDAY! I'm your host Eric Wolff, and what have I got to say about water on Mars? Forget it, Jake.

Ozone levels have dropped 33% since 1980. So why is the EPA considering a new ozone standard that could be the costliest in U.S. history? Keep the current standard. http://www.nam.org/ozone **\nPOLITICO PRESENTS: \"AMERICA'S ENERGY AGENDA: WHAT'S NEXT?\" POLITICO hosts a conversation Thursday on assessing the market aftermath of Obama's climate change rules and energy policies, and the growing pressure on pipeline infrastructure. The event features Jason Bordoff, Founding Director, Center on Global Energy Policy, Columbia University; Tony Clark, Commissioner, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; Marty Durbin, President & CEO, America's Natural Gas Alliance; Senator John Hoeven (R-N.D.); Jane Kleeb, Founder, Bold Nebraska; Miles Keogh, Director of Grants & Research, National Association of Regulatory Utility Regulators; Lena Moffitt, Dirty Fuels Campaign Director, Sierra Club; Bob Perciasepe, President, Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. RSVP: http://politi.co/1iAGF5K\nFIRST SALESMAN TRIES TO WIN INDIA OVER TO CLIMATE ACTION: With all the hoopla on Monday surrounding President Barack Obama's speech to the United Nations General Assembly and his face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, you could be forgiven for overlooking the most important item on the day\u2019s schedule for climate-watchers: Obama\u2019s chat with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Obama told reporters after the meeting that much of the discussion focused on climate change and he signaled that India \u2014 long a skeptic of any agreement that would burden developing countries \u2014 is more committed than ever to reaching a climate deal in Paris later this year. \u201cWe agreed that this is a critical issue for the world \u2014 that all of us have responsibilities,\u201d Obama said, adding that India\u2019s \u201cleadership in this upcoming conference will set the tone not just for today but for decades to come.\u201d Keenly aware that India won\u2019t undertake any policies that stalls its economic development, Obama stressed that the climate deal \u201ccan actually be an engine of growth over the long term.\u201d\nDespite the happy talk, Indian officials have signaled \u2014 most recently in an interview with E&E News \u2014 that they\u2019ll maintain their long-standing demands for greater climate finance and some semblance of a division of responsibility between developed and developing countries. The real test of India\u2019s commitment to the climate negotiations will come when the country unveils its domestic climate change submission to the United Nations \u2014 likely later this week. India is the only big carbon emitter that hasn\u2019t delivered its plan.\nSHUTDOWN WATCH: ME's rickety old Government-shutdown-o-meter remains at 1 out of 10, meaning the meter expects Congress and the president to find a way to fund the government for a little while longer. Nonetheless, federal agencies must prepare for the possibility that the money will stop flowing when the calendar flips to Oct. 1. As in days of yore, ME has a quick rundown of the contingency plans of some key energy-related agencies: \nIN BATTLE OF OFFSHORE BLUSTER, NY BEATING OUT NJ: Offshore wind power would seem to a tempting offer for the New York City metro area: Power generation close to a demand center with no attendant air pollution and no need to take up valuable land. Both New York and New Jersey would seem like candidates to get in the game, but as POLITICO New Jersey's David Giambusso reports, \"Offshore wind development has languished in a bureaucratic mire for the better part of [NJ] Gov. Chris Christie's tenure and critics say it will likely remain there until he leaves office. About 50 miles to the northeast, however, clean energy developers and state policymakers are expressing increased optimism over the future of wind power off the New York coast...'The moral of the story is we can't get the executive branch of the state government to get behind wind energy,' said New Jersey state Sen. Bob Smith.\" \nMOONSHOT: $20 MILLION TO MAKE WASTE CO2 USEFUL: The XPRIZE Foundation \u2014 the same people who sponsored the prize for the first private low-earth orbit \u2014 will announce today a new contest to see if anyone can take waste carbon dioxide and convert it into a saleable product. The NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE announcement argues that given that fossil fuels provide most of the energy to power the world, it would be useful to make something else with all that carbon, like, as the contest animation suggests, building materials. ME suggests pumping the carbon into a giant greenhouse and growing really, really tall trees. XPRIZE folks, please deliver the cash to POLITICO's new office. Think of all the snacks it would buy! \nGAS UTILITIES THINK THERE'S ENOUGH PIPELINE SAFETY LAWS FOR NOW: A subcommittee of the Senate Transportation and Infrastructure committee will meet today to discuss pipeline safety, the second held by Chairwoman Deb Fischer on the topic. There have been several high profile pipeline accidents in recent years, notably the deadly San Bruno explosion and more recently, the oil spill in Santa Barbara. According to his prepared remarks, Terry McCallister, chairman of the American Gas Association, which represents gas utilities, will tell the committee that existing programs simply need more time to work: Recently passed laws \"created numerous programs to further improve industry safety.... Many of these programs are in the early stages, and we encourage Congress to allow them to mature. In the case of the unanimously passed 2011 Act, several required regulations have yet to be finalized.\"\nREADING GLASSES ON: TAX INCENTIVES COULD GIVE RENEWABLES AN EDGE: Any tax changes that improve depreciation treatment for energy companies helps solar and wind more than fossil fuel generators, says a report out today from the Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s American Energy Innovation Council. The report models the potential effects of recent tax proposals on renewable and fossil fuel generation. \nAD WATCH NORTH CAROLINA: The National Religious Partnership for the Environment will launch a five-figure ad campaign with a 30-second television spot that will run for a week in Raleigh-Durham. The ad is intended to put pressure on Sen. Richard Burr to reinstate the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The program, which buys up private property located inside national parks and other protected land, will run out on Sept. 30. \nTRYING TO CRACK EPA'S ARMOR: Rep. Lynn Westmoreland will introduce today the second of his trio of bills intended to break down the legal immunity EPA has when it causes disasters like the recent King Mine spill. Today's bill will require the EPA to reimburse the Judgement Fund if and when it loses a liability case due to an accident. \nMOVER, SHAKER, NUCLEAR: Aside from the new day-to-day manager, reported in yesterday\u2019s ME, NRC has announced several more personnel shifts. The new head of the Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research will be Mike Weber, currently the deputy executive director overseeing compliance, waste and other programs. Weber replaces Brian Sheron, who will retire in November after a long career at the NRC that began in 1976. Jennifer Uhle, the engineering chief in the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, will take over the Office of New Reactors. And Catherine Haney, director of nuclear materials safety and safeguards, will become the NRC's Region 2 administrator in January. She replaces Victor McCree, whose will be the NRC's executive director of operations.\nQUICK HITS \n\"Snow-capped peaks of 'Blood & Oil' get panned by North Dakota\u2019s oil patch,\" Reuters: http://reut.rs/1RcGVUx\n\"Marco Rubio: I\u2019m Not a Sinologist, Man,\" NY Mag: http://nym.ag/1FyItXZ\n\"Assessing the Human Toll of Volkswagen\u2019s Diesel Deception,\" NYT: http://nyti.ms/1RcHMVl\n\"Duke, state haggling over fine for leaky coal ash pond,\" WRAL: http://bit.ly/1NYziB2\n\"How investors plan to make money in renewable energy,\" Fortune: http://for.tn/1VnuXYH\n\"In smog battle, industry gets help from unlikely source: black business group,\" WaPo: http://wapo.st/1P331tn\nTHAT'S ALL FOR ME!\nNOW AVAILABLE: POLITICO PRO EUROPE BRIEF \u2013POLITICO Pro, POLITICO\u2019s premium subscription service, has launched a new product dedicated to making sense of European policy and politics through an American lens.
