(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)  CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2013 As Congress races toward its long summer recess, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is confident that he\u2019ll get a vote to bar any taxpayer funds going to Planned Parenthood. \u201cThere\u2019s a nationwide movement that we\u2019ve been leading,\u201d Paul said in an interview, after participating in a town hall with military veterans. \u201cWe will probably send a million emails out on this subject. I think by motivating the grassroots, there\u2019s a very good chance we\u2019ll get a vote on this.\u201d Paul\u2019s confidence came just a day after a special Sunday session of the Senate seemed to put the lid on any wishlist conservative amendment. July has been a most cruel month for that sort of thing, and especially cruel to Paul\u2019s presidential rival Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). After Cruz accused Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of a \u201cflat-out lie\u201d to save the Export-Import Bank from phasing out, he watched colleagues line up against him and with the leader. For Republicans, the politics of abortion are far less fraught than the politics of a New Deal-era investment bank that\u2019s backed by the Chamber of Commerce. The release of undercover interviews with Planned Parenthood executives, in which they antiseptically discuss the sale of fetal body parts, has elevated the cause of defunding the group. And Paul has a much better relationship than Cruz with McConnell, his state's senior senator. Paul said he didn't think his amendment would happen on the highway bill, but that he'd submitted a discharge petition that is a separate request for a new bill. \"I think there\u2019s a very good chance that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said. Planned Parenthood\u2019s defenders have accused Republicans of misrepresenting what the organization does, pointing out that it is illegal for taxpayer funds to pay for abortion. Paul said it was unclear whether the law was being followed. \u201cI think it should be investigated,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem here really is not just whether it\u2019s illegal to buy and sell the organs, but whether the taxpayer dollars should be going to a group that is sort of manipulating and turning the baby around to get access to organs. I think most people were horrified by them.\u201d That raised another question: Whether it should be legal, at all, for the bodies of aborted fetuses to be sold for science. \u201cI think that there should not be any financial incentives to get an abortion,\u201d said Paul. \u201cNow, they would argue that it just covers the cost, but any time money changes hands \u2013 even if it\u2019s to a nonprofit group \u2013 that is a real question. Really, we probably shouldn\u2019t be doing research on these babies, because you would hate to think there is any kind of incentive for that to occur. \"Donating tissue when you die is an incredibly noble thing. I\u2019ve worked with donated corneas to give people back vision. But this baby really didn\u2019t have a choice. Some people are horrified by the idea of having factories where you\u2019d grow babies for their body parts. Will technology allow that? Technology probably almost already does allow that. But should a civilized society allow that? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. The battle to defund Planned Parenthood has become a major focus of America\u2019s anti-abortion movement. Paul said he did not see the need to go further and challenge Title X funding for family planning. One of the arguments against Planned Parenthood getting any money, he said, is the level of spending on other forms of government care. He pointed to funding for community health centers, which surged under both President George W. Bush and President Obama. \"Community health centers do everything Planned Parenthood does, except for abortion. So, you also have Obamacare. You\u2019ve got free contraception everywhere in the country now. You\u2019ve got free health insurance,\" he said. \"I really don\u2019t think there is a role for Planned Parenthood to get any money. Many times, when they say \u2018we do this or that function,\u2019 they refer that to community health centers. I do think that we\u2019ve got plenty of other government venues without this.\u201d \u00a0 ", "byline": "", "description": "\"There\u2019s a very good chance we\u2019ll get a vote on this,\u201d he said.", "title": "Rand Paul says the GOP can defund Planned Parenthood before the recess", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/07/27/rand-paul-says-the-gop-can-defund-planned-parenthood-before-the-recess/", "topics": ["health", "abortion"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "George W.
