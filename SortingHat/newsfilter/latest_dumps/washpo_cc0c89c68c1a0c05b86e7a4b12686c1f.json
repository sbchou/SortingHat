{"body": "   KANSAS CITY, Kan. \u2014 It took a while for Edgar Galicia to realize that maybe Donald Trump had done him a favor. As it turns out, Trump\u2019s disparaging comments about Mexicans have been a morale boost to Latinos who consider the sharp public rebuke of the billionaire Republican presidential candidate evidence that they are a rising force in the United States. \u201cAt first I was upset. I felt insulted\u201d when Trump called Mexicans \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201crapists,\u201d said Galicia, a graphic designer and business leader in Kansas who is from Mexico. \u201cNow I see this as the wake-up moment, the time when our eyes were opened to our power.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an \u2018aha!\u2019 moment,\u201d agreed CiCi Rojas, chief executive of Central Exchange, a large women\u2019s business group in the Midwest. \u201cThis has ignited the ordinary person, those of Hispanic heritage. It\u2019s motivating and mobilizing.\u201d Nationwide, Latino leaders say they are energized by the response from Macy\u2019s, NBC, NASCAR, Serta and a growing list of other companies that have severed ties with Trump because of his remarks. Latinos lit up social media and online petitions to complain, and their concerns were heard. Trump, however unintentionally, many said, has triggered what some are calling \u201cthe Latino moment.\u201d         1 of 9       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                         Skip Ad   \u00d7           Cutting ties with Trump: Who has dumped him and why      View Photos   The GOP presidential hopeful has faced an avalanche of criticism over his characterization of illegal immigrants.

You can\u2019t do that and get away with it,\u201d he said. The country\u2019s stunning demographic changes have a lot to do with the new corporate and mainstream respect Latinos are feeling. Nationally, the number of Hispanics has soared from 9\u00a0million in 1970 to 55\u00a0million \u2014 nearly one in six Americans. In California, the number of people who identify themselves as Hispanic surpasses those who classify themselves as white, according to a new census report. In many parts of the Midwest, Latinos are driving population growth, such as in this city in Kansas where Latinos account for more than 30\u00a0percent of its 150,000 residents. In the past 15 years, a swell of Latino immigrants moved here and reversed a steady decline in population, said Mayor Mark Holland, a fourth-generation Kansan. He said that big grocery stores know their customers and that they stock, for example, a wide variety of salsas and other Latin American specialties.   Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump criticized U.S. immigration and trade policies in a speech that veered from accusing Mexico of deliberately sending criminals to the United States to professing respect for the Mexican government. (AP)   Holland, a Protestant pastor, said many Latinos are Catholic and buy \u201cJesus candles\u201d \u2014 which come in jars that have Jesus\u2019s likeness on them \u2014 so now they can be found those in grocery stores, too. The mayor says his city is richer for its diversity. \u201cWhat Trump has done is pull back the thin veil of racism underlying the immigration debate\u201d and arguments against a path to citizenship for law-abiding, hardworking Latinos, he said. Holland said Trump\u2019s unapologetic bashing of Mexicans has started \u201ca great coming-out party\u201d for Latinos, who are saying, \u201cWe are here. We don\u2019t have to pretend we are not.\u201d Even Latinos who haven\u2019t paid much attention to politics are tuning in \u2014 Trump\u2019s remarks are featured prominently on Spanish-language television, Facebook and Twitter, and anti-Trump chants have become wildly popular at televised soccer matches. \u201cPeople who normally don\u2019t talk about politics are\u201d now doing so, said Cris Medina, chief executive of Guadalupe Centers, which provide social services in the Kansas City metro area. \u201cThis has focused them on the candidates.\u201d Medina said he went from being \u201cmad at Trump\u201d to being \u201cmobilized by Trump\u201d when he realized that the negative comments were uniting Latinos from Puerto Rico, Guatemala and many other countries and causing them to pay attention to the presidential campaign. Medina said he has heard only \u201cdisappointing\u201d or \u201clukewarm responses\u201d from most Republican candidates \u2014 although he thinks Jeb Bush \u201cgets it more, understands more,\u201d noting that Bush\u2019s wife was born in Mexico. But he said he thinks Democrats have been more forcefully repudiating Trump and embracing immigration reform. On Monday, just across the river in Kansas City, Mo., Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley will be addressing thousands of Latinos at the annual convention of the National Council of La Raza, a national civil rights advocacy group. What they have to say about immigration is drawing new interest \u2014 and more media coverage by Spanish-language media outlets \u2014 partly because of Trump\u2019s remarks. Vargas, of NALEO, said it is unclear how the Trump fallout will affect other Republican candidates because \u201cTrump is such an outlandish character.\u201d But, he added, \u201cI think Donald Trump will go down in history like Pete Wilson,\u201d referring to the Republican governor of California in the mid-1990s who backed Proposition 187, an anti-immigrant bill that caused enormous backlash among Latinos. On Saturday, Trump continued to rail against undocumented immigrants, telling a large crowd gathered in Arizona: \u201cWe have to take back the heart of our country.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. These are people that shouldn\u2019t be in our country. They flow in like water.\u201d There will always be those who do not want people in their neighborhood who speak another language or look a little different, many Latinos said. But Latinos have \u201creached a turning point,\u201d said Carlos Gomez, president of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Greater Kansas City. They realize they have clout, especially if they stand together, noting that Latino purchasing power is estimated at more than $1.5\u00a0trillion. Before Trump started his anti-Mexican rant, Macy\u2019s had been making a pitch to Latinos, Gomez said, recalling a prominent ad by the retailer featuring mariachis this spring. \u201cIt\u2019s a special time\u201d he said, because big U.S. corporations are standing with them, telling them they matter. He said the message Latinos are hearing is: \u201cYou are the customer. You are the voter.\u201d ", "byline": "", "description": "KANSAS CITY, Kan. \u2014 It took a while for Edgar Galicia to realize that maybe Donald Trump had done him a favor.As it turns out, Trump\u2019s disparaging comments about Mexicans have been a morale boost to Latinos who consider the sharp public rebuke of the billionaire Republican presidential candidate evidence that they are a rising force in the United States.Read full article >>", "title": "The mainstream response to Donald Trump affirms Latino political power", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636635/s/48162bd8/sc/7/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cpolitics0Cthe0Emainstream0Eresponse0Eto0Edonald0Etrump0Eaffirms0Elatino0Epolitical0Epower0C20A150C0A70C120C678e440A50E676a0E4440A0Eb23d0E2cc18fa294850Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Inational/story01.htm", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Jeb Bush", "Mayor Mark Holland", "Martin O'Malley", "Carlos Gomez", "Jose Andres", "Sarah L.
