Maybe two. \u00a0But if you're doing it for a second time you're actually under more scrutiny the second time around than the first. That's why I still remain stunned at the stupidity of Hillary Clinton's email scandal. She had to have known it would be a big problem. The big question now is -- how much will it affect her likely candidacy down the road?\n\nAfter the news first came out, polls showed Clinton hadn't been hurt by the revelations. People who liked her before still did -- and people who didn't -- didn't. But now the new swing state polls should make Hillary Clinton\u2019s advisors nervous. \u00a0As we discussed, in the key swing states like Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania .. her numbers have dropped in favorability. \u00a0But as any pollster will tell you, it\u2019s the negative numbers that can matter the most. \u00a0And when you look at just Florida alone, Clinton\u2019s unfavorable scores rose from 39 percent in February to 46 percent in march.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt appears one press conference didn't do the trick to change voters' minds.
