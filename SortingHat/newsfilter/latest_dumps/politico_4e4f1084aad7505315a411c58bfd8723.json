Marco\u2019s turning a lemon of a New York Times story into lemonade. And in Tallahassee lawmakers are \u2013gasp!-- doing their jobs, by getting ready to pass a budget at the last possible moment. And, yes, in the headline and below I used the Tallahassee term \u201cturkeys\u201d for hometown/special spending items. Y\u2019all can just call it pork. First, let\u2019s check in with Florida\u2019s most-crowded congressional GOP primary, CD-18\nStory Continued Below\n5 Rs & COUNTING FOR CD-18 \u2013 The Republican race to replace Rep. Patrick Murphy will have five announced candidates after today now that retired Army vet Brian Mast and former Palm Beach County business owner Rick Kozzell join the fray. Other candidates include Martin County school board member Rebecca Negron, St. Lucie County Commissioner Tod Mowery and former state Rep./2014 GOP nominee Carl Domino. FOX pundit Noelle Nikpour and former Secret Service agent Dan Bongino might run as well.\n--Mast is a decorated vet who lost both legs in an IED blast. His website is here: http://bit.ly/1Ix20Io.\n-- Kozzell served as a law clerk in the United States Senate\u2019s Judiciary Committee and worked for Sen. George LeMieux. His campaign website is here http://bit.ly/1dpH3Bu\nIF TURKEYS WERE HORSES, LAWMAKERS WOULD RIDE \u2013 \u201cSenate budget \u2018linkage\u2019 includes old-fashioned horse-trading,\u201d by The Tampa Bay Times\u2019 Steve Bousquet: \u201cThe second day of House-Senate budget negotiations Sunday was quieter than the first but Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, kept things interesting. ... Latvala did some old-fashioned horse trading -- a tradition as old as the Legislature itself -- and he did it in public\u2026. He offered to include $1 million for a new \u2018Military Museum of South Florida\u2019 if the House would support a project in his district: $1 million to expand East Lake Community Library in Palm Harbor. Latvala offered to find money for two highway projects in Broward if the House would support a Riviera Beach highway beautification and a new water taxi in Clearwater to reduce congestion on State Road 60, the main route to Clearwater beach.\u201d http://bit.ly/1FJAW1C\n--\u201cBudget Conference, Day 2: \u2018I\u2019ll Arm Wrestle You For It\u2019\u201d By The Naples Daily News\u2019 Matt Dixon: http://bit.ly/1RWzbqo\nWHAT\u2019S LEFT -- \u201cFlorida legislators still divided over key spending items,\u201d by AP\u2019s Gary Fineout: \u201cLegislative leaders have reached agreement on broad spending parameters, but remain at odds over the specifics, including dozens of hometown projects sought by lawmakers. Over the past two days they have been haggling over everything from $10 million for a project at the Kennedy Space Center to $400,000 for a trail planned to be built adjacent to a private toll road in northern Leon County. ... Both sides have agreed to roughly boost spending on each public school student by 3 percent. But Senate Republicans also want to attach to the budget other changes, including changing the eligibility criteria for a scholarship program aimed at children with disabilities and the eligibility for the state's popular Bright Futures college scholarship program. ... House and Senate budget negotiators are also at odds over how to carry out Amendment 1, the land conservation measure passed last fall by voters. One big sticking point is whether to borrow money to help pay for both Everglades restoration and land acquisition. House leaders are in favor of borrowing the money, while the Senate is opposed. In the past Gov. Rick Scott has strongly opposed borrowing money to pay for construction projects or land buying.\u201d http://apne.ws/1T5UYNU\n--Budget deal set, but Scott still a wild card,\u201d by The Sarasota Herald-Tribune\u2019s Lloyd Dunkelberger: \u201cThe final budget deal is likely to leave Scott short on some of his session priorities, including $673 million in tax cuts and record per-student funding in the public school system. The final budget will have tax cuts and higher K-12 spending, but it is not likely to reach the level that Scott had urged lawmakers to adopt. Another issue with the governor could be the House and Senate agreement to use state funding to make up for a portion of the reduction in the federal hospital funding program, known as the \u2018Low Income Pool,\u2019 from its current $2.2 billion to $1 billion in the coming year. Scott opposes the use of state funding to \u2018backfill\u2019 the LIP shortfall.\u201d http://bit.ly/1FDLBMd\nLIP PATCH -- \u201cBudget negotiators agree to spend $400 million to offset loss of LIP,\u201d by The Miami Herald\u2019s Mary Ellen Klas: \u201cThe proposal would draw down $604 million in federal funds and offset most of the $1.2 billion loss in federal Low Income Pool funds for the 2015-16 budget year. It would put the $1 billion into raising reimbursement rates for hospitals.\u201d http://bit.ly/1FDLtw6\nPOLS LOVE SUBSIDIES. FOR THEMSELVES -- \u201cFlorida lawmakers, most of whom oppose Medicaid expansion, benefit from generous tax-subsidized health insurance,\u201d by The Miami Herald\u2019s Mary Ellen Klas: \u201cOne of the chief arguments Florida House Republicans made Friday when they rejected the Senate plan to help 600,000 working poor get health insurance is that it would create a taxpayer-funded entitlement and would be hard to repeal. What they didn\u2019t mention during the debate is that they are entitled to a very generous health insurance package that costs $22,000 a year \u2014 with premiums mostly covered by Florida taxpayers. And, over the years, they have rejected any attempts by Gov. Rick Scott to reduce the benefit.\u201d http://hrld.us/1JwsDxw\nTHE JEB LOBBY -- \u201cWhat Jeb Bush\u2019s friends (and others) want in a new budget,\u201d by Gary Fineout in the Fine Print Blog: \u201c[T]here\u2019s plenty left in the $77-$80 billion spending plan that will be the target of lobbying in the next few days. Take for example an appropriation in the House budget for $1.2 million to provide liability insurance to teachers. This is not a new idea and had been in place while Gov. Jeb Bush was in office. The idea is for the state to help pay for coverage and take away a recruiting tool for the Florida Education Association - which right now is engaged in a lawsuit against Florida's tax credit scholarship program. (This program pays for roughly 70,000 kids to attend private schools around the state.).\u201d http://bit.ly/1FZssXo\nJEB-STAKES \u2013 Jeb Bush\u2019s June 15 announcement will be no shocker (he\u2019s officially running for president, which has been unofficially doing for more than six months). But he\u2019s finding ways of making news nonetheless over it, having sent out an email today that says \u201cIn 8 days I\u2019m going to make some news\u2026and I want you to be front and center for it. So today we\u2019re officially launching a contest to fly one lucky winner and a friend to Miami for the big day. And all you have to do to is add your name to automatically enter. I won't get into details on what the announcement is about, but I promise you it\u2019s worth throwing your name in: JebAnnouncement.com. Good luck! ... P.S. On November 8, 2016, you won\u2019t want to look back and say I could have been there when it all began: JebAnnouncement.com.\u201d\n--\u201cDetails emerge about Jeb Bush\u2019s post-decision fundraising push,\u201d by Saint Petersblog\u2019s Peter Schorsch: http://bit.ly/1KP2x66\n--\u201cJeb Bush All But Says He\u2019ll Kick Off Presidential Campaign and Head Straight to N.H.,\u201d by Bloomberg Politics\u2019 David Knowles: http://bloom.bg/1FJrfQX\nCONTINENTAL JEB-FEST \u2013 \u201cAnother Bush heads to Europe: On an increasingly unstable continent, Jeb confronts the legacy of W. and Dad,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Eli Stokols: http://politi.co/1dp5e30\nWALKER V. BUSH \u2013 \u201cWalker jabs at Bush, calls for a \u2018fresh\u2019 GOP face,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019S Jonathan Topaz: \u201cI hope Republicans, I hope independents and even some discerning Democrats will see that we\u2019re striking a stark contrast with Hillary Clinton,\u201d the governor said in an interview aired Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u2018This Week.\u2019 \u2018You know, we\u2019re a new fresh face taking on someone from the past. \u2026 I think Gov. Bush is still probably up there, up front because he\u2019s going to have more money than just about all of us combined,\u2019 he said.\u201d http://politi.co/1IwTqJK\nMARCO OF THE CORN \u2013 \u201cIowa\u2019s \u2018Roast and Ride\u2019: 5 takeaways,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Katie Glueck: \u201cThe Florida senator is still introducing himself to the state after skipping several other cattle calls here. But the reception he received Saturday suggests that Iowans are interested in learning more, and they like what they hear so far. When he arrived, Rubio was mobbed by attendees who asked for meetings, talked policy and clamored for pictures. One voter asked Rubio to record a message for his girlfriend, and the senator obliged, while several people who were volunteering in Carson\u2019s tent left their posts to take pictures with Rubio, saying they hadn\u2019t decided whom to support yet. The crowd was receptive to Rubio\u2019s speech, including his swipes at critics and his implicit jabs at Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton.\u201d http://politi.co/1FCwgLN\nRUBIO-JITSU \u2013 It\u2019s tough to turn your opponent\u2019s strength to your advantage, but Marco did it with a jiu-jitsu adherent\u2019s aplomb this weekend with Friday\u2019s New York Times\u2019 story headlined \u201cMarco Rubio and His Wife Cited 17 Times for Traffic Infractions\u201d (http://nyti.ms/1BOs1eG). For starters, the headline got changed to \u201cRubios on the Road Have Drawn Unwanted Attention.\u201d In the end, though, it was NYT that drew unwanted attention. It was roundly and justifiably mocked and criticized by folks across the political spectrum who wondered why it was written, whether it was a sloppy hit job planted by American Bridge and why it downplayed the fact that Marco only had four tickets. Why include the wife\u2019s 13 citations \u2013 unless it was solely to pump up the number for a better headline (which, again, was changed)? Rubio turned the story into a fundraising pitch. So from a campaign perspective, this was wanted attention. Rubio has done this before, selling water bottles after his embarrassing thirst-slaking amid his 2013 SOTU response. On the stump in Iowa, he also did a little jiu-jitsu on an AP report concerning his not-so-great finances. That AP story, unlike the Times piece, was actually newsworthy however.\n--\u201cRubio Laughing All The Way To The Bank, Fundraising From #Rubiocrimespree,\u201d by Breitbart\u2019s Sarah Rumpf: \u201cFriday afternoon, Rubio campaign manager Terry Sullivan sent out a fundraising email, gleefully mocking the \u2018huge scandal\u2019 that the Times had uncovered. http://bit.ly/1MAllaf\n--\u201cMarco Rubio: 4 tickets \u2018not that many,\u2019 red light cameras a \u2018scam,\u2019\u201d by MSNBC\u2019s Kasie Hunt: \u201cI can tell you, being from Miami, where you drive everywhere, having four tickets in 17 years is not considered bad,\u201d he said in an interview Saturday. \u201cLet me just say, I really don\u2019t like red light cameras \u2026 That\u2019s a big scam. But that\u2019s another topic for another day.\u201d http://on.msnbc.com/1JzwwA7\n--\u201c\u2018New York Times\u2019 shows its \u2018gotcha\u2019 colors,\u201d USA Today column by Glenn Harlan Reynolds (aka Instapundit): The \u201cearth-shattering traffic scoop produced rather a lot of mockery from people on the right, and from some on the left. Longtime political correspondent Jeff Greenfield tweeted: \u2018Rubio TrafficTicketGate? This a parody of political journalism gone nuts, right?\u2019... [F]olks on Twitter mocked the Times with the #RubioCrimeSpree hashtag, featuring such other alleged crimes as \u2018Drank milk after the expiration,\u2019 \u2018Red wine with fish,\u2019 and my favorite, \u2018Called Chris Matthews, asked him if his refrigerator was running.\u2019 Even most of the major newspapers and networks declined to treat the Times' story seriously.\u201d http://usat.ly/1AVjL1v\nMARCO\u2019S MONEY \u2013 \u201cRubio\u2019s real estate dealings often a drag on his finances,\u201d by AP\u2019s Nicholas Riccardi: \u201cFactor in some questionable moves with money and a hefty load of student loans, and it's clear that the Republican presidential candidate\u2019s real estate dealings often have been a drag on his finances despite an income most would relish. ... he sold a home in Tallahassee, Florida, that he owned with a former colleague. That freed Rubio from a monthly payment on an interest-only loan and the cost of upkeep. But he lost money on the deal\u2026. he consolidated the debt on his primary residence in West Miami, Florida. The original mortgage required only payments of interest on the principal in its first decade. Rubio has only paid off about 4 percent of overall principal since buying the house.\u201d http://bit.ly/1HgxDVc\nMARCO\u2019S RESPONSE \u2013 \u201cThe latest one is, I shouldn\u2019t run for president because I\u2019m not rich enough \u2026 And it\u2019s true: I don\u2019t make $11 million a year giving speeches to special interests, and I don\u2019t have a family foundation that\u2019s raised $2 billion, a lot of it from foreign interests,\u201d he said, in a nod to Bill and Hillary Clinton. \u201cBut my wife and I work to ensure that we have enough money to send our kids to a Christian education at a private school and we have a mortgage we pay every month. But do you know what my biggest debt is? It\u2019s not to a bank. It\u2019s to the United States of America.\u201d The quote is taken from Real Clear Politics\u2019 Rebecca Berg\u2019s story headlined \u201cWalker Draws a Crowd at Ernst\u2019s Iowa Event.\u201d http://bit.ly/1QDfEsJ\nFLORI-DUH REEF-MAKING-- \u201cThat sinking feeling: Barge overturns, crushes Rapa Nui Reef,\u201d by The South Florida Sun Sentinel\u2019s Mike Clary: \u201cThe dream of planting 15 Easter Island-style concrete figures in the ocean floor as an underwater art installation and one-of-a-kind dive site was crushed Sunday when the barge on which it sat overturned and smashed the faux Polynesian gods to pieces.\nInstead of dropping straight down into the Atlantic Ocean about a half mile east of the Deerfield Beach International Fishing Pier, the rusty barge rolled over on its port side after the scuttle holes were opened and ended up coming to rest on top of what was called the Rapa Nui Reef.\u201d http://bit.ly/1FIYJik\nOOPS -- State Has Been Overbilling Feds For Nursing Home Screenings (Possibly For Years),\u201d by the Naples Daily News\u2019 Matt Dixon: \u201cThe Florida Department of Elder Affairs has been requesting higher than allowed reimbursements from the federal government for nursing home screening work, an overbilling practice that has likely cost taxpayers millions of dollars, according to billing records and an internal report. Shoddy record keeping and a failure to file a federally required cost plan means there is no record to show how long the department has been overbilling the feds or how much in overpayments it has received over the years. ... The program that houses the screening program has been reimbursed by $6.8 million over the past four quarters, a number that includes the overbilling, according to state records.\u201d http://bit.ly/1HV9C1H\nABORTION WATCH -- \u201cFlorida abortions dip, but not as high as other states,\u201d by AP\u2019s Kelli Kennedy: \u201cThe number of abortions performed in Florida dropped by 10 percent between 2010 and 2014, but the decrease is less than in other Republican-led states that have more aggressive restrictions on the procedure. Roughly 72,100 abortions were performed in Florida in 2014, a 9.7 percent dip from about 79,900 in 2010, according to state health records. The number of abortion clinics has remained steady at about 70 during the time period. ... Florida\u2019s decline is modest compared to states like Arkansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, Missouri and Indiana, where abortion figures have dropped by more than 15 percent since the adoption of some of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the country. The annual number of abortions has declined substantially since 2010 in most U.S. states. But the declines are perplexing because they are not concentrated in states with restrictive laws and are equally spread among liberal states like New York where rights have been protected.\u201d http://apne.ws/1eX8PGF\nTHE ROADRUNNER\u2019S STILL FREE -- \u201cCoyote trapped and killed in west Boca Raton,\u201d by WPTV\u2019s Webteam: \u201cLast weekend a couple in west Boca Raton says a coyote attacked and killed one of their dogs, a 4-year-old Yorkie mix, in front of their home. Residents in the area have reported many coyote sightings over the past couple of months and one man claimed a coyote acted aggressively toward him.\u201d http://bit.ly/1KVEaqg\n\u2018LIKE A LEPRECHAUN\u2019 \u2026WITH A SHARK? -- \u201cMan attempts to sell live shark outside Fort Lauderdale Publix,\u201d by WSVN-7: \u201cFriday evening, 7News caught up to Patrick Lanier, the man who tried to sell the live shark, and he said he reeled in the marine predator on the Intracoastal Waterway. \u2018I felt like a leprechaun, like I struck gold,\u2019 he said. Lanier said he was hoping to make about $100 from selling the shark, but no one seemed interested. \u2018On top of it, it's not on ice. It's just sitting there on the concrete,\u2019 said Publix shopper James Douglas\u2026.This amateur shark salesman is not the first of his kind. In 2009, a South Florida man brought a nurse shark for a ride on the Miami Metromover and hauled it on his bike on his way to two sales stops along the Miami River.\u201d http://bit.ly/1HaLjAQ\n--\u201cShark attacks child, leaves severe leg injury,\u201d by Florida Today\u2019s J.D.
