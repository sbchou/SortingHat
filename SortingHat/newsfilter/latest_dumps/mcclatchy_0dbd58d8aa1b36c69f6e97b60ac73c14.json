{"body": "Facebook traffic mirrored Ohio Gov. John Kasich\u2019s low poll standing Tuesday.\nKasich became the 16th prominent Republican to announce he was running for the party\u2019s presidential nomination. During the day of the announcement, he generated 261,000 interactions on Facebook and 156,000 people.\nThat\u2019s low, compared to his rivals. And it reflects his low standing in national polls. Kasich needs to reach the top 10 to qualify for the August 6 Republican debate in Cleveland, and it looks like it\u2019s going to be close.\nWhile Facebook is not a factor in who debates, it does reflect who\u2019s generating interest. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, for instance, had 679,000 people and 1.57 million interactions. Real estate mogul Donald Trump had 3.4 million people and 6.4 million interactions.\nOther announcement day Republican results:\nChris Christie \n482,000 unique people \n803,000 interactions \nBobby Jindal \n316,000 unique people \n542,000 interactions \nJeb Bush \n493,000 unique people \n849,000 interactions \nRick Perry \n422,000 unique people \n763,000 interactions \nLindsey Graham \n84,000 unique people \n142,000 interactions \nGeorge Pataki \n59,000 unique people \n81,000 interactions \nRick Santorum \n169,000 unique people \n266,000 interactions \nMike Huckabee \n458,000 unique people \n814,000 interactions \nCarly Fiorina \n304,000 unique people \n515,000 interactions \nBen Carson \n847,000 unique people \n1.5 million interactions \nMarco Rubio \n695,000 unique people \n1.3 million interactions \nRand Paul \n865,000 unique people \n1.9 million interactions \nTed Cruz \n2.1 million unique people \n5.5 million interactions.\nDavid Lightman: 202-383-6101, @lightmandavid", "byline": "", "description": "Trump generated huge Facebook traffic\nKasich in danger of not qualifying for debate\nOhio governor announced White House bid Tuesday\n\u2026\nClick to Continue \u00bb", "title": "Kasich entry into GOP race stirs minimal Facebook interest", "url": "http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article28164856.html", "topics": ["personality", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Rick Santorum", "George Pataki", "David Lightman", "Chris Christie", "Jeb Bush", "Rick Perry", "John Kasich", "Donald Trump", "Lindsey Graham", "Marco Rubio", "Mike Huckabee", "Bobby Jindal", "Ben Carson", "Carly Fiorina", "Scott Walker", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": ["Real"], "authors": [{"author_id": 33909, "fullname": "david lightman", "primary_org": "mcclatchy"}], "date_written": "2015-07-22 13:48:06", "org": "mcclatchy", "article_id": "0dbd58d8aa1b36c69f6e97b60ac73c14", "date_access": "2015-07-22 13:00:05.679745"}
