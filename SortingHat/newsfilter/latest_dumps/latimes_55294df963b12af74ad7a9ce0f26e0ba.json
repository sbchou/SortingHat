{"body": "Vice President Joe Biden has decided not to run for president, ending months of intrigue about his political future and greatly boosting the prospects of the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Rodham Clinton.\nOver the summer, while his family grieved the \nMay death of his son\n, Beau, the vice president\u00a0\u201csaid all along\u201d that the window for a presidential run might close before they were ready to decide.\n\u201cI\u2019ve concluded it has closed,\u201d Biden\u00a0said Wednesday in an appearance in the White House Rose Garden. \u201cUnfortunately, I believe we\u2019re out of time, time necessary to run a winning campaign.\u201d\nBiden\u2019s announcement, with both his wife, Jill, and President Obama at his side, signals the approaching end of a four-decade career in elected office and a quest for the presidency that stretched for more than a generation.\nBarring an unexpected development, it also sets the final shape of the Democratic race in a way that strongly favors Clinton, the former secretary of State.\nBiden\u2019s speech contained at least one thinly veiled criticism of Clinton \u2013 warning against excessive partisanship \u2013 and although he did not mention her name, he challenged her on policies. Overall, however, his decision strongly helps her campaign.\nIn the past couple of weeks, a raft of polls have tested how the race would look with and without Biden. The surveys offered a consistent verdict \u2013 that Biden would have started out with support from just short of one-fifth of Democrats, and that that backing largely would have come at Clinton\u2019s expense.\nEven more important than the raw numbers were the types of voters Biden potentially could have attracted.\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Clinton\u2019s main remaining rival, has gathered strong support among white, college-educated liberals who share his strongly held views about income inequality and his critique of big banks and corporate power.\nJoe Biden used a Washington forum on the vice presidency Tuesday to highlight his close relationship with President Obama that would be at the heart of Biden\u2019s potential presidential campaign, even offering a fresh account of his counsel to Obama about targeting Osama bin Laden.\nThrough that anecdote...\nJoe Biden used a Washington forum on the vice presidency Tuesday to highlight his close relationship with President Obama that would be at the heart of Biden\u2019s potential presidential campaign, even offering a fresh account of his counsel to Obama about targeting Osama bin Laden.\nThrough that anecdote...\nBut Clinton has stayed well ahead of Sanders in national polls and in surveys of most heavily Democratic states because of lopsided support for her among black and Latino voters and self-identified moderates. A Biden candidacy would have threatened that bulwark, potentially holding down Clinton\u2019s vote enough to allow Sanders to defeat her in key contests.\nClinton still faces a spirited contest from Sanders. \u201cShe still needs to earn this. Bernie Sanders is still a formidable threat and could still win the first two states, and nobody knows what will happen if that kind of jolt occurs,\u201d said Paul Maslin, a veteran Democratic strategist who is neutral in the primaries.\n\u201cThe positive part is it avoids a bloodletting,\u201d Maslin said of Biden\u2019s decision not to run. \u201cThere\u2019s not that much difference between the two of them, so his argument would had to have been, \u2018I\u2019m genuine, I\u2019m real, I have good character and she does not.\u2019 However it ended up, that would not have been helpful.\u201d\nFreed of that risk, Clinton now has a much clearer path to the nomination unless Sanders can dramatically expand his base of support, which so far has not happened. Indeed, even before Biden announced his decision, Clinton seemed to be gaining ground in several polls taken after last week\u2019s Democratic debate, both nationally and in New Hampshire, the one state where Sanders did have a clear lead.\nFor his part, the often loquacious Biden used his time in front of the cameras to lay out the themes on which he would have campaigned. He called on Democratic candidates to \u201crun on the record\u201d that Obama has compiled over the past seven years, and he declared that \u201cI will not be silent,\u201d promising to speak out \u201cclearly and forcefully\u201d to articulate his vision for the Democratic Party and the future.\nIn his clearest critique of Clinton, he repeated a line he has used \nseveral times over the past few days\n, to declare that the country needs a less partisan political atmosphere.\nRepublicans are \u201cour opposition \u2013 they\u2019re not our enemies,\u201d he said.\nAt last week\u2019s debate, Clinton, in a response to a question asking her to name her enemies, had included \u201cthe Republicans\u201d on her list, although she also noted that she successfully worked with Republicans while she was a senator from New York.\nBiden also gave Clinton a challenge, as he ticked off the policy goals that he argues the next president needs to embrace. Among the most notable was his call for free college.\n\u201cWe need to commit to 16 years of free public education for all of our children,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all know that 12 years of public education is not enough. As a nation, let\u2019s make the same commitment to a college education today that we made to a high school education 100 years ago.\u201d\nClinton has placed college affordability at the center of her campaign, but she has stopped short of pushing to make college free, a position that is more in line with Sanders\u2019 campaign.\nBiden also said \u201cwe need a moonshot in this country to cure cancer,\u201d the disease that claimed the life of his son. \u201cIt\u2019s personal,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cBut I know we can do this.\u201d\nBiden\u2019s speech also sounded a cautious note on the use of force overseas, which potentially creates a contrast with Clinton, who has advocated what she calls a \u201csmart power\u201d approach to foreign policy that calls for using military might when necessary.\n\u201cWe have to accept the fact that we can\u2019t solve all the world\u2019s problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThe argument that we just have to do something when bad people do things isn\u2019t good enough. It\u2019s not a good enough reason for American intervention.\u201d\nSIGN UP for the free Essential Politics newsletter >>\nOn other major issues, though, Biden\u2019s remarks could have been pulled from a Clinton stump speech \u2013 a reminder of why it was so difficult for him to find space in the field to mount a viable challenge.\nHe warned the country has reached unsustainable levels of inequality, that unlimited and secret cash in politics is corroding democracy, and that the rich get too many tax deductions. He also talked about the need to address racial injustice, boost gay rights and reform the immigration system.\nFor months, a close circle of advisors \u2014 and at times the vice president himself \u2014 worked to build support for what would have been a third campaign for the White House. Aides said he felt confident he could run \na viable campaign\n.\nBut Biden's deliberations were complicated by his struggle to reconcile his political ambition with his family\u2019s anguish after Beau's death.\nHad Biden run, he would have started from a strong platform. After seven years at President Obama\u2019s side, he can claim a hand in the achievements of what many Democrats see as a successful administration.\nMoreover, in what has proved to be an unpredictable campaign dominated by political outsiders, Biden\u2019s brand as an authentic \u2014 some say gaffe-prone \u2014 political warrior might have suited the times.\nBut no sitting vice president has won the presidency since 1988 \u2014 the first time Biden ran \u2014 when George H.W. Bush was elected to succeed Ronald Reagan. And in Clinton, the former secretary of State, senator and first lady, Biden would have faced an opponent who already boasts significant political support and a formidable campaign infrastructure.\nIn a statement, Clinton called Biden\u2019s record one to be \u201cproud of, defend and build on.\u201d She said that \u201clike millions of others, I admire his devotion to family, his grace in grief, his grit and determination on behalf of the middle class and his unyielding faith in America\u2019s promise.\u201d\nBiden\u2019s political career ultimately has been book-ended by two searing personal tragedies. Just weeks after his election to the Senate at age 29, his wife and infant daughter were killed in a car accident that also left his two young sons seriously injured. He almost didn\u2019t enter the office he\u2019d been elected to, but ultimately served 36 years in Congress before his election as vice president in 2008.\nIn that time he waged two campaigns for the presidency, and had designs on a third from the moment he and Obama were reelected in 2012. But Beau faced a series of health issues, and early this year was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. He died May 30.\nBeau \u201cis our inspiration,\u201d Biden said Wednesday of his late son, who served as Delaware's attorney general and was a rising political star. The entire family, Biden said, \"found purpose in public life.\"\nTimes staff writer Evan Halper contributed to this report.\nFor more campaign\u00a0coverage, follow\u00a0\n@mikememoli\n\u00a0and\u00a0\n@davidlauter", "byline": "", "description": "<p>Vice President Joe Biden has decided not to run for president, ending months of intrigue about his political future and greatly boosting the prospects of the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p> <p>Over the summer, while his family grieved the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-beau-biden-20150531-story.html\">May death of his son</a>, Beau, the vice president\u00a0\u201csaid...</p>", "title": "Joe Biden decides against presidential bid, a big boost to Hillary Clinton", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/la-na-joe-biden-not-running-20151021-story.html", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Beau Biden", "Joe Biden", "Hillary Clinton", "Paul Maslin", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Evan Halper", "Bernie Sanders", "Ronald Reagan"], "orgs": ["Senate", "Democratic Party", "Congress", "Osama bin Laden"], "authors": [{"author_id": 40320, "fullname": "michael a. memoli", "primary_org": "latimes"}, {"author_id": 40195, "fullname": "david lauter", "primary_org": "latimes"}], "date_written": "2015-10-21 19:48:00", "org": "latimes", "article_id": "55294df963b12af74ad7a9ce0f26e0ba", "date_access": "2015-10-21 19:00:07.474534"}
