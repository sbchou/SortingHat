{"body": "(Adds judge extending restraining order, comments from lawyer)\nBy Susan Cornwell and Alex Wilts\nWASHINGTON Aug 3 (Reuters) - Republican legislation to cut\noff federal funding for Planned Parenthood failed to gather\nenough support in the U.S. Senate on Monday, halting at least\nfor now moves to punish the women's health group for its role in\ngathering fetal tissue from abortions for medical research.\nSenate Democrats succeeded in stopping the bill on a\nprocedural vote. Sixty votes were needed to advance it in the\n100-person chamber. It received 53 votes, with 46 senators\nopposing it.\nPlanned Parenthood, which provides healthcare services to\nmillions of women at hundreds of centers nationwide, has come\nunder attack with the online posting of hidden-camera videos\nproduced by an anti-abortion group, Center for Medical Progress.\nThe group has said the videos show Planned Parenthood\nofficials negotiating prices for fetal tissue from abortions it\nperforms. Planned Parenthood has denied any wrongdoing and has\nsaid it does not profit from fetal tissue donation.\nUnder U.S. law, donated human fetal tissue may be used for\nresearch, but profiting from its sale is prohibited.\nRepublicans are likely to try again in September to stop\nPlanned Parenthood from getting federal funds, which currently\namounts to more than $500 million a year.\nAfter a congressional recess in August, conservative\nRepublicans could try to attach their defunding measure to a\nbill to fund the government, raising the prospect of a possible\ngovernment shutdown over the issue.\n\nANGRY DEMOCRATS\nThe Republicans' efforts have intensified America's\nlong-running debate about abortion just as the 2016 presidential\ncampaign is getting under way. Those efforts have angered many\nDemocrats.\nThe legislation was \"just one more piece of a deliberate,\nmethodical, orchestrated, right-wing attack on women's rights.\nAnd I'm sick and tired of it,\" Democratic Senator Elizabeth\nWarren said. \"Women everywhere are sick and tired of it. The\nAmerican people are sick and tired of it.\"\n\"I want to say to my Republican colleagues, the year is\n2015, not 1955 and not 1895,\" Warren added.\nTwo Democrats, Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Joe\nDonnelly of Indiana, broke ranks and supported the defunding\neffort. \"I do not believe that taxpayer money should be used to\nfund this organization; instead those funds should be sent to\nother healthcare providers,\" Manchin in a statement.\nThe legislation's main sponsor was freshman Republican\nSenator Joni Ernst of Iowa.\n\"The question before us today is clear: Who do we want to be\nas a nation? It is hard for anyone to defend these morally\nreprehensible videos, as Planned Parenthood callously harvested\nthe organs of unborn babies, to be sold at a price,\" Ernst said.\nJust one Senate Republican, Mark Kirk of Illinois, who faces\na tough re-election race next year, voted against advancing the\nbill.\n\nMILLIONS RELY ON PLANNED PARENTHOOD\nPlanned Parenthood gets up to $500 million per year in\nMedicaid contributions, and up to $60 million in federal funds\nfor family planning services. U.S. law tightly restricts\napplying federal funds to abortions.\nMillions of women, many young and single, rely on Planned\nParenthood for healthcare beyond abortions and family planning,\nincluding breast and cervical cancer screenings.\nYoung, single women are a key demographic for Hillary\nClinton, the front-runner to represent the Democratic Party in\nthe November 2016 presidential election.\nClinton has called the online videos \"disturbing,\" while\nalso saying it was \"regrettable\" that Republicans, allied with\nanti-abortionists, were trying to cut off funding.\nIn the videos, anti-abortion activists posed as researchers\ntrying to obtain fetal tissue and, using hidden cameras,\ninterviewed Planned Parenthood officials about potential costs.\nIn San Francisco on Monday, a federal judge extended a\ntemporary restraining order that stops the group from releasing\nthe videos pending an Aug. 27 hearing. An abortion providers\ngroup sued to block the release on privacy grounds.\nBrian Chavez-Ochoa, a lawyer for Center for Medical\nProgress, said his clients have footage that has nothing to do\nwith the plaintiff in the case, the National Abortion\nFederation, and is not covered by the judge's injunction.\nIn Louisiana, Governor Bobby Jindal, one of many seeking the\nRepublican presidential nomination, said on Monday his state was\nterminating its Medicaid contract with Planned Parenthood.\nThree Republican senators seeking the nomination, Texas' Ted\nCruz, Kentucky's Rand Paul and Florida's Marco Rubio, voted on\nMonday in favor of advancing the bill to defund Planned\nParenthood. A fourth, South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, was\nabsent.\n\n (Additional reporting by Richard Cowan and Alex Wilts in\nWashington and Dan Levine in San Francisco; Editing by Kevin\nDrawbaugh, Tom Brown and Leslie Adler)", "byline": "", "description": "WASHINGTON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Republican legislation to cut off federal funding for Planned Parenthood failed to gather enough support in the U.S. Senate on Monday, halting at least for now moves to punish the women's health group for its role in gathering fetal tissue from abortions for medical research.", "title": "UPDATE 4-U.S. Senate blocks Planned Parenthood defunding measure", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/UShealthcareNews/~3/PZeBkg3UQ7o/story01.htm", "topics": ["abortion"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Mark Kirk", "Richard Cowan", "Lindsey Graham", "Brian Chavez", "Leslie Adler", "Dan Levine", "Marco Rubio", "Joe Manchin", "Bobby Jindal", "Tom Brown", "Susan Cornwell", "Joni Ernst", "Alex Wilts"], "orgs": ["Senate", "Democratic Party", "U.S. Senate", "Medicaid", "Center for Medical Progress", "Planned Parenthood"], "authors": [{"author_id": 33346, "fullname": "reuters editorial", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-08-04 01:11:26", "org": "reuters", "article_id": "a3d859fdcbef7bc57ccb898504155d5c", "date_access": "2015-08-04 00:40:59.509399"}
