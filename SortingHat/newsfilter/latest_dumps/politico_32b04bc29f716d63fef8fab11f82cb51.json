BOBBY JINDAL officially launched his long-shot bid for the GOP presidential nomination here this evening with some tough talk dismissing his competitors as \u201cselfish\u201d followers who are nothing more than \u201cgood talkers.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\nBut he saved his sharpest remarks for JEB BUSH, the only rival other than Democrat HILLARY CLINTON whom he singled out by name. In his announcement speech (and later in a remote interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity), Jindal pointed to Bush\u2019s well-known statement \u2014 that he\u2019d risk losing the primary to be able to win the general election \u2014 as precisely what\u2019s wrong with the former Florida governor.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve heard Jeb Bush saying we need to be able to lose the primary to win the general election. We\u2019re going to help him do that,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cI\u2019m going to translate that from political-speak into plain English. He is saying that we need to hide our conservative ideals. But the truth is, if we go down that road again, we will lose again.\u201d\nFor Jindal, it was a smart exercise in punching above his weight: By whacking Bush, the Louisiana governor who resides at the bottom of national polls will end up in news accounts next to the candidate who typically tops them.\nTRAIL MIX: A look at what's poppin' on the campaign trail\nGood Wednesday afternoon, and welcome to The 2016 BLAST. Your guide for the campaign is Jonathan Topaz (@JonathanTopaz). Send tips, ideas and gripes to jtopaz@politico.com.\nAdd another candidate to the 2016 list \u2014 BOBBY JINDAL, who made his presidential campaign official today in Louisiana. The odds he faces are, well, long: He\u2019s unpopular at home and barely registers in national polls. You\u2019re safer betting on HILLARY CLINTON or JEB BUSH, both of whom were in New York City today raising big bucks at fundraisers. In other campaign news, as MARCO RUBIO faces criticism on the right for his vote on fast-track authority, Republicans governors including SCOTT WALKER and JOHN KASICH mull their next move on Obamacare.\nTHE DAILY CLINTON \nHILLARY CLINTON is in New York City tonight for a big fundraiser at the Plaza Hotel, which will feature a concert from Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett.\nZEAL OF A CONVERT: The HILLARY CLINTON campaign is out with a new video expressing her commitment to same-sex marriage and gay rights ahead of this month\u2019s anticipated Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage. The spot features video of gay couples getting engaged and married along with a clip from Clinton\u2019s 2011 speech on Human Rights Day. \u201cSome have suggested that gay rights and human rights are separate and distinct. But in fact, they are one and the same,\u201d says Clinton, who doesn\u2019t appear in the video. bit.ly/1Rw8Q0i\nNETROOTS DISS: HILLARY CLINTON will not attend the liberal Netroots Nation conference next month, organizers announced today \u2014 the second straight year she\u2019s ditching. On July 18, MARTIN O\u2019MALLEY and BERNIE SANDERS will hold town halls at the event, which will also feature appearances from liberal standard-bearers like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\nBLOWBACK: NPR: \u201cHILLARY CLINTON\u2019s speech Tuesday at a historic black church in Missouri was mostly well-received by the audience, but three words angered some of the activists she was hoping to appeal to\u2026. [S]he's now facing criticism on social media after using the phrase \u2018all lives matter\u2019 \u2014 which has been used by some as pushback to the phrase \u2018black lives matter.\u2019 The latter phrase, which hung on a banner outside the church, was widely used by protesters in Ferguson and other cities. \u2018With her statement that all lives matter, that blew a lot of support that she may have been able to engender here,\u2019 said Renita Lamkin, a pastor at the St. John AME Church in St. Charles.\u201d\u00a0http://n.pr/1HeTz4C\nTHE PROGRESSIVE RESISTANCE\nBERNIE\u2019S RELEVANCY TEST: The New York Times: \u201cBlack voters have shown little interest in him. Even his own campaign advisers acknowledge that [BERNIE] SANDERS is virtually unknown to many African-Americans, an enormously important Democratic constituency \u2026 Given the makeup of the Democratic primary electorate, Mr. Sanders\u2019s capacity to win support among blacks represents a test of his relevance: It will help determine whether he can drain many votes from Mrs. Clinton or is bound to be merely a nuisance candidate with a following among the most ideologically driven liberal whites.\u201d nyti.ms/1NibUwz\nO\u2019MALLEY IN SOUTH CAROLINA: MARTIN O\u2019MALLEY traveled to South Carolina today to pay his respects to state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, who was one of the nine people killed in the shooting at Charleston\u2019s Emanuel AME Church. O\u2019Malley, who has called for gun-control reforms following the shooting, recently discussed meeting with Pinckney at the church, where Pinckney was a pastor. \u201cTotal hospitality, total generosity of heart,\u201d O\u2019Malley said of Pinckney in his recent address to the U.S. Conference of Mayors.\nWEBB ON THE FLAG: JIM WEBB weighs in on the Confederate Flag in a Facebook post, breaking from Democratic hopefuls who have forcefully called for it to be taken down. \u201cIt should not be used in any way as a political symbol that divides us. But we should also remember that honorable Americans fought on both sides in the Civil War, including slave holders in the Union Army from states.\u201d on.fb.me/1LCdoAC\nLEFT OF BERNIE: Green Party candidate JILL STEIN, who won nearly 500,000 votes in 2012, on BERNIE SANDERS\u2019 campaign: \u201cI wish that he had run outside the Democratic Party. There are many similarities, obviously, between his vision and my vision. The difference is that I\u2019m running in a party that also supports that vision \u2026 I wish him the best. The difference is that my campaign will be there in the general.\u201d bit.ly/1e40fFf\nBOBBY JINDAL\u2019S LAUNCH\nBOBBY JINDAL launched his long-shot bid for the presidency today \u2014 first, with a video announcement and then with a rally in Kenner, La., where Jindal lived before becoming governor.\nHOME VIDEOS: BOBBY JINDAL officially announced his presidential bid with a series of videos of the Louisiana governor and his wife Supriya breaking the news to their children. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll get a chance, if you behave, to go back to Iowa.

But governor\u2019s main focus is on big picture.\u201d bit.ly/1s521q6\nLOUISIANA LONG SHOT: POLITICO\u2019s Katie Glueck and Eli Stokols report: \u201c[BOBBY] JINDAL is widely viewed as the longest of long shots, a candidate with a glittering resume but almost no chance of winning the GOP nomination in 2016. It\u2019s a long way from where he was at the beginning of the Obama era in early 2009 \u2026 the young governor of Louisiana was thought to be the Republican Party\u2019s next rising star, a blazing talent on a trajectory to be a presidential contender \u2026 Jindal is polling at about 1 percent nationally now \u2014 when he shows up in the polls at all.\u201d politi.co/1HeOBov\nSURVEYING THE 2016 LANDSCAPE\nMARCO\u2019S NEW HEADACHE: Tampa Bay Times: \u201cMARCO RUBIO has a new headache from the right: His support for President Obama\u2019s Pacific trade deal. \u2018Marco Rubio Casts Deciding Vote For Obamatrade Without Even Reading It,\u2019\u00a0screamed a headline in Breitbart News, which last rode the Florida Republican on immigration \u2026 A number of conservative groups have lashed out at giving Obama fast track authority on trade deals \u2026 Rubio felt it enough to\u00a0push back on Twitter\u00a0today,\u00a0linking to a National Review\u00a0story that says Rubio did read the deal.\u201d bit.ly/1Jj693g\nPOPULAR IN MIAMI: Daily Caller hed: \u201cAmid Confederate Flag flap, JEB BUSH emerges stronger.\u201d bit.ly/1KaDz2q\nTRUMP\u2019S BUMP: POLITICO\u2019s Daniel Strauss reports: \u201cReal estate tycoon DONALD TRUMP has been gleefully calling attention to a Suffolk University poll showing him in second place among the large 2016 Republican primary field, and whispers of a Trump surge are making the rounds. It might be wise to take a deep breath\u2026Pollsters and GOP consultants in the state chalked Trump\u2019s bump up to a mixture of his recent candidacy announcement and the high name recognition that comes from his notoriously flamboyant personality, not to mention his reality show fame.\u201d http://politi.co/1J6fbh5\nOBAMACARE DILEMMA: POLITICO\u2019s Rachana Pradhan and Paul Demko report: \u201cIf the Supreme Court rules against Obamacare subsidies, the four governors running for president will face a harsh choice: Let tens of thousands of people get kicked off their health plans, or try to create a state exchange and lose credibility with a virulently anti-Obamacare Republican primary base. Louisiana\u2019s BOBBY JINDAL, Wisconsin\u2019s SCOTT WALKER, New Jersey\u2019s CHRIS CHRISTIE and Ohio\u2019s JOHN KASICH all refused to set up Obamacare exchanges, as did most other GOP governors. Their states would be directly affected if the court rules that the health law\u2019s subsidies can go only to people living in states that did establish the new online Obamacare markets \u2026 after the federal law was enacted, [Walker] took 92,000 people who were just above the poverty line out of [Wisconsin\u2019s Medicaid program] and moved them to the Obamacare exchange instead.\u201d politi.co/1CtbzRo\nWALKER\u2019S RESPONSE: In a CNN op-ed today, SCOTT WALKER writes defiantly that the fallout would be Congress and the White House\u2019s problem, and says governors will not set up state exchanges in the event the federal subsidies are struck down. cnn.it/1BMoLpR\nWALKER\u2019S GUN SHOW: Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: As Congress mulls potential gun-control measures following the Charleston shooting, SCOTT WALKER today signed two bills today loosening restrictions. \u201cOne bill, Senate Bill 35, removes the state's 48-hour waiting period for handgun purchases. The other, Senate Bill 70, allows off-duty or retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed weapons at public schools \u2026 Walker has touted his record expanding gun rights in Wisconsin.\u201d bit.ly/1JiSQjf\nKASICH PAYS HIS RESPECTS: The Des Moines Register on JOHN KASICH, in Iowa this week for the first time since campaigning there in 1999. \u201cKasich so far has ignored Iowa, instead saying his likely White House bid will hinge on whether he can secure a victory in New Hampshire \u2026 But Kasich told the Register on Tuesday that he hasn't ruled out competing in Iowa for a second time. \u2018It has yet to be decided as to how much we'll put into Iowa,\u2019 he said. \u2018But I'm coming to Iowa because I want to show respect to the people of Iowa.\u2019\u201d dmreg.co/1GI7aOz\nNEXT NEWS CYCLE\nIN THE EARLY STATES\nJINDAL, THE DAY AFTER: Fresh off his presidential announcement, BOBBY JINDAL will be in Manchester for two events, including Politics and Eggs at noon.\nALSO IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TOMORROW: MARCO RUBIO will be there for three events, including a veterans and military town hall in the morning.\nIN IOWA TOMORROW: 2008 Iowa caucus winner MIKE HUCKABEE and 2012 victor RICK SANTORUM both hold multiple events in the Hawkeye State.\nELSEWHERE\nJEB BUSH will be in the Lone Star State tomorrow for fundraisers in Houston and Dallas.\nBERNIE SANDERS will hold a press conference at the Capitol tomorrow to introduce legislation on closing estate tax loopholes.\nTHE DAILY NUMBER\n6: \u00a0RAND PAUL\u2019s drop in percentage points among Kentucky Republican primary voters. Last year, Paul was at 25 percent in his home state.
