But, in a video statement, she acknowledged one of their staff members spoke in a way that does not \u201creflect\u201d the \u201ccompassionate care that we provide.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cThis is unacceptable, and I personally apologize for the staff member's tone and statements,\u201d Richards said. \u00a0\nRichards does not directly name Deborah Nucatola, the group official in the video. The video was secretly recorded last year and released to the press this week by the pro-life group, Center for Medical Progress. \u00a0\nThe video shows Nucatola at a lunch with two anti-abortion activists posing at representatives of a biotech firm apparently interested in talking about fetal tissue donations. It shows her munching on what looks like salad and sipping on red wine while discussing fetal lungs and \u201clower extremities\u201d in hot demand. \u00a0\nShe says in the video: \"We've been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I'm not gonna crush that part, I'm gonna basically crush below, I'm gonna crush above, and I'm gonna see if I can get it all intact.\" \u00a0\nHouse Speaker John Boehner on Thursday called the video \u201cdisgusting.\u201d \u00a0\nUnclear is whether any legal lines were crossed \u2013 something lawmakers are sure to probe in several concurrent congressional investigations underway. \u00a0\nWhile some critics accused Planned Parenthood of selling aborted fetus parts, which would be illegal under federal law, the group says it only donates fetal tissue to researchers, for no profit. \u00a0\nBut there may be other legal issues at play. \u00a0\nSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent a letter Wednesday to Richards noting federal law prohibits the \u201calteration of abortion methods and procedures solely in order to obtain fetal tissue.\u201d \u00a0\nTitle IV of the Public Health Service Act says abortion providers cannot alter the \u201ctiming, method, or procedures\u201d used to terminate a pregnancy solely for the purpose of obtaining tissue. \u00a0\nGrassley said his committee is launching an inquiry into the matter, but also fired off a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch raising these issues. \u00a0\nThe videotaped discussion, he wrote, \u201craises questions about whether the actions of abortion providers, and in particular those employed by Planned Parenthood and its affiliates, are consistent with federal law.\u201d He also told Lynch the video raises questions about whether they violated the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. \u00a0\n\u201cI respectfully request that you provide the Committee with a description of any and all actions taken by the Department to ensure compliance with this statute,\u201d he wrote. The Justice Department confirmed to FoxNews.com that it had received the letter but had no further comment. \u00a0\nIn his letter to Richards, Grassley demanded all records relating to Planned Parenthood\u2019s provision of fetal tissue and all records of the organization\u2019s facilitation or coordination of organ donation via any of its affiliates. This includes procedures and the amount of money generated by the donation of fetal tissue. \u00a0\nStem cell research using fetal tissue is not illegal, and it has been used in research for decades as long as the mother gives her informed consent about the use of the donated tissue and donating physicians sign a statement promising to adhere to specific guidelines. It is illegal, however, for abortion providers to generate revenue in return for human fetal tissue donations. \u00a0\nIn a statement by the group Wednesday, Planned Parenthood insisted the video had been heavily edited and Nucatola\u2019s statements were taken out of context. Specifically, the group said Nucatola only discussed money the group gets as reimbursement for transporting the fetal tissue, which is allowed under the law. \u00a0\n\u201cI want to be really clear: The allegation that Planned Parenthood profits in any way from tissue donation is not true. Our donation programs \u2013 like any other high-quality health care providers \u2013 follow all laws and ethical guidelines,\u201d Richards said, while reiterating that it is always the woman\u2019s decision to donate. She also took aim at the group that filmed and distributed the now viral video: \u00a0\n\u201cWe know the real agenda of organizations behind videos like this, and they have never been concerned with protecting the health and safety of women. Their mission is to ban abortion completely and cut women off from care at Planned Parenthood and other health centers.\u201d \u00a0\nAt the state level, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, also a GOP presidential candidate, announced an investigation into the group while calling for a suspension of its license in the near-term. Meanwhile, Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has directed the state\u2019s Health and Human Services Commission to conduct an immediate investigation, in addition to one already ordered by the state\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office. \u00a0\nOn Capitol Hill, Boehner endorsed the committee investigations and hearings. \u201cAnd once they have them, we'll decide what's the proper course of action,\u201d he said, adding he might \u201cvomit\u201d trying to talk about the video in detail.", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Planned Parenthood head apologizes for official&rsquo;s fetal organ comments, as fallout grows - 2016 candidates blast Planned Parenthood over video", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/16/planned-parenthood-head-apologizes-for-officials-fetal-organ-comments-as/", "topics": ["abortion"], "people": ["Chuck Grassley", "Deborah Nucatola", "Cecile Richards", "John Boehner", "Loretta Lynch", "Bobby Jindal", "Greg Abbott"], "orgs": ["GOP", "Senate Judiciary Committee", "Justice Department", "Committee", "Center for Medical Progress", "Planned Parenthood Federation of America", "Planned Parenthood"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-07-16 23:43:03", "org": "fox", "article_id": "ecf7ff6fb16cdddefca0a03ad6074492", "date_access": "2015-07-16 23:20:03.129446"}
