Scott Peters, pictured, and Rick Nolan.  | AP Photo\n\n            By \nJake Sherman\n\n09/09/15, 05:14 AM EDT\n\n                Updated 09/08/15, 10:49 PM EDT\nA conservative group is spending a quarter-million dollars to target House Democrats who say they will vote for President Barack Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran.\nThe American Action Network, a nonprofit with close ties to GOP leadership, is starting an ad campaign on broadcast television in two media markets: Minneapolis, where it will target Rep. Rick Nolan (D-Minn.), and San Diego, where the ads will criticize Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.). The buy is $100,000 in each market, and each advertisement will run 235 times, in total, Wednesday and Thursday.\nThe spot criticizes each lawmaker for supporting a deal that AAN says funds terrorism, lifts the missile embargo on Iran and will result in \u201cdestabilizing the Middle East.\u201d\n\n\n\n            By \nBurgess Everett\n             and \nSeung Min Kim\n\n\u201cBut some in Congress like Rick Nolan are ignoring all the warnings and supporting a deal at any price,\u201d the narrator says. \u201cCall Rick Nolan and tell him to stop siding with Iran.\u201d\nThe advertisement is an early sign of what conservatives believe will be a major campaign issue in 2016: the Iran agreement. For example, the AAN polled in Nolan\u2019s district and found that 54 percent of voters oppose the Iran agreement, while just 27 percent support it. Nolan won his 2014 race with 48.5 percent of the vote, while his GOP opponent, Stewart Mills, got 47.1 percent of the vote.\n\u201cThis is a critically important vote beyond just what\u2019s going on this week, this year, this cycle,\u201d said Mike Shields, AAN president. \u201cThis is an important vote in history.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cAnytime you have someone in a congressional district voting against the wishes of his constituents, there could be a price to pay, and that\u2019s what we want the member of Congress to know before the vote. We\u2019re less focused on the political consequences than the historic consequences.\u201d\n\n\nThe group is spending $50,000 on similar digital ads targeting not only Nolan and Peters, but also Democratic Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, Pete Aguilar of California and Louise Slaughter of New York. Wasserman Schultz, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has already been threatened with a primary challenge because of her support of the Iran deal.\n\n                                            By \nAlan Wolfe\n\n\n                                            By \n                                                    Luiza Ch.
