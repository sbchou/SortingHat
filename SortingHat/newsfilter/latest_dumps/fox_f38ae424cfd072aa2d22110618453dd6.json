Hood or at the Mohammed cartoon contest or, now, Chattanooga, has been part of that problem.\n\nThis has consequences for his party, since many in the Democratic base are extremely worried about racial profiling, cultural sensitivity and ensuring that Islamists are treated the same way as other killers.\n\nOne month ago today, Republicans were faced with a similar situation when a racist lunatic murdered congregants at a black church in South Carolina. Many in the Republican base are concerned about the rise of racial politics, political correctness run amok and the demonization of the South, the geographic base of the party.\n\nBut to the disappointment of Democrats, and many on the media, Republicans dealt straight away with the issue and all (or almost all) acquitted themselves with compassion, mercy and clarity. It was a big test for the party\u2019s huge field of candidates as well as the GOP in early-state South Carolina. It was a great success.\n\nDemocrats face a similar test now. Can they respond with similar clear-eyed rhetoric?\n\nIf Democrats are seen as sharing the president\u2019s posture on Islamism, it will complicate things for Hillary Clinton in a big way. But other than former-Sen. Jim Webb, is any other candidate likely to say more today than express sympathy for the families of the victims? Will anyone else be willing to confront the party\u2019s orthodoxy and talk about radical Islam? Clinton surely doesn\u2019t want to antagonize her base just as cracks are beginning to deepen.\n\n[Watch Fox: Senior Political Correspondent Mike Emanuel covers the state of the race for the Democrats live from Cedar Rapids, IA.]\n\nGun-free zones under fire - The murder of unarmed U.S. Marines in Chattanooga drew swift calls to scrap federal policy establishing gun-free zones at military facilities. The ineffectiveness of the ban, enacted during the Clinton administration, was ironically underlined by pictures at one of the shooting scenes showing a bullet-ridden front entrance displaying a sign declaring it gun-free.\u00a0 The attack, which tragically recalls the 2009 Fort Hood shooting of unarmed soldiers the Obama administration termed \u201cworkplace violence\u201d, has critics of the ban are asking: If our troops are going to be serially targeted by terrorists, as it now appears, shouldn\u2019t they at least be able to carry side arms to protect themselves?\n\n[WashEx notes that earlier this month Donald Trump called for an end to gun free zones.]\n\nTime for a change - \u201c\u2026[T]he policies that prohibited our military personnel from being armed at an establishment like this\u2026are outdated. Containment was something that might have been good during the Cold War, but we\u2019re facing an enemy in radical Islamic terrorism that's willing to take the fight to us and we need to make sure that our men and women in uniform not only have the resources to protect us and keep our country safe, but they need to have the resources to keep themselves safe.\u201d \u2013 Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wisc., on \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d\n\nPOWER PLAY: PLANNED PARENTHOOD GAME CHANGER\nUndercover video of a Planned Parenthood exec talking about harvesting fetal organs has shocked the country. Given the abortion rights group\u2019s close alignment the Democratic party, what does the uproar mean politically? Republican strategist Mercedes Schlapp and Democratic consultant Craig Varoga discuss the fallout with Chris Stirewalt. WATCH HERE.\n\nPlanned Parenthood is sorry if you were offended - Fox News: \u201cCecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, defended the organization\u2019s practices and maintained the group does not illegally sell fetal tissue. But, in a video statement [Richards said]\u2026This is unacceptable, and I personally apologize for the staff member\u2019s tone and statements,\u201d Richards said. Richards does not directly name Deborah Nucatola, the group official in the video. The video was secretly recorded last year and released to the press this week by the pro-life group, Center for Medical Progress.\u201d\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026\nFast Company: \u201cIBM wants you to be able to tell how your tone comes across in written communications.

Donald Trump lands at 18 percent in the poll topping the list 3 points ahead of his closest competitor Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wisc., who climbs to 15 percent, followed by former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., who holds strong at 14 percent. What about the other Floridian? Sen Marco Rubio, R-Fla., continued to slip, but seems to have stabilized. Rubio fell from 13 percent in April down to 9 percent in May. Since then he\u2019s waivered around the high single digits. For now, it seems, Rubio has managed to hold that space, which in a field like this is an achievement in itself.\n\nThe Trump effect was felt outside of the top tier where contenders like Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Rick Perry, Mike Huckabee and, perhaps most of all, Carly Fiorina.\n\nPower Play:\u00a0Trumpedo - How damaging has Trump really been beyond the media hype? Republican strategist Mercedes Schlapp and Democratic consultant Craig Varoga give Chris Stirewalt their take. WATCH HERE.\n\nJeb\u2019s take on the Iran deal: legitimizing a regime with \u2018blood on their hands\u2019 - Yahoo! reporter Jon Ward talked with Former Gov.

Bush said, \u201cWe also have a situation that is deeply troubling to me, which is there\u2019s blood on their hands with American military men and women in Iraq\u2026And to legitimize a regime that killed hundreds of American soldiers without any consequence, without any recognition that that\u2019s something that should be troubling, is deeply disturbing to me.\u201d\n\nAnd gains another Hamptons \u2018money man\u2019 - NYDN: \u201cPresidential hopeful\u00a0Jeb Bush\u00a0will head on a Hamptons\u2026with a stop at money man\u00a0Ken Lipper\u2019s East Hampton mansion... Lipper\u2026will host Bush at an intimate brunch after the former Florida governor flies in just for the day on July 25.\u201d\n\nThis sounds familiar\u2026 - Miami Herald: \u201cJeb Bush\u00a0is bringing back one of the phrases he loved to use as governor -- \u2018Mount Tallahassee\u2019 -- only now that he\u2019s running for president, he\u2019s talking about \u2018Mount Washington.\u2019 Bush plans to speak in the state capital Monday about how we would reform how the federal capital works. It\u2019s part of a series of speeches about what his priorities would be as president, spokeswoman Allie Brandenburger\u00a0said.\u201d\n\nWalker for the win - Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel: \u201cDealing\u00a0Gov. Scott Walker\u00a0a victory just as his presidential campaign gets underway, the Wisconsin Supreme Court in a sweeping decision Thursday ruled the governor\u2019s campaign and conservative groups had not violated campaign finance laws.\u201d\n\nLook who\u2019s here - Boston Globe: \u201cIt was one of those only-in-New-Hampshire moments. Presidential candidates bump into each other \u2014 on a street corner. While campaigning. Luckily, Dr. Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina are friends, having served together on the board of the Kellogg Co.

Klein writes, \u201cOn Wednesday, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the insurance industry\u2019s largest lobbying group, announced that it had elected Marilyn Tavenner as its chief executive officer. Before joining AHIP, Tavenner led the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under Obama\u2026Tavenner could be a poster child for the corrupting influences of the revolving door between industry and government that Obama once decried.\u201d\n\nSCHLAPPED: CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS \u2018BROKE HIS WORD\u2019\nThat\u2019s what American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp stated in his op-ed in The Hill. On the heels of the two watershed decisions from the Supreme Court last month, Schlapp writes, \u201cIt was\u00a0once\u00a0unimaginable\u00a0to most people\u00a0to think that Chief Justice John Roberts would contradict so sharply the image\u00a0he\u00a0portrayed\u00a0at his\u00a0confirmation hearing. For example, under oath he explained, \u2018You don\u2019t look to legislative history\u00a0to create ambiguity.\u00a0 If the text is clear, that is what you follow, and that\u2019s binding.\u00a0 And you don\u2019t look beyond it to say, well, if you look here, though, maybe this clear word should be interpreted a different way.\u2019\u201d\n\nAH, GERMANY\u2026\nA squirrel faced police in Germany after a woman complained he was stalking her, reports NBC News. When the woman was unable to shake the rodent authorities stepped in, and found he was suffering from exhaustion. In an effort to give the animal some much needed sleep the officers fed him apple and honey tea. After recovering, the animal will be transferred to a local shelter.\n\nAND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\u201cThis is in all probability an example of radical Islam at work and you know I think our emphasis on ISIS is a little overstated because we had these attacks that predate ISIS\u2026But the general issue is radical Islam. And unless we have a president who immediately says this is a lone gunman, how does he know?\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d Watch here.\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
