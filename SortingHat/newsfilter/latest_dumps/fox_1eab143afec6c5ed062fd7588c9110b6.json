So Hillary Clinton's craving for a Chipotle burrito bowl last week may have been more calculated than original thought. The second most liberal dining establishment in the U.S. is Starbucks, according to the survey.\n\nAs for the right, Chick-Fil-A grabbed the top conservative spot, scoring a 120 on Experian\u2019s index. Sonic and Applebee\u2019s patrons also tend to be more right leaning.\u00a0\n\nRegardless of political affiliation, Americans are still spending more money than ever dining out.\u00a0\n\n\nDid Hillary Clinton know Chipotle is favored by liberals?
