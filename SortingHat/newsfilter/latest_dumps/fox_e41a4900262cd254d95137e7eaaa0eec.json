Jeb Bush for president at an event in the swing state of Colorado Tuesday.\nThe endorsements constitute the largest group of military veteran supporters for any candidate in the 2016 election, according to the Bush campaign.\n\"It\u2019s an incredible honor to have the support of these heroic individuals.\u201d Bush said in a statement to Fox News. \"I am committed to a safe America through a strong military, and having a strong military includes having policies that will keep our country\u2019s commitment to our veterans\u200e.\"\nBush's so-called veterans coalition includes four members of Congress, eleven Medal of Honor recipients, and ten former Navy SEALs or Army Special Forces soldiers.\nAt Tuesday's town hall in Englewood, Colo., Bush is also set to announce more details about his plan to overhaul the Department of Veterans Affairs, which has been plagued by scandals and criticism over the last two years.\n\u201cThe entire system needs to be simplified, reformed and refocused on its most important mission\u2014to \u2018care for those who shall have borne the battle,\u201d Bush wrote in a National Review editorial earlier this month.\nRecent polls of Republican primary voters have shown Bush coming in a distant second to billionaire businessman and reality TV star Donald Trump.
