Lincoln Chaffee is not a suitable Democratic nominee. He\u2019s a party switcher from a tiny state and who has a less-than-stellar track record. But as Chaffee launches his candidacy today why isn\u2019t he getting the kind of loving attention that the even more unsuitable Sen. Bernie Sanders has received? After all, Chaffee is so far showing far more courage in taking on his party\u2019s establishment than Sanders. And unlike Sanders and former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley so far, Chaffee is willing to hit presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton where it hurts: foreign policy. Liberals have cheered on Sanders for moving Clinton to the left but Democrats and the establishment press seems ready to give her a free pass on foreign policy.  As CNNs new poll confirms, President Obama\u2019s Iraq war is at least a political disaster, whatever you say about the tactics. It is as unpopular as George W. Bush\u2019s Iraq war prior to the 2007 troop surge and says equal numbers of Americans blame Bush and Obama for the rise of ISIS. The WaPo/ABC News poll substantially concurs, giving Obama a 31 percent approval rating on his ISIS policy overall. Even assuming Democrats back Obama at a higher rate than the general population, there are deep problems here. What would Clinton do differently? How would she solve the crisis? How does she explain the rise of ISIS in Libya after the rebellion she backed there went awry? These are far more important questions for the former secretary of state than how many brands of deodorant she believes as just society would offer.  Clinton can keep playing patty-cake with her party\u2019s left wing by just talking. Clinton can elicit oohs and ahs just for using liberal buzzwords on income inequality, police policies, immigration and sexual practices. But on the question of what she would do today about ISIS, Iran, Libya and a bevy of other foreign policy issues: zilch.  Lincoln Chaffee is not quite as unlikely to be the Democratic nominee as Sanders, but the fact that his prosecution of Clinton\u2019s record is ignored while Sander\u2019s long-shot run gets so much coverage may tell you all need to know about Clinton\u2019s structural advantages with the press.  [Watch Fox:\u00a0Correspondent Peter Doocy reports on the Chaffee announcement from Arlington, Virginia]  Big buck rodeo - Clinton attends a breakfast fundraiser in New Mexico today at the home of Ed Romero, her husband\u2019s ambassador to Spain. She then heads to Texas for fundraisers today and Thursday.  \u201cThe high likelihood is that Hillary will be the (Democratic) nominee, but I think inevitability is not her friend. It\u2019s a real burden.\u201d \u2013 longtime Obama strategistDavid Axelrod speaking at Marquette University Law School.  Party pooh bah plumping for Hillary - Politico reports that the guy who is supposed to be raising money for the whole Democratic Party is also raising funds for one Democrat in particular: Hillary. The former Obama fundraiser-turned-DNC finance chair, Henry R. Mu\u00f1oz III, made calls on behalf of Clinton\u2019s fundraiser in the Lone Star State today, according to local county chairman Manuel Medina.  Power Play: Hillary\u2019s polling problem, in 60 seconds - Hillary Clinton has taken a big hit in recent polls as the scandals afflicting her campaign take hold.

But one thing at which Britons have long excelled is making cheese. Theirs is some of the best in the world and has been since long before most Americans found out that the good stuff comes in colors other than orange. So celebrate British Cheese Week (yes, yes, we know jokesters \u2013 every week is British cheese week). The Telegraph helpfully provides ten of the British best for you to try.

Jeb Bush, R-Fla., showed a feistier attitude than usual. In an interview with Neil Cavuto from a Florida candidate forum, Bush reacted to President Obama\u2019s recent comment that he restored America\u2019s standing in the world after President George W. Bush. Jeb had harsh words saying, \u201cIt was like our President was living in an alternative universe.\u201d But Bush was tough on his fellow Republicans too. When Cavuto made a comparison between Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., on similar bond rating problems as governors, Bush was quick to add Christie\u2019s policies were, \u201c\u2026different than ours.\u201d In another interview Bush hit Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., his NSA firestorm saying Paul was, \u201c\u2026wrong about the Patriot Act.\u201d  But Bush\u2019s most interesting parry came when asked by reporters about Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., whose video message to the gathering reinforced his call for generational change in American politics, saying, \u201cour outdated leaders continue to cling to outdated ideas.\u201d Bush, 62, sarcastically said, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to imagine that my good friend Marco would be critical of his good friend Jeb.\u201d  Jeb\u2019s problem in Iowa isn\u2019t Dubya - While general election voters have concerns about President George W. Bush\u2019s role in brother\u2019s campaign, a recent Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll says that it\u2019s not President George W. Bush\u2019s fault that his brother isn\u2019t doing better in the early state.  Walker hits Hillary, with backhand for Jeb - \u201cPeople don\u2019t want a leader anointed in America. They don\u2019t want someone who\u2019s part of a monarchy or a legacy. They want someone who earns it by working hard, making the case to the American people that they\u2019re going to work for everyday Americans like them.\u201d \u2013 Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wisc., on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d  Rubio dumps his troublesome house - An aide to Sen. Rubio told Fox News\u2019 Serafin Gomez that Rubio sold what has been called his, \u201chouse of horrors,\u201d in Tallahassee, Fla. The house has been not only a financial drain, but a tie to the scandal-plagued former Congressman David Rivera, R-Fla., with whom Rubio purchased the house when they lived there together as state-lawmakers. Rivera lost his seat in 2012 amid a campaign finance scandal.  Nevada hits establishment, keeps caucus - The Hill: \u201cThe Nevada state legislature\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0failed to pass a measure changing its presidential caucuses to a primary election, dealing a blow to former Gov. Jeb Bush\u2019s (R-Fla.) hopes in the early-voting state, while boosting Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.)\u2026top-tier Republican presidential contenders like Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\u2026could have been in good shape if the state had moved to a primary, which tend be higher turnout affairs that favor well-funded candidates who spend a lot of time and money on the ground.\u201d  Rand post-NSA fallout: Good or bad - National Journal: \u201c[Rand Paul] needs to win the race of public opinion and raise his profile among grassroots donors. Unlike competitors such as Jeb Bush or even fellow Sen. Marco Rubio, Paul has struggled to tap into the donor class that many campaigns rely on. So, from the Senate floor during his battle against the NSA, Paul\u2019s campaign raked in money.\u201d  Transgender tangle for Huckabee - WaPo: \u201c[Former Gov. Mike Huckabee\u2019s] February comments [on transgenderism] might have gone over quite well back in 2004, when so-called \u2018values voters\u2019 dominated\u2026[A]n audience for Huckabee\u2019s version of traditional moral values does exist. And a lot of it lives in Iowa, a state Huckabee won in 2008\u2026This is increasingly part-and-parcel to Huckabee's appeals to social conservatives\u2026It\u2019s the kind of aw-shucks, flyover-country-versus-the freaky-coasts politics\u2026That dynamic amounted to central theme in Huckabee\u2019s book, and it seems to be a real part of Huckabee\u2019s 2016 GOP primary campaign strategy.\u201d  [Huckabee hits the road for day three of his four day sweep through his home state of Arkansas.]  Kelly File exclusive with Duggars - Huckabee\u2019s fellow Razorbacks Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar join Megyn Kelly tonight to speak about their son\u2019s alleged molestation of their younger children. The Duggars have been part of Republican presidential primary politics for years endorsing folks like former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., in 2012 and Mike Huckabee in 2008, the latter has vowed to stand by them.

Christie tries a South Carolina town hall - Christie holds his first town hall outside New Hampshire or New Jersey today. Christie has not spent much time in the early Southern state. His last trip was in January for Gov. Nikki Haley\u2019s, R-S.C., inauguration.  BOEHNER MAKES TRADE PITCH Speaker John Boehner continues to push hard for the Trade Promotion Authority bill. In a new video, Boehner\u2019s voiceover explains why this bill is good for America as drawings depict examples of what he\u2019s saying.
