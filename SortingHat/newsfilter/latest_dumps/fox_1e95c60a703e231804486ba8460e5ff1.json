In \u201cThe Sun Also \u2009Rises,\u201d one character asks, \u2009\u201cHow did you go bankrupt?\u201d and another responds: \u201cTwo ways. Gradually, then suddenly.\u201d\n\nThe exchange captures Hillary Clinton\u2019s red alert. She\u2019s been going politically bankrupt for a long time, and now faces the prospect of sudden collapse.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf she\u2019s got a winning defense, she better be quick about it. The ghosts of scandals past are gaining on her and time is not on her side.\n\nHillary\u2019s one big advantage is obvious \u2014 she\u2019s the only serious contender for the Democratic nomination, and she beats most GOP opponents in head-to-head matchups. But everything else weighs against her, including momentum.\n\nThe compelling claims that she and Bill Clinton sold favors while she was secretary of state for tens of millions of dollars for themselves and their foundation don\u2019t need to meet the legal standard for bribery. She\u2019s on political trial in a country where Clinton Fatigue alone could be a fatal verdict.\n\nAfter 25 years of corner-cutting and dishonest behavior, accumulation is her enemy. Each day threatens to deliver the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back. It may already have happened and we\u2019re just waiting for public opinion to catch up to the facts.\n\nMeanwhile, her Houdini skills are being tested big time.\n\nTo continue reading Michael Goodwin's column in the New York Post, click here.Michael Goodwin is a Fox News contributor and New York Post columnist.", "byline": "", "description": "Hillary Rodham Clinton has been going politically bankrupt for a long time, and now faces the prospect of sudden collapse.", "title": "Hillary Clinton: Is Democratic candidate on verge of collapse?", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/A-bqxXz54eY/", "topics": ["women", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Bill Clinton", "Michael Goodwin", "Ernest Hemingway", "Hillary Clinton", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Clinton Fatigue"], "orgs": ["New York Post"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-04-27 14:16:41", "org": "fox", "article_id": "1e95c60a703e231804486ba8460e5ff1", "date_access": "2015-04-27 15:20:06.560467"}
