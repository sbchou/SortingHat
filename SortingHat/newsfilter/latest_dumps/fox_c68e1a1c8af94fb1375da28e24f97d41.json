I go up, and they're scalping tickets. You heard that? They're scalping tickets. Why? Because people don't want to be ripped off, and this country is being ripped off. I think if I ran, I'd win.\u201d\nHe has been honing this act for a long time.\nMany pundits\u2014some of them the same wiseguys who thought Trump would sink like a stone\u2014are saying that he\u2019s taken a beating over the last week. After all, NBC, Univision, Macy\u2019s and Serta have all cut ties with him over his comments on Mexican immigrants.\nMany people obviously found those comments offensive. But in purely political terms, this is helping Trump.\n\nFor one thing, he has dominated the campaign news cycle for a week, drawing more attention than all the other candidates combined. He has driven home his message with a spate of cable news interviews. (And\u2014subtle plug here\u2014The Donald will be talking about these issues Sunday on \u201cMedia Buzz.\u201d)\nHere\u2019s what the media elite misses, and why he\u2019s surged into second place in Fox and CNN polls. Trump portrays himself as a fighter, and that resonates with many voters. Trump casts himself as a straight talker, and voters like that. Trump markets himself as a non-politician in an era when the public is fed up with pols. He\u2019s seen as tough on illegal immigration, which doesn\u2019t hurt in a Republican primary.\nThe bombastic billionaire also strikes a populist note by going to war with big corporations.\nAnd this just in: President Obama, in Tennessee, called for a smart legal immigration system \u201cthat doesn\u2019t separate families but does focus on making sure that people who are dangerous, people who are, you know, gang-bangers, who are criminals that we\u2019re deporting as quickly as possible.\u201d\nGang-bangers? Trump\u2019s version was more inelegant, but if the president is worried about Mexican gang-bangers, doesn\u2019t it suggest the businessman had a point?\nBy now, most politicians would have softened or papered over the remarks about Mexican immigrants including such miscreants as rapists. But Trump has doubled and tripled down. He\u2019s denounced NBC, sued Univision for $500 million and urged customers to boycott Macy\u2019s. This dovetails nicely with his refrain about politicians being \u201call talk and no action.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the press has been prodding Trump\u2019s Republican rivals to take him on. \u201cHis outlandish rhetoric and skill at occupying the national spotlight are also proving to be dangerously toxic for the GOP brand, which remains in the rehabilitation stage after losing the 2012 presidential race,\u201d says a front-page Washington Post story. \u00a0\nCBS\u2019s Nancy Cordes said Republican leaders \u201cworry\u201d that Trump\u2019s rising polls \u201cwill just embolden him and further alienate the critical Hispanic vote.\u201d\nBut why is this a Republican problem? Yes, the party has well-documented difficulties with Hispanic voters, but Trump is hardly an establishment Republican. He might be causing himself problems with Latinos, but why would that rub off on, for example, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio? The media often demand that all party members respond to one Republican\u2019s controversial comments in a way that you rarely see with Democrats.\nStill, some GOPers realized they could ride this wave. George Pataki, perhaps to remind people he\u2019s running, called Trump\u2019s comments \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\nNew Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez said \u201cI think those are horrible things to say about anyone and any culture.\u201d\nHillary hit Trump, but without naming him, while Jeb Bush limited himself to \u201cI don\u2019t agree with him. I think he\u2019s wrong.\u201d\nThe point is, they\u2019re all responding to Donald Trump. And for the moment, he\u2019s the guy driving the campaign narrative.\nClick for more from Media Buzz\nmedia-buzz\n\nMedia Buzz, hosted by Howard Kurtz, airs on Sundays at 11AM and 5PM ET on Fox News Channel.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this show\n\n\n\n", "byline": "", "description": "The first time I interviewed Donald Trump, back in 1987, he said this:", "title": "Trump bump: Why his media war against offended corporations is boosting him", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/hr8g9ecck_Q/", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["George Pataki", "Howard Kurtz", "Jeb Bush", "Nancy Cordes", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Susana Martinez", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": ["Univision", "GOP", "Macy"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-07-03 22:10:57", "org": "fox", "article_id": "c68e1a1c8af94fb1375da28e24f97d41", "date_access": "2015-07-03 10:20:03.218569"}
