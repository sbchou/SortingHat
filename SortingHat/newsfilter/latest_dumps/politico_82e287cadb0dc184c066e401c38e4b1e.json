Steve Elmendorf and Jimmy Ryan of Elmendorf|Ryan and Paul Frick and Dan Sallick of Home Front are partners in the firm.\nSubject Matter is also bringing on Debra DeShong as executive vice president and managing director for public affairs. A long-time Democratic communications operative, DeShong most recently served as chief of staff to U.S. Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy.\nThe move to combine forces comes as K Street mergers and acquisitions by large public companies have slowed in recent years as more lobbyists and consultants have moved to smaller or independent shops. Meanwhile, lobbying and consulting revenues have been hurt by tightened corporate budgets and congressional gridlock has also put pressure on the bottom line.\nFor instance, two recent downtown mergers were borne out of firms in crisis \u2014 Squire Sanders merging with embattled Patton Boggs and Wiley Rein acquiring McBee Strategic after its name partner exited. But the move by Elmendorf|Ryan and Homefront comes with both firms on solid financial footing. The top partners think it\u2019s a strong strategic move and will help them integrate all aspects of client services.\nI think the marketplace right now rewards people who are not large and bureaucratic,\" Elmendorf said. \"I think we can hit that sweet spot of creating a business that is big enough to do a lot of things \u2014 service clients in a lot of ways \u2014 but not too big that our clients feel that they aren't getting the attention and service we've always provided.\"\nWhile firm mergers like this can often serve as a catalyst to try and get bought out by a large public firm like WPP or Interpublic Group, the partners said that isn't their goal.\n\"It was sort of born out of a 20 year friendship and evolved over a two year conversation about how the industry is changing and how we might work together,\" Sallick said. \"While we've both been in business a long time, we are definitely approaching this with a start-up mentality with a lot of intensity, a lot of energy around how we do things different.\"\nThe firm is founded by partners with deep Democratic ties. Three of the firm's four partners \u2014 Elmendorf, Sallick and Frick all worked for former House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (Mo.). Ryan worked for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (Nev.) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.).\nBut the partners said that they aren't committed to sticking with their one-party model.\n\"The goal is to figure out the best way to service clients,\" Elmendorf said. \"We're looking at a whole bunch of different ways both in terms of being bipartisan and geography to grow the firm and in terms of services... we start all of this with an open mind in how can you grow the business in such a way to do the most for clients.\"\nHome Front was founded in 1998 and recently launched inside the Beltway policy campaigns for the Association of American Railroads, Airlines for America and Nestle USA, which included television and radio commercials, digital media content and advertising, among other things. Other Home Front clients include: Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and the United States Census Bureau. \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Elmendorf Ryan, Home Front Communications merge", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/elmendorf-ryan-home-front-communications-213832", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "women", "immigration"], "people": ["Rachael Bade", "Hillary Clinton", "Hanna Trudo", "Michael Kruse", "Dan Sallick", "Steven Shepard", "Bob Corker", "Chris Christie", "Anita Hill", "Harry Reid", "Karen G.
