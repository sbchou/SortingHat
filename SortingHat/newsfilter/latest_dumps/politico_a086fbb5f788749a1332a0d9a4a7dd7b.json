She argued that Republicans are only damaging their party among women. And she\u2019s in a strong position: Boehner has been forced to routinely turn to Democrats in the House on must-pass legislation and Democratic leaders are confident the Ohio Republican will work with them again.\n\n\n\n            By \nBurgess Everett\n\nBut Boehner\u2019s other adversaries \u2013 a cadre of hardline conservatives \u2013 are just as determined to strip Planned Parenthood of the $540 million it receives in government funding. More than 30 lawmakers have signed on to a letter from South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney pledging to not vote for any funding measure that appropriates money to the health care organization.\nAnd the roughly 35 members of the House Freedom Caucus are expected to take a similar stand this week, lawmakers have said.\n\u201cI think leadership is going to have to choose, do they want it to be a talking point or do they actually want to do something about it,\u201d Mulvaney said.\nThe contentious issue has dominated lawmakers\u2019 attention after nine videos were released over the summer allegedly depicting agents of Planned Parenthood discussing fetal tissue sales. The group denies any wrongdoing.\nDemocrats say the Republican effort only validates their long-running argument that Republicans are waging a \u201cwar on women.\u201d\n\u201cHow dare they be so disrespectful to women. How dare they be so disregarding of women's health issues. Since I have been here - it's 28 years - they have been out to get Planned Parenthood,\u201d Pelosi (D-Calif.) said.\nShe suggested that the anti-Planned Parenthood push could will come back to haunt the GOP in next year's general election.\n\u201cThis budget,\" Pelosi said, \"is a lot bigger than the ideology\u2026.of a few in that caucus.\u201d\nBut Republicans are also certain they've got a winner. GOP voters are staunchly opposed to abortion and the conservative lawmakers view fighting Planned Parenthood funding as fulfilling their campaign promises. Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho, one of the Freedom Caucus\u2019 leaders, said that while conservatives are not advocating for a shutdown, his fellow right-wingers \u201ccan\u2019t be afraid of having the battle.\u201d\n\u201cIf you telegraph to the other side that you\u2019re unwilling to have that battle you\u2019ve already capitulated. What you say is you\u2019re going to use all the tools available,\u201d he said.\nThe ingrained positions have the makings of a dramatic three weeks in Congress. Lawmakers have to pass a budget bill, or continuing resolution, to fund the government before Oct. 1. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already said his chamber doesn\u2019t have the votes to defund Planned Parenthood and House GOP leaders have yet to formalize a plan to move forward.\n\n\n\n            By \nJake Sherman\n\nBoehner told Republicans during a closed-door conference Wednesday that allowing a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood could hurt the cause of lawmakers who oppose abortion rights. The House is expected to hold a government funding vote next week but are still split on how to tackle funding for the group. The conservatives are meeting with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) and Republican Conference Chairman Cathy McMorris Rogers (R-Wash.) to chart a course forward.\nDemocrats want to keep the debate focused on abortion and preserving the constitutional right of a woman to obtain the procedure until a fetus is viable instead of having to talk about the gruesome images captured in the sting videos.\nAt a House Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday, Democrats blasted Republicans for trying to use the video controversy to try to overturn Roe v. Wade. Republicans \u201cwon\u2019t be happy until abortion is outlawed in the United States of America,\u201d said Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.).\nThey\u2019re also trying to refocus the conversation away from Planned Parenthood and on to the group that made the surreptitious videos, the Center for Medical Progress, and its founder, David Daleiden. Planned Parenthood and its allies allege that the group has ties to violent anti-abortion activists, which its executives strongly deny. Democrats also allege that the group violated state and federal laws in the course of obtaining the undercover video and interviews.\n\u201cRepublicans are frothing at the mouth at Planned Parenthood\u2026.,\u201d Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.) said. \u201cHouse Democrats will use every opportunity this month to highlight the GOP's 'd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again' strategy and misplaced priorities.\u201d\nConservatives, however, see this as the best chance they\u2019ve had in decades to seriously curb Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding \u2013 and create a discussion about Republican priorities in Congress. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said Republicans aren't afraid to discuss the problems they see within Planned Parenthood in their effort to defund the group.\nThey\u2019ve floated an alternative measure that would redirect the government funding Planned Parenthood receives to health care clinics.\n\u201cThe dollar amount will be exactly the same\u2026it will go to other organizations that are not involved with what looks like criminal activity,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cBut the reality is to just have a show vote [isn\u2019t enough]\u2026 What they did is immoral.\u201d\n\n                                            By \nJohn Culhane\n\n\n                                            By \nSue Bell Cobb\n\n\n                                            By \nMark Perry\n\n\n                                            By \nAlan Wolfe\n\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Conservatives and Democrats are equally sure they benefit from a fight that threatens to shut down the government.", "title": "On Planned Parenthood, both sides see a winner", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/planned-parenthood-abortion-congress-shutdown-fight-213469", "topics": ["abortion"], "people": ["Katy O'Donnell", "Burgess Everett", "Steve Cohen", "Alan Wolfe", "Kim Davis", "Tim Grieve", "Jim Jordan", "Mike Huckabee", "Anna Palmer", "Hadas Gold", "Vladimir Putin", "Tim Hartman", "Tim Starks", "Ted Cruz", "Danny Vinik", "Sue Bell Cobb", "Raul Labrador", "Mick Mulvaney", "Parke Wilde", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Kimberly Hefling", "Theodoric Meyer", "Nahal Toosi", "Josh Gerstein", "Donald J.
