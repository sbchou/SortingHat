However, another major 2012 Santorum backer, Louisiana energy executive William Dor\u00e9, is not listed.\nStory Continued Below\nSantorum, a devout Roman Catholic and one of the field\u2019s most vocal social conservatives, also enjoys support from donors heavily involved in Catholic causes, including Frank Hanna, a wealthy businessman from Atlanta. Euse Mita, a Pennsylvania developer who is playing a key role in fundraising ahead of the pope\u2019s visit to the U.S. this fall, is also on board with Santorum.\nThe former Pennsylvania senator produced one of the most abysmal campaign fundraising reports in the GOP field last week, raising only about $607,000 and spending most of it.\nSantorum\u2019s full finance committee list is below:\nLee and Kelley Beaman (Nashville, Tennessee)\nJeff and Donna Blackard (McKinney, Texas)\nRaza Bokhari (Villanova, Pennsylvania)\nCurtis Bostic (Charleston, South Carolina)\nTim Busch (Irvine, California)\nPat and Becky Cipollone (Bethesda, Maryland)\nSonny and Sally Climer (Wildersville, Tennessee)\nJoe Corcoran (Malvern, Pennsylvania)\nStephen Cordasco (Cherry Hill, New Jersey)\nHon.
