{"body": "WAUKESHA, Wis. \u2014 Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who built a national conservative following by crippling public employee unions and then defeating a forceful effort to recall him, announced on Monday that he is running for president as a Washington outsider whose taste for big fights would lead to a smaller federal government.\n\nMr. Walker is the 15th prominent Republican to formally start his campaign, doing so at a time of growing challenges for him, especially in Iowa. He considers it a must-win state in the presidential nominating process, which begins there in February.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running for president to fight and win for the American people,\u201d he announced in a campaign video released early Monday.\n\nAs an unofficial candidate early this year, Mr. Walker got off to a hot start with several strong speeches and impressive poll numbers in Iowa and other key states. But a series of gaffes hurt him among some Republican leaders and donors, and his lead in Iowa polls has softened recently as rivals like Senator Ted Cruz, Rick Perry, Donald J. Trump and Ben Carson have gained ground or campaigned more than Mr. Walker.\n\nHis fund-raising has also lagged behind that of several Republicans, including Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio, who are widely considered top contenders along with Mr. Walker.\n\nMr. Walker\u2019s strategy is now focused on building a political operation in Iowa and campaigning aggressively there with an increasingly conservative message. He recently endorsed amending the United States Constitution to leave laws blocking same-sex marriage up to each state, and he is preparing to sign Wisconsin legislation that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, except when the life of the mother is in immediate jeopardy.\n\nWith those positions and others, Mr. Walker is aiming to sway conservative and evangelical voters, two dominant groups in the Iowa Republican caucuses. They may now have a particular affinity for Mr. Cruz and Mr. Carson, who had a combined 19 percent support of likely Iowa caucusgoers in a recent Quinnipiac University poll. But other Republican candidates like Mr. Perry, a former Texas governor, and Mr. Rubio are angling to appeal to the same voters, and Mr. Rubio and his supporters have more financial resources than Mr. Walker does right now.\n\n\u201cWalker had a great winter but maybe got a little cocky, a little ahead of himself, and now he really has to take the time to work Iowa and build up the resources to compete harder in the early primary states,\u201d said Ed Rollins, a veteran Republican consultant who has worked with David Polyansky, one of Mr. Walker\u2019s advisers in Iowa.\n\nTo distinguish himself, Mr. Walker, a 47-year-old career politician, is building his bid for the White House around his style of leadership, reflected in slogans like \u201cgo big and go bold\u201d and \u201ca fighter and a winner,\u201d and his record as governor since 2011.\n\nHe has also sought to enhance his understanding of national affairs and foreign policy by taking time away from the campaign trail this year for dozens of briefings with experts, heads of state and military officials. As a result, not only has he spent less time fund-raising than other candidates, he has also been absent for long stretches from New Hampshire and South Carolina, which have early nominating contests and where his poll numbers have slipped as well.\n\n\u201cI think he waited too late to get into the race, because there was such excitement for him when he was here in March,\u201d said Catherine Welborn, a South Carolina Republican who heard Mr. Walker speak that month in Charleston. \u201cSouth Carolina doesn\u2019t have much time to get to know him, but one thing is for sure: He needs to come down here and tell the story about beating the unions. That\u2019s the kind of person we need to stand up for America.\u201d\n\nOther admirers of Mr. Walker said he was poised to regain momentum because of his fiscally conservative record in Wisconsin, where he signed a two-year state budget on Sunday that holds the line on taxes and cuts funds for University of Wisconsin campuses while also freezing tuition there.\n\nBut Mr. Walker is best known for taking on Wisconsin\u2019s public employee unions, shortly after taking office in 2011, by proposing a bill to repeal collective bargaining for most government workers to give control over pay and benefits back to the state. Championing the measure as a way to deal with the state\u2019s budget deficit, Mr. Walker drew support from his extensive network of conservative backers, as well as Republican leaders in the State Legislature.\n\nUnion leaders and Democrats fought hard during weeks of protests at the State Capitol, saying the bill was unnecessary and intended only to gut the unions and advance Mr. Walker\u2019s political ambitions.\n\nThe legislation passed, which led to the effort to recall Mr. Walker the next year. He won that battle, too, and throughout these fights attracted 300,000 donors nationwide, a network he hopes will help finance his presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cGovernor Walker\u2019s sterling record of accomplishment \u2014 historic pension reforms, tax cuts, right to work \u2014 provide an impressive foundation as he begins this campaign, but, yes, they do help raise expectations for him,\u201d said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group supported by the billionaire industrialists Charles G. and David H. Koch.\n\nAfter his remarks here, Mr. Walker will visit the four early nominating states \u2014 Nevada on Tuesday, South Carolina on Wednesday, New Hampshire on Thursday and Iowa for a three-day \u201cWinnebago tour.\u201d\n\nThe recreational vehicle reflects a Midwestern, Everyman image of Mr. Walker that he has highlighted on the campaign trail with his stories about riding his beloved Harley-Davidson motorcycle and shopping for discount clothing at Kohl\u2019s.\n\n\u201cHe has an instinct, because he is so middle class, of absorbing information and facts and putting it through that middle-class filter,\u201d said Ed Goeas, a senior adviser to Mr. Walker and veteran pollster.\n\n\u201cMost people I work with are in one of two categories: You walk through an issue with them and they say, \u2018Here\u2019s my position,\u2019 or you walk through an issue with them and they say, \u2018Here\u2019s my position, but what do the polls say?\u2019\u201d Mr. Goeas said. \u201cThe unique thing about Scott is, and I\u2019ve never seen this with anyone else, he does a gut check after taking a position. He says, \u2018Tell me, if we do this, if this is the solution, the one test I want to run is, will this make people\u2019s lives better?\u2019\u201d", "byline": "PATRICK HEALY", "description": "Gov.
