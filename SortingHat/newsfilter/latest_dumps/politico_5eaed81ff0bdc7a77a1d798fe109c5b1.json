Astounding,\u201d Bush wrote on his campaign website.\n\r\nThe tax rant and voluminous disclosure gives Bush a chance to talk about his wealth (estimated around $20 million) on his own terms, while delivering a dig at Clinton, who is still under fire for her exclusive use of a personal email account while serving as secretary of state. The staging and packaging of this document dump was a sleight of hand aiming to distract from the disclosures themselves \u2014 the fact that Bush is very much a 1-percenter who has aggressively monetized his family connections to amass significant wealth amidst a recession \u2014 and from several bad business dealings with questionable associates that have already been well chronicled.

Send tips, ideas and gripes to jtopaz@politico.com.\nToday\u2019s headline: CHRIS CHRISTIE is running for president. The New Jersey governor officially launched his campaign this morning, telling supporters he\u2019ll always tell it to them straight. In other news, two big document dumps overshadowed the race today \u2014 33 years worth of tax returns for JEB BUSH and 3,000 pages worth of State Department emails for HILLARY CLINTON. Also, BERNIE SANDERS railed against his vulgarian rivals for their last minute, beat-the-FEC-clock cash dash.\nTRAIL MIX: A look at what's popping on the campaign trail\nCHRIS CHRISTIE MAKES IT OFFICIAL \nA BRASH CAMPAIGN: POLITICO\u2019s Alex Isenstadt reports from Livingston, NJ: \"CHRIS CHRISTIE formally launched his presidential campaign here on Tuesday, hoping the plain-spoken style and penchant for authenticity that once made him a rising star in the Republican Party will catapult him from long-shot to contender. Speaking before around 1,000 supporters at the small high school gymnasium of his alma mater, the New Jersey governor promised a brash campaign, one in which he would speak his mind and offer a decisive, clear vision of leadership that he said was lacking from his many rivals in the Republican field \u2026 The event was designed to showcase Christie\u2019s style. He spoke without the help of a teleprompter, and frequently didn\u2019t make use of the notes that were sitting on the podium.\u201d politi.co/1U4NVWq\nPLAIN-SPOKEN: From the speech: \u201cWhen I stand up on a stage like this in front of all of you there is one thing you will know for sure: I mean what I say and I say what I mean. And unlike some people who offer themselves for the presidency in 2016, you\u2019re not going to have to wonder whether I can do it or not.\u201d\nCLEARING THINGS UP: Also from the speech: \u201cI\u2019m not running for president of the United States as a surrogate for being elected prom king of America.\u201d\nBETTING IT ALL ON NH: POLITICO\u2019s Eli Stokols reports as CHRIS CHRISTIE hustled off to New Hampshire for a five-day swing. \u201cThe embattled New Jersey governor has little choice: he has to go all-in on the Granite State. Trouble is, he\u2019s not alone. JEB BUSH and RAND PAUL are also heavily invested in New Hampshire. So are a handful of GOP long-shots ranging from GEORGE PATAKI to JOHN KASICH. ... Never before have so many White House hopefuls bet so much on a single primary \u2026 for almost every moderately conservative, establishment-oriented GOP hopeful in need of an early state breakthrough, New Hampshire is really the only game in town.\u201d politi.co/1Hvwz1h\nFIRST SPOUSE PRIMARY: Mary Pat Christie, in an upcoming interview with CNN, says CHRIS CHRISTIE\u2019s blunt style is \u201ca hallmark of his leadership\u201d and reflects on the aftermath of Bridgegate. \u201cI think that you felt that people were all against you and you wanted to get to shout what the truth was,\u201d she said in an excerpt provided to POLITICO. \u201cI wouldn't recommend it, but it was healthy in some ways\u2026but we're past that. Everybody knows that Chris had nothing to do with that. We have to remind people why Chris is such a good leader.\u201d\nOFF-MESSAGE: National Journal asked CHRIS CHRISTIE\u2019s biggest backer, billionaire Ken Langone, whether he would donate at least $10 million to the New Jersey governor\u2019s campaign. \u201cWould I write a check for $10 million? No, no I wouldn't,\u201d said Langone, the founder of Home Depot and an estimated net worth of more than $2 billion. bit.ly/1HrNMqt\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BLAST BONUS! MEGA-DONOR ANALYSIS OF IOWA\nLANGONE ON DEMOGRAPHY: \u201cLook, you've got to look at Iowa, and that's those old ladies with knitting needles sitting around living rooms \u2014 I don't understand it.\u201d\nLANGONE ON STRATEGY: \u201cForget Iowa. I say to you, the hell with Iowa.\u201d\nCHRISTIE\u2019S POWER PLAYERS: POLITICO\u2019s Daniel Strauss reports: politi.co/1GMykkZ\n5 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT CHRIS CHRISTIE: via NPR http://n.pr/1HvXABI\nTHE DAILY CLINTON \nCHELSEA\u2019S FEE: $65K: The Washington Post reports that the University of Missouri at Kansas City paid Chelsea Clinton $65,000 to speak last year \u2014 after balking when HILLARY CLINTON\u2019s team demanded $275,000 for the former secretary of state. wapo.st/1JnTB7O\nLESSONS FROM TERRY: Time: \u201c[HILLARY] CLINTON\u2019s campaign for president has adopted key strategic lessons from [longtime Clinton backer and Virginia Gov. Terry] McAuliffe\u2019s gubernatorial race, including the finer details of a data-driven field organization focused on turning out the Democratic base and unmarried women, leaning into progressive Democratic positions and hiring many of the same staff members that helped McAuliffe win the governor\u2019s mansion. And Democrats say that McAuliffe\u2019s 2013 victory sets the stage for the state to go blue in the 2016 general election, when HILLARY CLINTON is the likely candidate.\u201d ti.me/1eYcjJe\nNOT A COVER UP: POLITICO\u2019s Josh Gerstein reports: \u201cThe timing of the State Department's plan to release about 3,000 pages of former Secretary of State HILLARY CLINTON's emails at 9 p.m. Tuesday is not an effort to minimize media coverage of the documents but the result of the complexity of preparing the records for public release and the need to meet a court-imposed deadline, a State official said.\u201d http://politi.co/1T2K4aO\nTHE PROGRESSIVE RESISTANCE\n\u2018NATIONAL DISGRACE\u2019: POLITICO\u2019s Jonathan Topaz reports: On the last day of FEC filings for this quarter, BERNIE SANDERS \u2014 an ardent support of campaign finance reform who has refused to have an affiliated super PAC \u2014 slammed presidential candidates for their last-ditch fundraising efforts in a statement today, calling it a \u201cnational disgrace.\u201d http://politi.co/1IqqqCs\nWARREN ON BERNIE: Boston Herald: \u201cElizabeth Warren isn\u2019t ruling out joining ultra-liberal Democratic presidential candidate BERNIE SANDERS on the campaign trail in New Hampshire, saying she\u2019s not surprised at all that the Vermont senator is surging in the polls and drawing enthusiastic Granite State audiences. \u2018Bernie\u2019s out talking about the issues that the American people want to hear about,\u2019 Warren, who hasn\u2019t endorsed anyone in the Democratic primary yet, told the Herald yesterday. Asked if she would campaign with Sanders at some point, she didn\u2019t dismiss the idea. \u2018Too early to say,\u2019 she said. But Warren didn\u2019t seem convinced that Sanders could eventually knock front-runner HILLARY CLINTON out of the Democratic primary.\u201d\u00a0bit.ly/1NsxA9k\nWARREN ATTACKS: Connecticut Post: Elizabeth Warren fired up 1,300 Democrats last night at a Connecticut Democratic Party fundraising dinner \u2014 and took aim at some top Republicans.\nJEB BUSH: \u201cJEB BUSH, if you believe that the next president\u2019s job is [to] privatize\u00a0Social Security, then I believe that it\u2019s our job to make sure you aren\u2019t president.\u201d\nSCOTT WALKER: \u201cWell, SCOTT WALKER, if you believe the next president\u2019s job is to encourage bigotry and to treat some families better than others, then I believe it\u2019s our job to make sure you aren\u2019t president\u201d \u2014 a reference to his call for a constitutional amendment allowing states to ban same-sex marriage. bit.ly/1KnmbYt\n\u2018RESIDUAL DISENCHANTMENT\u2019: The Boston Globe: \u201cProminent members of a Massachusetts Democratic fund-raising network that boosted Barack Obama in 2008 and Deval Patrick two years earlier are hosting high-dollar events for presidential candidate MARTIN O\u2019MALLEY on Tuesday \u2026 the three events in the Boston area reflect a residual disenchantment with [HILLARY CLINTON] among some of the party\u2019s local power brokers.\u201d bit.ly/1ef0bCJ\nEARLY-STATE OP-ED: MARTIN O\u2019MALLEY penned an op-ed in today\u2019s Des Moines Register outlining his clean-energy plan he released earlier this month. \u201cAs president, I would use my executive power on day one to declare the transition to a clean energy future the number one priority of our federal government. And this is exactly what I\u2019m coming to Iowa to talk about over the Fourth of July weekend,\u201d he writes. dmreg.co/1R1HjsH\nJEB\u2019S TAX RETURNS, CONTINUED\nWHERE IT\u2019S FROM: Tampa Bay Times: \u201cThe vast majority of income came from consulting and speaking fees, where [JEB] BUSH earned between $40,000 and $75,000 apiece for dozens of appearances before business and trade groups, colleges, and organizations. \u2026 Bush has earned nearly $10 million in speaking fees since leaving the governor's office, including nearly $2.4 million for 50 speeches in 2013.\u201d bit.ly/1C4YYJn\nSURVEYING THE 2016 LANDSCAPE\nRAND MEETS WITH BUNDY: POLITICO\u2019s Adam Lerner reports: \u201cRAND PAUL met privately with Cliven Bundy on Monday, the Nevada rancher and anti-government activist told POLITICO. The encounter came after Bundy attended an event for the Kentucky senator\u2019s presidential campaign at the Eureka Casino in Mesquite, Nevada. When the larger group dispersed, Bundy said, he was escorted by Paul\u2019s aides to a back room where he and the Republican 2016 contender spoke for approximately 45 minutes. The Nevada rancher said that he had expected only to have an opportunity to shake hands with Paul and make small-talk. He was surprised when campaign aides found a private room and allowed Bundy, his wife and son to speak with the candidate for the better part of an hour.\u201d http://politi.co/1LGkzem\nRAND\u2019S CAMP RESPONDS: From a statement: \u201cThere were no scheduled meetings at Senator Paul's stop in Mesquite.\u00a0 He spoke to many people who came to this public event, none for 45 minutes and none planned.\u201d\nWALKER\u2019S IRAN DIG: SCOTT WALKER pens an op-ed in National Review today to rail against the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear negotiations with Iran and urging negotiators to back away from the table. The deadline for a deal, set for today, got pushed back a week.\u00a0 natl.re/PZuRMR\nCRUZ DEFENDS THE DONALD: In an interview with Fox News this morning, TED CRUZ offered praise for DONALD TRUMP and said he shouldn\u2019t apologize for his recent comments calling many immigrants \u201crapists\u201d and \u201cdrug dealers.\u201d \u201cI like Donald Trump. I think he\u2019s terrific, I think he\u2019s brash, I think he speaks the truth. \u2026 I don\u2019t think you should apologize for speaking out against the problem that is illegal immigration,\u201d Cruz said, later adding that he doesn\u2019t think the majority of immigrants aren\u2019t mostly rapists and drug dealers. bit.ly/1NvgGpO\nPOLITIFACT BAIT: TED CRUZ, today, to CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper: \u201cIn my time in Washington, to the best of my knowledge, I have never spoken ill of any senator, Republican or Democrat.\u201d\nNEXT NEWS CYCLE\nNEW HAMPSHIRE TRIFECTA: The day after his official launch, CHRIS CHRISTIE covers all his bases in New Hampshire tomorrow: a diner stop, a house party and a town hall meeting.\nRAND PAUL will be in Iowa tomorrow for four events, his first day of a two-day swing in the state.\nTED CRUZ starts his book tour tomorrow with two stops in Texas, including one in Houston.\nBERNIE SANDERS will hold a rally in Madison, Wisconsin, tomorrow evening.\nTHE DAILY NUMBER\n2: The years of tax returns Mitt Romney released during his 2012 presidential campaign.
