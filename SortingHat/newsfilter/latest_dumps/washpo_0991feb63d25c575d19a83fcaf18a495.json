(Via NASA)  THE BIG IDEA: A new conservative\u00a0self-help manifesto\u00a0from the head of AEI \u2014\u00a0Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute, is positioning his think tank to play a bigger role in 2016, offering more issue briefings and debate preparation for candidates. His new book out this week, \u201cThe Conservative Heart,\u201d can be read as a communications manual of sorts. It also prods GOP leaders to outline a conservative social justice agenda.\u00a0\u201cForget the scapegoats,\u201d Brooks writes. \u201cWhen the vast majority of Americans agree that conservatives are not compassionate, the time has come for a little introspection. The central problem is not what others say about us. It is what we say about ourselves.\u201d Brooks, who told The Daily 202 that Jeb Bush has already read the\u00a0book, is upset by the extent to which Republicans have run against Barack Obama in recent elections, rather than outlining their own vision. He thinks the GOP must become less \u201coppositional\u201d to become a majority party. \u201cOur politics have to be joyful, optimistic and in the service of people,\u201d he explained in an interview.\u00a0\u201cRight now, the left and right are offering two negative, pessimistic, dividing options.\u201d    Mitch McConnell greets Arthur Brooks after delivering a speech at AEI\u2019s downtown offices. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)  The think tank chief concludes his book with \u201cSeven Habits of Highly Effective Conservatives,\u201d a 38-page self-help manifesto for how lawmakers should talk so that real people will listen. Here is a summary of his key points\u2014  Be a moralist. \u201cInstead of championing low-wage Americans, conservatives sound like tax accountants to billionaires,\u201d Brooks writes. \u201cWhen we cheerlead entrepreneurship, for example, we usually heap praise on rags-to-riches outliers who are now multinational executives.\u201d In explaining their opposition to a higher minimum wage, he urges conservatives to \u201cstop laboring to explain inflation cycles, consumption patterns, and the laws of supply and demand.\u201d Instead, he says, \u201clead with your heart and offer a statement of principle.\u201d Fight for people, not against things. Using a word cloud from Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1980 RNC convention speech in Detroit, Brooks points out that \u201cpeople\u201d appeared more than anything else. He argues that the Great Communicator never got bogged down in wonky specifics.\u00a0 Brooks writes. \u201cEconomics runs quietly in the background, like your computer\u2019s operating system \u2026 Republicans today have become like a bunch of computer geeks talking about \u2018bits,\u2019 \u2018algorithms,\u2019 and \u2018binary values.\u2019 Most people don\u2019t understand that stuff or much care about it.\u201d Get happy. \u201cHow often did you see Ronald Reagan truly angry? \u2026 His jokes were more devastating than any fire-and-brimstone words could have been,\u201d Brooks recalls. \u201cThin skin and a hair trigger make us look like an angry political minority.\u201d Steal all the best arguments. \u201cMake the arguments for empathy and compassion,\u201d he writes. \u201cTrait-trespassing is the right thing to do and it\u2019s the only way to win nationwide.\u201d Say it in 30 seconds. \u201cEach of us has ancient regions in our brain that make us decide if that politician on TV is a friend or foe,\u201d writes Brooks. \u201cIf our brain says he or she\u2019s a friend, we\u2019re going to keep listening.\u201d  WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: \u2014 Missouri executed an\u00a0inmate last night (pictured below), the first person put to death since the Supreme Court weighed in on lethal injection last month.

Making\u00a0an impassioned case for criminal justice reform at the NAACP convention, the president said he has\u00a0ordered Attorney General Loretta Lynch to start a review of the use of solitary confinement in prisons.\u00a0He also argued that the $80 billion the federal government spends each year on prisons \u2014 nearly a third of the Justice Department\u2019s budget \u2014 could instead fund preschool for every 3- and 4-year-old in the country,\u00a0Juliet Eilperin reports from Philadelphia.

Donald Trump\u00a0is first in a fresh Suffolk University/USA Today national poll of Republican primary voters, leading Jeb Bush\u00a0by 3 points, 17 percent to 14 percent. After NBC chose not to air the Miss America pageant because of its severed ties with\u00a0Trump,\u00a0fewer than a million people watched it on the Reelz Channel. Last year, it was 5.6 million. This year, it was 925,000, per Nielsen.  POWER PLAYERS IN THE NEWS:  The pro-Chris Christie super PAC raised $11 million and will go on New Hampshire TV next week.

A super PAC supporting George Pataki plans to go on TV with a commercial that touts the former New York governor as a GOP moderate. \u201cIf we nominate another Bush, or give voice to Trump on Mexicans, Hillary Clinton will win, and it\u2019ll be our fault,\u201d a narrator says.

IRAN DAY TWO HIGHLIGHTS \u2014 A round up of the coverage:\u00a0  While every Republican presidential candidate spoke out against the deal, including Rand Paul, Hillary Clinton embraced it. \u201cIn Tehran, a live broadcast of Obama\u2019s White House remarks was interrupted for an address by President Hassan Rouhani, who said that \u2018all of our objectives\u2019 had been realized in the planned lifting of sanctions and in what he said was the world\u2019s recognition of Iran\u2019s nuclear program for civilian use,\u201d\u00a0Carol Morello and Karen DeYoung report from Vienna. \u201cReaction from U.S. allies ranged from concern among the Sunni monarchies of the Persian Gulf that lifting sanctions would increase Shiite Iran\u2019s efforts to expand its powers, to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s assessment that Iran would not only get a nuclear weapon out of the agreement, but also a \u2018cash bonanza\u2019 to continue support for terrorism once sanctions are gone.\u201d \u201cMost congressional Republicans remained deeply skeptical, some openly scornful, of the prospect of relieving economic sanctions while leaving any Iranian uranium-enrichment capability intact. And Democrats offered only cautious endorsements of the deal that represents a cornerstone of Obama\u2019s foreign policy as Congress begins a two-month review of the agreement,\u201d per Mike DeBonis and Steven Mufson. At least 13 Democratic or independent senators would have to join with Republicans to override an Obama veto (at the end of the 60-day review period). \u201cDem-aligned groups that favor the deal are putting together plans to spend millions of dollars on a campaign shoring up support for the deal among Democrats in Congress, and offering backing to those who find themselves targeted by ads from opponents,\u201d Greg Sargent reports. There\u2019s a divide within Obama\u2019s team over what\u2019s next in the U.S. relationship with Iran.\u00a0\u201cThe optimists, led by Secretary of State John Kerry and Obama himself, believe the nuclear deal can be the first step to a healthier relationship with Iran that begins to stabilize the anarchic region,\u201d Politico\u2019s Michael Crowley writes. \u201cThe skeptics, dominated by senior military, intelligence and counter-terrorism officials, deeply distrust Iran and imagine knives hidden behind the back of Iran\u2019s smiling diplomats.\u201d The fate of several Americans held in Iran, including a Washington Post journalist detained last July, remains separate from the deal, even after U.S. officials repeatedly raised the issue with Tehran. Oil prices fell yesterday: \u201cFor American corporations, the Iran nuclear deal starts with pistachios, caviar, carpets and airplanes \u2014 and could mean more. For American consumers, the deal could mean slightly lower oil prices, but not until next year, as limits on Iranian crude oil exports are lifted. But for Iran, the nuclear deal \u2014 once it is fully implemented several months from now \u2014 will have far-reaching benefits, giving it access to foreign investment, trade with oil-thirsty markets in Europe and Asia, and escrow accounts that are holding more than $100 billion from oil sales out of Tehran\u2019s reach.\u201d  WAPO HIGHLIGHTS: \u2014 \u201cScott Walker: Unbending and excitable,\u201d by Michael Fletcher: \u201cAt 47, Walker\u2019s polite unwillingness to bend, his placid determination to stand his ground at all cost, both animates and complicates his presidential candidacy. Partisans love hearing about how he decimated Wisconsin unions, cut taxes, defunded Planned Parenthood and required photo identification at the voting booth \u2013 all while calmly staring down political opponents. It has helped catapult him to the first rank of Republican presidential hopefuls.The question is whether voters will see his style as evidence of clear vision or the mark of a man unwilling to compromise. And how far can he go without backing down as he enters an arena where the issues are more complex and the politics more treacherous?\u201d \u2014 \u201cGroups backed by secret donors take the lead in shaping 2016 elections,\u201d by Matea Gold: \u201cThese tax-exempt groups \u2014 which can keep their donors secret even as they sponsor hard-hitting ads \u2014 are being increasingly embraced by campaign operatives looking for new ways to influence the political environment. While such \u2018social welfare\u2019 organizations are not supposed to be primarily focused on elections, they face little oversight from a deadlocked Federal Election Commission or the Internal Revenue Service, whose effort to issue new rules governing their political activity has stalled.\u201d \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s not just OPM: Cybersecurity across the federal government is pretty awful,\u201d by Andrea Peterson:\u00a0\u201cAccording to the Government Accountability Office, 19 of 24 major agencies have declared cybersecurity a \u2018significant deficiency\u2019 or a \u2018material weakness.\u2019 Problems range from a need for better oversight of information technology contractors to improving how agencies respond to breaches of personal information \u2026 GAO also noted the \u2018sharp\u2019 increase in information security incidents reported by federal agencies in recent years.\u201d In fiscal year 2006, there were 5,503. In fiscal year 2014, there were 67,168 \u2014 as illustrated by this graph from the GAO report:     BIOMETRICS COMPROMISED:\u00a0National Journal zeroes in on the Chinese stealing\u00a01.1 million sets of fingerprints during the OPM hack. \u201cUnlike a Social Security number, address, or password, fingerprints cannot be changed\u2014once they are hacked, they\u2019re hacked for good,\u201d writes Dustin Volz. \u201cAnd government officials have less understanding about what adversaries could do or want to do with fingerprints, a knowledge gap that undergirds just how frightening many view the mass lifting of them from OPM.\u201d SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: \u2014 ZIGNAL VISUAL \u2014 Word Cloud Wednesday: Our analytics partners at Zignal Labs\u00a0offer a text-based snapshot of a day in the life of buzzed-about\u00a0presidential candidates.\u00a0For Scott Walker, the state budget and labor issues dominated talk surrounding his candidacy.     Most of the talk about Bernie Sanders\u00a0centered on his support for the Iran accord:     As for Donald Trump, he spent the day in that political sweet spot between Nazism and consumerism. He\u00a0tweeted an image that incorporated a photo of Waffen-SS soldiers at the White House, and then he deleted it. The campaign blamed an intern.     \u2013WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT: Tweets of the day: Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), caused a stir when he tweeted the image below. \u201cOMG, @taylorswift13 in the Rotunda?\u201d he wrote.

He\u2019ll be more careful next time he\u2019s at Magruders.\u201d \u2014\u00a0New York Times, \u201c3 Leave Jobs Over Psychologists\u2019 Involvement in Bush-era interrogations,\u201d by James Risen: \u201cThe nation\u2019s largest professional organization for psychologists announced a management shake-up on Tuesday. The action came days after a scathing report concluded that top officials of the group had colluded with government officials during the George W. Bush administration to assure that the organization\u2019s ethics rules did not bar psychologists from involvement in harsh interrogations about terrorist activity\u2026The report concluded that several prominent psychologists had taken actions that helped the C.I.A.\u2019s interrogation program, which is now known to have included torture, including protecting it from dissent by health professionals inside the C.I.A.\u201d \u2014 New York Times, \u201cI.M.F. Demands Greek Debt Relief as a Condition for Bailout,\u201d by Jack Ewing: \u201cThe I.M.F., in a report released publicly on Tuesday, proposed that eurozone creditors should consider letting Athens write off part of its huge debt or at least make no payments on its eurozone debt for 30 years\u2026Germany and other countries, including the Netherlands and Finland, are loath to grant Greece easier terms, which are a tough sell to their own voters. But Germany in particular is anxious for the I.M.F. to continue monitoring Greece.\u201d \u2014 Wall Street Journal, \u201cChristian Employers Dealt Setback on Birth Control Issues,\u201d by Louise Radnofsy: \u201cChristian employers challenging the Obama administration\u2019s revised system for providing contraception as part of the 2010 health law lost a round in the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday. The ruling added another victory for the federal government in a series of lawsuits working their way through the courts \u2026\u00a0The opinion covered cases including one brought by the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic religious order that operates nursing homes. The Obama administration\u2019s rules that most health plans cover contraception have spurred dozens of legal challenges from Christian groups with moral objections to birth control\u2026Under alternative arrangements finalized by the Obama administration last week, employers who have such objections must tell their insurance company or the federal government. The insurance company then takes over responsibility for providing the coverage to employees who want it.\u201d \u2014 Raw Story, \u201cStats wiz Nate Silver: For black Americans, U.S. is as about as dangerous as Rwanda,\u201d by Katie Halper: \u201cAs he explained to me\u2026 \u2018If you\u2019re a white person your chance of being murdered every year is 2.5 out of 10,000\u2026 If you\u2019re a black person it\u2019s 19.4, so almost eight times higher\u2019\u2026 Silver: the murder rate for white Americans is similar to the murder rate for people living in Finland, Chile or Israel. The murder rate for black Americans, on the other hand, is similar to the rate found \u2018in developing countries that are war zones even, like Myanmar, or Rwanda, Mexico, Brazil, Nigeria, places that have vast disorder.'\u201d \u2014 CNN, \u201cBrad Steinle: Trump \u2018sensationalizing\u2019 sister\u2019s death,\u201d by Theodore Schleifer:\u00a0\u201cThe brother of a San Francisco woman killed by an undocumented immigrant said Tuesday that Donald Trump was inappropriately using her without as much as calling the family to express condolences. \u2018Donald Trump talks about Kate Steinle like he knows her,\u2019 Brad Steinle told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Tuesday. \u2018I\u2019ve never heard a word from his campaign manager, I\u2019ve never heard a word from him. It\u2019s disconcerting. I don\u2019t want to be affiliated with someone who doesn\u2019t have the common courtesy to reach out and ask about Kate, and our political views and what we want.'\u201d BUZZING AT THE CAPITOL: \u2014 Politico, \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s Capitol Hill mission accomplished,\u201d by Lauren French and Burgess Everett: \u201cProgressives have criticized Hillary Clinton for being too close to Wall Street. They\u2019ve questioned her rhetoric on poverty and education. In early voting states they\u2019ve come out in droves for her chief competitor, Sen. Bernie Sanders. But on Tuesday, even some of the most ardent populists in Congress had nothing but praise for the 2016 Democratic front-runner during her day trip to Capitol Hill, after peppering her with questions on income inequality, early childhood education and criminal justice reform.\u201d \u2014 National Journal, \u201cCapitol Hill Dems wish Clinton was president already,\u201d by Lauren Fox and Rachel Roubein: \u201cMembers leaped at the chance to have the ear of a former colleague and potential future president \u2026 \u2018There are warm, warm feelings in that room for her,\u2019 [Sen. Tim] Kaine said. \u2018She knows she is going to be running in 2016 when there are a whole bunch of competitive Senate races, and she said, \u2018I want to campaign with ya. I want to be standing on a stage with ya, and if you do that, you\u2019ll help me, and if I do that, I\u2019ll help you.\u2019 \u2026 There was a very nice teamwork message that was part of the speech today.\u2019\u201d \u2014 National Journal, \u201cHouse GOP pulls another bill from floor over abortion,\u201d by Daniel Newhauser: \u201cHouse Republican leaders pulled a commemorative coin bill supporting breast cancer from the floor Tuesday amid conservative outrage that an organization the measure would support is allied with Planned Parenthood. The bipartisan bill would have funneled some proceeds from the minting of commemorative coins to Susan G. Komen for the Cure and the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. But conservatives objected, noting that the Komen organization donates money to Planned Parenthood.\u201d HOT ON THE LEFT Scott Walker: Boy Scouts ban on gay leaders \u2018protected children.\u2019 From the Washington Post: \u201cWalker (R) said Tuesday that the Boy Scouts of America should keep its blanket ban on openly gay leaders because the policy \u2018protected children and advanced Scout values\u2019 \u2026 Walker, who launched his presidential campaign on Monday, is an Eagle Scout who has long been active with the organization. His two sons, now in their 20s, were involved in scouting and his wife served as a den mother.\u201d HOT ON THE RIGHT NAACP chapter calls for removal of massive Confederate sculpture in public park. From Fox News: \u201cA sculpture in Georgia larger than a football field \u2013 depicting Civil War luminaries Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and Thomas \u2018Stonewall\u2019 Jackson \u2013 has become the latest target in the push to purge the South of signs of the Confederacy. The Atlanta chapter of the NAACP called Monday for the elimination of all symbols of the Confederacy from Stone Mountain Park, whose marquee attraction is the 90-foot-high, 190-foot-wide sculpture carved deep into the mountain.\u201d DAYBOOK: \u2013What\u2019s happening today on the campaign trail: Scott Walker will campaign in North Charleston, Lexington and Mauldin, South Carolina.
