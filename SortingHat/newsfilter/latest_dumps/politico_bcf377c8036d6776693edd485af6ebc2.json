{"body": "AP Photo\nBy Seung Min Kim\n7/21/15 10:25 AM EDT\nUpdated 7/21/15 12:03 PM EDT\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley is rolling out legislation targeting so-called sanctuary cities that would block funding for cities and other local governments that decline to cooperate with federal immigration officials.\nThe announcement came during an emotional Tuesday Senate hearing where Jim Steinle \u2014 the father of Kathryn Steinle, whom authorities say was shot and killed earlier this month by an immigrant here illegally \u2014 urged senators to pass legislation that would prevent deaths like that of his daughter on a San Francisco pier.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cOur family realizes the complexities of immigration laws,\u201d Jim Steinle told senators on Tuesday. \u201cHowever, we feel strongly that some legislation should be discussed, enacted or changed to take these undocumented immigrant felons off our streets for good.\u201d\nThe Iowa Republican\u2019s legislation would force local government officials to cooperate with federal immigration authorities or else lose grants from the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department. The legislation, Grassley said, would hold sanctuary cities \u201caccountable.\u201d\nThe bill also calls for a mandatory minimum sentence of five years in prison for immigrants who try to enter the United States after being deported. The suspect in Steinle\u2019s death \u2014 Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez \u2014 had been deported to his native Mexico multiple times but had re-entered the country.\n\u201cEnforcing the immigration laws of the United States is not a voluntary or trivial matter,\u201d Grassley said as he opened the hearing. \u201cReal lives are at stake. Things cannot continue this way.\u201d\nMore on POLITICO\nSteinle\u2019s death has thrown the issue of illegal immigration into the 2016 presidential campaign spotlight, as well as back under the congressional microscope. Donald Trump has seized on Steinle\u2019s death during his presidential bid to make his case for tougher border security and immigration enforcement \u2014 comments that won praise from at least one person who testified before the Senate on Tuesday.\nLaura Wilkerson, whose son Josh was killed in 2010 by an immigrant here illegally from Belize, thanked Trump during the hearing for bringing attention to the issue and added: \u201cIt feels good to be heard.\u201d\nThough immigration advocates are already raising alarm about legislation meant to crack down on sanctuary cities, one influential Democrat \u2014 Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California \u2014 is working on a measure that would force local law enforcement officials to work with the feds.\nDuring the hearing, Feinstein described the legislation: It would require state and local law enforcement to tell federal immigration officials \u2014 should they ask to be notified \u2014 when they are about to release from custody immigrants here illegally who have been convicted of a felony.\nFeinstein said it is \u201cvery clear\u201d to her that cooperation has to improve between federal immigration officials and local government, adding that she believes a \u201csimple notification to Immigration and Customs Enforcement could have prevented Kate Steinle\u2019s death.\u201d\nSteinle will testify again later this week at a House hearing examining the issue. Top Obama administration officials \u2014 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services director Leon Rodriguez and Sarah Saldana, the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 are testifying before the Senate later Tuesday.\nBy AARON MAK\nBy JOSH ZEITZ\nBy LARRY J.
