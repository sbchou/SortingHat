But the media only wants to talk about one thing: Donald Trump.\nBy Hadas Gold\n7/21/15 8:18 PM EDT\nUpdated 7/21/15 8:53 PM EDT\nAP Photo\nGov. John Kasich formally announced his White House bid at the Ohio State University on Monday afternoon, pitching himself as a serious conservative with a resume that outclasses anyone else in the Republican field. But just as he wrapped up, his fellow GOP candidate Donald Trump was giving out Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s personal cell phone number at a rally in South Carolina.\nKasich got Trumped.\nStory Continued Below\nLast week in Camden, New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie rolled out his vision for the future of criminal justice reform, a thoughtful synthesis of liberal and conservative ideas about community policing.\nHe got Trumped.\nOn Monday, Rand Paul even brought out a chainsaw, wood chipper and fire to destroy the U.S. tax code. He also announced a plan to defund Planned Parenthood.\nTrumped and Trumped.\nAlso on POLITICO\nELI STOKOLS\nJeb Bush\u2019s economic policy speech? Trumped. Scott Walker\u2019s $26 million money haul? Trumped. Carly Fiorina\u2019s attack on Hillary Clinton? Marco Rubio\u2019s thoughts on Iran? Bobby Jindal in general? Trumped, Trumped, Trumped.\nJust 35 days since the brash real estate mogul launched his presidential campaign with all the subtlety of a rhinoceros, Republican candidates have been gasping for air, choked off from media access and desperate to break out beyond an egomaniacal celebrity who is polling better than most of the field. The early jostling has a special urgency this year: The first GOP debate on Aug. 6 is just two weeks away, and only 10 candidates will make the cut.\nThe contenders have taken different tactical approaches. Some, like former Texas governor Rick Perry and Sen. Lindsey Graham, have attacked Trump with abandon, calling him a \u201cjackass\u201d (Graham) and telling him to drop out of the race (Perry) in response to Trump saying Sen. John McCain is \u201cnot a war hero\u201d because he was captured. Top-tier candidates like Jeb Bush have taken a subtler approach, calling Trump\u2019s language divisive while avoiding getting down and dirty with a world-class mud-wrestler.\nBut every time any of them manages to get a little attention, Trump ups the ante.\nChristie\u2019s proposal for criminal justice reform drew on the many programs he brought to the streets of New Jersey and called for a compassionate approach to criminals who have been locked away for minor crimes. After delivering a detailed speech and touring a halfway house, he was ready for some tough questions about his take on a policy issue that has become the subject of intense national debate. Except that\u2019s not what the press wanted to talk to him about.\n\u201cAfter the drug rehab round table, the only questions from the gaggle were about Donald Trump,\u201d said Samantha Smith, a Christie campaign spokesperson.\nBush, who is second in the polls after Trump but is blowing away his rivals in the money race, laid out his vision of limited government on Monday, pledging to fight Washington\u2019s bloat and extend the ban on former members of Congress going into lobbying.\n\u201cIt got a little news. Not as much as Donald Trump,\u201d Bush said on Tuesday at a campaign event in South Carolina. His first question after the panel? Trump.\nBush\u2019s expression visibly soured.\n\u201cI respect the sentiments that people feel when they hear Trump talk,\u201d Bush said. \u201cThe problem with Mr. Trump\u2019s language is it\u2019s divisive, it\u2019s ugly, it\u2019s mean-spirited.\u201d\nAlso on POLITICO\nNICK GASS and ADAM B. LERNER\nWalker, who is fighting for the top tier along with Bush and, well, Trump, has had a number of big policy moments in the last week, from signing a 20-week abortion ban in Wisconsin to saying he\u2019d tear up the Iran nuclear deal on \u201cday one\u201d as president to signing an executive order allowing National Guard members to carry guns while on duty.\nDespite a sit-down interview with NBC Nightly News\u2019 Kelly O\u2019Donnell, the clip shown on Sunday\u2019s NBC Nightly News? Walker responding to Trump.\nIn the interview, Walker said he tried to stay away from talking about his Republican rivals. Then he talked about Trump.\n\u201cI say on policy any of them can speak for themselves but when it becomes personal like this, not just against John McCain, but really to me, that\u2019s a swipe at any of our American heroes, particularly those who were taken as prisoners of war. At a minimum, he needs to apologize.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Walker declined to comment.\nOn Tuesday morning, just before Trump broadcast his cellphone number to the world, Graham called President Barack Obama \u201cthe Neville Chamberlain of our time\u201d \u2014 ordinarily the kind of torqued-up rhetoric that would win him headlines. Instead, the news was soon all about his feud with Trump. But a CNN chyron later in the day didn\u2019t even mention his name, reading simply, \u201cTrump reveals rival\u2019s cell number on live TV.\u201d\nJindal had one of the most positive receptions at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa over the weekend, with multiple standing ovations, and is experiencing a slight rise in recent polls. But no one noticed.\n\u201dWhile Donald Trump distracts other candidates nationally, we are making headway on the ground in Iowa,\u201d Jindal spokesperson Shannon Dirmann said in an email.\nOn CNN on Tuesday, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee complained that \u201call the interviews these days are about Donald Trump.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s 16 candidates and all of the attention is focused on one of the candidates,\u201d he said.\nHuckabee\u2019s campaign manager (and daughter) Sarah Huckabee said that while the focus has been on Trump, Huckabee has been \u201cgoing where other Republicans fear to tread\u201d by working to expand the GOP\u2019s appeal to African-Americans and union members. On Sunday, he addressed one of the largest African-American churches in South Carolina and released two videos focused on the \u201cneed for racial reconciliation in America.\u201d\n\u201cEverybody has their moment, and this is Donald Trump\u2019s time,\u201d Sarah Huckabee said. \u201cWe\u2019d like our surge to happen sometime at the end of January.\u201d\nBen Carson, speaking to reporters Tuesday morning in Arlington, Va., expressed exasperation after fielding several minutes of questions about Trump.\n\u201cThere are super big problems going on in this country right now which threaten to destroy us. And for us to get caught up in a controversy of, \u2018Well, what about Trump when he said that?\u2019 it just seems so petty to me. It just does,\u201d he said.\nThe one group benefiting from the Trump-for-all? Democrats.\nAlso on POLITICO\nHADAS GOLD\nBernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley had rather embarrassing moments at the liberal confab Netroots Nation on Saturday as Black Lives Matters protestors took over both of their appearances. But the attention didn\u2019t last long. On the same day, Trump made his \u201cMcCain is not a war hero\u201d comment, and that\u2019s pretty much all anyone\u2019s talked about since.\nStuart Stevens, a top strategist for Mitt Romney in 2012, said that the candidates should just be patient and wait Trump out.\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s obvious Donald Trump is dominating the political news, it\u2019s doubtful anything that\u2019s happened in July, six and a half months before Iowa, has ever had much consequence in a presidential race,\u201d Stevens said in an email. \u201cPatience is one of the great undervalued virtues in politics. June was obsessed with a jail break; July is Trump. Given the calendar this cycle, the race will start for real after New Year\u2019s bowl games. And if Bernie Sanders continues to close on Hillary Clinton, the Republican primary won\u2019t even be the lead story.\u201d\nKatie Glueck, Daniel Strauss, Eliza Collins and Eli Stokols contributed to this report.\nBy AARON MAK\nBy JOSH ZEITZ\nBy LARRY J.
