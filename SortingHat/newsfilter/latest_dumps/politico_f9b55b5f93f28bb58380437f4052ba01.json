(http://www.politicopro.com/proinfo)\nTAR HEEL STATE PARTY TROUBLES -- The North Carolina Republican Party has a lot on the line in 2016 - a battleground state in a presidential yea, one of the tightest governor's races in the country, and an incumbent senator to protect. But GOP leaders and the state party Chairman Hasan Harnett are struggling with trust issues, or as one Republican familiar with these discussions put it: \"[Harnett] will tell you one thing, and then two days later, he'll do a complete 180 on it.\" This summer, the party lost its executive director, and within weeks, lost its interim executive director, too. Without one, there is more chatter that the Republican National Committee might run its money through a county party, instead of the state, like former Sen. Kay Hagan did in 2014 when the state's Democratic Party was in turmoil. \n\"I'm almost sure that's going to happen,\" another local GOP strategist said. \"Now, they're trying to work around [Harnett], and isolate him.\" But Paul Shumaker, Senator Richard Burr's (R-N.C.) campaign consultant, said there is \"no decision\" yet to change the funding structure. \"Without knowing who the executive director is, everybody's going to leave a lot of options on the table,\" he said. However, Niger Innis, a Republican activist, said that while the Harnett has been willing to work with the \"old guard\" in the state, the establishment hasn't reciprocated. \"Is the Republican Party ready for the repercussions of attempting to force failure upon the first black chairman of North Carolina?\" Innis said. \nNorth Carolina isn't alone in its troubles. Colorado's state GOP may have papered over its in-fighting for now, but they struggled with accusations of extortion involving the state attorney general. In Nevada, the Las Vegas Journal-Review editorial board earlier this month called on the GOP chairman, Michael McDonald, to resign, following allegations fraud, calling him, \"disgraceful.\" http://bit.ly/1Y1Ty9M \nFIRST IN SCORE -- AIR WAR, ON JUDGES -- The Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative group, reserved $200,000 worth of airtime and digital ad space in Iowa, New Hampshire and Washington, D.C., challenging Republican candidates ahead of Wednesday's debate to declare their positions on Supreme Court appointments. \"We can't afford more surprises,\" the ad says, over images of Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Anthony Kennedy, and retired Justice David Souter, all appointed by Republican presidents, who've all taken positions that didn't please some conservatives.

Ted Cruz and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker for their comments on immigration, juxtaposing them with another Republican - Ronald Reagan. The National Immigration Forum Forum Action Fund reserved six-figures worth of airtime on CNN, MSNBC and Fox News during pre- and post-debate coverage. The Washington Post first reported the ad buy. http://wapo.st/1OP1i8Z \nTAKING IT ALL -- \"The Key to Winning Down Ballot Races,\" by Larry J. Sabato, Kyle Kondik and Geoffrey Skelley in POLITICO's Magazine: \"Down-ballot races are increasingly decided by who wins the White House. To grasp this fact, it's best to focus on two numbers: 6 percent and .781 ... 1. To win the Senate, win the White House ... 2. The year's most important Senate primary (Florida) ... 3. Will any incumbents face primary trouble? (Not really.) ... 4. More retirements are coming.\" http://politi.co/1VWW4fq \nYOUTH VOTE -- Sen. Rob Portman's campaign said it's mobilizing young voters with its Students for Portman coalition, and it's going after them on Instagram, too. Portman's staff said in a press release that it's the first Senate campaign to use the picture filter platform, micro-targeting Ohio State University students this weekend during the first football home game. \n** A message from Pandora: Pandora reaches over 70 million monthly voting-age listeners who listen on average over 2 hours per day.

Rubio has held kitchen table meetings and private meet-and-greets with prominent LDS Church leaders, lining up support from some of the top Mormon names in Nevada politics, including Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison. Hutchison recently barnstormed northern Nevada with Rubio, personally introducing the Florida senator at stops along the way.\" http://politi.co/1NyWSFU\nNOT-SO-SUBTLE SIGNS -- \"Trump vs. Walker: A tale of two tailgates,\" by POLITICO's Katie Glueck in Ames, Iowa: \"The stage, the heat and the drunk college kids they faced were the same. But the receptions Scott Walker and Donald Trump received when they stumped at the same Iowa event Saturday couldn't have been more different - or revealing. The tailgate party scene at the annual Iowa State-University of Iowa football game was tailor-made for the Wisconsin governor, a football fan who's at his retail politicking-best when playing the Midwestern everyman role. ...But Walker was nearly inaudible in his remarks, the fault of too-weak speakers in the tailgate tent. It didn't matter much anyway: it quickly became apparent that many of the hundreds of attendees who had packed into and around the tent, sponsored by the Iowa GOP, couldn't see the main stage, and thought - and hoped - they were watching Trump instead.\" http://politi.co/1Nr5uwH \nCODA - QUOTE OF THE DAY: \"They made it very boring and plain.\" -- Rep.-elect Darin LaHood (R-Ill.), on moving this week into former Rep.
