{"body": "As its favored candidate strains to improve languishing poll numbers, the \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Jeb Bush is keeping busy.\n\nThe group appears to be targeting two of Mr. Bush\u2019s rivals who have gained a measure of traction with establishment Republicans: Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.\n\nThe super PAC, Right to Rise, dispatched representatives to Ohio to scour documents related to Mr. Kasich at a public library in Westerville. \u201cJeb\u2019s oppo team\u2019s in OH now rifling thru my archives,\u201d Mr. Kasich posted on Twitter on Thursday night. \n\n\u2014 John Kasich (@JohnKasich) October 2, 2015\n\n\n\nAnd in Iowa on Thursday, the group sent a tracker to gather footage at an event for Mr. Rubio. The tracker was asked to leave, according to Politico, which reported the move. \n\nA spokesman for Right to Rise, Paul Lindsay, said the group was \u201ccollecting routine, issue-based research on all the candidates in the race.\u201d\n\n\u201cIowa and central Ohio are also wonderful places to visit this time of year,\u201d he added, calling the breakfast at a Fairfield Inn in Westerville \u201cfantastic.\u201d\n\nMr. Bush himself has begun tweaking Mr. Rubio with greater frequency in recent days, taking particular aim at his relative lack of experience. The needling comes as Mr. Rubio\u2019s standing in polls has risen recently.\n\n\u201cMarco was a member of the House of Representatives when I was governor, and he followed my lead,\u201d Mr. Bush told MSNBC on Thursday.\n\nHe was asked if Mr. Rubio had the leadership skills to be president. \u201cIt\u2019s not known,\u201d he said. \u201cBarack Obama didn\u2019t end up having them and he won an election on the belief that he could.\u201d\n\nMr. Bush has also drawn attention to his plan to dock the pay of lawmakers who miss votes \u2014 which has been interpreted as a jab at Mr. Rubio, who has done so frequently.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after a town hall-style event in Bedford, N.H., on Wednesday night, Mr. Bush was asked if Mr. Rubio\u2019s voting record was a problem.\n\n\u201cI think if you had a dock-in-pay strategy, you\u2019d probably get more attendance,\u201d he said generally, before an aide rushed him off.", "byline": "MATT FLEGENHEIMER", "description": "Right to Rise, the \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Jeb Bush, appears to be targeting two of his rivals who have gained a measure of traction with establishment Republicans: John R.
