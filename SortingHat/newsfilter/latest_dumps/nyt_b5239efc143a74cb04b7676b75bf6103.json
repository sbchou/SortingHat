{"body": "She had a law career, an ambitious agenda as first lady, an industrious stint in the Senate, those years and miles as secretary of state.\n\nAnd it has come to this: In a bid to seem less stuffy and turn the page on a beleaguered (yet again) presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton is chatting with Lena Dunham about the singer Lenny Kravitz\u2019s penis.\n\nYou can watch the video yourself. It\u2019s a jokey promotion for an interview of Clinton just published in a new newsletter that Dunham is putting out. You can also see a comedic sketch of Dunham\u2019s arrival at Clinton\u2019s campaign headquarters in Brooklyn and the make-believe refusal of a Clinton gatekeeper to let her in. There\u2019s even a cameo by Amy Schumer.\n\nThe interview itself covers Clinton\u2019s biography and some serious terrain, including feminism and the relationship between African-Americans and the police.\n\nBut it\u2019s in large part a Dunham-Clinton love-in, a pajama party minus the pajamas, ostensibly in keeping with the Clinton campaign\u2019s recent pledge to roll out a warmer, funnier version of the candidate. I\u2019ve lost count of which version we\u2019re on.\n\nIn the promotional video, Clinton kids that because Dunham\u2019s newsletter and the website associated with it are called Lenny, she half expected that the person coming to question her might be Kravitz.\n\nDunham then mentions some viral footage of a Kravitz wardrobe malfunction: \u201cHis stuff fell out of his pants.\u201d\n\nClinton feigns fascination. \u201cI\u2019ll look for that,\u201d she says.\n\nI blame us in part. For years we\u2019ve demanded that she show us something more raw, that she weep or bleed or chirp or quip, that a policy wonk isn\u2019t enough, that a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is only the start.\n\nWe\u2019ve reminded her of how nimbly her husband pivoted from noonday speech to late-night saxophone. We\u2019ve insisted that our presidents and would-be presidents not only inspire but also divert us. And we\u2019ve pumped up the scandals, ratcheting up the pressure on her to feed us distractions.\n\nBut still I\u2019m baffled. How can her response to charges that she\u2019s too packaged and calculating be this packaged and calculated? And to counter her image as entrenched political royalty, why would she enlist stars whose presence merely emphasizes her pull with, and membership in, the glittery world of celebrity?\n\n\u201cInsane,\u201d said one Democratic operative when I sought his reaction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a transparent and ham-handed attempt to appeal to a niche audience that the campaign has identified as a critical target,\u201d he added, referring to progressive young women. \u201cBut if they\u2019re not already getting Lena Dunham and her cohorts, they\u2019re in even bigger trouble than I thought.\u201d\n\nI think that Clinton is actually in less trouble than we sometimes speculate. She remains the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic nomination.\n\nBut her campaign so far is an unimpressive dress rehearsal for the general election. It\u2019s devoid of soul and sweep, a series of labored gestures and precisely staked positions. Constituency by constituency, leftward adjustment by leftward adjustment, she and her aides slog and muscle their way forward.\n\nAnd they contradict the adage that a politician campaigns in poetry and governs in prose. Clinton campaigns in something more like a PowerPoint presentation. Prose would be an upgrade. Poetry is light years away.\n\nThat\u2019s what the Democratic strategist David Axelrod was getting at when, about two weeks ago, he tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s still HRC\u2019s to lose, despite new polls. But it\u2019s hard to inspire w/grinding, tactical race. \u2018Hillary: Live With It\u2019 is no rallying cry!\u201d\n\nNo it isn\u2019t, not even if Dunham and Schumer put funny faces on it.\n\nIt\u2019s to Dunham\u2019s shrewd credit that she grabbed a piece of the action. It serves her well.\n\nBut for Clinton? It\u2019s a contrivance.\n\nEarlier this month, The Times\u2019s Amy Chozick interviewed her aides and reported that there would be \u201cnew efforts to bring spontaneity to a candidacy that sometimes seems wooden and overly cautious.\u201d\n\nAn effort at spontaneity: that\u2019s the prompt for sitting down with Dunham \u2014 who assures Clinton that she\u2019s a fashion icon and implores her to wear dresses that show her shoulders \u2014 and it\u2019s the oxymoronic story of Clinton\u2019s political life.\n\nShe is routinely reintroducing herself, forever trumpeting the real Hillary this time, constantly promising the unguarded Hillary at long last.\n\nBut the real Hillary has always been there, the thread running through all the changes in costumes and hairstyles and campaign events.\n\nShe is fiercely intelligent but, yes, wildly defensive. She does her homework with uncommon diligence and earnestness but can be a dud on the stump. She\u2019s impressively controlled. She\u2019s distressingly controlling.\n\nThere\u2019s more than enough good in that mix for voters to make peace with it.
