{"body": " NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 Donald Trump said during a campaign speech on Wednesday that Hillary Rodham Clinton is \u201cshrill,\u201d raising his voice several octaves to get the point across.  \u201cHillary, who is very shrill -- do you know the word \u2018shrill\u2019?\u201d Trump said to a crowd of a few hundred at a convention center here on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cShe can be kind of sha-riiiiill.\u201d  Trump is often criticized for the way he describes women, and Clinton wasn\u2019t the only woman he went after here on Wednesday. He said Caroline Kennedy is too nice to be the ambassador to Japan. He described, at length, a \u201cvicious, vicious woman\u201d in her 80s who once sued him during a dispute over an apartment. And he yet again called the career of former technology executive Carly Fiorina, another Republican running for president, \u201ca disaster.\u201d  \u201cThey say: \u2018You can\u2019t say that because it\u2019s sexist,\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cI say: \u2018What\u2019s sexist about it?\u2019 I respect women more than I respect men...I have great respect, admiration, and I cherish women... I love women!\u201d Several people in the audience said those sorts of brash, politically incorrect comments are the No. 1 reason they love Trump \u2014 and why they would vote for him in the presidential primary here next February.     Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at the Charleston Convention Center Wednesday in North Charleston, S.C. (Charles Ommanney/The Washington Post)  \u201cHe speaks his mind. He tells the truth,\u201d said Stephanie Grant, a mother of three wearing a \u201cReTRUMPlican\u201d t-shirt who drove about two and a half hours from Hartsville to see Trump. \u201cAs much as I hate to admit it, I\u2019m 42 and I\u2019ve never voted before. But I\u2019m voting for him. I never felt like anyone was telling the truth before now.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments came during a meandering 40-minute speech that featured many of his regular talking points \u2014 like China stealing jobs from the U.S. and the media treating him unfairly \u2014 along with tangents on sweating, golf, his plane, Michael Jordan, the low quality of foreign-made furniture and his various business ventures. He spent very little time discussing what some expected would be the centerpiece of his speech: expanding opportunities for minority business owners. Trump\u2019s team billed the event as an address to the South Carolina African American Chamber of Commerce, but his appearance actually came during the Greater Charleston Business Alliance\u2019s annual meeting. The audience looked like those at most of Trump\u2019s events: mostly white and skewing older, although a few African American business owners attended. (The crowd was much smaller than those at most Trump events, with rows and rows of empty chairs that, towards the end of the speech, small children raced up and down.) Trump said he likes \u201cAfrican American negotiators,\u201d and he said it should be easier for black entrepreneurs, along with all entrepreneurs, to secure business loans. He also claimed that a recent, unidentified poll found that 25 percent of African Americans surveyed would vote for him in the general election.  \u201cI have a lot of friends, African Americans in New York, who said: \u2018You\u2019re going to get most of them,\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cI was actually disappointed with the 25 percent.\u201d John Gethers of Columbia, who secures financing for minority-owned businesses, said he attended the speech to hear Trump\u2019s ideas on bonding issues, access to capital and contracting opportunities.  \u201cI was kind of confused \u2014 I don\u2019t know what I just sat through,\u201d said Gethers, 31, who is black. \u201cI don\u2019t know if any presidential candidate is going to be specific, but I just thought I was going to hear a little bit more.\u201d   Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump greets audience members Wednesday in North Charleston, S.C. (Charles Ommanney/The Washington Post)  Trump instead devoted large chunks of his speech criticizing various media outlets for not treating him fairly.  Earlier in the day, Trump had tweeted that \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d he would no longer do interviews with Fox News. Trump has become increasingly critical of Fox and its major personalities in recent days. The announcement came about 15 minutes afterr The O\u2019Reilly Factor show canceled an interview with Trump scheduled for Thursday, according to a Fox spokesperson.  Becky Causey, a 71-year-old retiree who attended the speech, said she closely reads Trump\u2019s tweets and watches television at least 15 hours per day to catch everything Trump-related. But she noted that the channels she surfs is becoming more limited. \u201cI don\u2019t like CNN because they don\u2019t like Trump,\u201d said Causey, a retired nurse who lives in Murrells Inlet. \u201cNow it looks like Fox News is against him. And I\u2019m putting Bill O\u2019Reilly on hold.\u201d During the speech, Trump also went after the weaknesses of some of his fellow Republican rivals. He marveled at how much New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie sweated during the second GOP debate last week, and wondered aloud why Fiorina is \u201cfighting like hell to raise money\u201d instead of self-financing her campaign like him. But his strongest critique was for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who is also a candidate. Trump questioned why Rubio personally has \u201cno money, zero\u201d and why he is running against his mentor, former Florida governor Jeb Bush.  \u201cHe\u2019s overly ambitious, too young, and I have better hair than he does, right?\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m so tired of this politically correct brat.\u201d  ", "byline": "", "description": "The GOP front-runner\u2019s comments are the latest in a line of questionable remarks about women.", "title": "Donald Trump calls Hillary Clinton \u2018shrill\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-calls-hillary-clinton-shrill/2015/09/23/63c6d5be-6216-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html", "topics": ["women", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Michael Jordan", "Jeb Bush", "John Gethers", "Chris Christie", "Carly Fiorina", "Bill O'Reilly", "Hillary Clinton", "Caroline Kennedy", "Donald Trump", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Marco Rubio", "Charles Ommanney"], "orgs": ["S.C.", "Hartsville", "GOP", "Greater Charleston Business Alliance", "South Carolina African American Chamber of Commerce"], "authors": [{"author_id": 31249, "fullname": "jenna johnson", "primary_org": "washpo"}], "date_written": "2015-09-23 22:45:14", "org": "washpo", "article_id": "2e04eec3faba424ecce4f97de5c220f4", "date_access": "2015-09-23 22:00:05.489083"}
