{"body": "  MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich. \u2014 \u201cCarly for president! Please make a path!\u201d a woman announced loudly to a crowded bar here.  She wasn\u2019t at a Carly Fiorina event. It was an event to honor retiring Rep. Candice S. Miller. Fiorina was just stopping by. In theory.  But these days, it\u2019s hard for Fiorina to just stop by anywhere. Fresh off a widely praised performance in the second Republican presidential debate, Fiorina received a rock-star welcome to this upscale island teeming with Republican activists attending a weekend conference. On the campaign trail, Fiorina has captured the attention that candidates crave but that can come back to bite them.  After arriving here by ferry Saturday afternoon, she was greeted by throngs of supporters carrying red \u201cCarly\u201d signs. She shook hands, posed for pictures and pitched herself for the presidency as she made her way down Main Street, weaving in and out of at least two packed bars.  When Fiorina arrived at Horn\u2019s for the Miller event, a local TV reporter immediately started interviewing her. Standing near Fiorina, all Miller could do was watch as she was upstaged. The crowd was so large, some wondered whether it was violating the fire code.  Earlier, Fiorina addressed supporters at Mary\u2019s Bistro, where the University of Michigan football game playing on TVs was an afterthought for the capacity crowd.  \u201cLet me ask you a question: How many of you saw the debate on Wednesday night?\u201d she asked. \u201cIf you saw that debate, you know that I think this election is about leadership.\u201d Fiorina came to Mackinac Island \u2014 which is only accessible by ferry or charter flight and has no cars but plenty of horse-drawn carriages \u2014 to speak at the annual Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference on Saturday night. She was one of five Republican White House hopefuls \u2014 joining Sens. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Rand Paul (Ky.), Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former Florida governor Jeb Bush \u2014 who came to the confab, held at a luxurious hotel with sweeping lake views. For the more than 2,200 Republican who registered, the event was a chance to see some of the candidates up close. For Fiorina, that meant a fresh dose of encouragement, but also some skepticism.  \u201cI am concerned about one issue she doesn\u2019t really touch on: immigration,\u201d said Josie Mantela of Escanaba, Mich., who is weighing voting for Fiorina or Cruz. At Wednesday\u2019s debate, Fiorina, the only woman onstage,  demonstrated a keen understanding of foreign affairs, took on front-runner Donald Trump and gave original responses to questions, winning her plaudits from Republicans.  But the debate also brought national attention to her controversial tenure as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard. Trump criticized her stewardship of HP, which fired her in 2005 and suffered 30,000 layoffs under her watch. Fiorina has tried to emphasize the positive elements of her record, like growing the company.  \u201cThe scrutiny is going to continue,\u201d said Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R), a former chief executive of Gateway. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s just the nature of running for president.\u201d  He added: \u201cThere are some issues that go away, but issues like that are not things that just sort of are episodal.\u201d Fiorina\u2019s opponents here this weekend were not eager to talk about her record at HP.  \u201cI haven\u2019t studied any of that. I\u2019m more interested in what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Kasich said.  Cruz also declined to weigh in, saying: \u201cOthers may engage in the back and forth. I have no intention of going there.\u201d Trump did not attend the event, but his presence could be felt. In his Friday night speech, Bush said President Obama is \u201can American\u201d and a \u201cChristian,\u201d responding to Trump\u2019s decision not to correct a questioner at a recent town hall. Cruz praised Trump for drawing attention to the issue of immigration.  Trump is \u201cbringing a lot of notoriety to the boring Republican group that we\u2019ve had over the years,\u201d said Rick Swindlehurst of Mount Pleasant, Mich. \u201cI mean, you\u2019ve got to admit: McCain was boring. Romney? Kinda boring too.\u201d Like Trump, Fiorina is running as political outsider. She will try to build on her progress on the trail in the next few weeks. The next GOP debate is not until Oct. 28.  On Monday, Fiorina will be a guest on \u201cThe Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon.\u201d Seemingly aware that political celebrity does not necessarily equal wins, Fiorina urged supporters not to sit on the sidelines.  \u201cYou need to do your part,\u201d she said at Mary\u2019s. \u201cAs citizens, you need to stand up, you need to vote.\u201d ", "byline": "", "description": "Former Hewlett-Packard exec draws more attention \u2014 but also skepticism \u2014 after Wednesday\u2019s GOP debate.", "title": "Carly Fiorina gets rock-star welcome at GOP events on Mackinac Island", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/carly-fiorina-gets-rock-star-welcome-at-gop-events-on-mackinac-island/2015/09/19/9441a1da-5ed6-11e5-9757-e49273f05f65_story.html", "topics": ["immigration", "personality", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Jeb Bush", "Candice S.
