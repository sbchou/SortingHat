The committee interviewed Planned Parenthood officials and representatives from three tissue procurement companies that work or had worked with clinics -- and the Democrats conclude there's no evidence to substantiate allegations of wrongdoing made by the Center for Medical Progress. In a new memo shared with PULSE, the Democrats' report finds no evidence that clinics are profiting from the sale of fetal tissue or that physicians are altering the timing, method or procedure of an abortion for the purpose of obtaining fetal tissue. Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, haven't yet offered the results of their investigation.\n-- More report findings from the Dems: Just two Planned Parenthood affiliates are participating in fetal tissue donation, and only one affiliate is receiving any reimbursement for costs. Another four participated in donation in the past five years. The one clinic that is getting reimbursed receives $60 per tissue specimen, the report outlines -- and tissue procurement execs confirmed similar reimbursement costs, ranging between $45 and $60. Deborah Nucatola, who appeared in the first CMP video, told the committee that \"donation is not a revenue stream for affiliates.\" StemExpress's Cate Dyer, who appeared in another video, said she thought Planned Parenthood was losing money on its tissue donation practices. \n-- Planned Parenthood execs, as well as the tissue procurement company leaders, all said that Planned Parenthood isn't donating intact fetuses, which would be a violation of the Partial Birth Abortion Act. The full memo here: http://politico.pro/1Nh1WgA\nAll that comes as the House Judiciary Committee holds a hearing on Planned Parenthood this morning. There won't be any officials from the organization, but Republicans are planning for emotional testimony from two women who say they are \"abortion survivors\" after being born alive during abortion procedures. Both will describe surviving a saline abortion that they say should \"scald the child to death, from the outside in,\" as Melissa Ohden says in prepared remarks. The Democratic witness, a law professor, will offer a legal defense against the undercover videos: \"There is simply no evidence in these misleadingly edited videos of a violation of either of these laws,\" she'll say today, per prepared testimony. The full transcripts: http://1.usa.gov/1NZxE3q. And the livestream will be here at 10:30 a.m.: http://1.usa.gov/1hCNpi3 \n-- AND, HOW TO AVOID A SHUTDOWN (OR AT LEAST TO TRY): House Republican leaders are leaning toward a plan, but there's far less agreement about how to deal with the issue around government funding for Planned Parenthood. Leaders will hold a series of \"listening sessions\" this week with lawmakers in hopes of quelling any uprising, POLITICO's Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan report. The options: One, vote on a funding bill that also defunds Planned Parenthood, ensuring a veto from President Barack Obama. Two, pass a funding bill that doesn't deal with the organization, but also schedule a vote on a standalone defunding measure. Three -- and this one is new -- use reconciliation to go after Planned Parenthood funding more directly. Majority Leader Keving McCarthy and Whip Steve Scalise hope to have a plan by this weekend, at the latest. The full story: http://politi.co/1L10wX8 \n--There are now 28 House Republicans who say they won't vote for a government funding bill unless it eliminates funding for Planned Parenthood, according to Heritage Action for America.

At issue is the definition of \u201csmall group\u201d health insurance market. Currently it only includes employers with 50 or fewer workers, but that threshold is slated to increase to 100 workers next year. That means a broader swath of companies will be subject to the ACA\u2019s coverage rules. Insurers and business groups argue that the change will result in higher premiums and disrupted coverage for millions of workers. \n-- There is broad bipartisan support for legislation that would make the switch optional, and it could advance in the next few weeks. But the proposal could easily get derailed by the usual partisan rancor over Obamacare. \u201cThis small group market, in particular, needs more stability,\u201d said Clare Krusing, a spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans. Pro\u2019s Paul Demko has more: http://politico.pro/1Qn9b6x\n-- And the bill's chances in the Senate? At least so far, no one is sure. Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch told your PULSEr the House was much further along on the issue, but that he's eager to move on it in his committee. \nWHOA: NEW CHOLESTEROL DRUGS ARE WAY OVERPRICED -- The two pricey new drugs should cost two-thirds less than what they currently cost, based on the benefits they bring to patients, according to a new report from the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review. The drugs -- Amgen's Repatha and Sanofi and Regenerson's Praluent -- should cost no more than $2,177 annually to avoid straining the health system, the report said. All three currently cost over $14,000 annually, though that doesn't take into account pending insurance negotiations to lower the cost of the drugs.

On Tuesday, CMS told the National Association of Health Underwriters that they\u2019re aiming to have the dedicated phone line up and running by the start of open enrollment on Nov. 1. \nCALI PLAN TO EXTEND OBAMACARE TO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS PUNTED TO 2016 -- A provision that would let undocumented immigrants buy exchange plans was stripped from a bill before the California state legislature, just days before lawmakers adjourn for the year. Instead, lawmakers plan to take it up next year as part of a different bill, Pro's Rachana Pradhan reports. \"The plan to open up California's exchange to undocumented immigrants easily cleared the California Senate in June before hitting snags in the state Assembly. The bill's supporters also say Gov. Jerry Brown's administration has expressed concerns about the bill,\" she writes.

Republican presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Scott Walker have signaled they too would be open to curbing the tax benefits that have long come with employer-sponsored health coverage.\" So as debate over the tax heats continues to heat up, it'll be just as awkward for Republicans as for Democrats, who also dislike the tax.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is a lead sponsor in the upper chamber. \"It's really turned into an area where we've had an opportunity to work past one another's differences and make a meaningful difference for families who are dealing with this opioid crisis,\" Rep.
