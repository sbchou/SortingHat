The real work is already done, anyway. Josh Kraushaar (here) and Liz Mair (aggregated here) had already determined the causes of death before most in the political press had even finished snark-Tweeting.  So, enough about the roadkill. Let\u2019s talk about the road.  What squashed Walker wasn\u2019t so much about bad staffing or unpreparedness as it was about his fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of his party in this cycle.  Walker looks like a good alternative to Jeb Bush if Ted Cruz is on the other side. But what if the outer boundary is actually Donald Trump or Ben Carson?\nSecond-place Carson is currently running laps around Trump on the issues of sharia law and creeping Islamism. While Trump is trying to get off the topic, Carson is denouncing willful P.C. blindness to the issue.  If you knew these would be the dominant issues of late September, would you have been bullish on Walker in the spring?  With so many voters so deeply despairing about the nature of the government and the state of the republic, Walker-like \u201creform\u201d doesn\u2019t sound so attractive. Revolt is the thing in the GOP these days.  Many have tried to rigidly apply the 2012 template to the 2016 stakes \u2013 including Walker\u2019s campaign. And while there are similarities, 2016 looks different: the nature and size of the field, the compressed schedule, the perceptions of Hillary Clinton\u2019s vulnerability and, most of all, a deeper sense of dread among party activists.  Here\u2019s a way to think about it. When the 2012 GOP nominating cycle was entering its darkest days, Newt Gingrich was warning of creeping sharia. It seems like Carson is picking up where he left off, but with more vigor. It took a while in the 2012 cycle to get to brutal attacks on rivals\u2019 immigration stances. In this cycle, it\u2019s where Trump started.  It\u2019s not so much that Walker peaked too soon, it\u2019s that it\u2019s much later in the cycle than we think.  Given the bloody war that has raged in the GOP since the last presidential cycle, this ought not to surprise us. But it certainly has, and no one more than Walker.  BAIER TRACKS: BLACK AND BLUE AND READ ALL OVER\u2026 \u201cWhat happened to Scott Walker? \u00a0He wasn\u2019t getting any positive story lines and never could get off the ground.\u00a0A search for headlines in major news outlets in the past five weeks reveals more than 80 brutal stories.  Some lowlights: (8/14)\u00a0WashEx: Walker won't buck special interests;\u00a0(8/19)\u00a0WaPo: Scott Walker goes wobbly;\u00a0(8/24)\u00a0WaPo: Walker falls flat on his face; (9/8) The Atlantic: Can Scott Walker Save Himself? The Wisconsin governor\u2019s presidential campaign is in free fall; (9/17)\u00a0Politico: Scott Walker swings, misses and his campaign scrambles  And there were dozens more as bad or worse.  This paints a tough picture of a candidate who one person who knows Walker said, \u2018He ran - not on who he was, but on who he thought people (particularly in Iowa) thought he should be.\u2019\u201d \u2013 Bret Baier  Jeb responds to 9/11 attack ad - At an event in Iowa Monday night, Bush responded to an attack ad from a PAC with ties to Hillary Clinton that went after Bush\u2019s defense of his brother President George W. Bush. Bush responded in Iowa, \u201cProtecting the homeland is a first priority of the President of the United States, and it shouldn\u2019t be a partisan issue.\u201d  You high, bro? - In a new Instagram video, Donald Trump mocks Bush again, this time focusing on Bush\u2019s admitted past doobage enthusiasm. Using Bush\u2019s differing stances on the Iraq war, Trump poses the question: Are we sure it was only 40 years ago?  Carly shows her lighter side on \u2018Tonight Show\u2019 - Carly Fiorina decided to show her lighter side with Jimmy Fallon Monday night. Fiorina talked about her grandchildren and the songs she sings to her dogs. She performed a verse of her made-up song to the tune \u201cRock Around the Clock.\u201d  [In an effort to have more voters get to know her, the super PAC backing Fiorina\u2019s campaign hosts a the premiere of \u201cCitizen Carly\u201d tonight at the Arlington Cinema \u2018n\u2019 Drafthouse in Arlington, Va. Watch the trailer here.]  SOUND OFF: READERS RESPOND TO GOP 2016 POWER INDEX \u201cI used to be a supporter of Fox News, now I don\u2019t listen to any of Fox reporters or staff. You are just as bad as the lazy Republicans and Democrats. You don\u2019t care about\u00a0truth, just ratings....shame on you...\u201d \u2013 David Black  \u201cDebate established that Carly Fiorina and Marco Rubio most articulate on policy, with Donald Trump and Ben Carson weak on substance. At this early point, a Rubio-Fiorina ticket (or vice versa) appears\u00a0best chance to both unify fractious GOP and win the general election.\u201d \u2013 Jim Hartman  \u201cChris, c\u2019mon! Love the daily column but in what world, or by what metric, do you see Jeb as the most likely GOP nominee today? A little too inside for me. I\u2019d go Carly, Rubio and Cruz as 1,2,3 in any order you want to put them as of today (e.g. if the vote was tomorrow) Thanks. Keep it comin\u2019.\u201d \u2013 J.E.

Additionally, Clinton has committed to changing the law\u2019s small business mandate, which requires businesses with 50 or more full-time employees to provide health insurance or pay a penalty fee. In a February 2014\u00a0speech she spoke of the perils of Obamacare forcing businesses to hire employees part-time, rather than full time, in order to ensure that they don\u2019t have to pay extra for healthcare allowances.\u201d  Hillary botches emotional moment with suicide victim\u2019s mom - Boston Globe: \u201cThe sauna-hot room was silent as a woman told a halting and tearful story about her son\u2019s struggle with a serious mental disorder. \u2018Because we couldn\u2019t get good mental health care for him,\u2019 she said, wiping a tear, \u2018he finally took his life.\u2019 \u2026 Hillary Clinton physically backed up closer to a wall as she listened and nodded. When the woman finished her story, the leading Democratic presidential contender retrieved a microphone, turned away, and began asking another panelist to respond. Then she stopped herself. \u2018I\u2019m very sorry,\u2019 said Clinton, who followed with a bland observation. \u2018We\u2019re not doing enough on mental health treatment.\u2019 No real show of compassion. No hug or even a touch on the hand.\u201d  New Yorkers hard on Iran deal - Support for the Iranian nuclear deal that Hillary Clinton helped set in motion as secretary of state is abysmal even in her home state of New York. Only 32 percent of registered voters in a new Quinnipiac University poll support the deal. Fifty-nine percent were opposed. This may help explain Clinton\u2019s poor favorability rating in the Siena College poll out Monday.  Told ya so: Clintons scuff up Biden ahead of potential launch - You read it here on Monday, but Politico chronicles the pressures being applied to the vice president.  DEMS FACE VOTE ON LATE-TERM ABORTION As Pope Francis arrives in Washington today, Senate Democrats are being forced to fight to keep elective late-term abortions legal. Although Democrats have enthusiastically embraced the pope\u2019s stance on income inequality and climate change it seems that enthusiasm stops with the Church\u2019s anti-abortion stance. Republicans hope to shine a light on this discrepancy between Democrats and the Catholic Church ahead of Francis\u2019 Thursday address to a joint session of Congress.  The vote concerns moving legal constraints from the current 24 weeks to 20 weeks and has broad support across the country. And while Democrats have the votes to stymie the measure, Republicans hope that simply holding the vote will appeal to the broad electorate and create campaign problems for Democratic senators up for re-election in 2016.  Graham wants to get out of abortion \u2018club of seven\u2019 - The Hill: \u201cSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) urged his colleagues to allow a 20-week abortion ban to move forward, saying it\u2019s time for America to \u2018get out of this club of seven\u2019\u2026Other countries that don\u2019t ban elective abortions after 20 weeks include\u00a0Canada, China, the Netherlands, North Korea, Singapore and Vietnam.\u201d  McConnell starts laying out spending strategy - WaPo: \u201c[Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell] is expected [today] to begin setting up the\u00a0procedural process that could allow the Senate to complete work on a stop-gap bill by early next week, giving the House just enough time to consider the legislation before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Under the plan, the Senate would first vote on a\u00a0short-term continuing resolution (CR) that would include language blocking funds from going to Planned Parenthood. Democrats will almost certainly have the votes to filibuster that bill. McConnell would then bring up a CR\u00a0that would extend current discretionary funding levels for up to two and half months without any significant policy changes.\u201d  [Countdown to shutdown: 9 days - Yes it\u2019s that time.

New Hampshire Union Leader: \u201cA city man is facing an arson charge after police say he lit his own vehicle on fire to prevent it from being towed. Police Sgt. Chris Biron said officers were sent to 25 Cartier St. around 7:43 p.m. to investigate a report of arson. Biron said the owner of an apartment building had called Dan\u2019s City Towing to have an illegally parked car removed. According to police, after the car had been placed on a tow truck and lifted, the owner of the vehicle, identified as Shad Badeau, 40, of 25 Cartier St., arrived. According to Biron, Badeau set his vehicle on fire to prevent it from being towed. The tow truck driver unhitched and dropped the vehicle, at which time Badeau extinguished the car fire himself before fire and police personnel arrived. Badeau was arrested on a charge of arson, and is expected to be arraigned today.\u201d  AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026 \u201cWhen he knew that [Scott Walker] disappeared in Iowa, it was over.
