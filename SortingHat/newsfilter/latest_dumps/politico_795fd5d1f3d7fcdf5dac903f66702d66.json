Lerner\n7/27/15 5:42 PM EDT\nUpdated 7/27/15 6:00 PM EDT\nTed Cruz on Monday defended his statement that Mitch McConnell told a \u201cflat-out lie\u201d about reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, doubling down on his assertion that the Senate majority leader conspired with Democrats to undermine the most conservative wing of the party.\n\u201cI gave a highly unusual floor speech,\u201d Cruz said on \u201cThe Howie Carr Show\u201d on WRKO in Boston, referring to his diatribe last Friday condemning the way the Senate ultimately passed funding for the Export-Import Bank.\nStory Continued Below\nMcConnell, Cruz said, \u201cbasically rammed [the Ex-Im Bank] through using the full power of the Senate majority leader,\u201d while getting \u201cvisibly angry\u201d with concerned conservative members of the caucus, like Cruz, and assuring them that he made \u201cno deal\u201d with Democrats about the bank.\nIn Friday\u2019s speech, which Cruz delivered on the floor of the Senate, the Texas Republican and 2016 presidential contender compared McConnell\u2019s denial of a deal to St. Peter\u2019s thrice-repeated denial that he knew Jesus Christ. But, Cruz added, McConnell\u2019s statement was a \u201clie.\u201d\nAlso on POLITICO\nKATIE GLUECK\n\u201cWhat we saw today was an absolute demonstration that not only what he told every Republican senator, but what he told the press over and over again was a simple lie,\u201d said Cruz. \u201cThe majority and minority leader, arm-in-arm again, should not team up against the American taxpayers.\u201d\nWhen asked by host Howie Carr whether or not he believes that the speech was an attack on a fellow Republican, Cruz said he would never \u201cthrow rocks\u201d at a member of his own party. Ronald Reagan famously refrained from attacking fellow GOP-ers, dubbing this policy his \u201celeventh commandment.\u201d Cruz has cited Reagan\u2019s dictum in the past.\n\u201cWhat I said about McConnell wasn\u2019t attacking him personally,\u201d explained Cruz, who later refused to condemn any of Donald Trump\u2019s comments on the campaign trail.\nBy DAVID GREENBERG\nBy JIEUN BAEK\nBy SVEN BECKERT\nBy POLITICO MAGAZINE\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "\"I gave a highly unusual floor speech.\"", "title": "Ted Cruz: I wasn't attacking Mitch McConnell 'personally'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/ted-cruz-i-wasnt-attacking-mitch-mcconnell-personally-120684.html", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["Adam B.
