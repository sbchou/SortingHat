{"body": "Jeb! Bush has just opened the most hipster campaign merchandise store of all time. Among the traditional Jeb! paraphernalia for car windows, coffee mugs and baby onesies, is a T-shirt with a threatening message to anyone who dares challenge his father\u2019s greatness. In block, capital letters, the shirt says: \u201cMy dad is the greatest man I\u2019ve ever known, and if you don\u2019t think so, we can step outside.\u201d That is not an empty threat, people. Remember what happens when you cross a Bush\u2026  Now, if we buy this shirt are we defending former President George H.W. Bush\u2019s honor or our own dad\u2019s?     The most blatantly hipster item is the graphic muscle-tank screenprinted with a black and white picture of Jeb! from the 1970s complete with sideburns and a \u2018stache. If he can\u2019t get 20-somethings to wear this ironically \u2026     The store is also peddling a bowl to make guacamole. It looks like a mortar and pestle without the pestle. The bowl costs $75, and the Jeb! insignia, if there, is not apparent in the photo. (Sales tip: Plain mortars and pestles can be purchased together for much less at any random retailer.) But we guess we\u2019re supposed to presume this is similar to the \u201cguaca bowle\u201d Jeb! and Columba use for \u201cwhipping up guacamole on Sunday Funday.\u201d (Their words not ours.) So, if you\u2019ve longed to spend a lazy Sunday vicariously living like the South Florida Bush family \u2026     If you\u2019re fully emulating the Bushes and traveling to Miami any time soon, there\u2019s also a $30 Jeb! 2016 beach towel to rest your head as you bathe in the sun and ponder your life decisions.", "byline": "", "description": "He's also selling a $75 guaca bowle.
