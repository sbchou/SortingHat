I take responsibility.\u201d\n\u201cI do think I could have and should have done a better job answering questions earlier,\" she added.\nHer remarks came during her third sit-down interview in recent days. The full ABC interview is set to air on Tuesday evening, but the network released Clinton\u2019s one apologetic line in advance.\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\nTuesday's change in direction followed an interview with the AP, in which Clinton again refused to apologize, on the lawyerly grounds that \u201cwhat I did was allowed.\u201d The decision to make a clean apology, a source said, was finalized Monday night.\nThe language of the question Clinton answered on ABC also differed from the one posed by Mitchell, who asked Clinton \"wanted to apologize to the American people for the choice you made.\" That language was seen as heavy-handed by some Democrats, and asking for too much from Clinton.\n\"Though she can't say it, HRC clearly went private because she didn't want folks fishing around in personal email, and it boomeranged,\" former Obama advisor David Axelrod tweeted after the interview. \"She was right to admit mistake and take responsibility, but also wise to refuse the invitation to \"apologize to American people.\"\n The new ABC News interview allowed her to apologize fully, without so explicitly beggin pardon from the entire country.\n Privately, Clinton allies have been seething as the campaign has struggled to overcome the email controversy, with many blaming the fumbling response on the candidate herself. The hope was that the ABC News interview Tuesday night would provide what was necessary for the campaign to turn a corner.\n The apology was the kind of reversal she never made in 2008, when on matters large and small Clinton showed off a real aversion to saying the word, \u201csorry.\u201d That year, she consistently declined to apologize for her vote to authorize the war in Iraq \u2014 a move that eventually cost her in the Democratic primary.\nClinton\u2019s shift to a more contrite response to the email story comes as evidence is mounting that the controversy has dragged on her poll numbers and favorability ratings, while Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders continues to surge and Vice President Joe Biden keeps alive the speculation of his own White House run.\n\n                                            By \nJohn Culhane\n\n\n                                            By \n                                                    Julian E.
