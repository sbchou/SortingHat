The former secretary of state made easy work of a motley crew of challengers in the first Democratic debate in Las Vegas last night. Jim Webb spent most of his time complaining that he wasn\u2019t getting enough time. Bernie Sanders had some moments railing against Wall Street (\u201cfraud is a business model) but struggled over his record on guns and looked completely lost when discussing foreign affairs, especially Russia\u2019s role in Syria. Clinton dominated the foreign policy segments. Lincoln Chafee blamed his dad\u2019s death and fresh arrival in the Senate for voting in favor of Glass-Steagall repeal. It got worse for him from there. \nMartin O\u2019Malley tried to stick it to Clinton on Glass-Steagall but she easily pivoted away to comments on climate change. And moderator Anderson Cooper let the issue vanish even though it presented the most interesting source of policy difference. Clinton broke no new ground on her Wall Street position sticking to her argument that breaking up the big banks is not the answer and that regulators should look to the shadow banking system. Ardent financial reformers hate this answer (and note that all the big banks were deeply involved in the mortgage crisis and closely tied to AIG) but there is really no reason for Clinton to go away from it. She is not going to lose the nomination to any of the men on stage last night. \nStory Continued Below\nVice President Joe Biden did not make a dramatic entrance into the debate and his name never even came up. He\u2019s the only candidate who could seriously challenge Clinton for the nomination but he won\u2019t be running to her left (at least not very hard) on Wall Street issues should he ultimately get in. And Clinton wrapped herself in Obama\u2019s mantle most of the night, a fairly clear effort at reducing the Biden threat. Clinton also got off easy on her email controversy with Sanders riding to her defense saying the American people are \u201csick and tired\u201d of hearing about it, earning a beaming thank you from the Democratic front-runner. \nTHE WALL STREET HIGHLIGHTS \u2014 Some of the top lines from the debate, via POLITICO\u2019s Patrick Temple-West: \u201cAbout an hour into the debate, Wall Street took its inevitable beating from all five Democrat candidates. Former Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley seized on the topic to score points at Clinton\u2019s expense. \u2018Secretary, I was proud to support you eight years ago, but something happened in between,\u2019 he said, referring to the financial crisis of 2008-2009. \u2018We need to reinstate Glass-Steagall,\u2019 O\u2019Malley said \u2026 \n\u201cOn Oct.8, Clinton announced a sweeping proposal to protect and strength the landmark 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. Her proposal touched on financial industry hot-spots ranging from high-frequency trading to the \u2018revolving door\u2019 between Washington regulators and businesses. But it didn\u2019t include reinstating Glass-Steagall. \u2026 \n\u201c\u2018The plan that I put forward would actually empower regulators to break up big banks if we thought they posed a risk,\u2019 Clinton said on Tuesday. \u2018There\u2019s this whole area called \u2018shadow banking,\u2019 that\u2019s where the experts tell me the next potential problem could come from. \u2026 But I want to make sure we cover everybody. Not what caused the problem last time but what could cause it next time,\u2019 she said. \u2018If only you look at the big banks you may be missing the forest for the trees.\u2019\nSanders punched back. \u2018In my view, Secretary Clinton, you do not, Congress does not regulate Wall Street. Wall Street regulates Congress \u2026 And we\u2019ve got to break up these banks. Going to them and saying \u2018please do the right thing\u2019 is kind of na\u00efve.\u2019 \u2026 Sanders hammered Goldman Sachs in particular, citing former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson\u2019s relationship with the company prior to his government service. \n\u201c\u2018Your millionaire and billionaire friends caused this problem \u2026 it was wrong to ask the middle class to bail out Wall Street,\u2019 Sanders said. \u2018I will have Wall Street now to help kids in this country go to college, public colleges and universities, free with a Wall Street speculation tax.\u201d\nWHY SO LITTLE TIME ON GLASS-STEAGALL? \u2014 Better Markets\u2019 Dennis Kelleher emails: \u201cGross disservice to the American people to almost totally ignore the candidates views and plans to prevent another financial crash and protect the American Dream of jobs, homes and economic security. Regardless of what anyone thinks, unbelievable & irresponsible to let that issue go by with so little discussion.\u201d \nWHAT DID WALL STREET THINK? \u2014 This was the typical response from a senior banker: \u201cAt the Mets game, falling in love with Bartolo all over again.\u201d (The Mets lost 3-1 and now must defeat Zack Greinke in Los Angeles on Thursday. They will ride the arm (and hair) of Jacob deGrom. \nCLINTON CRUSHES IT \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Shane Goldmacher: \u201cThe first Democratic debate was advertised as a showdown between the top two candidates in the race, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. Instead, one of the most dramatic moments was a plea from Sanders for the political conversation to move on from Clinton's email scandal. \u2026 The moment of kind sentiment came after Clinton ripped into Sanders in the opening minutes of the debate, going straight after her surging rival for his position on guns, one of the few issues in which the democratic socialist is out of step with the Democratic base.\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the only issue on which she went after Sanders, who has surged in the polls, particularly in New Hampshire. She criticized him for his refusal to embrace capitalism and his holding up of European socialism as a model for America. \u2026 \u2018We are not Denmark. I love Denmark. We are the United States of America,\u2019 she declared. And she said it was the job of leaders to \u201crein in the excesses of capitalism\u201d not to oppose it. \u2018We would be making a great mistake to turn our backs on what created the greatest middle class in the history of the world,\u2019 she said.\u201d http://politi.co/1Pf8Ftz\n**A message from the Independent Community Bankers of America: Now is the time for Congress to put down partisan differences and unlock the community banking industry\u2019s potential to spur economic growth.

I don\u2019t think the story it tells is the one we want to tell, and the reforms it would bring aren\u2019t particularly effective. I think in terms of structural changes, there are better aspirational objectives for the debate to focus on and better options for achieving those objectives. \n\u201cIn particular, breaking up the banks through higher capital requirements would meet the same goals while building on the work that has been done \u2014 work that is already showing significant success and could use more of a spotlight\u201d http://bit.ly/1ZBunLQ\nGOOD WEDNESDAY MORNING \u2014 Somewhere, Jim Webb is still complaining about having to wait 10 minutes to answer a question.

When he broached the idea of doing that at a board meeting at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in Manhattan in February, directors quickly agreed to take up the matter. On April 2, they voted in favor of it. \u2026 GE took a big step toward completing the process on Tuesday when it said it would sell the bulk of its U.S. commercial lending and leasing business to Wells Fargo an operation that includes about $32 billion of assets and 3,000 employees \u2026 \n\u201cThe dismantling of GE Capital shows the impact Washington\u2019s toughened postcrisis approach to banking is having on the formerly freewheeling world of finance. GE Capital made loans funded by debt, including money borrowed via the short-term IOUs known as commercial paper. After that market froze in the financial crisis, the government stepped in with a rescue but resolved not to see a repeat of such a mess. Ensuing financial legislation eliminated GE Capital\u2019s longtime regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision. The Federal Reserve took over and GE Capital was deemed a systemically important financial institution, a designation that crimped its use of borrowed money\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1hDy4P9\nNEW FANNIE/FREDDIE RESEARCH \u2014 American Action Forum has new research out today \u201cthat delves into the taxpayer cost of Fannie, Freddie & FHA selling distressed mortgages to non-profits.

JPMorganChase reported third-quarter results Tuesday that disappointed some investors as revenue fell 7%. But some of the bank\u2019s shrinkage was by design, an effort to become simpler and less sprawling as new capital regulations are set to roll out in coming years. The New York bank \u2026 said its overall assets declined by $160 billion in the six months ended Sept. 30 to $2.42 trillion, a 6% drop. The last time assets declined at the bank by that much was in early 2009, during the financial crisis.\n\u201cThe bank is trying to become smaller because the Federal Reserve is preparing to apply new capital surcharges that will be more costly to a bank the larger and more complex it is. On Tuesday, J.P. Morgan executives said they think they have made enough moves to reduce its surcharge to 4% from 4.5%. \u2026 Still, getting smaller has its drawbacks. Excluding a big tax benefit and other items, J.P. Morgan reported that it earned $1.32 a share, a nickel shy of the $1.37 a share expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Including the $2.2 billion tax benefit, the largest U.S. bank by assets reported a profit of $6.8 billion, or $1.68 a share. That compared with a profit of $5.57 billion a year earlier. Revenue at the New York bank fell 6.9% to $22.78 billion.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1LadTTz\nTARULLO: RATE HIKE NOT LIKELY THIS YEAR \u2014 NYT\u2019s Binyamin Appelbaum: \u201cDaniel K. Tarullo, a member of the Federal Reserve\u2019s\u2019s Board of Governors, said on Tuesday he did not \u2018expect that it would be appropriate\u2019 for the Fed to start raising its benchmark rate this year, breaking with the stated position of the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen. Mr. Tarullo spoke, in an interview with CNBC, less than 24 hours after another Fed governor, Lael Brainard, expressed similar hesitation \u2026 The comments by two officials on the Federal Open Market Committee who rarely speak publicly about monetary policy suggested that Ms. Yellen is facing growing internal opposition to the view she expressed last month that it will probably make sense to start raising rates this year to maintain control of inflation. \n\u201c\u2018Yellen appears to have a revolt on her hands,\u2019 said Tim Duy, a professor of economics at the University of Oregon who follows the central bank closely. \u2018She now faces the prospect of multiple dissents from the dovish wing of the F.O.M.C. if she insists on pushing through with a rate hike this year. Such a split decision would not enhance the institution\u2019s credibility.\u2019\u201d http://nyti.ms/1PfbJG2\n** A message from the Independent Community Bankers of America: Now is the time for Congress to put down their partisan differences and unlock the community banking industry\u2019s potential to be catalysts for economic growth. ICBA and America\u2019s more than 6,400 community banks urge lawmakers to secure meaningful regulatory relief. Community banks in every Congressional district across the nation are the backbone of local economic growth nationwide and support our communities one loan at a time. But excessive and unnecessary regulation is thwarting their ability to fully meet the needs of local economies. We need lawmakers to enact sensible regulatory relief to allow community banks to do what they do best: serve their communities.
