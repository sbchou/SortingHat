{"body": "   Republican presidential candidate and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. (Reuters/Lucy Nicholson)  In the first set of GOP debates last month, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina stood out as the clear winner of the \u201cJV debate.\u201d Buoyed by a bounce in the polls (and some lobbying of debate broadcaster CNN), she was\u00a0on the main stage on Wednesday night, and pulled off the same feat\u00a0again. Fiorina was the clear victor, while others who needed a win left their supporters at least as or\u00a0more worried than when the night began. Within her performance, though, were hints of the weaknesses that will plague her for the rest of her campaign. In the broadest sense, Fiorina\u2019s victory was won with clear, specific answers to most of the questions she was asked (with a notable exception which we\u2019ll get to later). She detailed exactly how she would expand the military to send a message to Russia, Iran and so on. She swiftly corrected Donald Trump\u2019s interpretation of the 14th Amendment. She movingly\u00a0linked her answer on drug policy to how she and her husband had lost a child to drug addiction. And she was succinct in laying out the GOP\u2019s anti-Clinton talking points. And she made sure she got as much speaking time as possible, including\u00a0interrupting more than any other candidate \u2014 a smart strategy in an 11-person debate.           1 of 24       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                       Skip Ad   \u00d7           GOP candidates meet in second presidential debate      View Photos   Front-runner Donald Trump and 10 other Republicans face off at the Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif.

The first came when CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper asked her to respond to Donald Trump\u2019s quote about her in a Rolling Stone profile:\u00a0\u201cLook at that face. Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?\u201d\u00a0Fiorina, referencing an earlier exchange between Trump and Jeb Bush, answered, \u201cMr. Trump said that he heard Mr. Bush very clearly what Mr. Bush said. I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.\u201d Simple, effective (and surprisingly not pre-planned), her reply was the first time any GOP candidate has drawn blood when attacking Trump since his campaign began. The other moment was her impassioned support for shutting the government over funding Planned Parenthood, daring Clinton and the president to \u201cwatch the tapes.\u201d Given how important the issue is right now to the conservative base, do not be surprised if her stand\u00a0actually wins her more points with GOP voters than her confrontation with Trump. While Fiorina once again succeeded on the debate stage, the rest of the field comes out of Wednesday in the same state as they went in, for better or worse. Trump, who had mocked Jeb Bush as \u201clow-energy,\u201d seemed to tire as the debate wore on, and lost several exchanges with Jeb Bush, Fiorina and others.\u00a0Judging from the early headlines, the new narrative is that Trump has stalled; as Professor John Sides has pointed out, this new narrative could be a sign of the Trump boomlet ending. After Fiorina, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) probably did best. Like Fiorina, he was the most consistently composed and impassioned; unlike Fiorina, he didn\u2019t really have any memorable moments, and his showing\u00a0wasn\u2019t much stronger than the first debate, when he didn\u2019t gain in the polls. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, after an early attack on Trump, was largely absent in a debate where he desperately needed a win. The pressure on his stumbling campaign will likely only increase. Jeb Bush looked better than he did in the first debate, but likely didn\u2019t do enough to bring\u00a0his poll numbers back up or sooth his donors\u2019 growing fears.\u00a0Ben Carson also largely failed to make waves, but staying the course\u00a0in a strong second suits him just fine right now. The rest of the field was just kind of there. It\u2019s not all roses for Fiorina though; the more\u00a0one looks at her performance, the more vulnerabilities become clear. The first weakness was that her confidence in delivering specifics did not always match the factual accuracy of those specifics. On the Planned Parenthood videos, as Vox\u2019s Sarah Kliff wrote, \u201cEither Fiorina hasn\u2019t watched the Planned Parenthood videos or she is knowingly misrepresenting the footage.\u201d And she said Obama had done \u201cnothing\u201d on immigration, \u201cbecause the Democrats don\u2019t want this issue solved,\u201d when Obama pushed for the immigration reform bill that passed the Senate but House Republicans refused to vote on\u00a0(just one of many GOP excuses for not dealing with the issue). But the bigger weakness was briefly exposed when she and Trump sparred over Fiorina\u2019s record as CEO of Hewlett-Packard. At other points in the debate, Fiorina had been quite willing to come right back at candidates who had challenged her, but when Trump attacked her time at HP, Fiorina almost immediately pivoted towards Trump\u2019s various bankruptcies. That\u2019s because her tenure is difficult to defend. Fiorina\u00a0claims\u00a0she doubled the size of the company, but that was almost entirely because of an unsuccessful merger with Compaq. Under Fiorina, thousands lost their jobs and the company\u2019s stock plummeted by more than half\u00a0\u2014 and then\u00a0jumped 7% the day after her firing.\u00a0Remember, Mitt Romney was hurt in 2012\u00a0merely for investments in companies that lost jobs, and in 2010 California Democrats used Fiorina\u2019s HP record against her with great success.\u00a0Even in the midst of success on Wednesday night, Fiorina still couldn\u2019t hide her weaknesses.           1 of 15       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                     Skip Ad   \u00d7           The top quotes from the second Republican presidential debate      View Photos   Memorable quotes from the second GOP debate.
