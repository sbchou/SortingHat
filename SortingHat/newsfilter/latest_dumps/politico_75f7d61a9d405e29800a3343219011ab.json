But, she went on to add, \u201cPardon us if we\u2019ve got the giggles over watching the Democrats, the so-called Democratic front-runner, hear [competitors\u2019] footsteps and what was meant to be a runaway victory, what was meant to be a coronation, becomes their own \u2026 version of a clown car.\u201d\nAs chatter about a possible Biden bid has intensified over the past several days, plenty of Republicans are sounding more like Biden cheerleaders \u2014 even Biden consultants \u2014 than political foes, delighting in gaming out how Biden could emerge as a credible challenger to Clinton and knock out the sense of coronation that has lingered around her, even as she battles scandal-tinged headlines.\n\u201cOh, Run Joe Run,\u201d said Conway, who is also president of a super PAC backing Ted Cruz.\n\u201cI\u2019d love to see Joe Biden get into the race,\u201d said GOP strategist and former Mitt Romney spokesman Ryan Williams. \u201cHe would be a formidable candidate.\u201d\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) has been tweeting stories bearing headlines such as \u201cHillary vs. Biden Would Get Ugly Fast\u201d and \u201cTop Democratic fundraisers invited to meet with Joe Biden at Naval Observatory.\u201d\nAnd the Republican National Committee has been blasting out examples of the White House speaking highly of the vice president, seeking to suggest that Obama would lean toward his second-in-command rather than his former secretary of state.\nAlso on POLITICO\nANNA PALMER\n\u201cA Biden candidacy will divide the White House and could fracture the Democrat establishment \u2014 especially if Clinton can\u2019t turn things around or stumbles even further,\u201d said RNC spokesman Michael Short, explaining the Biden boosterism.\nBiden has yet to publicly announce his intentions but is said to be heavily considering a run, with a decision expected by the end of the summer. His desire to mount another run (after failing to clinch the Democratic nomination in 1988 and 2008) is said to be motivated in part by the recent death of his son Beau Biden, who reportedly wanted his dad to run, and comes as Clinton has suffered endless headlines about her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and questions about conflicts of interest regarding the Clinton Foundation.\nIt\u2019s not that Clinton is running alone. She already has several challengers, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has gained some traction among progressives in the party. But in the eyes of Republicans, the fact that Biden, the sitting vice president, is mulling a late-entry run, is a sign of Clinton\u2019s vulnerabilities.\n\u201cVice President Joe Biden\u2019s potential entry into the Democratic Primary means one thing and one thing only \u2014 Secretary Clinton is in trouble,\u201d said Jeff Bechdel, communications director for the GOP opposition research group America Rising PAC, in a statement. \u201cClinton has inflicted so much damage on herself through scandals involving her private email and the Clinton Foundation that she has provided an opening for Biden.\u201d\nA representative for Clinton didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nRepublicans are hopeful that Biden, a seasoned politician who is respected on both sides of the aisle, would emerge as a credible contender who, at the least, would be taken seriously should he draw contrasts with Clinton. They also believe Biden would eat into some of her support among centrist Democrats, weakening Clinton by dipping into her base.\n\u201cIf Biden can get any kind of traction, any momentum, it will further add to all of the problems Hillary Clinton has to deal with. And getting through the nominating season, it adds all kinds of extra pressure that they weren\u2019t really counting on at the beginning of this race. It\u2019s just another prominent voice that\u2019s going to show a contrast with Hillary Clinton,\u201d the RNC\u2019s Short said in a separate conversation.\nAlso on POLITICO\nNICK GASS\nMany Democrats, and some Republicans, say that\u2019s wishful thinking \u2014 Clinton is still overwhelmingly expected to be her party\u2019s nominee, and some think a more contested primary would make her stronger, as was the case for now-President Barack Obama when he ran against Clinton in 2008.\nBut if nothing else, Republicans say, the colorful Biden would ensure that it\u2019s not just the GOP in the sensationalist spotlight.\nBiden, who can be an emotional speaker, has a long record of getting carried away, or getting ahead of himself or the administration, such as when he blurted out full support for same-sex marriage before that was the position held by the White House. While he is currently still raw from the death of his son, Biden is known for using off-color language and for public displays of affection, and after the summer of Trump, Republicans wouldn\u2019t mind sharing the attention.\n\u201cBiden is good for a laugh at least once a week,\u201d said New Hampshire GOP operative Dave Carney. \u201cFor anyone in the business of generating clicks, he\u2019s almost as good as Trump.\u201d\nBut the GOP hope that Biden would substantially shake up the Democratic race is predicated on a lot of \u201cifs.\u201d It\u2019s not at all clear that Biden will actually get into the race; if he does, he could easily fall flat \u2014 as he did in 2008, when he ran against Clinton and Obama \u2014 and there\u2019s no guarantee that he would criticize Clinton off the bat, much less that he would do so effectively.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019ve got fundamental policy differences,\u201d said Fergus Cullen, a former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party who does not think that Biden will deliver on all of those GOP dreams. \u201cBoth are establishment Democrats. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s younger \u2026 both are former senators. What does he bring to the table, except maybe a little less baggage than Hillary? I just don\u2019t understand it. I think people are being overly polite.\u201d\nBill Kristol, the influential conservative editor of The Weekly Standard, does not think Biden should be dismissed \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not one of those who thinks Biden is a buffoon,\u201d he said \u2014 but at the same time doesn\u2019t think the vice president himself will cause the kind of damage to Clinton other Republicans are betting on. But Biden\u2019s possible entry does send the message that the field isn\u2019t settled yet, Kristol continued, painting a picture of a long-shot scenario in which other candidates, possibly even progressive favorite Elizabeth Warren, who has repeatedly ruled out a run, jump in later.\n\u201cIt does create more fluidity in general in the race,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you watch Trump, and Biden gets in, it feels like a crazy year. All the rules are being broken.\u201d\nBy BEN WOFFORD\nBy CASEY MICHEL\nBy PETER SUDERMAN\nBy JACK SHAFER\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "After months of enduring Trump and clown-car cracks, Republicans are enjoying watching Democrats squirm.", "title": "GOP revels in Joe Biden buzz", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/gop-revels-in-joe-biden-buzz-121743.html", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "personality"], "people": ["Dave Carney", "Mitt Romney", "Beau Biden", "Kellyanne Conway", "Joe Biden", "Michael Short", "Hillary Clinton", "Fergus Cullen", "Donald Trump", "Ryan Williams", "Barack Obama", "Elizabeth Warren", "Jeff Bechdel", "Bernie Sanders", "John Cornyn", "Katie Glueck", "Bill Kristol", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": ["PAC", "Senate", "Clinton Foundation", "RNC", "Republican National Committee", "New Hampshire Republican Party", "America Rising PAC", "Naval Observatory", "GOP"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30851, "fullname": "katie glueck", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-08-26 10:10:19", "org": "politico", "article_id": "75f7d61a9d405e29800a3343219011ab", "date_access": "2015-08-26 10:10:08.121970"}
