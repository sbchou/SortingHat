Brands\n\n\n            By \nAnnie Karni\n\n10/16/15 04:23 PM EDT\nHillary Clinton doesn't appear ready to let Bernie Sanders off the hook on his gun control record anytime soon.\nOn Friday, the campaign released a new video tying her fight against the National Rifle Association to President Barack Obama\u2019s comments in October after a mass shooting at a community college in Oregon.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cWe need more guns, they\u2019ll argue, fewer gun safety laws. Somebody somewhere will say Obama politicized this issue,\u201d Obama said at a press briefing Oct. 1, a clip of which plays in the Clinton campaign's new video. \u201cWell this is something we should politicize.\u201d\nThe video is also notable for showing Clinton embrace and attach herself to Obama's message during a period when she has distanced herself from the president on issues of trade, environment and even foreign policy in Syria.\nIn the days after the first Democratic debate, Clinton has been capitalizing on the one issue where she can attack Sanders from the left. The campaign has hailed an exchange between Sanders and Clinton about gun control as one of the most significant back-and-forths to emerge from the two-hour debate.\nThe new video also uses a clip from Clinton\u2019s rally in San Antonio on Thursday, where she also said: \u201cI\u2019ve been told by some to quit shouting about this,\" a veiled reference to a comment Sanders made during the debate. \"Well, I\u2019ll tell you right now, I will not be silenced. ... If you join me, I will keep taking on the NRA. A majority of Americans and a majority of gun owners support the changes I am recommending.\u201d\nShe doubled down on it Friday at a town hall in Keene, New Hampshire.\n\"Some people say that we shouldn\u2019t talk about it. Some say we shouldn\u2019t shout about it,\" Clinton said. \"Well, I think we have to keep talking, but more importantly, we have to act. We have to be willing to take on those who are not in favor of sensible gun-safety measures. That includes the NRA, and it includes a lot of people in public life today who are intimidated. I think that\u2019s no longer feasible. It\u2019s not longer right.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Clinton in new video: &apos;I will not be silenced&apos; on gun control", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/hillary-clinton-gun-control-new-video-2016-barack-obama-214892", "topics": ["trade", "economy", "immigration"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kenneth P.
