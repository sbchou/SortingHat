Lerner\n6/24/15 4:38 PM EDT\nUpdated 6/24/15 5:46 PM EDT\nSarah Palin\u2019s days as a regular fixture on Fox News are over.\nThe former Alaska governor and tea-party activist has been a constant bombastic presence on the network since she rose to national fame as John McCain\u2019s running mate in 2008, but POLITICO\u2019s Mike Allen reported Wednesday that Fox News has decided not to renew her contract. She\u2019ll still make the occasional appearance on Fox News and Fox Business, of course, and now she\u2019ll now be free to make the rounds on other channels and pursue other projects.\nStory Continued Below\nPalin\u2019s departure marks the end of an era, of sorts, for America\u2019s conservative network of choice. And though she won\u2019t be entirely signing off the airwaves, we\u2019ve compiled a list of highlights to commemorate Fox\u2019s Mama Grizzly Years.\n***\n10. October 2012, on Joe Biden\u2019s debate performance against Paul Ryan: \u201cThat\u2019s a tough format. It reminded me \u2026 of watching a musk ox run across the tundra with somebody underfoot. And in this case, when it came to style, it was Paul Ryan underfoot because of the moderator allowing Biden to do the interrupting, to kind of take control of the conversation.\u201d\nAlso on POLITICO\nMIKE ALLEN\n9. October 2014, on those who have discouraged her from running for office again: \u201cBless their hearts, those haters out there.\u201d\n8. February 2012, on the media\u2019s reaction to Rick Santorum: \u201cThis was a speech that he gave back in 2008 where he named evil as Satan. For these lame-stream media characters to get all wee-weed up about that \u2014 first, you have to ask yourself: Have they ever, ever attended a Sunday school class even? Have they never heard this terminology before?\u201d\n7. August 2011, on comments equating tea party activists with terrorists: \u201cIndependent, patriotic Americans who desire fiscal sanity in our beloved nation do not deserve to be called terrorists. If we were domestic terrorists, I think the president would want to pal around with us. He didn\u2019t have a problem with Bill Ayers.\u201d\n6. February 2011, on Rick Santorum\u2019s remark that she couldn\u2019t attend CPAC because she was taking care of her kids: \u201cI will not call him the knuckle-dragging Neanderthal that perhaps others would want to call him. I\u2019ll let his wife call him that.\u201d\n5. May 2015, on veterans who have received sub-standard health care from the VA: \u201cThey\u2019re the ones getting screwed by the VA. \u2026 In many respects, illegal aliens in our country today are receiving better health care, more benefits than our troops.\u201d\n4. April 2014, on a bodyguard who was caught on camera checking her out: \u201cWell, this agent who was kind of ridiculous there in posting pictures and comments about checking someone out. Well check this out, bodyguard \u2014 you\u2019re fired. And I hope his wife kicks his okol\u2019e and sends him to the doghouse. As long as he\u2019s not eating the dog.\u201d\nAlso on POLITICO\nDYLAN BYERS\n3. August 2012, on the upcoming presidential election: \u201cThese people who still have that addiction to the hope-ium that he had promised, that hope-y, change-y stuff that was really bogus four years ago. Well they have about 71 days to open up their eyes and realize the path that he has put us on, a path toward insolvency, a path toward fewer freedoms and, really, orchestrated chaos and bankruptcy.\u201d\n2. March 2014, on the difference between Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama: \u201cPeople are looking at Putin as one who wrestles bears and drills for oil. They look at our president as one who wears mom jeans and bloviates.\u201d\n1. May 2015, on President Obama: \u201cBarack Obama is lazy. In fact, he warned us that he was lazy and he attributed that to having been brought up in Hawaii.\u201d\nBy MICHAEL CROWLEY\nBy ALAN GREENBLATT\nBy DONALD DOWNS and  JOHN SHARPLESS\nBy JACK SHAFER\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "We've compiled a list of highlights to commemorate Fox's Mama Grizzly years.", "title": "Sarah Palin's 10 finest Fox News hits", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/sarah-palin-fox-news-top-ten-comments-remarks-119388.html", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "personality"], "people": ["Rick Santorum", "Bill Ayers", "Mike Allen", "Adam B.
