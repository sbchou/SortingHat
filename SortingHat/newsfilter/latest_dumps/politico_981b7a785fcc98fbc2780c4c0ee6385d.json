But he does like Carson and he liked that he \u201cbacked\u201d Trump up on his views on autism. \nOn a CNN interview after the debate, Trump praised his party. \u201cWe have a lot of talent in the Republican party and I think we\u2019re going to do very well come election day.\u201d \nWhen asked on MSNBC if there was anything he would do differently about the debate, Trump responded that he thinks he did pretty well. \n\u201cThere are some things, maybe it would have been better if the guy didn\u2019t hear my statement in Rolling Stone,\" he said, referring to comments he made to the magazine criticizing Fiorina\u2019s face. \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "After debate, Trump praises GOP challengers", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/donald-trump-2016-cnn-presidential-debate-post-debate-reaction-213771", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "personality"], "people": ["Michael Grunwald", "Henry C.
