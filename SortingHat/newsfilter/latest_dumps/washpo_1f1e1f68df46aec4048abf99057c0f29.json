{"body": "   Trump: It wasn't an apology. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)  SIMI VALLEY, Calif. -- Donald Trump made only the briefest appearance in the post-debate spin room, the flash of his famous hair sparking a dangerous mass scramble to a side door. Stuck inside its threshold, he only got one kind of question: Was he trying to apologize to Carly Fiorina when he called her a \"beautiful\" woman? \"I think she's a very nice woman,\" Trump said. \"It's not a question of apology. She's a very nice woman -- had a little bit of a tough time tonight, I think. A little bit of a tough time. But she's a very nice woman. I really feel and I really felt that she's a very nice woman.\" So, he... apologized? \"Politically correct people would say I did, but I wouldn't say that.\" What about the people who said he was being chauvinistic? Was he apologizing for that? \"Those are politically correct people, and I don't really go by that. I think that's one reason I'm leading in every poll. People get that.\" With that, Trump was gone. Fiorina never entered the spin room -- and neither did any representative of her campaign. The press and even spinners for other campaigns were left explaining that she had been the standout.
