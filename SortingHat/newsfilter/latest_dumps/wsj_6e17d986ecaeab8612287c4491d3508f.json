{"body": "\u201cVox.com is a general interest news site for the 21st century,\u201d the Vox Media website informs us. \u201cIts mission is simple: Explain the News. Vox is where you go to understand the news and the world around you. It treats serious topics seriously, candidly shepherding people through complex topics.\u201d\nBy some measures, Vox.com has been a success. A corporate vice president, Jonathan Hunt, \u201csaid the company broke even in 2014 and will be profitable this year,\u201d Advertising Age reported in March. And Vox gets attention, as evidenced by this column.\nBut its \u201cmission\u201d is to be authoritative, and in that it has failed. It\u2019s just another opinion site, albeit one with an unusually earnest tone. Liberals may cite it as an authority, but they are no less apt to cite sources like ThinkProgress, the Puffington Host and even the New York Times. Nonliberals, especially conservatives, don\u2019t view Vox as any more credible than other liberal sources.\nMuch of Vox\u2019s content consists of strange, contrarian arguments of the sort that could just as easily appear at Slate. A case in point: \u201cEmailgate Is a Political Problem for Hillary Clinton, but It Also Reveals Why She\u2019d Be an Effective President\u201d by Matt Yglesias, a former Slate writer.\nHere is the nut:\nYglesias imagines that as president, Mrs. Clinton would be a kind of benevolent dictator\u2014in his words, \u201can iron fist.\u201d With Republicans likely to retain their congressional majorities, \u201cshe\u2019ll push executive power in somewhat unorthodox ways in pursuit of an agenda conservatives hate.\u201d (He worries, though, that her foreign policy may be uncongenial to liberals.)\n\u201cShe truly is the perfect leader for America\u2019s moment of permanent constitutional crisis,\u201d he exults: \u201ca person who cares more about results than process, who cares more about winning the battle than being well-liked, and a person who believes in asking what she can get away with rather than what would look best.\u201d\n\u201cOne of my longtime rules in politics is that all procedural arguments are insincere, including this one,\u201d as Michael Barone has observed. Those who came of political age in the 1970s and 1980s have at times found it disorienting to see liberals champion executive power at Congress\u2019s expense. Back then, they argued the opposite. But of course then they controlled Congress, while Republican presidents were the norm. They flipped when that did\u2014but then so did conservatives, in the opposite direction. And liberal arguments for a strong executive don\u2019t seem novel at all to anyone who\u2019s studied the Progressive and New Deal eras.\nAnyway, Yglesias can\u2019t be accused of hypocrisy. He\u2019s quite clear that it is the left-wing ideological ends that justify Mrs. Clinton\u2019s questionable means. If two years from now he is inveighing against President Rubio\u2019s outrageous power grabs, that will be entirely consistent with his fantasies about Mrs. Clinton.\nYet Yglesias\u2019s argument is dubious even on its own terms. Consider the objectives of those past norm-busting behaviors he lauds: The cattle-futures scam was for her personal enrichment. The 2000 Senate race and 2008 gaming of the nomination process were for her personal ambition. The illicit email server was, by her own account, for her personal \u201cconvenience.\u201d Other motives have been suggested\u2014to evade public-records laws, to conceal corrupt dealings between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation\u2014none of which are ideological.\nThe only example whose objective was ideological was her nepotistic role as chairman of \u201ca policymaking committee in her husband\u2019s White House.\u201d That would be the Task Force on National Health Care Reform, which put forward an ambitious plan. It died in a Democrat-controlled Congress. That is, the effort ended in failure\u2014as, one hardly need mention, did her 2008 nomination campaign.\nIt\u2019s possible that somebody else would have succeeded in the health-reform effort. It\u2019s probable that New York would have sent a liberal Democrat to the Senate had Mrs. Clinton forgone the race. It\u2019s a fact that a liberal Democrat went to the White House in 2009 (although Yglesias faults President Obama for being too respectful of political norms until recently). On the whole, one could argue that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s efforts have done more to retard than to advance the liberal project.\nAs for the email decision, Mrs. Clinton herself has repeatedly acknowledged\u2014in what the media erroneously term her \u201capologies\u201d\u2014that it backfired badly. To say that the consequences for her have been anything but convenient is an understatement. If her purpose was concealment, the result has been more exposure\u2014not to mention the possibility of criminal exposure. If the reports are accurate, she didn\u2019t even succeed in deleting those 30,000 or so \u201cpersonal\u201d emails to the point of unrecoverability.\nIf you are the sort who longs to be ruled by a dictator, wouldn\u2019t you at least want it to be a competent dictator?\nIn addition\u2014and we say this with the caveat that the following observation may be vulnerable to Barone\u2019s dictum\u2014there are costs to violating political norms even when it seems expedient to do so. To take an example from early in Obama\u2019s presidency, the Democrats\u2019 aberrant exertions on behalf of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act produced a legislative victory but not a political one.\nPast expansions of the welfare state\u2014Social Security, Medicare, even Medicaid\u2014were passed with popular and bipartisan support and have proved politically resilient even against marginal reforms. ObamaCare could easily fall apart once Obama is out of office. As we noted last week, Mrs. Clinton is already calling for repeal of a key provision, the so-called Cadillac tax on employer-provided benefits.\nThe yearning for a strongman in the White House is part of the left\u2019s crisis of authority, about which we wrote in a May 2013 column. (As an aside, a parallel observation may be made about the right and its flirtation with Donald Trump.) Authority in a constitutional republic requires not only political power but legitimacy, which rests upon those political norms Yglesias so eagerly traduces. And the liberal project of expanding the scope of government is especially threatened by the undermining of the government\u2019s legitimacy.\nWhich brings us back to Vox and its \u201cmission.\u201d Its promise of impartial \u201cexplanatory journalism\u201d turned out to be all pretense and no substance. The same can be said (and has been in this column) of other gimmicks like \u201caccountability journalism\u201d and \u201cfact checking.\u201d Journalists no less than politicians depend on public trust, and that trust cannot be earned simply by making a show of authoritativeness.\nTwo Papers in One!\nTwo Candidates in One!\nEverything Not Forbidden Is Compulsory\nWe Blame George W.
