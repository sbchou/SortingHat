Barnum, who enriched himself off of hoaxes and later started Barnum & Bailey Circus, before also entering politics. The only difference, Salter said, is that Barnum had \u201ca less ridiculous hairdo, better taste and more tact.\u201d\nAt a campaign event in Iowa earlier this month, Trump launched an attack on McCain, saying \u201che\u2019s not a war hero\u201d and that, when it comes to heroic veterans, he \u201clike[s] people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d The comments were widely condemned by Republicans of all stripes, but Trump\u2019s poll numbers did not suffer significantly from the backlash.\nOne prominent Republican who refused to condemn Trump despite disagreeing with the comments was Sen. Cruz (R-Texas).\nLater in the article, Salter accuses Cruz of being ripped off by \u201cthe more experienced huckster\u201d and also perpetrating a hoax, but far less grandiosely than Trump. Salter said Cruz is hiding behind Ronald Reagan\u2019s oft-cited 11th commandment \u2014 that Republicans should not attack one another \u2014 as he triangulates \u201cin the hope of eventually inheriting the billionaire huckster\u2019s supporters.\u201d\nAlso on POLITICO\nDANIEL STRAUSS\nExcept it\u2019s not working, Salter says, because Trump is \u201cthe one candidate in the race who has longer and more successful experience with shameless self-promotion and political flimflammery.\u201d\n\u201cWere Trump in some epic misfortune to become the GOP nominee with his toxic favorable-unfavorable ratings and general repulsiveness, he could be the first candidate to lose all 50 states,\u201d writes Salter. \u201cAlthough his outsized ego may prevent him from realizing that, Republican leaders and the other 2016 candidates certainly do.\u201d\n\u201cAnd [in that case] one can imagine a disappointed Ted Cruz, his political career over as quickly as it began because his demagoguery didn\u2019t quite equal Trump\u2019s know-nothing hucksterism,\u201d Salter concludes.\nBy JACK SHAFER\nBy MICHAEL KRUSE\nBy DENNIS ROSS\nBy BEN WOFFORD\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Mark Salter has worked for McCain for approximately two decades.", "title": "Longtime McCain aide launches vitriolic attack on Trump, Cruz", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/john-mccain-aide-mark-salter-attacks-donald-trump-ted-cruz-120815.html", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Mark Salter", "Ted Cruz", "Ronald Reagan", "Adam B.
