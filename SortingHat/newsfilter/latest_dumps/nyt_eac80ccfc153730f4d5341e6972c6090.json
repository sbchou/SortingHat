{"body": "One of the more contentious moments of the first Republican presidential debate was when Donald J. Trump refused to rule out the possibility of a third party bid. \n\nMr. Trump showed no regrets about that position on Friday morning, maintaining that he was not going to let go of the leverage that he holds by keeping his options open.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a frontrunner \u2014 obviously I\u2019d much rather run as Republican and let that be clear,\u201d Mr. Trump said on MSNBC\u2019s \u2018Morning Joe.\u2019 \u201cAnd I just want to see if somebody gets in that I like and if I\u2019m treated with respect, I would not run as an Independent. But I want to leave the option open just in case that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also said that he owed it to his supporters to keep open the possibility of running as an independent and that he thinks he could beat Hillary Rodham Clinton even if he did not face her as a Republican. \n\n\u201cHillary\u2019s not exactly the great Abraham Lincoln,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe billionaire businessman also continued to be critical of the debate moderators, saying that Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly was \u201cvery unprofessional\u201d in her questioning and that she was more tough on him than his rivals.
