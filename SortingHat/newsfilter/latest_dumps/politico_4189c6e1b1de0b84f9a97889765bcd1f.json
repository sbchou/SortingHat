Rand Paul pulled in $7 million for his presidential run during the last fundraising quarter, his campaign reported on Friday.\nIncluded in that number are receipts from Paul\u2019s joint fundraising committee, and his campaign is able to point to a decently large number of contributors (108,205) with an average donation of $65.\nStory Continued Below\nThe $7 million figure doesn\u2019t, however, include the money raised by the libertarian-ish candidate\u2019s super PAC, which is expected to significantly up his total haul.\nWhile that makes comparisons tough, the initial figure pales in comparison to the eye-popping numbers trotted out by his Republican rivals in recent days. On Thursday, Jeb Bush\u2019s super PAC that it had exceeded its fundraising target, and had brought in $103 million. On top of that, Bush\u2019s campaign reported it had raised $11.4 million.\nAlso on POLITICO\nKATIE GLUECK\nAnd Sen. Ted Cruz announced last week that his campaign and super PACs had brought in a total $51 million haul for the second quarter.\nDuring the same fundraising period in the 2012 cycle, Sen. Paul\u2019s father, Ron Paul, raised $4.5 million.\nPaul\u2019s overall fundraising numbers are expected to put him very much in the game, and his polling numbers have him in the upper middle of the field. A recent CNN poll found Paul with 8 percent support, tied with Ben Carson and trailing Bush and Donald Trump.\nBreitbart.com first reported Paul\u2019s haul.\nBy MICHAEL KRUSE\nBy POLITICO MAGAZINE\nBy P.W.
