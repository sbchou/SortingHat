{"body": "Throughout the 2012 election campaign and ever since, Mitt Romney\u2019s fellow Republicans have criticized how he ran his presidential bid.\n\nThose Republicans include several people who are now running or plan to run for president in the 2016 election cycle. Their assessments of Mr. Romney\u2019s campaign, either retrospectively or in real time, were pointed, and now these politicians themselves are going through some rough patches.\n\nMr. Romney \u201cmade it about a referendum on the president\u2019s policies rather than about himself,\u201d Jeb Bush was quoted as saying last month. \u201cHe didn\u2019t show his heart. He didn\u2019t send a signal that he cared about people \u2014 when he did.\u201d\n\nBut others, conversely, wonder if Mr. Romney could ever have connected with voters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of with Ann Romney on this one: no, no, no, no, never,\u201d Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky told ABC\u2019s Jonathan Karl last January, when Mr. Romney was thinking of running a third time. \u201cI think it\u2019s a little more visceral than that, how you connect with people, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anybody\u2019s fault. I\u2019m just not sure that visceral connection is there with enough people to win a general election.\u201d\n\nEven during the 2012 election campaign, some prominent Republicans were critical of Mr. Romney \u2013 most notably Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of caution,\u201d Mr. Walker said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d in January 2012, discussing the Romney campaign. \u201cI think the mistake that they\u2019ve made is the feeling like it can just be a referendum on the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s got to be something more,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople don\u2019t just vote somebody out; they\u2019ve got to vote somebody in.\u201d\n\nGov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who flirted with a presidential bid in 2012, was openly dismissive of Mr. Romney\u2019s aides when asked whether his embrace of President Obama \u2014 after Hurricane Sandy ravaged his state \u2014 could have harmed the candidate. Mr. Christie was also pressed on his decision not to campaign for the Republican nominee in the final weeks of the race.\n\n\u201cAll this other noise, I think, is coming from know-nothing, disgruntled Romney staffers who, you know, don\u2019t like the fact that I said nice things about the president of the United States,\u201d Mr. Christie said shortly after Election Day in 2012. \u201cWell, that\u2019s too bad for them.\u201d\n\nMany of Mr. Romney\u2019s struggles as a candidate were of his own making. But now the men who made these assessments are finding how tough the spotlight can be. Mr. Bush, for instance, spent last week grappling with his inability to articulate a clear response to whether he would have invaded Iraq in 2003.\n\nMr. Paul has similarly had a number of rough news cycles, and has felt the media heat lamp for chuckling about his Amtrak train not stopping in Baltimore amid violence after the death of a black man in police custody.\n\nMr. Walker has stumbled talking about foreign policy, and was criticized for not taking questions in South Carolina. And Mr. Christie\u2019s difficulties following the George Washington Bridge lane closing episode are well-known.\n\nTheir past statements, when matched up against their current circumstances, are reminders that it\u2019s easy to be a critic from the sidelines, but much harder to actually run for president.", "byline": "MAGGIE HABERMAN", "description": "Some current assessments by Republicans of Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign, either retrospectively or in real time, were pointed, and now these politicians themselves are going through some rough patches.", "title": "First Draft: Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 Bid Had Tough Critics Among 2016 Hopefuls", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/05/18/romneys-bid-had-tough-critics-among-current-hopefuls/", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "personality"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Mitt Romney", "Ann Romney", "Chris Christie", "Jeb Bush", "Jonathan Karl", "Scott Walker"], "orgs": ["Hopefuls", "MSNBC", "Amtrak"], "authors": [{"author_id": 7421, "fullname": "maggie haberman", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-05-18 13:43:25", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "d4f3464b6240541b4e611990a3ef9f8f", "date_access": "2015-05-18 20:49:32.748044"}
