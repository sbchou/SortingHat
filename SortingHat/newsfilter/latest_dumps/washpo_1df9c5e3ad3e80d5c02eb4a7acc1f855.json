{"body": " For Democrats, Donald Trump amounts to a kind of divine intervention. With the Republican Party on an urgent mission to woo Latino voters, one of its leading presidential candidates has been enmeshed for two weeks in a nasty feud over his inflammatory comments about Mexican immigrants. \u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs,\u201d Trump said in his campaign announcement speech. \u201cThey\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists.\u201d The comments \u2014 and many more since \u2014 have prompted an uproar among Latino groups and a series of acrimonious break-ups between Trump and various corporate partners. His outlandish rhetoric and skill at occupying the national spotlight is also proving to be dangerously toxic for the GOP brand, which remains in the rehabilitation stage after losing the 2012 presidential race. Univision said it would not air his Miss Universe and Miss USA beauty pageants; Trump sued the Spanish-language television network for $500\u00a0million. NBC Universal severed all ties to him this week, including his \u201cApprentice\u201d reality series; he called the network \u201cso weak and so foolish.\u201d    Hillary Rodham Clinton, in June 26 speech in Virginia, berated Republicans for not standing up to Donald Trump\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric about Mexican immigrants. (Charles Ommanney/The Washington Post)  And on Wednesday, the Macy\u2019s department store chain dumped him, saying it would no longer sell his menswear line. Trump said the retail chain had \u201ctotally caved.\u201d Despite \u2014 or perhaps because of \u2014 such antics, the flashy real estate mogul with a big bank account and an even bigger ego has rocketed into second place in recent national polls and in the early nominating states of Iowa and New Hampshire.  [Trump: \u2018I\u2019m being very nice now. I\u2019m trying to be presidential.\u2019]  Hillary Rodham Clinton and other Democrats, meanwhile, are eager to make Trump the face of the Republican Party, which is momentarily leaderless with a disparate presidential field and no clear front-runner. \u201cI am a person of faith \u2014 and the Donald\u2019s entry into this race can only be attributed to the fact that the good Lord is a Democrat with a sense of humor,\u201d exulted Paul Begala, veteran Democratic strategist and adviser to Priorities USA Action, a super PAC boosting Clinton\u2019s candidacy. In Iowa, the New York developer is tied for second place behind Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker with 10 percent, according to a Quinnipiac University survey released Wednesday. In New Hampshire, a CNN-WMUR poll last week had Trump in second place behind former Florida governor Jeb Bush with 11 percent. He also comes in second behind Bush in a new national CNN/ORC poll released Wednesday.   Donald Trump, seen here campaigning at a backyard reception in Bedford, N.H., has surged to second place in the Granite State and nationally. (Dominick Reuter/Reuters)  Trump, who claims to be worth $9\u00a0billion, has staked out populist-sounding ground in the campaign so far, railing against the impact of illegal immigrants, particularly from Mexico, on the U.S. economy and vowing to \u201cbuild a great wall on our southern border\u201d to keep them out. That message, along with promises to restrict Chinese imports and other protectionist measures, could resonate particularly well with some white, blue-collar male voters, angry over the slow economic recovery and suspicious of elite opinion in Washington. Trump also has stood by his remarks tying immigrants to crime. \u201cI like Mexico. I love the Mexican people. I do business with the Mexican people, but you have people coming through the border that are from all over. And they\u2019re bad. They\u2019re really bad,\u201d Trump said last weekend on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cYou have people coming in, and I\u2019m not just saying Mexicans, I\u2019m talking about people that are from all over that are killers and rapists, and they\u2019re coming into this country.\u201d   [Donald Trump begins 2016 bid, citing his outsider status]  Leading the Democratic charge to tie the GOP to Trump is Clinton, who has been invoking Trump\u2019s comments about Mexicans on the campaign trail. Notably, she does not mention Trump by name \u2014 perhaps hoping to associate his views with the other 15\u00a0declared or likely GOP candidates. \u201cRecently a Republican candidate for president described immigrants as drug dealers, rapists and criminals,\u201d Clinton told a raucous rally in Northern Virginia last week. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s never met them. Maybe he\u2019s never stopped to ask the millions of people who love this country, work hard and want nothing more than a chance to build a better life for themselves and their children what their lives are like.\u201d Other Democrats have pounced as well. Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2014 a descendant of Mexican immigrants seen as rising star in his party \u2014 said in a recent interview that Trump was \u201cplainly insulting Mexicans.\u201d \u201cHe will be in this campaign in many ways the face of the Republican Party because he has higher name [identification] than almost all of them,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThat is a very dumb way to begin a campaign.\u201d  [How Mexico is going to make Donald Trump pay]  Trump and his advisers declined to comment on the record for this story. Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, told reporters last week that Trump\u2019s comments were \u201cnot helpful\u201d to the party\u2019s efforts to reach more diverse voters. But, he added, \u201cwe don\u2019t get to pick and choose who runs, who doesn\u2019t.\u201d Although most were initially hesitant to comment, a growing number of likely or declared GOP candidates have condemned Trump\u2019s Mexican-bashing comments. \u201cI think they are wholly inappropriate,\u201d New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said last week. Some of the party\u2019s firebrands, however, rallied to Trump\u2019s support. Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), a presidential candidate and tea party favorite, said this week that Trump was \u201cterrific\u201dand that he should not apologize because he \u201cspeaks the truth.\u201d Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), a staunch conservative who plays an important role in Iowa\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucuses, said in a radio interview Wednesday that he appreciates Trump\u2019s \u201cscrappiness.\u201d   [How Donald Trump\u2019s man in Iowa plans to mess with the GOP]  \u201cDonald Trump is one of the few individuals that will speak boldly about what he believes in, and he\u2019ll be challenged by the PC police, the politically correct police, and instead of backing up and curling up, he just goes forward,\u201d King said on KAYL Radio in Storm Lake, Iowa. Clinton, though, in her Virginia speech scolded the GOP field for not speaking up more loudly to condemn Trump. \u201cWe need to call out derogatory language, insults, personal attacks wherever they occur,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is enough for us to debate without going there.\u201d Begala helped write Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201cSister Souljah\u201d speech in his 1992 presidential campaign when Clinton repudiated controversial comments about race by a hip-hop artist. \u201cI know how powerful it can be to point out problems on your team,\u201d Begala said. With Trump, Begala said, Republicans \u201cdon\u2019t know what to do about him. The truth is, it\u2019s very simple. What they say to friends in private is what they ought to say to the country in public, which is, \u2018That guy\u2019s out of line.\u2019\u201d David Axelrod, a former campaign strategist for President Obama, said Republican candidates must develop \u201ca Trump strategy.\u201d \u201cYou heard his opening salvos, many of which clanked and created some discomfort among Republicans,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cEvery Republican candidate now has to calculate how they deal with him, particularly in the debates. If he says something outrageous and no one challenges him, that\u2019s bad for them and bad for the Republican Party.\u201d The prospect of such a Trump moment in a debate invites memories of 2012 Republican primary debates that ended up becoming obstacles for the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney. In one debate, when audience members booed a gay soldier, neither Romney nor any other candidate came to his defense. Erik Smith, a Democratic strategist who worked on Obama\u2019s campaigns, said the danger for Republicans is that Trump becomes \u201can anchor\u201d weighing down the party\u2019s brand, especially with Latino, millennial and independent voters. \u201cThe truth is this entire field is currently reinforcing their party\u2019s worst perceptions among the voters they need the most,\u201d Smith said. \u201cTrump simply super-charges it. He turns the volume up to 11.\u201d Some Republican strategists, however, see a silver lining. \u201cYou can make the argument that hyperbolic rhetoric like this paints the rest of the field as much more moderate,\u201d said Brian Walsh, a veteran Republican operative. \u201cIt\u2019s harder in the long run to paint Republicans like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio as representative of the far right when that rhetorical space is being filled by someone like Donald Trump.\u201d  ", "byline": "", "description": "For Democrats, Donald Trump amounts to a kind of divine intervention.With the Republican Party on an urgent mission to woo Latino voters, one of its leading presidential candidates has been enmeshed for two weeks in a nasty feud over his inflammatory comments about Mexican immigrants.Read full article >>", "title": "Donald Trump surges, and Democrats cheer", "url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636635/s/47c09b94/sc/7/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cpolitics0Cdonald0Etrump0Esurges0Eand0Edemocrats0Echeer0C20A150C0A70C0A10C895d9e9e0E1f5d0E11e50E84d50Eeb37ee8eaa610Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Inational/story01.htm", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["Steve King", "Brian Walsh", "Paul Begala", "Bill Clinton", "Chris Christie", "Julian Castro", "Jeb Bush", "Marco Rubio", "Dominick Reuter", "Donald Trump", "Hillary Rodham Clinton", "Reince Priebus", "Mitt Romney", "David Axelrod", "Erik Smith", "Charles Ommanney", "Scott Walker", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": ["Quinnipiac University", "Republican Party", "Univision", "Priorities USA Action", "PAC", "Republican National Committee", "GOP"], "authors": [{"author_id": 31230, "fullname": "philip rucker", "primary_org": "washpo"}], "date_written": "2015-07-01 21:17:00", "org": "washpo", "article_id": "1df9c5e3ad3e80d5c02eb4a7acc1f855", "date_access": "2015-07-01 21:30:14.058496"}
