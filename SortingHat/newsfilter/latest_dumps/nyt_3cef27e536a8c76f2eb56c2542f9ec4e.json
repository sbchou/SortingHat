{"body": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The shape of the Republican presidential nomination race and the fate of the traditional New Hampshire primary were crystallized by three town hall meetings in the state last week.\n\nGov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, at the Derry-Salem Elks Lodge in Salem, and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, at the Historical Society of Cheshire County in Keene, each had healthy give-and-take sessions with more than 100 voters that lasted over  an hour. These were in the tradition of New Hampshire politics.\n\nIn between those forums, Donald J. Trump packed an auditorium in the town of Derry with 20 times as many people for a gathering that more closely resembled an angry revival meeting or a professional wrestling match.\n\nFor more than a half-century, New Hampshire has been a proving ground for vetting and testing presidential hopefuls, forcing them to hone their political and policy knowledge. If the Trump model prevails, it not only could change the fabric of the party but also could spell an end to this substantive, searching type of retail politics.\n\nThe town halls of Mr. Bush and Mr. Kasich,  two of the top mainstream Republican candidates, were not absolute models of thoughtful citizen engagement; there were confrontational moments. Somebody asked Mr. Bush whether he had been on a clandestine C-130 aircraft that the questioner said had ferried Saudi agents out of the United States the day after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nMr. Kasich was grilled on Social Security by Jane Lang, vice president of the New Hampshire Alliance for Retired Americans. The demonstrative governor went over and hugged her.\n\nAsked later about his answer, she replied: \u201cWhat answer?\u201d\n\nThese two sessions featured pretty good questions and reasonably thoughtful answers on jobs, the environment, Russia, Social Security, abortion and disabilities. That\u2019s the New Hampshire way. By contrast, the Trump rally was almost content-free. The real estate mogul spoke  with insults, invective, bravado and bluster. He said that Mr. Bush was \u201cdumb\u201d and that Mitt Romney lost the 2012  presidential contest because \u201che choked.\u201d Asked beforehand by a reporter to provide specific achievements to back his claim to be a champion of women\u2019s issues, Mr. Trump responded: \u201cNobody will be better on women\u2019s health issues than Donald Trump.\u201d That was it.\n\nWhen a woman asked one of the few substantive questions at the town hall \u2014 whether he would include more policy prescriptions on his website \u2014 the Republican front-runner began discoursing on his business acumen and recalled \u201cscooping up the Doral Hotel.\u201d\n\nThe crowd, young and old, lapped it up. Ken Brand, a 56-year-old Derry resident who periodically leapt to his feet yelling, \u201cBring it on, Donald,\u201d loved the message: \u201cHe\u2019s going to build that wall to keep Mexicans out and ship those 11 million illegals the hell out of here.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump is setting the agenda, dominating the debate in New Hampshire. As Mr. Kasich emerged from an education forum in Londonderry, a town to the west of Derry, the first three questions he was asked were about Mr. Trump and immigration. Mr. Bush had a similar  experience in Keene, only with more questions about Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Trump belittles most of his opponents  but displays special venom toward Mr. Bush. The Bush camp says this will energize their campaign as their candidate fights back by citing all of Mr. Trump\u2019s nonconservative positions and telling voters that his anti-immigration initiatives \u2014 building a wall on the border that Mexico will pay for, deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants, ending birthright citizenship and seizing remittances to home countries \u2014 \u201care not going to happen.\u201d If this were an academically scored debate, Mr. Bush would win easily on substance. But it\u2019s more like a street brawl, and Mr. Trump is on familiar ground.\n\nThere are still 169 days before the New Hampshire contest, which often has determined  the ultimate nominee or sent a resounding message about the general election. The state\u2019s voters break late and are unpredictable, which is why many politicos here suspect the Trump phenomenon will fade. It didn\u2019t look that way in Derry.", "byline": "ALBERT R.
