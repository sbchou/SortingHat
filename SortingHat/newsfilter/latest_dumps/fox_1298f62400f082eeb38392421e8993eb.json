Bush opens his quest for the White House with much to prove. Six months after signaling serious interest in a possible run, the son of one president and brother of another has accumulated a record-breaking war chest approaching $100 million, activated a national political network and pioneered a new approach to presidential campaigns.  (AP Photo/Erik Schelzig, File)\n\t                        \n\t                \n\n\nIn the ever-important Money Primary, the GOP presidential field has divided into Haves and Have-Nots.\nThe Haves are former Florida Gov.\u00a0Jeb Bush, who has raised $114 million; Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, at $52 million; Florida Sen.\u00a0Marco Rubio, at $45 million; and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, at $26 million. These figures include the funds raised directly by the campaigns as well as the candidates\u2019 associated super PACs through June 30.\nExcluding super PACs changes the ranking. In that case, Mr. Cruz leads with $14 million to Mr. Rubio\u2019s $12 million and Mr. Bush\u2019s $11 million.\nRemember when each announced he would run for president, since FEC rules don\u2019t allow campaign fundraising until the candidate is officially in the race. Mr. Cruz declared on\u00a0March 23, Mr. Rubio on\u00a0April 13, and Mr. Bush on\u00a0June 15. So Mr. Bush raised almost as much for his campaign in two weeks as Messrs. Cruz and Rubio did in three or more months. Mr. Walker declared on July 13, after the quarterly reporting deadline had passed, so his totals do not include any campaign fundraising.\nBut his extensive donor list from his recall election will likely help him scramble the ranking.\nClick for Karl Rove\u2019s complete column in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nKarl Rove joined Fox News Channel (FNC) as a political contributor in February 2008.
