{"body": " John Kasich wowed \u2019em at the Shady Canyon Golf Club, the sort of elegant setting where influential establishment Republicans size up presidential candidates.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very accomplished person,\u201d said Tom Tucker, a Newport Beach real estate developer. \u201cYou have to be able to run something large and complex, and he has, and you have to make deals.\u201d \n\u201cHe\u2019s done all this stuff,\u201d added David Horowitz, state Republican finance chairman, \u201cand he cares.\u201d\nUnder the old rules, the warm response to the governor of Ohio might signal he\u2019s about to climb into the top tier of the contest for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, especially as other governors or former governors \u2013 Rick Perry of Texas and Scott Walker of Wisconsin \u2013 have dropped out and another \u2013 Jeb Bush of Florida \u2013 has failed so far to catch on.\nYet no one knows what works this year, as voters angrily send a message that they\u2019re tired of politics and politicians as usual. Three outsiders who have never held elective office \u2013 real estate mogul Donald Trump, former business executive Carly Fiorina and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson \u2013 dominate Republican polls.\nFar behind are the candidates with the government records who logically would seize the spotlight as voters start zeroing in on the race. Bush has more money but is stuck in single digits. Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas are fresh under-50 up-and-comers, but they have gotten little traction.\nKasich, 63, would seem a logical serious contender. He offers a strong resume, popularity in a pivotal state and a down-to-earth personality that few of his Republican rivals can match. And he\u2019s a good fit with the center-right Republicans whose ranks have produced party presidential nominees since 1988.\n\n10.3% Kasich\u2019s showing in latest RealClearPolitics average of New Hampshire polls. He\u2019s third behind Donald Trump and Ben Carson.\nKasich is held back by the very quality that endears him so to the insider political community: his resume.\nHe accepted federal money to expand the Medicaid program for lower-income people, a feature of Obamacare that most Republicans loathe. He\u2019s urged a path to legal status for some undocumented immigrants. As House Budget Committee chairman in 1997, Kasich was an architect of the bipartisan balanced budget agreement that helped create years of federal surpluses, and he has argued against a 2015 government shutdown.\nAt the golf club, Kasich spoke to members of New Majority, a conservative group focused on fiscal issues, not social issues.\nHis message was clear: I\u2019m a conservative who seeks solutions and will work with anyone to find them. Kasich\u2019s practical talk makes grassroots conservatives seethe.\n\u201cThe base is looking for a candidate capable of attacking Democrats,\u201d said Mark Meckler, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots.\n\nYou can\u2019t win without that base. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019d have that. Hogan Gidley, Mike Huckabee adviser, discussing John Kasich\nKasich insists he\u2019s a true conservative. \u201cI don\u2019t think my positions are moderate. They\u2019re conservative,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThey\u2019re practical.\u201d\nEDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM\nBeing practical, and candid, can also be a liability in a crowded Republican field where most of the candidates are barely known.\nAt the golf club, speaking without notes, Kasich said, \u201cI look at our friends in the Latino community as people that ought to be voting Republican. . . . They are great, caring, hardworking folks. And a lot of them do jobs that they\u2019re willing to do. That\u2019s why in the hotel you leave a little tip, you know?\u201d\nThat drew criticism from some Hispanic rights groups. Kasich clarified his comments three days later, saying, \u201cFrom top to bottom, Hispanics play a critical role in America, not only today, but going forward.\u201d\nEDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM\nBy the rules that have governed presidential nominating contests for years, Kasich sees a huge opportunity\n\u201cThere\u2019s now only one Midwestern governor left in the race,\u201d said spokesman Chris Schrimpf. Kasich\u2019s Ohio record \u201cwill play well throughout the Midwest, and it\u2019s the kind of record that voters nationally ultimately want to see in the White House.\u201d\nHe\u2019s got an opening. The center-right is unenthusiastic about Bush, and it wants Fiorina and Rubio to show the gravitas and depth demanded of would-be presidents. Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, has been stuck in low single digits in most polls. In the latest Monmouth University New Hampshire poll, taken earlier this month, Trump led Kasich among moderates, 29 percent to 19 percent.\nKasich hopes to break through in the New Hampshire, which conducts the nation\u2019s first primary Feb. 9. It could happen, but the fuzzy rules of how to succeed in 2016 politics make his fate unpredictable.\n\u201cThe race is way too fluid,\u201d said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center.\nDavid Lightman: 202-383-6101, @lightmandavid", "byline": "", "description": "Resume includes Washington, state experience\nHopes to do well in New Hampshire\nVoters signal they want outsiders\n\u2026\nClick to Continue \u00bb", "title": "Good news, bad news: GOP establishment likes Kasich", "url": "http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article36270648.html", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["David Horowitz", "Hogan Gidley", "Mark Meckler", "Chris Christie", "Jeb Bush", "Rick Perry", "Andrew Smith", "John Kasich", "Donald Trump", "Marco Rubio", "Mike Huckabee", "Chris Schrimpf", "David Lightman", "Ben Carson", "Carly Fiorina", "Scott Walker", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": ["University of New Hampshire Survey Center", "Tea Party Patriots", "House Budget Committee", "Medicaid", "GOP"], "authors": [{"author_id": 33909, "fullname": "david lightman", "primary_org": "mcclatchy"}], "date_written": "2015-09-24 09:00:00", "org": "mcclatchy", "article_id": "5c1e98a1e8a8ed8a6699f44e90dadfb2", "date_access": "2015-09-24 12:03:11.223666"}
