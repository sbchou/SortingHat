{"body": "(Note: We\u2019ll be on vacation next week, returning Monday, Aug. 31.)   \u201cWhat\u2019s Vice President Joe Biden up to?\u201d asks Bloomberg View\u2019s Jonathan Bernstein, who answers: \u201cHe appears to be inventing a new form of presidential campaigning: The perpetual trial balloon\u201d:\nWe\u2019re not sure about that. Last month we noted a Puffington Host report that was fairly specific about a deadline: \u201cBiden is still very much considering a bid for the White House, people close to Biden say, and will make a final decision at the end of the summer, targeted for September.\u201d\nAnd while it\u2019s true such a late start would have its disadvantages, it\u2019s not as if Democrats have a lot of alternatives. For that the vice president can thank Hillary Clinton, who mostly cleared the field so as to make herself the inevitable nominee.\n\u201cMost likely, nothing will shake [Mrs.] Clinton\u2019s hold on the nomination,\u201d Bernstein insists\u2014though he acknowledges \u201cthere\u2019s always a chance that something could\u2014scandal, health or some unforeseeable circumstance.\u201d Hmm, what could that possibly be? In a footnote, Bernstein dismisses the obvious answer:\nSeems to us that\u2019s putting the cart before the horse, if you\u2019ll forgive the clich\u00e9. Surely the pols who\u2019ve already endorsed Mrs. Clinton are now a lagging indicator; we\u2019d have rewritten the footnote\u2019s concluding sentence as follows: \u201cWatch the high-profile politicians who have endorsed her; if one expresses major doubts, the nomination politics has changed.\u201d\nAt any rate, there is reason for worry in a new Quinnipiac swing-state poll. In Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, the survey tested Mrs. Clinton and Biden (as well as Bernie Sanders) in general-election match-ups against Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Donald Trump.\nThe poll\u2019s biggest loser is Scott Walker, who wasn\u2019t even included in the general-election match-ups\u2014unlike in previous polls of the three states in March and June and of three others (Colorado, Iowa and Virginia) in July. Several other GOP contenders were also dropped between June and July, presumably because it would be unwieldy to test so many of them while adding Biden and Sanders. But the new poll swaps Walker out for Trump. It also finds the Wisconsin governor languishing in the mid-single-digits among primary preferences of the three states\u2019 Republicans.\nMrs. Clinton is doing considerably worse against the two Florida Republicans than in either of the preceding polls. Her only lead is against Bush in Ohio.\nShe trailed Bush by three points in Florida in March (42% to 45%), led him by four in June (46% to 42%) and trails him by 11 now (38% to 49%). In Ohio the decline came earlier: She led by nine in March (47% to 38%) and one in June (42% to 41%) and leads by two now (41% to 39%). In Pennsylvania, she led by six in March (46% to 40%) and four in June (45% to 41%) and trails by three now (40% to 43%).\nAgainst Rubio in Florida, she led by two in March (46% to 44%) and three in June (47% to 44%) and trails by 12 now (39% to 51%). In Ohio she led by nine in March (47% to 38%) and three in June (45% to 42%) and trails by two now (40% to 42%). In Pennsylvania she led by four in March (46% to 42%), trailed by one in June (43% to 44%) and trails by seven now (40% to 47%).\nAs for Trump, she trails even him in Florida, by two points (41% to 43%) but leads by five in both Ohio (43% to 38%) and Pennsylvania (45% to 40%).\nBiden outperforms Mrs. Clinton in eight of the nine match-ups. The lone exception is in Florida, where the vice president trails Bush by 13 points (38% to 51%). But he leads Bush by three in Ohio (42% to 39%) and trails him by only one in Pennsylvania (42% to 43%). Against Rubio, Biden trails by six in Florida (42% to 48%), leads by one in Ohio (42% to 41%) and trails by three in Pennsylvania (41% to 44%). And Biden leads Trump in all three states: by three in Florida (45% to 42%), 10 in Ohio (48% to 38%) and eight in Pennsylvania (48% to 40%).\nThe March and June polls didn\u2019t test Biden, but in the July poll of Colorado, Iowa and Virginia the advantage was hers. As we noted at the time, the inevitable nominee and the vice president trailed Rubio by equal margins in Iowa, but she fared better than him in the other eight match-ups (which included Walker but not Trump).\n\u201cI had to come out because of all the foolishness going on,\u201d groused longtime Clinton surrogate James Carville in an NBC interview Wednesday, reported by the Washington Examiner. \u201cOf course there\u2019s not a full-scale Democratic freakout. .\u00a0.\u00a0. Polls go up and down.\u201d\nThat they do, but it\u2019s been a while since Mrs. Clinton\u2019s have gone up. It seems reasonable to assume the metastasizing email scandal is the primary reason why. On that subject, Carville sounds like a high-sodium version of Bernstein:\nFine? You mean like for violating the law?\nAnd the story continues to develop. A Reuters report yesterday further undermines Mrs. Clinton\u2019s claim that she did not traffic in classified material. The State Department, as Reuters notes, has stressed that many of the emails have been newly stamped classified, which does not necessarily mean they were classified at the time they were sent and received:\nAnd a McClatchy Washington Bureau report suggests the State Department lacked the ability or will to do anything to safeguard the security of that information:\nWas Mrs. Clinton\u2019s system hacked by spies for hostile powers, either during or after her tenure as secretary of state? Did her lawyers delete any classified material\u2014perhaps unintentionally\u2014before scrubbing the server? If the FBI can recover its contents, perhaps we\u2019ll find out. If not, we\u2019ll never know. In any case, it\u2019s difficult to see how the continuing investigation could yield any information helpful to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s political case.\nAre Democrats really quite as unworried as Bernstein and Carville think? That question brings us back to the vice president. On Aug.\u00a05 the New York Times ran a front-page story titled \u201cFriends of Joe Biden Worry a Run for President Could Bruise His Legacy\u201d: \u201cThey fret that Mr. Biden, as well known for his undisciplined, sometimes self-immolating comments as he is for his charm on the trail, could endanger Mr. Obama\u2019s own legacy by injuring Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy and causing his party to lose control of the White House.\u201d Example:\nSo they communicate it anonymously via the New York Times. Some friends!\nA reader who sent us the piece at the time remarked: \u201cOne could of course say the exact same things about Mrs. Clinton running.\u201d (Well, except for the bit about charm.) And now they are saying it. \u201cSome of her supporters are looking to her to provide clarity\u2014and less irritation with the topic,\u201d the Times\u2019s Maggie Haberman wrote in a brief online squib yesterday. \u201cMrs. Clinton has said that no voters question her about her email practices. She has held few spontaneous events, providing limited opportunity for it to come up. But among her supporters, the questions have lingered.\u201d\nThe Haberman item is odd; we\u2019ve quoted the entire substance of it, which is to say she doesn\u2019t provide any examples. But Politico does, in a Wednesday piece by Annie Karni titled \u201cAllies Fault Hillary Clinton\u2019s Response on Emails\u201d:\nIf the piece about Biden\u2019s friends was meant to warn him against challenging Mrs. Clinton, the piece about her allies may provide him some encouragement.\nTwo Former Enron Advisers in One!\nTwo Writers in One!\nFox Butterfield, Is That You?\nOut on a Limb   \u201c\u00a0\u2018In politics, particularly presidential races, my oft repeated mantra is the UFO rule.
