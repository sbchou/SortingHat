{"body": "   FERGUSON, MO - MARCH 4: A Ferguson police officer stands on watch as protesters demonstrate outside the Ferguson Police Department in Ferguson, Missouri on March 4, 2015.  The mayor of Ferguson, Mo. said Wednesday morning that Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump is wrong when he says that city, which became a symbol of racial unrest after the police shooting of Michael Brown last year, is besieged by criminal illegal immigrants. \"He's never been here, as far as I know,\" said\u00a0James Knowles, a Republican who has been mayor of Ferguson since 2011, during an interview with Fox2 in St. Louis.  James Knowles has never seen any roving violent gangs of illegal immigrants himself in #Ferguson. pic.twitter.com/a5BpSfVT4B \u2014 TC (@tchop_stl) August 26, 2015 Trump, during a campaign stop in Iowa on Tuesday, repeated a line he has used before when discussing illegal immigration, in which he claims\u00a0Ferguson, a 21,000-person, majority black city, is plagued by gangs of violent illegal immigrants.\u00a0 \"You know, a lot of the gangs that you see in Baltimore and in St. Louis and in Ferguson and Chicago, you know they\u2019re illegal immigrants,\" Trump declared on Tuesday. \"They\u2019re here illegally. And they\u2019re rough dudes. Rough people. \u00a0They\u2019re going to be gone so fast if I win that your head will spin.\" \u00a0\u00a0 The real estate developer's surging presidential campaign has forced the issue of illegal immigration to the forefront of the GOP\u00a0primary.\u00a0 Both Ferguson and Baltimore experienced racial unrest this year and last following the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of police that prompted national outrage. In both cities, those incidents sparked massive protests, angry residents faced off with police officers, and businesses were vandalized, looted, and in some cases burned to the ground. But Knowles, who successfully weathered calls for his resignation after Michael Brown's death last August, said that Trump's suggestion that Ferguson -- a St. Louis suburb with little violent crime and a statistically insignificant immigrant population -- has a problem with crime committed by illegal immigrants is off-base. \u201cI\u2019m assuming that Donald Trump is saying that from his extensive experience in St. Louis and in Ferguson,\" Knowles said, sarcastically. \"I\u2019ve never seen any roving bands of illegal immigrants or gangs in Ferguson. \u00a0I think he\u2019s just trying to find headlines and we just gave him one.\u201d", "byline": "", "description": "'He's never been here' - Ferguson mayor says of GOP frontrunner", "title": "Ferguson&#8217;s GOP mayor to Trump: You&#8217;re wrong \u2014 there are no &#8216;roving bands of illegal immigrants&#8217; here", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/26/fergusons-gop-mayor-to-trump-youre-wrong-there-are-no-roving-bands-of-illegal-immigrants-here/", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Michael Brown", "James Knowles"], "orgs": ["GOP", "Mo."], "authors": [{"author_id": 31039, "fullname": "wesley lowery", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-08-26 16:31:24", "org": "washpo", "article_id": "d43fa3343a17a43dfc0258efc86c3f98", "date_access": "2015-08-26 15:50:02.979725"}
