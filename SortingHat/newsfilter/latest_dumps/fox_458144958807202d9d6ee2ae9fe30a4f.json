We see it as an encouraging sign that the American people are hungry for his candidacy,\u201d Draft Biden 2016 said in a statement.\u00a0\nThe developments come as Clinton struggles to ignite the Democratic base on the campaign trail. While she\u2019s still the unrivaled front-runner, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is polling competitively in key states and drawing big crowds on the trail.\n\nSanders\u2019 performance has helped stoke speculation that Biden might have a shot, should he enter.\nSchale described his new role with Draft Biden 2016 as that of an informal adviser. \u201cBasically just grabbing an oar,\u201d Schale told Fox News.\nSchale told Fox New Radio host Alan Colmes he has \u201ca strong affinity for the vice president,\u201d and said of the current primary race, \u201cthere\u2019s just not a lot of energy, and I\u2019m worried about that.\u201d\u00a0\nTwo weeks earlier, Josh Alcorn, who has worked for Biden and was working on Beau Biden\u2019s gubernatorial campaign in Delaware before he died in May, also joined Draft Biden 2016 as a senior adviser. The PAC is ramping up a social media campaign to tout the vice president\u2019s accomplishments.\nMeanwhile, the new Quinnipiac Poll showed Clinton with a comfortable lead in the Democratic field. But it showed her negative numbers rising, and Biden doing at least as well as Clinton in match-ups against Republicans.\nIn Florida, for instance, Biden was leading Donald Trump 45-42 percent, while Trump was narrowly leading Clinton. Polling in Ohio and Pennsylvania likewise showed Biden doing well.\nBiden has been on vacation in South Carolina with family, and last week it was reported he would be discussing his possible candidacy with insiders and family members -- and make a decision \u201cnext month.\u201d The New York Times reported Biden had an hour-long conversation with Richard Harpootlian, former chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, and was putting out feelers through advisers to state operatives, \u201cto determine how fast they could organize a campaign.\u201d\nThe White House has declined to take a stance. In July, spokesman Eric Schultz was asked if President Obama has encouraged or talked with Biden about him running. He said Obama \u201chas said that the best political decision he\u2019s ever made in his career has been to ask Joe Biden to run as his vice president.\u201d\nOn Monday, however, a \u201cwell-placed source\u201d in the White House told CNN the administration was already quite invested in Clinton\u2019s success as a candidate. \u00a0\nWhether or not the White House is on board, there is space for Biden in the primary field, thanks to Clinton\u2019s worsening poll numbers and a general sense of restiveness among the voters for something new, said Tom Whalen, an assistant professor of social science and political author at Boston University.\n\u201c[Hillary\u2019s] personal ratings in likeability and trust are falling faster than Red Sox pennant hopes in August,\u201d he told FoxNews.com. \u201cIt\u2019s very bleak, and I think Biden would have a good shot. I think voters are open to an alternative.\u201d\nWhether Biden fits the bill remains to be seen, said former Democratic strategist Dan Gerstein, who warns polling is still volatile right now, and candidates tend to do better when they are operating from a safe distance, off the trail.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to take the slings and arrows and prove their salt on the campaign trail,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Hillary was secretary of state, her [popularity] was at rock star levels. As soon as she got into the campaign, and had to start talking like a candidate \u2026 her numbers dropped.\u201d\n\u201cPlus,\u201d he added, \u201cBiden comes in with weaknesses of his own. He has run for president twice (\u201988 and \u201808) and with very bad results. This romanticized version of him now \u2026 once he is back on the campaign trial, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\nBiden is known for his frequent gaffes. Yet, given the acceptance of Trump\u2019s candor on the other side, it seems voters are more forgiving these days, Whalen said.\nHe said Biden\u2019s tragic personal life \u2013 he lost his son Beau to cancer; his first wife and daughter were killed in a car crash in 1972 \u2013 has resonated.\n\u201cWhen you are talking about presidential politics, you are talking personal narrative,\u201d said Whalen. \u201cI think he has a bond with the American people that can\u2019t be underestimated.\u201d\nFox News\u2019 Serafin Gomez contributed to this report.", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Biden buzz grows amid new polling, &lsquo;draft&rsquo; movement picks up key adviser  - Latino groups warn Trump's immigration rhetoric could inspire more hate crimes - COMPLETE CAMPAIGN 2016 COVERAGE", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/21/biden-buzz-grows-amid-new-polling-draft-movement-picks-up-key-adviser/", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "immigration"], "people": ["Joe Biden", "Steve Schale", "Dan Gerstein", "Josh Alcorn", "Beau Biden", "Hillary Clinton", "Donald Trump", "Serafin Gomez", "Tom Whalen", "Eric Schultz", "Bernie Sanders", "Richard Harpootlian", "Alan Colmes"], "orgs": ["South Carolina Democratic Party", "Boston University", "PAC", "Red Sox", "Quinnipiac Poll"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-08-21 23:01:35", "org": "fox", "article_id": "458144958807202d9d6ee2ae9fe30a4f", "date_access": "2015-08-21 22:30:04.466769"}
