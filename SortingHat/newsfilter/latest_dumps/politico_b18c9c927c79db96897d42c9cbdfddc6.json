(Just posted by Eli Stokols: \u201cWalker struggles for the Iowa prize: The Wisconsin governor is suddenly in trouble after leading in the polls here for months.)\u201d http://politi.co/1hhZGtC\n* Trump might have a 25 percent ceiling. But for now, he also appears to have a 25 percent floor. Which in fielded this crowded means ... winning. http://wapo.st/1MtgZmZ\n* Rubio, who shows flashes of strength, plans to sit back and watch until the insurgent fireworks show ends. That could be a while. http://nyti.ms/1WxRBkF\n* The media loves Kasich.

I also encourage you to read this very different take by a current Amazonian [link]. Here\u2019s why I\u2019m writing you. The NYT article prominently features anecdotes describing shockingly callous management practices, including people being treated without empathy while enduring family tragedies and serious health problems.\n\u201cThe article doesn\u2019t describe the Amazon I know ... But if you know of any stories like those reported, I want you to escalate to HR. You can also email me directly at jeff@amazon.com. Even if it\u2019s rare or isolated, our tolerance for any such lack of empathy needs to be zero. ... I don\u2019t think any company adopting the approach portrayed could survive, much less thrive, in today\u2019s highly competitive tech hiring market. ...\n\u201cI strongly believe that anyone working in a company that really is like the one described in the NYT would be crazy to stay. I know I would leave such a company. But hopefully, you don't recognize the company described. Hopefully, you\u2019re having fun working with a bunch of brilliant teammates, helping invent the future, and laughing along the way.

We have millions of people who are struggling to keep their heads above water, who want to know what candidates can do to improve their lives, and the media will very often spend more time worrying about hair than the fact that we\u2019re the only major country on earth that doesn\u2019t guarantee health care to all people.\u201d http://nyti.ms/1gOmdNS\nINSTAGRAM DU JOUR --\u00a0@georgewbush:\u00a0\u201c@laurawbush and I were overjoyed to meet our second grandchild [Saturday]. ...\u00a0\u00a0We are grateful to God -- and to @jennabhager and Henry -- for this beautiful, healthy gift of life.\u201d\u00a0http://bit.ly/1hHyzZ0\nFOURTH QUARTER \u2013 N.Y.
