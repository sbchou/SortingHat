She\u2019s been there enough that she knows these are tough calls,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI think Hillary Clinton would be the first to say that when you\u2019re sitting in the seat that I\u2019m sitting in in the situation room things look a little bit different \u2013 because she\u2019s been right there, next to me.\u201d\nBut when asked if it was too late for Vice President Joe Biden to jump into the race, Obama remained positive about his right-hand man but non-specific. \n\u201cI love Joe Biden and he\u2019s got his own decision to make and I\u2019ll leave it at that,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the meantime, he\u2019s doing a great job as vice president and has been really helpful on a whole bunch of issues.\u201d \n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "With Biden weighing a run, the president works to remain even-handed.", "title": "Obama treads lightly between Hillary and Joe", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/barack-obama-treads-lightly-president-hillary-clinton-joe-biden-214395", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "personality"], "people": ["Allie Grasgreen Ciaramella", "Joe Pompeo", "Kim Davis", "Kenneth P.
