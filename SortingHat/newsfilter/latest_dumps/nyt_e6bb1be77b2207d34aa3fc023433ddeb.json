{"body": "WASHINGTON \u2014  When President Obama addressed members of the Democratic National Committee here over the weekend, he offered a glowing account of the economic recovery under his administration.\n\n\u201cAmerica is coming back,\u201d he said after rattling off an array of upbeat economic indicators. \u201cWe\u2019ve risen from recession.\u201d\n\nBut as both parties begin positioning themselves for the election to succeed Mr. Obama, the politics of the economy are far more complicated than the president would have them. Among Democrats, there are divisions over the degree to which Hillary Rodham Clinton, considered their leading contender, should praise the recovery and run on Mr. Obama\u2019s stewardship of the economy. And Republicans \u2014 assessing falling unemployment and soaring job creation under a president with still-mediocre approval ratings \u2014 are grasping for the right way to frame their 2016 campaign message.\n\nThe coming debate over the economy, and by extension Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy, is a particularly acute topic for governors, who are often judged by voters on their states\u2019 economic performance and who spend much of their time on job creation. As the governors gathered here for their annual winter meeting, there was bipartisan optimism about the economy, but it was guarded.\n\n\u201cIn many parts of the country, we are seeing increasing momentum in terms of recovery, but in almost every state, and certainly in parts of Colorado, we are still struggling to get the unemployment down,\u201d Gov. John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado said, \u201cand most importantly the wages still haven\u2019t started rising.\u201d\n\nColorado\u2019s unemployment rate was down to 4 percent in December, below the national average, which was 5.7 percent in January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But Mr. Hickenlooper\u2019s sober analysis suggests an awareness that voters are not yet enjoying a boon and certainly are not yet fully crediting Mr. Obama for the recovery.\n\nIndeed, a Quinnipiac University poll in Colorado, a crucial swing state, released last week indicated that 58 percent of voters said they wanted the next president to \u201cchange direction from Barack Obama\u2019s policies,\u201d and the president\u2019s job approval rating was only 43 percent. Perhaps mindful of such data, Mr. Hickenlooper, a Democrat, indicated that Mrs. Clinton could not run simply on the recent good economic news.\n\n\u201cI am not saying who the candidate is going to be, but I don\u2019t think she will come with, \u2018Everything is fine, everything is going well,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cI suspect that she will come forward with some new ideas and some innovative ideas on how we can begin to move wages up and how we can help businesses expand more rapidly and create more jobs.\u201d\n\nYet in another important state on the presidential map, the Democratic governor said Mrs. Clinton should not be shy about linking herself to Mr. Obama\u2019s record.\n\n\u201cShe should embrace the Obama economic policies that have moved the country forward, absolutely,\u201d said the governor, Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, a close friend of both Mrs. Clinton\u2019s and former President Bill Clinton\u2019s. \u201cGo through the numbers, look where we are today. Things are booming.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. McAuliffe was quick to add that Mr. Obama could make it easier for Mrs. Clinton to offer that embrace if his administration was more effective in trumpeting the recovery.\n\n\u201cI think they need to do a much better job of explaining their successes,\u201d said Mr. McAuliffe, who was the chairman of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nWhat most of the governors, in both parties, agreed on was that longstanding wage stagnation was diminishing the political impact of the recovery.\n\n\u201cWe still have a wage problem. We are still creating too many low-wage, not family-supporting, jobs,\u201d said Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island, a Democrat who was elected last year in a state that was among the hardest hit by the recession.\n\nMs. Raimondo, whose state has a 6.8 percent unemployment rate, added: \u201cSo there is a lot of work to do. She has a wage problem that she has to fix.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s structural economic challenges \u2014 whether wages, diminished manufacturing or other challenges associated with globalization \u2014 are such that Mrs. Clinton must come up with her own agenda, Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, another Democrat, said.\n\n\u201cI think it would be a mistake for somebody to be running on \u2018It\u2019s great guns; we just have to keep doing what we\u2019re doing,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Markell said. \u201cIt ought to be, \u2018In a changing world, here are the things we need to do differently.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n\nEarly signs suggest that Mrs. Clinton intends to offer proposals that would move beyond Mr. Obama\u2019s ideas \u2014 notably a plan to offer incentives to corporations that increase profit-sharing with employees.\n\nIf Democrats are grappling with how best to hail the resurgent economy while acknowledging its underlying difficulties, Republicans are engaged in a conversation over whether they should remain critical of the recovery, claim a share of credit for it or move on to different issues.\n\nMany of the Republican governors from states where economic improvement has been significant on their watch are uneasy about their nominee\u2019s continuing to bad-mouth the economy. Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, where unemployment is down to 4.1 percent, said Republican presidential candidates should point to job growth in Republican-led states.\n\n\u201cTake some credit for what Republican governors have done, because the recipe to revitalize the national economy is to do the same thing,\u201d Mr. Branstad said\n\nHe also suggested that Republicans ought to focus on national security, an issue on which Mr. Obama may prove to be more vulnerable than the economy.", "byline": "By JONATHAN MARTIN", "description": "Democrats disagree about whether their presidential nominee should promote the rebound, and Republicans grasp in several directions for the right message.", "title": "Political Memo: Economic Recovery Under Obama Creates Quandaries for 2016 Race", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/23/us/politics/economic-recovery-under-obama-creates-quandaries-for-2016-race.html", "topics": ["economy"], "people": ["Gina Raimondo", "Jack Markell", "Bill Clinton", "Terry Mcauliffe", "Terry E.
