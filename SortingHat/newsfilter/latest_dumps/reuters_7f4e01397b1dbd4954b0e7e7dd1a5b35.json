{"body": "WASHINGTON Democrat Hillary Clinton is attempting to rally her supporters and stoke outrage with a new television advertisement that criticizes Republican remarks on investigations into the September 2011 attack in Benghazi that killed four Americans. \nThe ad attempts to pivot away from discussions about her response to the attack of the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, just weeks before she is slated to testify before the committee on Oct. 22. \nThe ad, which will air across the United States on cable television, begins by showing California Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who is considered by many likely to be the next Speaker of the House, arguing that the House Benghazi Committee should be considered an accomplishment because it succeeded in lowering Clinton\u2019s poll numbers in her race for the White House. \nMcCarthy's remarks quickly drew criticism from Democrats who said he had revealed the investigation was purely political.\nThe ad points out that the committee cost taxpayers $4.5 million. \n\u201cThe Republicans have spent millions attacking Hillary because she\u2019s fighting for everything they oppose, from affordable healthcare to equal pay,\u201d a voice in the ad says. \u201cShe\u2019ll never stop fighting for you, and the Republicans know it.\u201d \nClinton - who was secretary of state at the time of the attacks - is trying to make the case that the coming Republican inquiry is not about the actual attacks but about trying to smear her politically as she seeks to represent her party in the November 2016 elections.\n\u201cLook at the situation they chose to exploit, to go after me for political reasons: the death of four Americans in Benghazi,\u201d Clinton said in a town hall meeting in New Hampshire on Monday. She called the panel a \u201cpolitical, partisan committee for the sole purpose of going after me, not trying to make our diplomats who serve in dangerous areas safer.\u201d\nThe House Benghazi Committee was established in 2014, after eight congressional investigations were conducted. The House committee has largely focused on Clinton\u2019s response to the attacks, which killed four Americans including Ambassador Chris Stevens. The committee expanded its inquiry and is now simultaneously investigating Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state.\nFor more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, \u201cTales from the Trail\u201d (here).\n\n (Reporting by Ginger Gibson; Editing by Ken Wills)", "byline": "", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton is attempting to rally her supporters and stoke outrage with a new television advertisement that criticizes Republican remarks on investigations into the September 2011 attack in Benghazi that killed four Americans.", "title": "Clinton TV ad rallies supporters on Benghazi investigation", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/1l_KUprYWTQ/story01.htm", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "personality"], "people": ["Chris Stevens", "Ken Wills", "Hillary Clinton", "Ginger Gibson"], "orgs": ["Trail", "House Benghazi Committee"], "authors": [{"author_id": 39032, "fullname": "ginger gibson", "primary_org": "reuters"}], "date_written": "2015-10-06 03:10:24", "org": "reuters", "article_id": "7f4e01397b1dbd4954b0e7e7dd1a5b35", "date_access": "2015-10-06 02:34:23.164265"}
