Here are his seven most quotable lines from the second Republican debate.\n1. First words: \u201cI\u2019m Donald Trump. I wrote the art of the deal. I say not in a braggadocious way. I\u2019ve made billions and billions of dollars.\u201d \n2. Asked to respond to Carly Fiorina: \u201cFirst of all, Rand Paul shouldn\u2019t even be on this stage. He\u2019s number 11.\u201d\n3. On himself: \u201cBelieve me. My temperament is very good, very calm.\u201d\n4. On Paul: \u201cI never attacked him on his looks, and believe me there\u2019s plenty of subject matter right there.\u201d\n5. On George Pataki: \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be elected dog-catcher right now.\u201d\n6. On his multiple bankruptcies: \u201cPeople are very, very, impressed with what I\u2019ve done. The business people.\u201d\n7. A left-handed compliment to Jeb Bush: \u201cMore energy tonight. I like that.\u201d\nBen Schreckinger is a reporter for Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Trump's most memorable debate lines", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/gop-debate-donald-trump-213735", "topics": ["personality", "economy"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Jules Witcover", "Rachael Bade", "Hadas Gold", "William Evanina", "Joseph Marks", "Noah Weiland", "Theodoric Meyer", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Xi Jinping", "Matt Friedman", "Katie Glueck", "Nick Gass", "Rick Santorum", "Daniel Lippman", "Jeb Bush", "Seung Min Kim", "Donald Trump", "Todd S.
