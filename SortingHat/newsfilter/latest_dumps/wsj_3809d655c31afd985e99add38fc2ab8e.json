{"body": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s recent poll troubles have \u201cled to another bout of a contagious pundit malady,\u201d observes David Weigel, who recently rejoined the Washington Post. \u201cThat would be Bidenmania.\u201d Not to be confused with Beatlemania.\nTo be sure, Weigel overstates the contagion. \u201cOn CNN, Chris Cuomo and Jeff Zeleny took turns asking whether Vice President Joe Biden would be tempted to enter the race,\u201d he notes. He also cites tweets from NBC\u2019s Luke Russert and the Washington Free Beacon\u2019s Andrew Stiles\u2014a total of four pundits.\nMake that three. As Breitbart.com\u2019s Pam Key notes, Cuomo\u2014whose elder brother, the governor of New York, has occasionally been mentioned as a prospective presidential aspirant\u2014yesterday posed a question that confirmed the \u201cBidenmania\u201d premise: \u201cZeleny, what do you think of the fact that trustworthiness looms large for Hillary Clinton and that is the exact strength that a candidate named Biden would have?\u201d\nBut Zeleny threw cold water on the idea: \u201cChris, we still do not think\u2014have no reason to believe that Joe Biden or any other Democrat is going to ride to the rescue here. It is likely going to be the field as we have it right now.\u201d On the other hand, Biden has run for president before, in 1988 and 2008, and the Puffington Host reported last week that he \u201cis still very much considering a bid for the White House, people close to Biden say, and will make a final decision at the end of the summer, targeted for September.\u201d\nCarrying several bucketfuls of cold water is Weigel, who was himself born in Delaware while Biden was still the First State\u2019s junior senator. He notes that the Quinnipiac poll that set off the supposed Bidenmania contagion\u2014and that we discussed yesterday\u2014in many ways looks even worse for Biden than for Mrs. Clinton.\nThat last statement isn\u2019t quite right. As Weigel shows in an interactive bar chart, Iowa is the only state in which Biden does as well as Mrs. Clinton in one of the match-ups, with both trailing Rubio by eight points.\nBut on the whole, he\u2019s right. \u201cHow can Joe Biden, the avuncular Irish-American pol whose antics have become inspirations for The Onion and Saturday Night Live, not be popular?\u201d he asks, then answers:\nBiden also is at a disadvantage when it comes to identity politics: \u201cIt has been 19 years since Democrats won a presidential election with a white male candidate,\u201d notes Weigel, also white and male. And \u201cthe brightest spot\u201d for the vice president \u201cis actually a Clinton weakness\u201d: \u201cfewer voters say that she \u2018cares about people like you.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nActually, that\u2019s the second brightest spot\u2014dimmer than the question of whether the candidate is \u201chonest and trustworthy.\u201d (Biden: 48% yes to 45% no in Colorado, 51% to 36% in Iowa, 58% to 35% in Virginia; Mrs. Clinton: 34% to 52%, 33% to 59% and 39% to 55% in the three states respectively.)\nOn the \u201ccares about people like you\u201d question Biden\u2019s advantage over Mrs. Clinton is smaller than we\u2019d have expected: six points in Colorado, nine in Iowa and 10 in Virginia. Only in the Old Dominion did a majority (55%) answer the question affirmatively about Biden; in the Centennial State 49% answered \u201cno\u201d and only 45% \u201cyes.\u201d Mrs. Clinton does better than Biden in the category of \u201cstrong leadership qualities.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why journalists covering the Democratic campaign would hope for a Biden candidacy. His bonhomie would provide a refreshing respite from the distant Mrs. Clinton and the severe Bernie Sanders. For a sense of the frustration occasioned by her aloofness, consider this plea from Bloomberg columnist Francis Wilkinson:\nWe can\u2019t quite tell if Wilkinson is serious. The bit about \u201cecstatic boredom\u201d seems like a joke; and the way he frames the idea, it comes close to being a proposal that reporters surrender their independence and agree to function as campaign operatives. Would any self-respecting journalist do that?\nWell, some might. The Washington Examiner notes a curious comment from Andrew Rosenthal, editorial page editor of the New York Times:\nGranted, Rosenthal has a point about the third-degree navel-gazing (now fifth-degree by virtue of our writing about his talking about it). But it is quite a leap to say that because it\u2019s tedious when the press talks about the press talking about the press, a politician\u2019s avoiding the press is not \u201can issue.\u201d \nAs for Wilkinson\u2019s suggested arrangement between Mrs. Clinton and reporters, it\u2019s not clear it would be as advantageous to her as it would be disadvantageous to them. Part of \u201csetting her own agenda\u201d consists in avoiding politically difficult policy questions, such as where she now stands on the Trans Pacific Partnership or the 2011 decision to intervene in Libya. She has every reason to continue stonewalling, leaving reporters who cover the Democrats lonely for Joe Biden\u2014or envious of their colleagues who (for the moment at least) get to cover Donald Trump.\n  Fox Butterfield, Is That You?   \u201cGold might have lost 40 percent of its price over the last four years, capping a stellar 10-year bull run, but analysts are already predicting a possible bottom for the precious metal.\u201d\u2014Matt Clinch, CNBC.com, July\u00a023\n  Out on a Limb   \u201cAlmond Milk Is Even More of a Scam Than We Thought\u201d\u2014headline, Salon, July\u00a022\n  The Ghost and Mr. Chicken   \u201cCasper Chicken Ordinance Continues to Move Forward\u201d\u2014headline, KCWY-TV website (Casper, Wyo.), July\u00a021\n  Psycho Killer\u00a0/ Qu\u2019est-Ce Que C\u2019est   \u201cESPN Dumps Talking Heads for Moving Bodies\u201d\u2014headline, Bloomberg, July\u00a020\n  The Lonely Lives of Scientists   \u201cScientist Warns the World to \u2018Think Twice Before Replying to Alien Signals From Outer Space\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014headline, Independent (London), July\u00a023\n  Hey, Kids!
