Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley. Clinton\u2019s challenge will be to keep the focus on issues and off her email, Benghazi or any other problematic stories. But even on issues she will have a hard time with Sanders and O\u2019Malley both hammering her from the left, especially on Wall Street issues. Both will likely press Clinton on why she won\u2019t bush for breaking up big banks and reinstating Glass-Steagall. \nThe former secretary of state has some good nuanced answers but nuance is tough to sell when it comes to slamming the \u201cbanksters.\u201d Clinton will also have to explain how she so nakedly flip-flopped on trade with her newfound opposition to TPP. She will likely talk about the lack of tougher currency provisions and \u201cgiveaways\u201d to big drug companies. But on both issues, the deal has not gotten worse since she called it the \u201cgold standard\u201d of trade deals and a key pillar of economic growth. Will she come out looking even more malleable on key issues or erase Democratic doubts and remind voters of her potentially history-making campaign? Should be good TV. \nStory Continued Below\nWHY YOU SHOULD BE SCARED \u2014 It\u2019s not clear if he will even run. But conservative Republicans are already saying they wouldn\u2019t support House Ways and Means Chair Paul Ryan for Speaker if he does. Because Ryan is not a fan of threatening economic chaos to attempt to force fiscal changes that Democrats will never accept. \nVia Bloomberg\u2019s Sahil Kapur: \u201cThe struggle between House Republican pragmatists and the 35-40 hardliners in the House Freedom Caucus is not about ideology \u2014 it's about tactics. Ryan has not advocated using the scorched-earth tactics the hard right embraces, such as permitting a government shutdown or debt default in pursuit of advancing the conservative agenda.\u201d http://bloom.bg/1Lfua7p\nOBAMA ON TRUMP: NOT GONNA WIN \u2014 President Barack Obama on CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes: \u201cHe is a great publicity-seeker - and at a time when the Republican Party hasn't really figured out what it's for as opposed to what it's against \u2026 I think there is genuine anti-immigrant sentiment in the large portion of at least Republican primary voters \u2026 He is, you know, the classic reality TV character \u2026 I don't think he'll end up being president of the United States.\"\nOBAMA ON HILLARY CLINTON\u2019S EMAIL USE: A \u201cMISTAKE\u201d \u2014 \"She made a mistake.

But he gave a cautious assessment of the outlook, saying that while many emerging market officials want the Fed to \u2018just do it\u2019 and lift rates, the US central bank had to be conscious of the risks that lay ahead. \n\u201cMarkets are putting very low odds on the Fed lifting short-term rates at its October 27-28 meeting, and Mr Fischer\u2019s words did not suggest that he is in a hurry to move this month given the uncertainties clouding the outlook. The Fed kept rates at all-time lows last month as it gauged how developments such as the sharp slowdown in China and volatile world markets could impact on the US outlook\u201d http://on.ft.com/1PoIlwb\nIS THIS TIME DIFFERENT FOR THE GOP? \u2014 WP\u2019s Dave Weigel: \u201cMuch like in Washington, where the abrupt withdrawal from the speaker\u2019s race of Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) signaled total party chaos, the view is fading that, eventually, this presidential contest will get back to normal. \u2026 Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who recently called South Carolina a \u2018lock,\u2019 is at 5.7 percent here, according to the RealClearPolitics average. That\u2019s good enough for only fifth place, 28 points behind front-runner Donald Trump and 12 behind former neurosurgeon Ben Carson. \n\u201cFour years ago, on his way to losing the state primary, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney never polled lower than 13 percent. Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), another establishment favorite who is ahead of Bush nationally and rising in recent polls, is currently even further behind in South Carolina, with a RealClearPolitics average of just 5 percent. \u2018The pattern of crowning the nominee has been broken,\u2019 said Barry Wynn, a former South Carolina GOP chairman\u201d http://wapo.st/1hyOZSH\nBIG WEEK FOR EARNINGS \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Saumya Vaishampayan and Corrie Driebusch: \u201cAs third-quarter U.S. corporate results roll out this week, many investors are putting an increased focus on profit margins as a sign of companies\u2019 ability to propel earnings higher. Profit margins \u2026 hit a record 10.5 percent for the S&P 500 in the second quarter. Margins have expanded since the financial crisis as companies cut costs, held off on updating infrastructure and borrowed at historically low rates. The upshot was several quarters of higher profits even as sales stagnated.\n\u201cMany investors now say companies don\u2019t have much excess left to wring out to boost profits. The issue has attracted increased attention as investors fret about factors that could boost costs for companies. These include pressure to pay workers more as the labor market improves and higher borrowing costs as the Federal Reserve gets closer to raising interest rates. \u2026 Sales for companies in the S&P 500 are forecast to slip 3.4 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to FactSet, after two consecutive quarters of declining revenue. Even if sales remain steady, few expect cost savings that could boost earnings\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1PoHOdz\nSANDERS: NOT A CAPITALIST \u2014 Per NBC: \u201cIn a one-on-one interview, Democratic Presidential candidate Sen.

Speaking on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Lima, Lou said developed economies were to blame for the global economic malaise because their slow recoveries were not creating enough demand. \n\u201c\u2018The United States isn't at the point of raising interest rates yet and under its global responsibilities it can't raise rates,\u2019 Lou was quoted as saying. The finance minister said the United States \u2018should assume global responsibilities\u2019 because of the dollar's status as a global currency \u2026 Asked about the global economic situation, Lou said the problem was not with developing countries. \u2018Rather, it is the continued weak recovery of developed countries\u2019 that's hindering the global economy, he said.\u201d http://reut.rs/1VN5jwK\nIMF/WORD BANK TAKEAWAYS \u2014 Mohamed A. El-Erian on Bloomberg View: \u201cThe assessment of the general context is far from reassuring. In the communique of the International Monetary and Financial Committee \u2026 officials from around the world characterized global economic growth as \u2018modest and uneven overall,\u2019 while noting increasing uncertainty and financial volatility \u2026 With the advanced economies doing slightly better than before, it is the emerging world that accounts for the major increase in downside risk\u201d \nFED FATIGUE SETS IN ABROAD \u2014 WSJ\u2019s David Harrison: \u201cTalk of the Federal Reserve\u2019s first rate increase in almost a decade tends to send many investors into a frenzy. For the world\u2019s central bankers, it is increasingly likely to elicit sighs of resignation. Fed fatigue has enveloped emerging-market officials facing repeated bouts of volatility in their currencies and capital flows alongside mounting worries about debt. Some policy makers, gripped by the uncertainty, delivered a message to their American counterparts as officials gathered in the Peruvian capital for the International Monetary Fund\u2019s annual meeting: Please stop dithering.\n\u201c\u2018Delaying the increase would not solve the situation,\u2019 said Sukhdave Singh, deputy governor of Bank Negara Malaysia. \u2018If it is a case that the emerging markets have taken on too much debt, there will be a day of reckoning. Delaying an interest-rate hike does not necessarily address that issue.\u2019 Fed fears have consumed emerging economies for the past two years after an unprecedented stretch of U.S. monetary stimulus. But many officials at the IMF meeting, which ended Sunday, said they would prefer certainty now over the prolonged agony of waiting\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1VMSDG9\nBANKS START REBUILDING RESERVES \u2014 FT\u2019s Ben McLannahan: \u201cWall Street\u2019s biggest banks are beginning to build their defences against downturns, signalling an end to the steady thinning of reserves that has helped boost profits in the past five years. Tapping into reserves set aside for bad loans has become a reliable source of income for the banks in the post-crisis environment, allowing them to offset the effects of weak demand and ultra-low interest rates. Regulators let lenders dip into reserves in this way if they can argue that an improving outlook makes losses less likely \u2026 \n\u201cBut the practice is expected to have a limited impact on the banks\u2019 third-quarter profits, which begin to be presented this week, because reserves have been run down about as far as they can go. While some banks with plump cushions of reserves could still make net reductions, others are at an \u2018inflection point,\u2019 said Jennifer Thompson, an analyst at Portales Partners in New York. Lenders with big exposures to energy could see \u2018dramatic\u2019 increases in reserves, she said, while related sectors such as materials, commodities and industrials also look vulnerable to rises\u201d http://on.ft.com/1OvjGVY\nBHARARA: MY JURISDICTION IS EVERYWHERE \u2014 Via Politics on the Hudson: \u201cWhen it came to Bharara\u2019s jurisdiction and its broad reach, the prosecutor said his office has long thought globally. \u2018Somebody once made the mistake of asking me, \u2018What again is your jurisdiction exactly?\u2019\u2019 Bharara said. \u2018And I said, \u2018Are you familiar with Earth?\u2019\nHe continued: \u2018Long before I got there, we have a long tradition in the Southern District of thinking of the global reach that we have, because we do have a good amount of resources \u2014 not unlimited resources, but a good amount.\u2019\u201d http://bit.ly/1Osz3A1\nTHE CAMPAIGN AGAINST BEN NELSON \u2014 Via SNL Financial on Ben Nelson at the NAIC: \u201cNelson's exit was largely engineered from within the NAIC, according to SNL's conversations with several regulators and other sources close to the organization in the weeks leading up to the announcement. A faction of state insurance commissioners pushed the NAIC not to renew his contract amid deep dissatisfaction with his performance, going as far as to revive an internal evaluation process that they hoped would speed his exit\u201dhttp://bit.ly/1RBs2vh\nSEC TRIMS USE OF IN-HOUSE JUDGES \u2014 WSJ\u2019S Jean Eaglesham: \u201cThe Securities and Exchange Commission has quietly pulled back on its use of in-house judges, a practice that brought it criticism and legal challenges. SEC leaders defend the fairness of using agency administrative law judges even for serious, contested cases, in accordance with powers the agency gained through the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law. When it uses its own tribunal, the SEC has historically enjoyed a home-court advantage, an analysis by The Wall Street Journal found in May of this year. \n\u201cThe analysis showed the agency won against 90 percent of defendants in contested cases heard by its in-house judges from October 2010 through March 2015, versus 69 percent success in cases it took to federal court. The analysis helped spur a wave of legal challenges and criticism of the internal tribunal. Now, the agency is sending fewer serious contested cases to its own judges, according to a new analysis by the Journal.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1PoXBJs\n** A message from the Independent Community Bankers of America: Now is the time for Congress to put down their partisan differences and unlock the community banking industry\u2019s potential to be catalysts for economic growth. ICBA and America\u2019s more than 6,400 community banks urge lawmakers to secure meaningful regulatory relief. Community banks in every Congressional district across the nation are the backbone of local economic growth nationwide and support our communities one loan at a time. But excessive and unnecessary regulation is thwarting their ability to fully meet the needs of local economies. We need lawmakers to enact sensible regulatory relief to allow community banks to do what they do best: serve their communities.
