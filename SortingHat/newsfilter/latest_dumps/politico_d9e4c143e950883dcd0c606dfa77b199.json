{"body": "On Media\nBy DYLAN BYERS\n7/8/15 6:06 PM EDT\nFrom my report on the media's dance with Donald Trump:\nBack in the spring, when Donald Trump first started making noise about a presidential bid, CNN President Jeff Zucker sent a message to his producers: Don\u2019t cover him.\nTrump had teased a presidential run many times before \u2014 in 1988, 2004, and 2012 \u2014 and Zucker had watched each time as the media got played by a braggadocious showman who relished the limelight. Zucker didn\u2019t want CNN to get played again, sources there said.\nThen, on June 16, Trump announced that he was, in fact, running for president. Since then, CNN has covered Trump more than 400 times on television and on its website, according to the Nexis database. That\u2019s more coverage than CNN has given to Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker or any other major GOP candidates. It\u2019s even more coverage than CNN has given to Hillary Clinton.\nOn Wednesday, one day after landing Clinton\u2019s first campaign interview with a national media outlet, CNN was once again going wall-to-wall on Trump, aggressively touting an interview with Anderson Cooper across its airwaves and at the top of its home page.\nThe dilemma facing CNN is one facing every political media outlet: How much coverage should be given to a notoriously self-aggrandizing business mogul and reality television star who, despite reporters\u2019 contention that he can\u2019t win his party\u2019s nomination, is drawing an enormous audience by offering the media sensational quotes and highly clickable fodder.\n\u201cI think a lot of media people thought that if he got in, and eventually fell back in with the afterthoughts, poll-wise, the coverage would (finally) taper off to the occasional freak-of-the-week treatment,\u201d Mark Leibovich, the New York Times Magazine correspondent and author of \u2018This Town\u2019, told POLITICO.\nThat hasn\u2019t happened.\nIn the polls conducted since his announcement, Trump has finished second both nationally and in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Barring a precipitous decline over the next few weeks, it is looking very likely that Trump will not only appear at the first Republican presidential primary debate in Cleveland, on Aug. 6, but that he will be closer to center-stage than some of his more politically experienced rivals.\nFor that reason, many editors believe Trump should be covered as aggressively as any other candidate. It\u2019s presumptuous for the media to decide who may or may not win the nomination, they say. While it\u2019s true that polling doesn\u2019t tell the whole story \u2014 at this point in 2011, Michele Bachmann was polling even higher than Trump is today, and Trump is notoriously unfavorable among the Republican establishment \u2014 many editors believe outlets must simply report on the presidential campaign as it unfolds.\n\u201cIn my view, making decisions solely according to who may win the nomination is the worst way to cover a presidential election,\u201d said Steven Ginsberg, the senior politics editor at The Washington Post, which has been covering Trump aggressively for several months. \u201cA whole lot happens on the way to the nomination and you can\u2019t explain what\u2019s happening with the candidates or the country without being on top of all of it.\u201d\nRead the full report here.\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "From my report on the media's dance with Donald Trump:\nBack in the spring, when Donald Trump first started making noise about a presidential bid, CNN President Jeff Zucker sent a message to his producers: Don't cover him.\nTrump had teased a presidential run many times before -- in 1988, 2004, and 2012 -- and Zucker had watched each time as the media got played by a braggadocious showman who relished the limelight.
