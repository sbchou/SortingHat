The deal eventually led to one that gave Russia access to U.S. uranium deposits.\n\nThe concerns about the foundation\u2019s contributions and finances are being raised as Clinton\u2019s wife, Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, makes a 2016 White House bid.\n\nShe also was secretary of state during other deals about which Schweizer has raised concerns.\n\nPally writes that the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership of Canada is listed on the foundation website as a donor . However, Canadian law prohibits charities from disclosing individual donors without their permission.\n\n\u201cThis is hardly an effort on our part to avoid transparency,\u201d she writes.\n\nPally also wrote Sunday that the foundation has already said it will likely re-file tax forms for some years, following the completion of a voluntary external review.\n\nHowever, she says the effort was not an admission that the foundation failed to report all of its revenue.\n\n\u201cThat is not the case,\u201d Pally writes. \u201cOur total revenue was accurately reported on each year's form.\u201d\u00a0\n\nShe said the errors were the result of government grants being \u201cmistakenly combined with other donations.\u201d\n\nPally also argued that the foundation\u2019s policies for donor disclosures and foreign-government contributors are \u201cstronger than ever\u201d and that the group has already announced that it will accept funding from only a \u201chandful of governments,\u201d including many whose multi-year grants for philanthropic work have yet to be completed.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to operating the foundation responsibly and effectively to continue\u00a0the life-changing work that this philanthropy is doing every day,\u201d Pally wrote.", "byline": "", "description": "The Clinton Foundation acknowledged Sunday that the nonprofit group \u201cmade mistakes\u201d in IRS filings and defended its disclosure of controversial contributions from a Canadian financier, following days of intense public scrutiny about foundation finances. \u00a0", "title": "Clinton Foundation addresses disclosure of $31M Canadian donation, re-filing IRS revenue forms", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/z0gFxRLJJIc/", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Hillary Clinton", "Frank Giustra", "Peter Schweizer", "Maura Pally", "Martha Coakley", "Clinton Cash"], "orgs": ["Clinton Foundation", "Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership of Canada", "IRS"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-04-27 08:00:58", "org": "fox", "article_id": "19b4369e40eefb13e4e7da859ad54b86", "date_access": "2015-04-27 08:50:07.645868"}
