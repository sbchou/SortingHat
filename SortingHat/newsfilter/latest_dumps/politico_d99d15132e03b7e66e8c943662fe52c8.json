Paul Ryan has agreed to delay a discussion about reforming the procedural motion used to remove a House speaker, a major concession to the House Freedom Caucus.\nThe Wisconsin Republican, now the presumptive next speaker of the House, delivered the message to Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussion. Possible changes to the so-called \"motion to vacate\" will now come as part of a larger discussion of reworking internal party and House rules. Should he become House speaker, Ryan will set a deadline by which the House Republican Conference will change chamber and party rules.\nStory Continued Below\nIn launching his bid for speaker, Ryan said the next speaker could not operate under the constant threat of a referendum vote to remove him from his position. He has not said how he wants to reform the motion to vacate, but several options have been discussed, including increasing the threshold to bring such a motion to a vote. The House Freedom Caucus is open to changing the procedure, several members have said.\nThe Freedom Caucus stopped short of endorsing Ryan's bid for speaker, but a supermajority of the group is supporting him.\nNorth Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, a member of the Freedom Caucus, filed a motion to vacate against Speaker John Boehner in July. It never received a vote on the House floor.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "He promises to delay discussions of overhauling a procedural mechanism to oust a sitting speaker.", "title": "Ryan offers concession to House Freedom Caucus", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/ryan-concessions-freedom-caucus-215075", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "trade", "economy"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "David Kendall", "Bernie Becker", "Rachael Bade", "Jim Jordan", "Elena Schneider", "Anna Palmer", "Hadas Gold", "Eric Schultz", "Carla Marinucci", "Austin Wright", "Tim Starks", "Michael Kruse", "Michael Bloomberg", "Michael Hirsh", "Joe Biden", "Jenny Hopkinson", "Brian Mahoney", "John Boehner", "Josh Gerstein", "Annie Karni", "John Cornyn", "Rich Lowry", "Katie Glueck", "Nick Gass", "Trey Gowdy", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Seung Min Kim", "Donald Trump", "John Bresnahan", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Paul Ryan", "Brianna Ehley", "Lauren French", "Lynn Westmoreland", "Adam Sneed", "Jeremy Herb", "Daniel Strauss", "Mark Meadows", "Jason Huffman", "Hillary Clinton", "Ben Wofford", "Emanuel Cleaver", "Eric Wolff", "Darius Tahir", "Caitlin Emma"], "orgs": ["Fiat", "Congress", "IPAB", "AARP", "Senate", "House Republican Conference", "Freedom Caucus", "CISA", "GOP", "House Freedom Caucus"], "authors": [{"author_id": 31434, "fullname": "austin wright", "primary_org": "politico"}, {"author_id": 30887, "fullname": "jeremy herb", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-10-22 22:19:00", "org": "politico", "article_id": "d99d15132e03b7e66e8c943662fe52c8", "date_access": "2015-10-22 21:30:11.641505"}
