Jeanne Shaheen, a former governor and longtime supporter who officially endorsed Clinton\u2019s campaign Saturday. \u201cI firmly believe what\u2019s good for women is good for America,\u201d Clinton said.\nClinton has been embracing her gender since her kickoff rally on Roosevelt Island last June, but the Women for Hillary rally marked the first time she placed her entire domestic and economic agenda in terms of how it affects women\u2019s lives.\n\u201cChildcare is a women\u2019s issue, but it\u2019s also an economic issue,\u201d she said. \u201cPaid family leave is a women\u2019s issue, but it\u2019s also an economic issue. You should not have to lose your paycheck or your job when you have a baby or someone in your family gets sick.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton Emails\n\n            By \nGabriel Debenedetti\n             and \nNick Gass\n\nClinton kept up the refrain: \u201cOf course, equal pay is a women\u2019s issue, but it\u2019s also an economic issue. We have to just get over this. Women should be paid the same as men, and when they\u2019re not their whole families get short-changed.\u201d\n\u201cRaising the minimum wage is a women\u2019s issue,\u201d she said. \u201cHolding corporations accountable when they gouge us on drug prices, pollute our environment or exploit workers are women\u2019s issues.\u201d\nCorporations profit-sharing with their employees, college affordability, and creating a pathway to citizenship for immigrants, she added, were all women\u2019s issues, too.\nLongtime Clinton aides could not remember a time during Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential bid when she embraced running as a woman and women\u2019s issues so openly and unequivocally as she did on Saturday.\nOn the campaign trail eight years ago, Clinton shied away from explicitly gender-based appeals. \u201cI am not running as a woman,\u201d she often said. \u201cI am running because I believe I am the best-qualified and experienced person.\u201d That strategy failed to fire up women voters -- in Iowa, Barack Obama earn more women votes than Clinton, and Clinton barely exceeded 50 percent of the women\u2019s vote overall in the Democratic primary.\nHer rousing speech thanking her supporters for helping to put \u201c18 million cracks\u201d in the \u201chighest, hardest glass ceiling\u201d came late in the primary -- in her concession to Barack Obama.\nThis time around, Clinton has been attacking Republicans on women\u2019s issues and women\u2019s health, hoping that a real contrast on the issues will be what gets her over the finish line in a general election and motivates women voters. Since her 2008 effort, Democrats have sought to advance the theme of a Republican \"war on women,\" and have made explicit appeals to women a key part of their strategy in an attempt to further leverage the traditional gender gap between the two parties. \nClinton singled out several Republican presidential candidates by name Saturday. GOP frontrunner Donald Trump \u201csaid I don\u2019t have a clue about women\u2019s health issues,\u201d Clinton said at the rally. \u201cHe said he would do a much better job for women than I would. That\u2019s a general election debate that\u2019s going to be a lot of fun.\u201d\n\n\n\n            By \nRachael Bade\n\n\u201cHe says he loves women, to quote him, he cherishes us,\u201d Clinton added, \u201cWell, if it\u2019s all the same to you, I\u2019d rather you stop cherishing women and start respecting women.\u201d\nShe even took a swipe at Dr. Ben Carson, who has recently been surging in the polls, for his opposition to abortion.\nNew Hampshire voters provided a fitting audience for the full-court woman press.\nIn 2008, the Granite State was the first in the nation to elect a state legislature with more women than men, Clinton noted in her speech. In 2012, it was the first state to send an all-women congressional delegation to Washington. The chief justice of the Supreme Court in New Hampshire is a woman, and Shaheen made history as the first woman to be elected senator and governor from her state. \n\u201cI think the rest of America could learn a few lessons from New Hampshire, don\u2019t you?\u201d Clinton said. \u201cRepublicans actually say I\u2019m playing the gender card. Well, if calling for equal pay and paid leave and women\u2019s health is playing the gender card, deal me in.\u201d\n\n                                            By \n Frank Cerabino.\n\n\n                                            By \nJennifer Haberkorn\n\n\n                                            By \nMichael Hirsh\n\n\n                                            By \nJeff Smith\n\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Rarely has Hillary Clinton campaigned on women\u2019s issues so openly and unequivocally as she did on Saturday in New Hampshire.", "title": "Clinton rallies around gender appeal", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/clinton-nh-women-213369", "topics": ["economy", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Kim Davis", "David Kendall", "Rachael Bade", "Heather Samuelson", "Henry C.
