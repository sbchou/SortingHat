{"body": "JEFFERSON, Iowa \u2014 Sheryl McDonald, a retiree, voted for both Presidents Bush. \u201cBut I\u2019m finding out they did some things we got stuck with,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not want to see Jeb Bush run,\u201d she added. \u201cHe turns me off.\u201d\n\nScarcely anyone at a meeting of the Green County Republican Party here in central Iowa recently had anything kind to say about Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor. They objected to his moderate stances on immigration and education standards. But they also complained matter-of-factly about fatigue with his family \u2014 especially after the presidency of George W. Bush, whom they blamed for a misguided war and big deficits.\n\nAnother activist, John Thompson, a West Point graduate who served in Iraq, called it \u201ca wasted war.\u201d Jeb Bush, he said, was the last of the potential Republican candidates he would consider.\n\nThis is the paradox of Mr. Bush\u2019s early campaign: He is well out in front in the race for elite Republican donors and for the support of the party\u2019s establishment. But he is unpopular with many in the rank and file, who can pick from a large crop of younger White House contenders who also pass the conservative litmus tests that Mr. Bush fails.\n\nMr. Bush will have a chance to break through that grass-roots resistance on Friday, when he arrives for his first visit to Iowa in more than three years.\n\nFar from the offices of Washington lobbyists and private homes where he has romanced affluent donors for months, Mr. Bush\u2019s two-day trip includes stops at a Waukee barbecue joint and a Cedar Rapids pizza place. It is part of the first retail campaign swing by Mr. Bush in early-voting states, and he will follow it up with visits to New Hampshire and South Carolina in the coming weeks.\n\nHis strategists say Mr. Bush plans to tell Iowans that he is a \u201creform-minded conservative\u201d with a record of results and a vision for overcoming stagnating incomes and tax reform.\n\nYet Mr. Bush appears so far to be bypassing the extensive networks of supporters, and strategists, that his father and older brother each built in Iowa en route to winning its first-in-the-nation caucus.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Bush named an outsider to head up his prospective Iowa campaign: Annie Kelly, a Pennsylvania native who worked for the National Republican Congressional Committee. And veterans of the \u201cBush Brigade,\u201d a group of up to 300 activists who met annually during the 1980s, said they had not heard from Jeb Bush.\n\nOf course, Mr. Bush\u2019s campaign is just getting going in Iowa; one Bush strategist said it would enlist elements of the old guard before long. \u201cObviously we\u2019ll be reaching out to alumni who worked on campaigns for 41 and 43,\u201d said the strategist, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the campaign\u2019s plans.\n\nBut it is unclear how many, if called, would rally behind Mr. Bush.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s at a different point in history than his brother George was,\u201d said George W. Wittgraf, a lawyer in Cherokee, Iowa, who was state chairman for the first President Bush. \u201cPeople were looking for an alternative to Bill Clinton then. While they\u2019re looking for an alternative to Barack Obama, there are lots of other potential candidates.\u201d\n\nRalph R. Brown, who worked for both earlier Bush candidacies in the state, said Mr. Bush was wise to seek out a fresh team in Iowa. \u201cThere will be a new generation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it takes to win.\u201d\n\nAlthough Mr. Bush has said he wants to be his \u201cown man,\u201d he is inescapably in his family\u2019s shadow. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of the same old same old,\u201d said Kellie Paschke, a lawyer in Waukee and a Republican activist in Dallas County west of Des Moines. Mr. Bush\u2019s \u201cname is something he\u2019s going to have to overcome,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is going to have to be more articulate with his fresh ideas.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Bush plans to meet privately with potential volunteers and staff at Jethro\u2019s, a barbecue restaurant in Waukee. On Saturday he will appear with a dozen other 2016 hopefuls at an agriculture forum in Des Moines, then attend a meet-and-greet at a Pizza Ranch restaurant in Cedar Rapids \u2014 the city where George W. Bush first publicly declared his ambition to reach the White House, in 1999.\n\nJeb Bush\u2019s own memories of Iowa include some that are less rosy. On the night of the statewide caucus in 1988, he spoke in Council Bluffs in support of his father, George H.W. Bush, who ended up losing the precinct on his way to finishing third in the state (although he won the nomination and the presidency). \u201cIt was a humbling experience\u201d for the 34-year-old Jeb, said Douglas E. Gross, a Bush family friend. \u201cHe trudges back to the Holiday Inn Express by himself like he doesn\u2019t have a friend in the world.\u201d\n\nPolls show stiff resistance to Mr. Bush so far in Iowa. More than one in four likely Republican caucus-goers said they would \u201cdefinitely not support Bush,\u201d a Quinnipiac University poll found last week. Forty percent had an unfavorable opinion of Mr. Bush, with 41 percent favorable \u2014 the worst ratio of any potential candidate except Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey.\n\nSignificantly, the No. 2 issue cited by Republicans in the survey in picking a candidate, after the economy, was immigration \u2014 a persistent problem for moderates in this Midwest state with a 5.5 percent Latino population. Last week, Mr. Bush reaffirmed his view that millions of undocumented workers in the United States should be given a path to legal status, which is anathema to many conservatives.\n\n\u201cWe have litmus tests that Iowans will expect candidates to answer the right way if they\u2019re deemed to be viable candidates, and those litmus tests in many cases are a turnoff in the general election,\u201d said Mitch Hambleton, the Republican treasurer of Dallas County. \u201cWe tend to beat ourselves up in the process.\u201d\n\nAlthough Iowa strategists unconnected to Mr. Bush said he would have to work the state hard to win over caucus-goers, it remains unclear that he has decided to do so.\n\nA strategist for his campaign promised more trips to Iowa, but declined to say how many. And David Kochel, a top Iowa operative whom Mr. Bush moved to Miami to manage his national campaign, has a record of lowering expectations. Four years ago when he ran Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign in Iowa, Mr. Kochel kept him out of the state until very late. (The strategy worked \u2014 Mr. Romney nearly won the 2012 caucus anyway.)\n\nBut there is danger in treading lightly in Iowa this cycle.\n\nThe field is stronger and broader than it was in 2012, Republican strategists say. Although Mr. Bush might be tempted to hedge his bets, to avoid the humiliation of a poor Iowa showing, that could allow others who also appeal to center-right voters, like Mr. Christie, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, to gain ground.\n\n\u201cWhat happens in Iowa becomes a reflection of your momentum in the race,\u201d said Mr. Gross, who was an Iowa finance chairman for George W. Bush but is unaffiliated this time.\n\nAs his rivals seek to persuade the party that they are best suited to win the general election, Mr. Bush will also need to make primary voters forget the past.\n\n\u201cAll year the question will be, \u2018Can Bush beat Clinton? Can Walker beat Clinton?\u2019\u201d Mr. Gross said. \u201cTo answer that question about Jeb Bush, they\u2019re going to have to answer in a way that doesn\u2019t relate to his dad or his brother.\u201d", "byline": "TRIP GABRIEL", "description": "The former Florida governor\u2019s stands on immigration and education do not sit well with party members, some of whom say they are tired of the Bush name.", "title": "Jeb Bush to Visit an Iowa Where Fatigue With His Family Has Set In", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/06/us/politics/jeb-bush-to-visit-an-iowa-where-fatigue-with-his-family-has-set-in.html", "topics": ["immigration", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Mitt Romney", "David Kochel", "Chris Christie", "John Thompson", "Jeb Bush", "Douglas E.
