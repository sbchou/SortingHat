{"body": "DES MOINES \u2014 \u201cDoes anybody remember me?\u2019\u2019 John Kasich asked Iowans on his first visit to the state since an inglorious presidential bid in 1999, when he barely made an impression before dropping out.    \n\nThroughout Wednesday, as he hop-scotched between events, Mr. Kasich, the two-term Ohio governor, sought to disarm skeptics of his late-to-the-party exploration of a second White House run. \n\n\u201cI was giant television star. Do you remember that?\u2019\u2019 he asked  a roomful of under-40 professionals from  the Bull Moose Club. There were many blank looks. \u201cI was only at Fox News for 10 years,\u2019\u2019 he said, breaking into a grin.\n\nIn an interview with The Des Moines Register that ran Wednesday morning, Mr. Kasich even tutored Iowans on how to say his name. \u201cIt rhymes with basic,\u201d he said.\n\nBut with blunt talk about his policy departures from conservative orthodoxy, Mr. Kasich appeared to make new friends in Iowa. \n\n\u201cI was taken aback by how straight a shooter he was,\u2019\u2019 said Tyler De Hahn, chairman of the Dallas County Republican Party, who heard him at the Bull Moose luncheon.  \u201cHe\u2019s kind of like a Christie lite.\u2019\u2019  \n\nA moment earlier, Mr. Kasich had been pushed about why Ohio was not a right-to-work state. \u201cBecause we don\u2019t have a reason to be one,\u2019\u2019 he said.  \n\nLike all candidates who come to Iowa, Mr. Kasich, 63, recounted well-rehearsed chapters of his biography and trumpeted his successes: \n\n* Working with President Clinton while a member of the House to craft \u201cthe first balanced budget since man walked on the moon.\u2019\u2019 \n\n* His decade in the private sector.  \u201cI just loved it,\u2019\u2019 he said, skipping over the role his employer, Lehman Brothers, played in contributing to the financial crisis. \n\n* His election as Ohio governor \u201cat exactly the right time,\u201d in 2010, when \u201cthings couldn\u2019t have been much worse.\u2019\u2019 \n\n\u201cI took a lot of the lessons I had learned in Washington to Ohio,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Kasic said, a line no other Republican candidate is likely to utter this cycle. \n\nMr. Kasich, who said he was still weighing whether to enter the race, is barely registering in Iowa polls. His formidable hurdles in the state include a lack of time visiting it, and a list of center-right policies he has supported that conservative caucusgoers are likely to reject, from expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to voting for an assault weapons ban while in Congress.\n\n\u201cThe hurdle he\u2019d have to get over is the strong religious right,\u2019\u2019 said James Gilson, a retired stockbroker who heard Mr. Kasich address the Greater Des Moines Partnership, a business and civic group.   \n\nBut balancing out those negatives is the potential appeal of the straight-shooting, even gnarly, Kasich persona. Despite the state\u2019s reputation for Iowa Nice, its voters welcome a candidate who can cut through the political catchphrases.\n\n\u201cHe tells it like it is, and I think that\u2019s going to be huge,\u201d said Mike McInerney, the Bull Moose president.  \u201cIowans really respect that.\u2019\u2019", "byline": "TRIP GABRIEL", "description": "As he hop-scotched between events in Ohio, John Kasich, the two-term governor of Ohio, sought to disarm skeptics of his late-to-the-party exploration of a second White House effort.", "title": "First Draft: John Kasich Appeals to Iowa as He Ponders White House Bid", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/06/24/john-kasich-appeals-to-iowa-as-he-ponders-white-house-bid/", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Lehman Brothers", "John Kasich"], "orgs": ["Des Moines Register", "Medicaid", "DES MOINES"], "authors": [{"author_id": 915, "fullname": "trip gabriel", "primary_org": "nyt"}], "date_written": "2015-06-24 22:47:52", "org": "nyt", "article_id": "4cc0e839e5c94ae9dfdea1933dd3efd5", "date_access": "2015-06-24 22:00:47.249879"}
