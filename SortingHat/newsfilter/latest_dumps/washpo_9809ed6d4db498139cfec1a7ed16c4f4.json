(Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)  Stepping away from a potentially explosive confrontation with Donald Trump, Ben Carson said Sunday that he never meant to attack the GOP presidential front-runner on his faith and skirted questions about whether Trump is fit to lead.  In an interview on ABC's \"This Week\" with Martha Raddatz, Carson said the media spun his comments that he \"doesn't see\" Trump's faith into an attack he never meant. Carson reiterated an apology he issued Friday\u00a0in an interview with Fox News\u00a0for questioning Trump's faith. \"When you do something that's inappropriate, I think it's appropriate to apologize for it,\" he told Raddatz.\u00a0 [Ben Carson: I don't want to get into a 'gladiator' fight with Donald Trump] But Trump had already retaliated, telling voters at an Iowa rally on Saturday that Carson lacks the \"energy\" to be president.

The two men have never before held public office. [Like Trump, Ben Carson has surged ahead by being a non-politician] As Trump's lead solidifies, he's fielding an increasing amount of attacks from his Republican rivals. In recent weeks, he has sparred with more-establishment candidates such as former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who has called Trump a germophobe, and candidates at the bottom of the race, such as Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who said\u00a0Trump is \"a narcissist\" and an \"egomaniac.\"\u00a0     Donald Trump and former Florida governor Jeb Bush are trading insults on the campaign trail.

The soft-spoken candidate sidestepped other opportunities Sunday to jump on the Trump-attack train. On CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" host John Dickerson asked Carson whether he thinks Trump is humble enough. \"I think I'm going to leave that up to the voters,\" Carson said. \"That's the appropriate way to do it.\" ", "byline": "", "description": "Carson's taking a different tack than other GOP candidates.", "title": "Ben Carson backs off Donald Trump feud", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/13/ben-carson-backs-off-donald-trump-feud/", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["John Dickerson", "Jeb Bush", "Donald Trump", "Martha Raddatz", "Bobby Jindal", "Pamela Kirkland", "Ben Carson"], "orgs": ["GOP"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30979, "fullname": "amber phillips", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-09-13 16:34:17", "org": "washpo", "article_id": "9809ed6d4db498139cfec1a7ed16c4f4", "date_access": "2015-09-13 16:10:10.599652"}
