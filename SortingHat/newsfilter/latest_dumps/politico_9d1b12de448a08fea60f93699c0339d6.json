{"body": "POLITICO\nPolitical intelligence on the intersection of Washington and Wall Street\nBy Zachary Warmbrodt\n8/11/15 7:59 AM EDT\nCANTOR UNCHAINED \u2014 Federal lobbying restrictions for former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor will end a week from today, marking the one-year anniversary of when he resigned from Congress after a surprise primary loss to David Brat. M.M. reached out to Cantor to see what he plans to do. He didn\u2019t personally respond, but a spokeswoman for the Virginia Republican\u2019s new employer, the investment bank Moelis & Company, said \u201che will not register to lobby for the firm.\u201d\nCantor\u2019s political action committee had more than $357,000 cash on hand as of the end of June. Cantor\u2019s separate campaign committee received $200,000 from him in June as it wound down and refunded more than $230,000 in contributions to Cantor backers including Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.\nStory Continued Below\nCHINA DEVALUES YUAN \u2014 The People\u2019s Bank of China cut the currency\u2019s daily reference rate Tuesday by 1.9 percent, a move that may reignite criticism in the U.S. Congress that the currency was already too weak, allowing Chinese goods to sell at artificially low prices worldwide, according to the WSJ\u2019s Lingling Wei: http://on.wsj.com/1P2tKUF\nCLINTON TOURS KEY STATES WITH $350 BILION COLLEGE DEBT PLAN \u2014 Hillary Clinton is trekking across New Hampshire and Iowa this week with a sweeping policy proposal aimed at reducing college loan debt. Clinton\u2019s GOP competitors wasted little time Monday attacking the \u201cNew College Compact,\u201d which would free up $350 billion for education by cutting tax deductions for the wealthiest Americans.\n\u2014 JEB BUSH:\u00a0\u201cThis irresponsible proposal would raise taxes, increase government debt, and double-down on the failed Obama economic policies that have led to a \u2018new normal\u2019 of sluggish economic growth, rising college costs spurred by Washington, and limited opportunities for all Americans \u2014 including recent college graduates.\"\u00a0http://bit.ly/1IzO0ev\n\u2014 MARCO RUBIO: \u201cAll she\u2019s talking about is, let\u2019s raise taxes and pour a bunch of money into a 20th-century outdated model.\u201d\u00a0http://bit.ly/1gXlDOA\nSLIM CHANCE OF SUCCESS? \u2014 Compass Point\u2019s Isaac Boltansky: \u201cThe Clinton campaign states that the plan would cost $350 [billion] over 10 years and be paid for by \u2018closing tax loopholes and expenditures for the most fortunate.\u2019 \u2026 The cost of this package poses both political and procedural problems which underscores our view that the proposal as currently constructed will not be enacted.\u201d\nWALL STREET LOBBYING GROUP SPARS WITH LABOR OFFICIALS \u2014 The Labor Department\u2019s epic, four-day public hearing on its fiduciary-duty proposal kicked off yesterday with testimony from one of the rule\u2019s biggest foes: the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. POLITICO\u2019s Patrick Temple-West reports that Labor Department officials questioned SIFMA CEO Kenneth Bentsen about the group\u2019s use of studies to point out flaws in the rule, with deputy assistant secretary Timothy Hauser saying that a SIFMA-commissioned study from Deloitte didn\u2019t independently verify information provided by the group\u2019s members.\nWall Street reform group Better Markets, which published a rebuttal against SIFMA\u2019s \u201cspin campaign,\u201d will testify alongside the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, another critic of the rule, at the Labor Department later today. http://1.usa.gov/1KW2B7E\nICI DISPUTES DOL\u2019S CLAIM OF FINANCIAL BENEFITS: Today, you can also expect witnesses to address the DOL\u2019s claim that the rule would create $44 billion in benefits over a decade. The Investment Company Institute\u2019s Sean Collins is slated to testify that that analysis is, \u201ctotally unfounded.\u201d Collins will say that the rule will instead cost investors $109 billion in lost returns.\nPEREZ TO FIDUCIARY RULE CRITICS: WE'RE MOVING AHEAD \u2014 Labor Secretary Thomas Perez on\u00a0Friday defended his agency's\u00a0fiduciary duty rule proposal in a letter\u00a0to a bipartisan group of\u00a0House members who had\u00a0asked him to re-propose the conflict-of-interest regulation. In a copy of the letter sent to Rep. Ann Wagner,\u00a0Perez said Labor has received more than 330,000 comments on the proposal and\u00a0will \"move forward towards issuing a final rule that balances the input we have received.\" Look for Wagner to press ahead with a\u00a0bill that would put Labor's regulation\u00a0on hold until the SEC writes its own investment advice rule, which the bill would subject to a number of new requirements as well.

Elizabeth Warren has a new target: the financial-services communication system that Symphony Communication LLC is poised to roll out to compete with Bloomberg\u2019s messaging service. The populist senator from Massachusetts sent a letter to six federal regulators yesterday raising questions about whether the tool \u201ccould prevent regulators from identifying and preventing future illegal behavior.\u201d http://1.usa.gov/1gYS13v\nHOUSE COMMS DIRECTOR IN CFTC SWAP \u2014 Christopher Spina, the communications director for House Financial Services Committee Democrats until last Friday, is joining the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. His first day as a senior advisor for public affairs at the futures and swaps regulator will be Monday.\n** A message from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness: The U.S. Chamber and Small Business Administration agree \u2014 DOL\u2019s proposed fiduciary rule is bad for business. SBA Office of Advocacy: \u201c[S]mall businesses stakeholders report that the proposals could ultimately lead advisers to stop providing retirement services to small businesses.\u201d Learn more and see what others are saying at www.USChamber.com/RetirementAction. **\nELLIOTT MANAGEMENT HIRES NEW LOBBYISTS \u2014 From POLITICO Influence: \u201cHedge fund\u00a0Elliott Management Corporation, which is run by GOP megadonor\u00a0Paul Singer, has brought on\u00a0Forbes-Tate\u00a0to lobby on issues related to financial services. The firm's\u00a0Daniel\u00a0Tate, Jeff Strunk, Frank Steinberg, Libby Greer\u00a0and\u00a0Jeff Sadosky\u00a0will be lobbying on behalf of the hedge fund. Elliott Management has significantly decreased its spending on lobbying in recent years. It spent $230,000 on lobbying the federal government last year and has spent only $20,000 so far this year. The firm has\u00a0Malkin & Rosson retainer.\u201d http://politi.co/1TgB0Ta\nSANTANDER FACES AUTO LOAN INVESTIGATION \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Peter Rudegeair: \u201cSantander Consumer USA Holdings, Inc., one of the largest U.S. auto lenders, said on Monday that regulators alleged the company violated fair-lending laws and the matter could be reviewed by the Justice Department. In July, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau told Santander Consumer USA that it had notified the Justice Department of instances where it found the company overcharged \u2018protected groups\u2019 of consumers on auto loans made through car dealerships, according to a regulatory filing Monday by the Dallas-based lender.\u201d\u00a0http://on.wsj.com/1Mgpdyz\nTHE ABCs of GOOGLE: In what Bloomberg News commentators call an \u201cearthshaking\u201d development, Google Inc. is reorganizing into a holding company called Alphabet Inc. http://bloom.bg/1DDxOu8. And Larry Page is joking about it: http://bloom.bg/1MlJIeN\n** A message from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness: The Department of Labor is currently working to redefine the definition of a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Security Act (ERISA) by modifying what constitutes \"investment advice.\" Unfortunately, this re-proposal is both more expansive and much more complicated than the DOL's controversial 2010 proposal. It will have a disproportionate impact on low and moderate income Americans saving for retirement \u2014 especially employees of small businesses who save using products such as IRAs. The Chamber is committed to working toward a rule that further protects investors while expanding, rather than unnecessarily limiting, access to investment advice and investment choices.
