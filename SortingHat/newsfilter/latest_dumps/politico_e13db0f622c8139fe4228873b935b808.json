Scott Walker speaks to supporters as he announces he is running for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination at the Waukesha County Expo Center, Monday, July 13, 2015, in Waukesha, Wis. | AP Photo\nWAUKESHA, Wis. \u2014 Scott Walker officially announced his bid for the presidency on Monday, launching his campaign from some of the most reliably Republican turf in America and the site of the Wisconsin governor\u2019s most unlikely victory.\nSuburban Milwaukee\u2019s Waukesha County is where Walker celebrated the 2012 recall victory that propelled him to national prominence. It was a bruising battle that added to an impressive streak over more than two decades in which Walker appeared on a ballot 14 times, and failed just twice. That record is at the heart of his pitch to Republican voters.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cMy record shows that I know how to fight and win. Now, more than ever, we need a president who will fight and win for America,\u201d Walker said, his sleeves rolled up.\nWalker emphasized he is not a creature of Washington. Unlike many of his rivals in the crowded GOP field, senators or products of political dynasties, Walker presented himself as an outside leader with tangible accomplishments.\nAlso on POLITICO\nADAM B. LERNER\n\u201cWe need new, fresh leadership; leadership with big, bold ideas from outside of Washington; the kind of leadership that can actually get things done \u2014 like we have here in Wisconsin,\u201d Walker said.\nAnd Walker\u2019s choice of kickoff location underscored his play for the deeply conservative vote. Waukesha County, which abuts Milwaukee County, where Walker lives, is bright red territory \u2014 it delivered big for Mitt Romney and John McCain in 2012 and 2008. And for a combative Midwestern Republican whose path to victory in 2016 is predicated on energizing the GOP base rather than broadening it, it would be hard to find a better symbolic venue.\nWhile Jeb Bush and Rand Paul have pushed messages of inclusiveness, there\u2019s no talk from the Walker campaign about outreach to minority communities and other nontraditional GOP voters. His chest-beating announcement on Monday was a prelude to the smash-mouth campaign he\u2019s likely to run.\n\u201cAmericans deserve a president who will fight and win for them. Someone who will stand up for the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Someone who will stand up for our religious rights and all of our other constitutional rights,\u201d he said.\nWalker ticked off a list of conservative grievances and vowed to address most of them on \u201cDay One\u201d of his presidency. Walker pledged to push for a repeal of Obamacare, sign off on the Keystone pipeline, terminate any nuclear deal with Iran and to take the threat of Islamic State more seriously than the threat of climate change.\nHe proudly pointed to his conservative wins in Wisconsin, taking on the unions, scoring a voter ID law, defunding Planned Parenthood and enacting anti-abortion legislation.\nIn many ways, Walker\u2019s crippling of collective bargaining power for unions in his first term fueled his rise. The legislation he championed underscored the weakening of the labor movement around the country in a state considered friendly to organized labor.\nHe emboldened other governors and legislatures to pursue similar reforms, and his knockout punch came when he beat back the unions who sought to unseat him using Wisconsin\u2019s unusual recall law. No governor had ever survived one before, and his win against Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett added to his presidential r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\nOn Monday, Walker made sure to exude average Joe-ness, too. He described bargain-hunting at Kohl\u2019s, clipping coupons with his wife, Tonette, to get the best deals. Walker has turned to the retailer before to highlight his thriftiness\nHe took the reference further, though, saying Kohl\u2019s makes its money off volume, and America would do well to take that approach to taxation, lowering rates and broadening the base and thereby encouraging more participation in the economy.\nAlso on POLITICO\nELIZA COLLINS\n\u201cYears ago, we saw this kind of plan work well under President Ronald Reagan. Back then, it was called the Laffer Curve. Today, I call it the Kohl\u2019s Curve because I believe that you can spend your own money far better than the government \u2014 and that will help grow the economy,\u201d he said.\nAfter the announcement, Walker will blitz the early-voting 2016 primary states, beginning in Nevada and hopscotching to South Carolina and New Hampshire before flying to Iowa \u2014 the state where he\u2019s the acknowledged front-runner \u2014 for three full days of events this weekend. There, he\u2019ll rack up road miles with stops between Davenport on the state\u2019s eastern edge and Sioux City on the border of Nebraska.\nHow his message resonates in western Iowa, especially among social conservatives who have questioned his commitment to their causes, could be a harbinger of his fortunes. Bob Vander Plaats, president of the influential Iowa social conservative group The Family Leader, said many conservatives in Iowa have \u201ca soft hesitancy\u201d with Walker, pointing to his shifting positions \u2014 at least rhetorically \u2014 on same-sex marriage and abortion.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re looking for is a consistency of convictions,\u201d he said. Though it\u2019s reminiscent of similar doubts the right held about Romney in 2012, Vander Plaats said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t put Walker in the Romney camp. \u201cI don\u2019t think Walker\u2019s got the Romney issue, he just has to make sure that he does not even get a scent of the Romney issue.\u201d\nWalker\u2019s speech was stuffed with coded language intended to reassure those conservatives, promising to be \u201csomeone who will stand up for our religious rights and all of our other constitutional rights\u201d and vowing to be a fighter for the \u201cborn or unborn.\u201d\nHe also took pains to shore up his foreign policy credentials, which took a hit in the spring when he made a handful of head-scratching comments \u2014 from comparing union protesters to terrorists, to describing the most important foreign policy decision in his lifetime as Reagan\u2019s decision to fire air traffic controllers.\nIn his speech, Walker ridiculed the Obama-Clinton foreign policy as \u201cyears of mush.\u201d\n\u201cThe United States needs a foreign policy that puts steel in front of our enemies,\u201d he said.\nBut Walker\u2019s feisty rhetoric will get him only so far. He\u2019s going to have to compete with rivals swimming in campaign and super PAC cash. He\u2019s expected to post a more modest haul than Bush, who blew away the field with a $103-million quarter, and even Ted Cruz\u2019s $51 million and Marco Rubio\u2019s $44 million. Their hauls, revealed on the eve of Walker\u2019s official campaign launch, come as Walker steps back into the foreground after months of low-key campaigning.\nOne of Walker\u2019s financial backers said the governor will succeed if he can tap into the \u201ceconomic anxiety\u201d confronting the nation \u2014 a role he argues no one has filled yet.\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the few candidates out there who can effectively and credibly speak to middle-class issues,\u201d said John Jordan, a California wine magnate.\nJordan said he\u2019s not concerned about Walker\u2019s quiet few months or a perception that Walker has been coasting on the winds of a powerful January speech in Iowa that first powered him to front-runner status there.\n\u201cNone of these campaigns have been really tested yet. Walker\u2019s name ID, of the top-tier candidates, is still the lowest,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think they know what they\u2019re dealing with yet.\u201d\nWalker\u2019s path to the nomination runs through the Midwest, beginning with Iowa, where he spent part of his childhood. New Hampshire is a tougher prospect \u2014 he hasn\u2019t visited there much and it shows in the polls: According to the most recent CNN/WMUR poll, Walker is in fourth place.\nBy JEFF GREENFIELD \nBy MICHAEL LIND\nBy LAURENCE REES\nBy JEH JOHNSON\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "\"My record shows that I know how to fight and win,\" Walker says.", "title": "Sleeves rolled up, Scott Walker kicks off presidential run", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/scott-walker-kicks-off-presidential-run-120058.html", "topics": ["economy"], "people": ["Rand Paul", "Mitt Romney", "Vander Plaats", "Kyle Cheney", "Ronald Reagan", "Jeb Bush", "Tom Barrett", "Marco Rubio", "John Jordan", "Bob Vander Plaats", "Scott Walker", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": ["Suburban Milwaukee", "GOP"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30865, "fullname": "kyle cheney", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-07-13 23:25:13", "org": "politico", "article_id": "e13db0f622c8139fe4228873b935b808", "date_access": "2015-07-14 02:20:02.692958"}
