If she was fixated in her first presidential bid on strength, Clinton is far more willing in her second to embrace and acknowledge what she described as the \u201cemotional, personal,\u201d often demanding moments that can \u201cpierce the political screen\" of a campaign and candidate.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard out there. This is something that just demands your mental, emotional, physical stamina all the time,\u201d Clinton told Another Round, a BuzzFeed podcast, in a wide-ranging interview touching on the rigor of the campaign trail, the scrutiny of public life, and the campaign event eight years ago in Portsmouth, where a woman asked simply, \u201cHow do you do it?\u201d\u201cI did not know that that was how I was going to feel at the time,\u201d Clinton said of her tearful answer. \u201cIt was a combination for me of feeling like somebody\u2019s asked me a really personal question, and\u2026 it\u2019s very hard out there. This is something that just demands your mental, emotional, physical stamina all the time.\u201d\u201cWhen it was over, I just felt drained,\u201d Clinton said, asked if she regretted the moment afterward. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel anything other than that. I didn\u2019t realize it was going to be such a big deal, to be honest, and then it became this big deal.\u201dIn the interview, Clinton recalled encounters with voters that have brought her to tears, in public and in private, over the course of her campaign. Last month, at the New Hampshire Democratic Party convention, she met Keith F. Thompson, a 52-year-old who cares for his mother, who has Alzheimer\u2019s, and whom he regularly brings to his part-time job. Last week, in Manchester, she met Nicole Hockley, whose 6-year-old son, Dylan, died at Sandy Hook.\u201cI didn\u2019t know she was going to be there,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything at all until she just came up to me before I went out to the event, and I could just feel myself getting very emotional about it. Those moments happen.\u201d\u201cSomething real pierces the political screen,\u201d Clinton said, like meeting Thompson or Hockley. \u201cIt\u2019s a moment that induces this kind of emotional, personal reaction.\u201dThese \u201creal\u201d moments exist within the \"totally different\" standard that Clinton said women are held to: an expectation that they be \"both strong and vulnerable at the same time,\" she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not easy to do.\"\u201cAnd so you just have to be who you are, to the best of your ability, but it is somewhat frustrating,\" Clinton continued. \u201cWomen in any profession, media, business, you name it, and we talk about this \u2014 we all feel like, if you do it, you\u2019re criticized, and if you don\u2019t do it, you\u2019re criticized,\u201d she said.She suggested that women public figures are sometimes understood collectively, rather than individuals with different strengths and weaknesses. \u201cEventually people either get your or they don\u2019t,\u201d she said.\u201cAnd you know when I ran for the senate back in \u201899, I was very much facing the same kinds of questions. What about this, what about that, etc. etc.,\u201d Clinton said 2000 Senate campaign. At the time, she went on an infamous listening tour, even staying overnight in voters\u2019 homes across the state, amid scrutiny over whether she was a carpetbagger for moving from Arkansas, to the White House, to Chappaqua, N.Y.\u201cI just got up every day and worked as hard as I could,\u201d she said. \u201cEven in this last presidential campaign as you point out, it\u2019s such a marathon, and it\u2019s so hard \u2014 and then, you know, when President Obama asked me to be secretary of state, it was a different kind of platform, and because I wasn\u2019t in politics, people were really nice about me. They said all kinds of nice things.\u201dThat, however, Clinton said ended when she began running for president again. The political scrutiny, though, she said is really a function of the national political stage \u2014 something she has been on for nearly 25 years.\u201cEven though my husband was governor of Arkansas for all those years, I drove myself around, I went to work every day, I took my daughter to school or to ballet. I had a really, just kind of run-of-the-mill, ordinary life,\u201d she said. Clinton famously hasn\u2019t driven a car since 1996, a feature of the far more insulated and restricted life of U.S. Secret Service protection \u2014 but the intensity of the media scrutiny, she said, is not something that anyone becomes accustomed to.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until he became president that I really encountered that overwhelming sense of the bubble, the scrutiny,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that you ever get used to it, but you do sort of learn how to manage it so that you can get up every day and go about your life.\u201dAnd even if she said better understands how to navigate the reality of that scrutiny, she expressed a fundamental frustration with how women are understood.\u201cSo I\u2019ve gotten kind of used to it,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cbut it still does still pose this conundrum: How is a woman supposed to behave? Well, how about the way she is? And then people should figure out her as opposed to her having to figure out everybody else.\u201d\nClinton on the rigors of campaigning:\nw.soundcloud.com\nClinton on the scrutiny applied to women public figures:\nw.soundcloud.com\n", "title": "Hillary Clinton On The Demands Of Campaigning: \u201cIt\u2019s Not Easy\u201d", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/hillary-clinton-on-the-demands-of-campaigning-its-not-easy", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "women"], "people": ["Margaret Thatcher", "Hillary Clinton", "Nicole Hockley"], "orgs": ["New Hampshire Democratic Party", "Senate"], "authors": [{"author_id": 6688, "fullname": "ruby cramer", "primary_org": "buzzfeed"}], "date_written": "2015-10-12 03:01:33", "org": "buzzfeed", "article_id": "77127f2a9700ba050d04ebba844580b2", "date_access": "2015-10-12 03:10:13.795957"}
