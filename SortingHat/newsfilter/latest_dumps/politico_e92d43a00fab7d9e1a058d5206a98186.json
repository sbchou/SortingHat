The company says it had \u201cno role in monitoring the content or source of data stored by Managed Service Providers clients such as Platte River Networks.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Platte River, at the FBI\u2019s request, is turning over the Datto device it used for on-site back-up of Clinton\u2019s system, the Daily Caller reported Wednesday.\nPlatte River has already turned over Clinton\u2019s server to the FBI after the intelligence community inspector general expressed concern about the number of classified emails on the unsecured system, including two messages the intelligence community said were \u201ctop secret.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Data firm gives FBI all backed-up Clinton emails", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/hillary-clinton-email-server-fbi-platte-river-214521", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["Josh Earnest", "Burgess Everett", "Mary E.
