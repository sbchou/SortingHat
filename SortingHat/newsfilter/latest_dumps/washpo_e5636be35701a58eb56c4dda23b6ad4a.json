(Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  Is the State Department press team harboring some irritation with Hillary Rodham Clinton lately? We can\u2019t imagine why. Sure, they\u2019re overrun with questions and document requests related to Clinton\u2019s e-mails as secretary of state. And yes, Clinton decided to oppose the Keystone Pipeline while State still ponders it. She\u2019s also advocated\u00a0for a no-fly zone over Syria, counter to the administration\u2019s position. We\u2019re sure they still wish her well. Yet over the weekend our colleague Ed O\u2019Keefe shared on Twitter an article about Clinton losing a key union endorsement. He noticed it was favorited by one interesting account: @StateDeptPress. The official account for the Foggy Bottom press operation.     Why would State\u2019s press office like a story so hurtful to Clinton? \u201cFat fingers. No excuse,\u201d Elizabeth Kennedy Trudeau, director of press relations at State, told the Loop when she called us (quickly, we might add) Monday. \u201cClearly if you look at our favorites and retweets we\u2019re apolitical.\u201d The story linked to in the tweet highlighted how a firefighters union was poised to endorse Clinton, but is now holding back until Joe Biden decides whether to enter the race. When we flagged it, the favorite was immediately removed, Trudeau said. She also sent an official statement that offered \u201cregrets\u201d for the \u201cinadvertent favoriting of a tweet \u2026\u201d We\u2019ll take her at her word that this was just the slip of a thumb, but there is other evidence to suggest that those in the current State Department are not enamored with the former head of their agency. Last week, the Associated Press reported that State\u2019s senior adviser for communications, and one-time acting spokesperson, Marie Harf, has been in discussions with Biden\u2019s team about potentially joining his presidential campaign if he runs. Is Trudeau sure the favoriting of the tweet didn\u2019t reflect any negative feelings toward Clinton? \u201cWe pride ourselves on working for every secretary of state equally\u201d she said, diplomatically.", "byline": "", "description": "State press Twitter account says it inadvertently favorited a tweet about Hillary Clinton losing a key endorsement.", "title": "State's press team didn't mean to favorite that tweet with bad news for Hillary Clinton", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/10/06/states-press-team-didnt-mean-to-favorite-that-tweet-with-bad-news-for-hillary-clinton/", "topics": ["personality", "other", "immigration"], "people": ["Ed O'Keefe", "Melina Mara", "Joe Biden", "Marie Harf", "Hillary Clinton", "Hillary Rodham Clinton"], "orgs": ["State Department", "Bike Tech", "Keystone Pipeline"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30989, "fullname": "colby itkowitz", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-10-06 12:19:23", "org": "washpo", "article_id": "e5636be35701a58eb56c4dda23b6ad4a", "date_access": "2015-10-06 11:30:07.226881"}
