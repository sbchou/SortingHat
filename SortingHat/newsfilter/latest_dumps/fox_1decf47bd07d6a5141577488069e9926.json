{"body": "\n\n\n\n\n(REUTERS/Brian Snyder)\n\n\n\nFor generations of Americans, the opportunity to go to college has served as the pathway to social mobility. Today, however, predatory for-profit colleges are giving students and taxpayers the shaft by trading on this American dream\u2014and some prominent Republicans are defending these institutions.\nThis year alone, the two largest for-profit college chains in the country came under heightened scrutiny\u2014and another one collapsed outright. In April, the Department of Education levied a $30 million fine against for-profit giant Corinthian Colleges Inc. for its misrepresentation of job placement rates. On hundreds of occasions, Corinthian lied to students about their job prospects as part of recruitment, promising them high-quality jobs on real career ladders in exchange for their tuition dollars and hard work.\nBy April, Corinthian Colleges collapsed and filed for bankruptcy, leaving tens of thousands of students with crippling debt and no recourse.\nFor-profit colleges are far more concerned with making a buck than giving students the high-quality education they pay for and deserve. On average, they spend an estimated 23 percent of their revenue on marketing and recruiting, while 19 percent goes to profit and only 17 percent goes to instruction. Compare that to public community colleges, where more than 80 percent of revenue goes to instruction, and you can see that for-profit colleges are just that\u2014for profits, not for students.\n\nFor-profit colleges are far more concerned with making a buck than giving students the high-quality education they pay for and deserve.\n\nThese practices mean hardships for real people. In Gerardo Sandoval\u2019s case, going to ITT Tech meant spending $55,000 for a degree in computer and graphic design, what he calls \u201cthe worst choice I\u2019ve ever made in life.\u201d ITT Tech recruiters and staff used pressure tactics to get Gerardo to sign for tens of thousands in student loans while providing an embarrassingly poor education. His degree proved to have no value to employers; Gerardo made less than he did with just a high school diploma. Even worse, ITT Tech\u2019s career services made him lie and report that he was making three times as much so that their programs could appear successful.\nWe can\u2019t be a country that tells students that college is really important but then allows predatory institutions to stick them with crippling debt, worthless degrees and an uncertain future. We desperately need to fix what\u2019s broken and protect the rights of students.\nBut instead of standing up for students, Republicans in Congress and on the presidential trail are defending for profits. No matter how many candidates may crowd onto the Republican debate stage, there\u2019s no debating that GOP presidential hopefuls love the for-profit college industry.\nIn June 2014, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio wrote the Department of Education, pleading for it to \u201cdemonstrate leniency\u201d toward Corinthian Colleges, which at the time was under federal investigation for its scams. The department had to remind Rubio that Corinthian \u201cadmitted to falsifying placement rates and/or grade and attendance records at various institutions.\u201d\nAs governor of Florida, Jeb Bush reduced for-profit oversight in the state,\u00a0leaving in place a \u201ccommission\u201d\u00a0that failed to act on any complaints in 15 years, while\u00a0loosening rules\u00a0to funnel more taxpayer money into the industry. His New Jersey counterpart, Gov. Chris Christie,\u00a0has lobbied for the University of Phoenix\u2014the largest for-profit college in the United States\u2014and attacked public universities by slashing state funding for higher education. The University of Phoenix receives\u00a0more than 90 percent of its revenue\u00a0from taxpayers, yet it spends\u00a0two and half times more\u00a0on marketing than it does on instruction, and exploits veterans by taking their GI benefits and\u00a0spending them on lavish advertisements.\nIn Louisiana, Gov. Bobby Jindal\u2019s brother was a\u00a0hired gun\u00a0for the for-profit industry. But, of course, Gov. Jindal failed to mention this fact while\u00a0pushing to loosen the rules\u00a0for for-profits and expand the industry. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee\u00a0worked for Victory University, a for-profit based in Memphis, Tenn. Four years after signing on, and in spite of Huckabee\u2019s best efforts, Victory collapsed, leaving 1,600 students stranded and in debt.\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\u00a0went to bat\u00a0for predatory for-profit ITT Tech, which currently faces\u00a0fraud charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission\u00a0for concealing its massive student default rates. ITT has had more students default than graduate\u00a0at 45 campuses across the country.\nIt\u2019s bad enough that the skyrocketing cost of college has made higher education diplomas as much a financial liability as a career asset. Students want to go to school to better their lives and those of their families. It\u2019s time we offered them a path to that dream\u2014and removed the for-profit debris obscuring it.\nTogether, we urge Fox News and Facebook, the hosts of the first Republican presidential primary debate, to ask the candidates to explain their coziness with an industry that is compromising the American dream. Why are they for profits, and not for students?\n\nRandi Weingarten is president of the 1.6 million-member American Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO, which represents teachers; paraprofessionals and school-related personnel; higher education faculty and staff; nurses and other health care professionals; local, state and federal government employees; and early childhood educators.\n\n\n+ FollowFoxNewsOpinion on Facebook\n\n", "byline": "", "description": "Predatory for-profit colleges are giving students and taxpayers the shaft by trading on this American dream.", "title": "Why we want Republicans to debate for-profit colleges", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/J2S_dIAmRjU/why-want-republicans-to-debate-for-profit-colleges.html", "topics": ["personality", "terrorism"], "people": ["Randi Weingarten", "Chris Christie", "Jeb Bush", "Brian Snyder", "Marco Rubio", "Mike Huckabee", "Bobby Jindal", "Scott Walker"], "orgs": ["Tenn", "Congress", "Corinthian Colleges", "American Federation of Teachers", "GOP", "Department of Education", "Securities and Exchange Commission"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-08-06 14:56:00", "org": "fox", "article_id": "1decf47bd07d6a5141577488069e9926", "date_access": "2015-08-06 17:20:06.285972"}
