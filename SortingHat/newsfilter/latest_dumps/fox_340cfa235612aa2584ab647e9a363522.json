At times, it seems like that is her main function in the race. But Fiorina attributes that to selective coverage.\n\n\u201cThe media happens to pull out a set of comments about Hillary Clinton, who of course is who we\u2019ll be running against in 2016,\u201d Fiorina says.\n\nOne reporter even told her that the way she goes after Hillary is \u201cmean.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany people have asked, \u2018Are you doing that because you\u2019re a woman and she\u2019s a woman?\u2019 No, I\u2019m doing it because it my world, track record counts.\n\n\u201cBecause I am a woman, there are many things she can\u2019t say. She can\u2019t play the gender card. She can\u2019t talk about being the first woman president. She can\u2019t talk about the war on women.\u201d\n\nAll this circles back to whether Fiorina is getting inordinate attention in the Republican field because every other candidate, potential candidate and wannabe is male. Clearly, especially with Hillary on the other side, it doesn\u2019t hurt. Fiorina has the standard I\u2019m-not-running-because-I\u2019m-a-woman line down pat, but she\u2019s also quick to add, \u201cby the way, I look different.\u201d\n\nPerhaps as important as gender is the fact that she\u2019s never held elective office. In her one previous political foray, Fiorina ran for a Senate seat in California against Barbara Boxer and lost. And that has the political pros doubtful that she could actually win the GOP nomination against the likes of Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Marco Rubio.\n\n\u201cSome in the media may perceive that,\u201d she admits before pivoting to a better answer: \u201cFor voters out here, me not being a professional politician is generally speaking an asset. People are tired of politics. They feel disconnected from the political process.\u201d\n\nFiorina\u2019s media stock is clearly rising as she gives speeches and does interviews. Outsider candidates with business backgrounds, from Herman Cain to Ross Perot, often have a natural appeal over those who get their hands dirty in the grubby business of politics. But they also have a tendency to flame out.\n\nIn Fiorina\u2019s case, her pitch could be complicated by the fact that H-P fired her in 2005 after a six-year tenure as chief executive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very transparent about the fact that I was fired in a boardroom brawl at Hewlett-Packard,\u201d Fiorina tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s not unfair at all to question that. What\u2019s unfair is when people gloss over the facts.\u201d And she rattles off what she views as her accomplishments: \u201cWe doubled the company. We quadrupled cash flow\u2026\u201d \u00a0\n\nBut the political arena is very different, especially in such a crowded primary field. While some of the Republican candidates are already jabbing each other, Fiorina doesn\u2019t plan to join them.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t need to spend a lot of energy distinguishing myself from other Republican candidates because everything about me is different,\u201d she says.\n\nClick for more from Media BuzzHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).
