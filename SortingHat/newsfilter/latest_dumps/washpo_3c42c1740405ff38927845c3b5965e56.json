{"body": "Look\u00a0around the country,\u00a0and you'll find\u00a0the same impassioned argument about pay for low-wage workers\u00a0is taking place. The $15 minimum wage was\u00a0approved in Seattle last year,\u00a0and is currently\u00a0being proposed in New York City.\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00a0is pushing for a federal $15 floor. Donald Trump, the\u00a0Republican presidential candidate leading the latest polls,\u00a0would prefer it remain as is, at $7.25 an hour. But raising\u00a0the minimum wage\u00a0carries a\u00a0different significance depending on where you live.\u00a0A dollar\u00a0goes a lot further in the South than it does in New England, as my colleague Niraj Chokshi\u00a0explained earlier this month. The Pew Research Center used regional price parities, supplied by the Bureau of Economic Analysis\u00a0(BEA), to estimate how fluctuations in purchasing power affect the real implications\u00a0of a $15 minimum wage around the country. Many of the findings are fairly obvious\u2014in New York City, where things are 22.3 percent more expensive than the national average, the hike\u00a0wouldn't mean quite as much as it would in Macon, Georgia, where prices are 12.2 percent below average. But the overarching\u00a0takeaway is still an important one.     The map above shows the real purchasing power of $15 in every state.\u00a0In Honolulu, the\u00a0priciest urban area in the United States, a $15 minimum wage is only worth about\u00a0$12.24; in rural West Virginia, meanwhile, where prices are lower than anywhere else in the country, $15 is worth closer to $20. The only place where $15 is actually worth $15 is Allentown, Pennsylvania, according to Pew. In some senses, local, price-driven minimum wages already exist. \u201cThere is a strong correlation between the purchasing power parity data and the minimum wage amount, which shows that local policymakers are actually responsive to the conditions of their states,\u201d Alan Cole, an economist with the Tax Foundation, told The Washington Post earlier last month. The picture is similar to one BEA data painted recently, which showed the value of state-level minimum wages. States with higher minimum wages don't necessarily pay employees a higher relative salary.     And it underscores an important part of national minimum wage policy that doesn't often get discussed.\u00a0If the goal is the ensure that all workers are paid a living wage\u2014whatever that living wage might be\u2014and the cost of living varies not just by state, but by\u00a0county, then regional pay floors make more sense. At the moment, there is at least one aspiring presidential candidate seems to agree. Democratic presidential hopeful\u00a0Hilary Clinton has said she supports a $15 minimum\u2014just not for everyone.\u00a0\"I think part of the reason that the Congress and very strong Democratic supporters of increasing the minimum wage are trying to debate and determine what\u2019s the national floor is because there are different economic environments,\" Clinton said in a town hall\u00a0in New Hampshire last month. \"What you can do in L.A. or in New York may not work in other places.\"", "byline": "", "description": "The fight to raise what America's lowest paid workers earn carries with it a very different meaning depending on where it's being waged", "title": "What raising the minimum wage to $15 would actually mean around the U.S.", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/08/03/map-how-much-a-15-minimum-wage-would-actually-be-worth-around-the-u-s/", "topics": ["economy"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Bernie Sanders", "Niraj Chokshi", "Alan Cole", "Hilary Clinton"], "orgs": ["Tax Foundation", "Pew Research Center", "Congress", "Bureau of Economic Analysis"], "authors": [{"author_id": 31050, "fullname": "roberto a. ferdman", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-08-03 17:01:16", "org": "washpo", "article_id": "3c42c1740405ff38927845c3b5965e56", "date_access": "2015-08-03 16:20:28.852726"}
