He\u2019s taking longer to shake off controversial remarks, delivering relatively subdued performances during interviews and campaign appearances, and, most disconcertingly, stalling in polls.\nThe latest national Quinnipiac University survey released Thursday provided some fuel to wishful rivals. Trump still leads among registered Republican voters with 25 percent, statistically unchanged from last month's Quinnipiac survey that put him at 28 percent. Yet it's the second major national poll this week showing a slight decrease from last month \u2014 Trump experienced an 8-point drop in the CNN/ORC survey released Sunday. (A Fox poll released Wednesday evening also showed Trump with relatively stalled momentum, and a Bloomberg survey of the GOP field showed Trump in a holding pattern at 21 percent).\nBut even before the latest polls, rivals were taking heart that maybe, just maybe, the air has begun to seep out of the Trump balloon. \u201cThe great salesman Donald Trump may in fact be failing at the single-most important thing in politics \u2014 and that is to seal the deal,\u201d said a strategist at a rival campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very long summer. It\u2019s been a deluge of 24 hours a day, 7 days a week Donald Trump \u2026 When you reach that point of oversaturation, which I believe Trump is at right now, you only start to go down.\u201d\nCurt Anderson, Bobby Jindal\u2019s chief strategist, asked whether Trump had peaked based on recent evidence, had some harsh words. \u201cI think the bloom is off the rose for sure. Every act gets old. Plays run on Broadway only for so long. The first five times he calls people an idiot it\u2019s funny. I think at this point, it\u2019s kind of gotten stale.\"\nAnderson said Jindal gets a good reception every time he bashes Trump on the trail. \u201cIf you look at Republicans and Iowa caucus voters, they\u2019re serious about their vote. They\u2019re professional voters \u2026 It\u2019s not going to happen for him there.\u201d\nTrump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Jindal's attacks are absurd. \u201cWe won't respond to the failing campaign of Governor Bobby Jindal who continues to receive less than 1 percent support in the most recent Fox News poll,\" she told POLITICO. \nAdding pressure to Trump, Scott Walker late Wednesday made an explicit call to take out the real estate mogul, telling top donors that he wants other struggling candidates to drop out of the presidential race so Republicans can coalesce behind an alternative to Trump.\nWalker, who dropped out of the race on Monday, said others should also considering bowing out because \u201cin the end, if we narrow the field to just a few quality, positive alternatives to the frontrunner, it's not only good for the party it's good for the country.\u201d\nTrump, in a statement, brushed off Walker's proposal. \u201cThe voters have focused on my proven ability to get things done and my positive vision to Make America Great Again. That is why I am leading in every poll,\u201d he said. \nWhile it\u2019s unclear if anyone will answer Walker\u2019s call, it\u2019s undeniable that Trump has lost some mojo. Less tangible evidence, like pictures of empty seats at a Trump event, repeated questions from supporters about sagging poll numbers and more bullish rivals taking new strategic tacks to get under Trump\u2019s skin have begun to pervade the frontrunner\u2019s narrative. And even though it\u2019s too soon to tell if his dip in polls is temporary, it\u2019s coincided with sharp rises from former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.\nTrump himself is showing signs that his lack of momentum may be getting to him, going out of his way at back-to-back events in South Carolina on Tuesday to point to his still-relatively-strong poll performances.\nTrump supporters told POLITICO they\u2019re hopeful he'll will rebound, but they weren\u2019t shy about pointing out his mistakes of late \u2014 including his gratuitous comment about Fiorina\u2019s face.\n\u201cIt was so unnecessary because he doesn't have to worry about her at all, and why he did that I have no idea,\u201d said Darlene Peavy, 45, a real estate agent, during a Trump rally in South Carolina on Wednesday night. \"I think he's down a little bit because of his comment.\"\nAfter dominating the first presidential debate, sucking up a good portion of the airtime, Trump faded a bit during this month\u2019s debate on CNN, landing fewer zingers and ceding memorable lines to candidates such as Carly Fiorina, who countered Trump\u2019s \u201clook at that face\u201d comments with a firm condemnation: \u201cI think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.\u201d\nLinda Coffield, 61, a federal employee, said at Trump\u2019s Wednesday rally that she had hoped Trump would have performed better in last week\u2019s debate.\"I wanted him to be more forceful,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted him to shut them down. I wanted him to be stronger\"\nHe also caught plenty of flak for failing to correct an audience member last week at a New Hampshire town hall who called Obama is a Muslim and not even an American. \nWhile Trump has surged in the past after making inflammatory comments, he seemingly hasn\u2019t shaken these as quickly, and pronounced to a crowd of business leaders on Wednesday, \"I'm so tired of this politically correct crap.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s also facing the momentum of the other outsider candidates, notably retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Fiorina. The Quinnipiac poll released on Thursday showed Carson coming in second with 17 percent, an increase of 5 points from last month, followed by Fiorina at 12 percent, up 7 points.\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, meanwhile, came in at 10 percent, up 3 points, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at 9 percent, up 2 points, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 7 percent, who remained steady. Other candidates polled at 2 percent or less, with 9 percent undecided.\nBen Schreckinger and Nick Gass contributed to this report.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The real estate mogul is losing steam at the polls, giving rivals hope that a Trump slump is taking hold.", "title": "Trump momentum shows signs of stalling", "url": "http://www.politico.com/donald-trump-2016-momentum-stalling", "topics": ["personality", "trade"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Jesse Rifkin", "Rachael Bade", "Henry C.
