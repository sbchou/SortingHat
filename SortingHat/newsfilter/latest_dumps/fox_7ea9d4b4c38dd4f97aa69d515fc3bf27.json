Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush also are polling consistently well.\u00a0\nRather, the 11th-hour dash is among those in the middle and back of the pack, competing for the last of 10 slots in the prime-time event at Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena.\u00a0\nThe Aug. 6 debate is hosted by Fox News, in conjunction with Facebook and the Ohio Republican Party. \u00a0\nThe 9 p.m. ET stage will be open to the top 10 candidates in recent national polls. With 17 total candidates now in the race \u2013 former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore was the latest, announcing his bid Thursday \u2013 not everyone will make the cut. \u00a0\nThose who don\u2019t can qualify for an earlier debate, at 5 p.m. Fox News has eased the criteria for that debate, and candidates will no longer have to reach at least 1 percent in the polls to make the stage, though there are other criteria. \u00a0\n\nThe only Fair & Balanced App \u2122 that gives you the Power to Decide!

Chris Christie and Texas Gov. Rick Perry. \u00a0\nPerry challenged poll-leader Trump to a pull-up contest after a week of pummeling the billionaire real estate tycoon for his comments on Mexican illegal immigrants and Sen. John McCain. \u00a0\nMeanwhile, Christie declared war on marijuana this week, promising Coloradans they had better enjoy legalized pot today because he will enforce federal laws against it when he is in the White House. \u00a0\nSpeaking with Fox News on Thursday, the Garden State guv said \"we're very confident we'll be at the 9:00 debate.\"\u00a0\nAfter spending the last several months going after Bush \u2013 now third in the RealClearPolitics poll average, behind Walker \u2013 Christie is competing these days more with Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Christie clocked in at 3 percent in the same RCP average, right behind Kasich, putting them on the tail end of the top 10. \u00a0\nPotentially outside the margin, but fighting to get in, are Perry, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, ex-Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. \u00a0\nFormer New York Gov. George Pataki and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham are further behind. Each, though, has been trying to take on Trump in recent weeks, with the latter putting out a viral video of himself destroying a cell phone \u2013 a response to Trump giving out his number during the McCain flap (Graham had lashed out at Trump for questioning his friend McCain\u2019s heroism, triggering Trump\u2019s ire). \u00a0\n\u201cI think the top eight candidates are comfortable where they are,\u201d said Jones. \u201c[The others] are pushing the envelope with the goal of rising above the dust that was created when you have 17 candidates running.\u201d \u00a0\nNot making the prime-time cut isn\u2019t the end of the road by any means, and there\u2019s still plenty of time before the Iowa caucuses. \u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think being left out of the debate is a death knell,\u201d said Steve Deace, who hosts a conservative radio talk show in the Hawkeye State. However, he said, \u201cit can hurt from a momentum standpoint, in that it is a spotlight you are not getting.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt will be a huge spotlight and I think for someone who is underfunded and under-organized who is impressive when they are in front of people, like Bobby Jindal, this is the spotlight they are going to need.\u201d \u00a0\nPerhaps an indication of how comfortable the GOP front-runner feels right now, Trump is in Scotland and attended the Women's British Open at one of his resorts \u2013 though he still talked campaign shop with reporters Thursday. \u00a0\nBush, though, is back on the stump stateside on Friday, with plans to address the National Urban League, along with retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Walker and Christie are campaigning in Iowa Friday, as is Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. Kasich is in New Hampshire.\u00a0\nFor all the buzz and attention surrounding Trump, there is now pressure on him to perform. \u00a0\n\u201cHe is clearly the man of the hour from a buzz standpoint,\u201d Deace said. \u201cI think with one or two exceptions, the goal of the others is to get him to go from zany to crazy, to self-immolate.\u201d \u00a0\nBut that might be difficult, considering he\u2019s weathered a string of controversies over his blunt remarks since entering the race. The worst thing that can happen is for Trump to pull his punches and wimp out, Deace said. \u201cHis entire campaign is based on him being a blunt instrument he can get back at Washington with. If he dulls those edges, that would be the death knell for him.\u201d \u00a0\nDeace said the others, though, have something to gain by not going for the bait. \u00a0\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see how Scott Walker performs in this environment. I think we have to see if this [debate] diminishes his stature or he is able to craft an everyman persona who is a nice contrast to the bigger personalities,\u201d he said. On the other hand, \u201cI think Ben Carson has a much more reserved, laid-back way of communicating than the rest of these candidates. Will he bore people, or be seen as the adult in the room?\u201d\u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "Less than a week before a bushel of 2016 Republican presidential hopefuls square off for the first time in two Fox News debates, billionaire businessman Donald Trump is holding firm to his primary lead -- while his lower-polling rivals battle for visibility in hopes of making the cut for the prime-time stage.", "title": "GOP candidates jockey for position in final debate dash", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/most-popular/~3/fKzzEQl5EBo/", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Mark Jones", "Jim Gilmore", "Rick Santorum", "Chris Christie", "Lindsey Graham", "Rand Paul", "Jeb Bush", "Rick Perry", "John Kasich", "Donald Trump", "George Pataki", "Bobby Jindal", "Ben Carson", "Carly Fiorina", "Scott Walker", "Steve Deace"], "orgs": ["Rice University", "Power", "RCP", "Baker Institute", "Quicken Loans Arena", "National Urban League", "Fair & Balanced App", "Ohio Republican Party", "Hewlett Packard", "GOP"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-07-31 11:00:09", "org": "fox", "article_id": "7ea9d4b4c38dd4f97aa69d515fc3bf27", "date_access": "2015-07-31 14:50:05.687676"}
