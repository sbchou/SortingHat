{"body": "WASHINGTON Outgoing House Speaker John Boehner lashed out Sunday at foes in and out of Congress who pressured him into resigning, calling them \u201cabsolutely unrealistic\u201d about what they can accomplish legislatively and accusing some of being \u201cfalse prophets\u201d who pushed strategies that \u201cnever had a chance\u201d of working.\nSpeaking Sunday on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d a relaxed and sometimes emotional Boehner, R-Ohio, didn\u2019t hold back when asked about a group of conservative Republicans within the House of Representatives and like-minded interest groups who claimed that he was blocking their agenda and was unwilling standing up to President Barack Obama.\n\u201cAbsolutely, they\u2019re unrealistic,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cThe Bible says beware of false prophets. And there are people out there, you know, spreading noise about how much can get done. I mean this whole notion that we\u2019re going to shut down the government to get rid of Obamacare in 2013 \u2013 this plan never had a chance.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cBut over the course of the August recess in 2013 and in September, a lot of my Republican colleagues who knew this was a fool\u2019s errand \u2013 really, they were getting pressure from home to do this.\u201d\nWhen asked if the \u201cfalse prophets\u201d included Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, a 2016 Republican presidential candidate, Boehner told \u201cFace the Nation\u201d host John Dickerson \u201cYou can pick out a lot of names. I\u2019ll let you choose them.\u201d\nBoehner then referred Dickerson to comments he made at a Colorado fundraiser where the speaker called Cruz a \u201cjackass.\u201d Cruz earned Boehner\u2019s ire when for advising House Republican conservatives.\n\u201cAnd so, we\u2019ve got groups here in town, members in the House and Senate here in town, who whipped people into a frenzy believing they can accomplish things that they know \u2013 they know \u2013 are never going to happen.\u201d\nWilliam Douglas: 202-383-6026, @williamgdouglas", "byline": "", "description": "Outgoing speaker blasts some Republican House members for 2013 shutdown\nAccuses foes of pursuing strategies that they know won\u2019t work\nBoehner believes \u201cchange comes slowly, and obviously too slowly for some\u201d\n\u2026\nClick to Continue \u00bb", "title": "Boehner attacks conservative foes who wanted him out", "url": "http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/congress/article36756699.html", "topics": ["health", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["William Douglas", "John Boehner", "John Dickerson", "Barack Obama", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": ["Senate", "House of Representatives", "The Bible", "Congress"], "authors": [{"author_id": 33904, "fullname": "william douglas", "primary_org": "mcclatchy"}], "date_written": "2015-09-27 17:54:27", "org": "mcclatchy", "article_id": "5e23856a2fabecf5b301dc58a70dcaab", "date_access": "2015-09-27 17:00:04.761237"}
