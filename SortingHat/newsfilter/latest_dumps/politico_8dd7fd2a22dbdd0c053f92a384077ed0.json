It is expected to be contentious with multiple candidates vying for each position as the conference struggles to regain its footing after the Ohio Republican\u2019s surprise announcement last week.\nBoehner said in a statement that the Republican Conference made it \u201cclear\u201d lawmakers want to move quickly to elect new leaders.\n\u201cAfter consulting with our conference, a large majority of our members have made clear they want these elections held next week,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cWith their considerations in mind, the House leadership elections will take place on Thursday, Oct. 8.\u201d \nMajority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) is expected to win the speaker's gavel. He\u2019s running against Florida Republican Rep. Daniel Webster, who unsuccessfully tried to beat Boehner in the speaker election earlier this year.\nIf McCarthy wins, that opens the door for a majority leader election. Reps. Tom Price of Georgia and Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who is the current majority whip, both are vying for that post. \nIf Scalise wins, there will also be a race for majority whip.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "House Republicans will hold elections for their leaders on October 8", "title": "Leadership elections scheduled for next week", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/the-gavel/2015/09/republicans-house-leadership-elections-214262", "topics": ["immigration", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Katy O'Donnell", "Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Ari Shapiro", "Kenneth P.
