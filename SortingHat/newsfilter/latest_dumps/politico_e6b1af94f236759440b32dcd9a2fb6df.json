Their daughter Chelsea and her family \u2026 are also expected to join them. Clinton\u2019s two brothers, Hugh and Tony Rodham, are also staying with the family \u2026 Despite the optics, longtime friends and supporters said there was never any real discussion of the Clintons vacationing anywhere else but the ritzy Hamptons where they have gone for years.\u201d\nRead more: http://politi.co/1E8HmgA\nFriday, Friday, gotta talk yourself in knots about birthright citizenship on Friday.

Send your tips, complaints and hottest hot takes to: hjackson@politico.com.\nTRAIL MIX: Here\u2019s what\u2019s popping on the campaign trail\nIn today\u2019s campaign news, SCOTT WALKER 2.0 is in a bit of a tangled web on birthright citizenship. HILLARY CLINTON\u2019s campaign is on the look out for impostors. Top-tier Republicans \u2014 but not Ohio Gov. JOHN KASICH \u2014 descend on a forum in the Buckeye State. TED CRUZ attacks Jimmy Carter\u2019s policies a day after he talks about his cancer diagnosis. SEC Country gets ready for DONALD TRUMP. \nTHE DAILY CLINTON:\nPRESS STARVED: POLITICO\u2019s Dylan Byers reports: \u201cHILLARY CLINTON has been running for president for well over four months now. In that time, she has given just one nationally televised interview \u2014 despite promises from both her and her campaign that she intended to do more \u2026 The Clinton listening tour officially ended on July 12, and since then the national media has been forced to endure 40 days and 40 nights without the promised interviews. The fast has only contributed to longstanding press frustrations with Clinton's limited availability.\u201d http://politi.co/1JuXpaL\nVAST RIGHT WING CONSPIRACY: Time: \u201cHILLARY CLINTON\u2019s campaign offices around the country have been put on alert after at least two women approached Iowa staff under the guise of being supporters in an apparent effort to catch the campaign engaging in improper or illegal activity, a Clinton campaign official said. The motivations of the women is not known, but their alleged techniques match those of Project Veritas, the conservative group run by James O\u2019Keefe, which specializes in undercover stings meant to embarrass liberal groups and politicians. The group declined to comment on the Clinton campaign\u2019s allegations.\u201d http://ti.me/1E8KRn7\nTWILIGHT PROBLEM: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a vampire. She\u2019s going to have to find a stake and put it right through the heart of these emails in some way.\u201d\nThat\u2019s California\u2019s evergreen Gov. Jerry Brown on HILLARY CLINTON\u2019s email troubles in a pre-taped interview schedule to air Sunday on Meet the Press.\nTHE PROGRESSIVE RESISTANCE: \nCHANNELING HOPE: Washington Post, from South Carolina: Bernie Sanders fired up a lively crowd of supporters Friday as he began a campaign swing through this early primary state that seven years ago helped to boost the candidacy of another senator who many thought couldn\u2019t beat the odds of winning the presidency. Sanders even made reference to President Obama\u2019s historic election in 2008 as evidence that the country \u201chas in fact made real progress of overcoming our legacy of historical racism \u2026 But the bad news is racism still remains a much too real part of American life.\u201d http://wapo.st/1fuXJs2\nHART AND SOUL: Los Angeles Times quotes MARTIN O\u2019MALLEY as drawing inspiration from his work on the 1984 Gary Hart race against Vice President Walter Mondale. \u201cHaving seen that before, it\u2019s a little easier for me to have the faith to walk across these months.\u201d The Times observes a \u201cconspicuously jet-lagged O\u2019Malley\u201d spoke as \u201che gripped a paper cup from Starbucks.\u201dhttp://lat.ms/1KzEpCG\nBIDEN OPPO: The New York Times revisits JOE BIDEN\u2019s prominent role on the Senate Judiciary Committee and crime bills of the \u201890s could hurt an as-yet-unannounced campaign. \u201cThe rapid shift in mood that those efforts reflect \u2014 a reaction to falling crime rates and a renewed attention to issues of racial injustice \u2014 could prove one of many hurdles ... if he decides to become a candidate for president.\u201d http://nyti.ms/1MDtrk8\nBERNING HOT TAKE: The Huffington Post: \u201cBERNIE SANDERS is the only Democrat gaining attention nationwide who isn't linked to an FBI investigation. Why some Democrats still continue to believe a candidate can win the White House with the Justice Department, FBI, and other intelligence agencies investigating this candidate's email practices, seems to overlook one obvious fact. Nobody has ever won the White House with an ongoing FBI and Justice Department investigation, and it doesn't seem that the FBI or Justice Department will cease investigating Clinton's email saga\u201d http://huff.to/1I0r9Fd\nTRUMP ON THE STUMP:\nOFF MESSAGE: POLITICO\u2019s Eliza Collins reports: DONALD TRUMP may be the spinning top that won\u2019t fall down, but his Iowa co-chair is cringing at some of his recent statements.\n\u201cOn illegal immigration, he wants to gather up the families and ship them out? That was a boondoggle. The caucusgoers are like, \u2018What?\u2019 That was a big mistake,\u201d Richard Thornton told The Des Moines Register \u2026 Thorton still thinks the Republican candidate can plow forward. http://politi.co/1NKQok3\nMOBILE HOME: Washington Post: \u00a0Mobile, Ala., \u201cdoesn't usually host presidential primary rallies. But \u2026 Donald Trump will take over Ladd-Peebles Stadium, usually home to high school football games on Friday nights, not presidential pep rallies. Trump's campaign expects 35,000 to attend.\u201d http://wapo.st/1hyc5d5\nBUT WHY? http://bit.ly/1Eawyip\nTRANSFORMING TRUMP: USA Today: In interviews with activists, analysts and Trump supporters in early voting states, a complicated picture emerges of what it would take to transform the billionaire real estate developer from a front-running candidate to a plausible nominee. Although not many people beyond Trump's orbit see it playing out that way, what is clear is that Trump has significant appeal with core GOP voters \u2014 and significant hurdles that may prove difficult to overcome. Not that his supporters are worried. \"I think he will win in Iowa, he will win in New Hampshire, and he will win in South Carolina,\" said Stephen B. Stepanek, a Trump state co-chairman and volunteer from Milford, N.H. \"And that momentum is going to carry him.\" http://usat.ly/1htpQdd\nTONE CHANGE: Days after a pair of Boston brothers cited him as inspiration for beating a homeless Hispanic man, DONALD TRUMP draws a forceful line on Twitter: \u201c@realDonaldTrump Boston incident is terrible. We need energy and passion, but we must treat each other with respect. I would never condone violence.\u201d http://bit.ly/1LnVz9m More here: http://politi.co/1JqwOdd\nWALKER\u2019s WORLD:\nNEITHER ADRIFT, NOR ANCHORED: After days of coverage noting his support for repealing birthright citizenship, SCOTT WALKER tells CNBC \u201cI\u2019m not taking an opinion one way or the other.\u201d http://cnb.cx/1I0hheL\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NO POSITION: POLITICO\u2019s Eliza Collins has more here http://politi.co/1DbK280\n\u2018LIVES\u2019 STUMBLE: CNN: SCOTT WALKER \u201cstumbled through a question Friday about whether he would meet with representatives of the Black Lives Matter movement. When asked whether he'd be willing to meet with activists, Walker dismissed the possibility by saying, 'Who knows who that is?' 'I meet with voters. Who knows who that is,' Walker said, apparently referring to Black Lives Matter activists. When pressed on the matter, Walker said he would 'talk to American voters.' 'It's the same way as saying we meet with the tea party. Who is the tea party? There's hundreds of thousands of people,' he said.\" http://cnn.it/1U5jah8\nNO LEFT TURNS: The Wall Street Journal: \u201cAt each step in\u201d SCOTT WALKER\u2019s \u201ccareer, he has run against Republican opponents with one overriding strategy: Never letting anybody get to the right of him. That helps explain his move this week to instantly embrace the toughest position on immigration after Republican presidential primary opponent Donald Trump released his policy platform on the matter.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1hPlY5Y\n\u2018BAMA NETWORK: AL.com: SCOTT WALKER appointed \u201cAlabama Senate Majority Leader Greg Reed \u2026 as the Alabama chairman of his presidential bid.\u201d Walker\u2019s headed to Alabama on Saturday to headline the state GOP\u2019s summer luncheon in Talladega. http://bit.ly/1WJSqXx\nTED\u2019s TURN:\nCARTER ATTACK: Bloomberg catches TED CRUZ ripping the Jimmy Carter administration in Iowa \u2026 a full day after the former president\u2019s wrenching press conference about his cancer diagnosis. \u201cAsked later by a Register reporter if the timing of his remarks on Carter could be considered insensitive, Cruz stood firm. \"We can always have a discussion about public policy,\" he said. \"The public policy of the late 1970s didn't work. And the point that I made here that was so important is that in response to the failures of public policy in the late 1970s there was a grassroots movement of millions of men and women that rose up and became the Reagan revolution. And the same thing is happening today.\" http://bloom.bg/1TYjP9i\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 FLASHBACK: Cruz apologized in June for joking about Vice President Joe Biden just days after his son died from brain cancer.\nJUNO NOTHING: POLITICO\u2019s Katie Glueck reports: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and actress Ellen Page, of \u201cJuno\u201d fame, got into a testy and free-wheeling discussion Friday over gay rights here at the Iowa State Fair. \u201cI\u2019m happy to answer your question but not to have a back-and-forth debate,\u201d Cruz told Page, as she pressed him about discrimination against LGBT citizens, approaching him as he flipped pork chops over an open grill. But the two then proceeded to have a spirited exchange over gay rights ...The discussion, which was held in view of reporters and caught on video \u2026 came hours before Cruz hosts a religious liberty rally here in Des Moines, where he will be defending what he sees as that right. http://politi.co/1EJ6eq0\nWOOING THE ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT: POLITICO\u2019s Katie Glueck reports: \u201cTED CRUZ has quietly embarked on a strategy designed to reclaim the mantle of the anti-establishment presidential candidate, methodically scoring endorsements, locking down the support of hardliner activists and creating an extensive grassroots network, even as Donald Trump keeps a firm grip on the title for now \u2026 he has studiously avoided upsetting the angry voters who are for the moment fueling Trump\u2019s campaign, but who could easily look for an alternative down the road.\u201d http://politi.co/1Kzr0uo\nMATCHING TRUMP?: Washington Examiner: \u201cTed Cruz has always coupled his no-amnesty, secure-the-border immigration policy with enthusiastic support for streamlining and encouraging legal immigration. That might be changing. The Texas senator and leading Republican presidential candidate said in interviews this week that there was a lot to like about Donald Trump's immigration policy proposals.\u201d http://washex.am/1KAyc9H\nJEB\u2019s JOURNEY:\nCHILLIN\u2019: POLITICO\u2019s Marc Caputo and Anna Palmer report: \u201cJEB BUSH is sticking with the plan. Despite DONALD TRUMP shooting ahead in the polls and Bush\u2019s debate performance getting bad reviews \u2014 and amid signs of frustration on the campaign trail from the former Florida governor himself \u2014 his supporters aren\u2019t panicking, multiple sources close to the candidate insist.\u201d The duo lay out five reason\u2019s Bush isn\u2019t sweating. Among them: \u201cJeb Inc. \u2026 Bush Inc. \u2026 Bush Time.\u201d http://politi.co/1hQxMoF\nCRUZ MISSILE: POLITICO\u2019s Katie Glueck reports: Texas Sen. TED CRUZ on Friday fired back at JEB BUSH, who a day earlier suggested the senator, who was born in Canada to a son of a Cuban immigrant and American-born mother, was the beneficiary of birthright citizenship. \u201cI appreciate Gov. Bush\u2019s concern. I would note it seems he\u2019s having a problem and getting confused between legal immigration and illegal immigration,\u201d said Cruz. \u201cWith regard to legal citizens, I\u2019m a United States citizen because my mother was a United States citizen, born in Wilmington, Del. And it has been the law since the beginning of the country that the children of American citizens born here or abroad are American citizens by birth.\u201d http://politi.co/1h1NdcY\nCATAMOUNTAIN TO CLIMB: Associated Press: \u00a0\u201cBush is the first presidential candidate to file petitions to get on the ballot for the Vermont presidential primary set for March 1. A Bush campaign aide says petitions with more than 2,000 signatures \u2014 twice the required number \u2014 were filed Thursday with the secretary of state's office.\u201d http://bit.ly/1NAENpP\nTWITTER STRATEGERY: Commenting on top of the estimable @comfortablysmug Mike Murphy, the leader of JEB BUSH\u2019s Right to Rise Super PAC sheds some light on the group\u2019s mailer strategy in Iowa and New Hampshire. \u201c@MikeMurphy: All NH R primary voters will get mail piece. Only omitted a few in IA who r locked in the Trump/Cruz/etc lane.\u201d http://bit.ly/1Eau838\nCHRISTIE CHRONICLES: \nHIGH-STAKES FAIR: Asbury Park Press: CHRIS CHRISTIE joked in a Fox News interview that he might ride a pony when he arrives at the Iowa State Fair on Saturday \u2014 so he could outdo Donald Trump, who touched down at the fair last week in a helicopter. \u201cYeah, a pony might be good,\u2019\u2019 Christie said. But Christie has bigger concerns than trying to match Trump\u2019s outlandishness. He\u2019s slipping in the polls, putting him at risk of being knocked off the main stage when CNN televises the next prime-time Republican presidential debate. http://usat.ly/1PE2BIA\nCOWBOY UP: Dallas Morning News reports Jerry Jones will do a super fan a solid, hosting a fundraiser next month for CHRIS CHRISTIE, whose sweaters and conspicuous hugging filled your playoff feeds last year.http://bit.ly/1JaWJ77\nRUBIO\u2019s RUN:\nDETROIT RAVE: Detroit News\u2019 Nolan Finley: \u201cMy first impression of Marco Rubio Thursday was that he looked as if he were running for president of his college class, and not the United States. Looks deceive. The 44-year-old Florida senator and Republican contender delivered a speech to the Detroit Economic Club that was sophisticated, passionate and chock-full of common sense conservatism. This guy is a credible presidential candidate.\u201d http://bit.ly/1U5nBbO\nWRIGHT AND WRONG: Columbus Dispatch: Republican presidential candidate MARCO RUBIO appeared to get the Wright Brothers a bit wrong. During a speech Thursday at the Detroit Economic Club, Rubio, a Florida senator, praised the innovation of the Wright Brothers for their first flight in 1903. But instead of pointing out they were from Dayton, Rubio described them as \u201ctwo brothers from Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.\u201d http://bit.ly/1JmTuGN\nSURVEYING THE 2016 LANDSCAPE:\nJOHN WHO?: Toledo Blade: \u201cConservative Republicans \u2026 convened in battleground Ohio\u201d with \u201croughly 3,800 attending the Americans for Prosperity's Defending the American Dream Summit in Columbus.\u201d \u201cJEB BUSH vowed to rebuild the U.S. Military \u2026 \u2018This world is a lot more dangerous than it was the day Barack Obama became president.\u2019 Gov. JOHN KASICH was nowhere to be seen, and a spokesman for Americans for Prosperity declined to discuss who was and was not invited.\" http://bit.ly/1JmVu1H\nJESUS TALK: RedState\u2019s Erick Erickson is not feeling JOHN KASICH: \u201cKasich will tell anyone willing to listen that Jesus demanded he expand Obamacare in Ohio \u2026 Kasich told people that they need to get over Roe v. Wade because it is the law of the land \u2026 What kind of Jesus demands John Kasich expand government, but accept Roe v. Wade? I\u2019ll tell you one thing, it is not the Jesus who spoke the world into being. I don\u2019t know who John Kasich\u2019s Jesus is, but I suggest he leave him at home next time.\u201d http://bit.ly/1NAEdrW\nPAUL\u2019s PLUNGE: National Review: \u201cA year ago, political insiders expected RAND PAUL to dominate in Nevada and Iowa, the first two states to hold presidential nominating caucuses. Now, as campaign season ramps up in earnest and he continues to slide in national polls, Paul\u2019s propensity to skip important GOP events has left Republican voters wondering whether he is willing to put in the work to seize his natural advantages in these two early states.\u201d http://bit.ly/1UYfZdv\n\u2018PARENTHOOD\u2019 SCREENING: POLITICO\u2019s Eliza Collins reports: BOBBY JINDAL \u201cheld a movie screening on his lawn, but these movies weren\u2019t the newest blockbuster. The Louisiana governor \u2026 showed a series of undercover Planned Parenthood videos on a loop outside the governor\u2019s mansion to protesters who were demonstrating against the defunding of Planned Parenthood.\u201d http://politi.co/1JmU3QV\nNEXT NEWS CYCLE\nHILLARY CLINTON has a fundraiser in the Hamptons.\nBERNIE SANDERS is in South Carolina.\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY heads to Iowa.\nSCOTT WALKER campaigns in Columbus and attends the Americans for Prosperity forum.\nCHRIS CHRISTIE is at the Iowa State Fair.\nTED CRUZ campaigns in Iowa.\nCARLY FIORINA is in Iowa.\nTHE DAILY NUMBER\n50. \nThat\u2019s the percentage of Americans MARTIN O\u2019MALLEY would like to have adequate retirement savings, according to a new Social Security plan released by his campaign on Friday, his latest effort to out wonk the Democratic primary field. http://politi.co/1UWtFWh\nFOLLOW @POLITICO\u2019S politics team: @PoliticoCharlie, @POLITICO_Steve, @PoliticoAlex, @anniekarini, @GlennThrush, @EliStokols, @katie_glueck, @shreckreports, @tparti, @gdebenedetti, @Hadas_Gold, @ec_schneider, @kyledcheney , @theodoricmeyer, @MarcACaputo, @CateMartel, @PoliticoKevin,@mikeallen, @dlippman, @Danielstrauss4, \u00a0@henrycjjackson\nThe latest POLITICO scoops and coverage of the 2016 elections.\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Sanders channeling hope -- Walker's no position", "title": "Hillary's Hamptons home", "url": "http://www.politico.com/2016blast/0815/2016blast19726.html", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["James O'Keefe", "Gary Hart", "Mike Murphy", "Henry C.
