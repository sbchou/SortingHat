Scott Walker told top donors Wednesday that he wants other struggling candidates to drop out of the presidential race so Republicans can coalesce behind an alternative to Donald Trump.\n\u201cIt's just was my fundamental feeling that I had a chance to lead not by running and winning in this instance, but by not running and challenging others in this race to consider making this decision because I believe in the end if we narrow the field to just a few quality, positive alternatives to the frontrunner, it's not only good for the party it's good for the country,\u201d Walker said in a 10-minute conference call to which POLITICO obtained access.\nIt\u2019s the first time Walker directly tied his decision to leave the race to a bid to take down Trump -- who currently sits atop the GOP field in polls -- though he did not mention the real estate mogul by name. At his press conference announcing his exit from the race Monday, Walker had urged other struggling candidates to drop out to help narrow the field.\nDuring the call, which Walker\u2019s team billed as a thank-you call for top supporters two days after he exited the presidential race, Walker said he \u201ccertainly wouldn\u2019t be interested in a cabinet position\u201d if a Republican wins the White House. He also walked donors through his campaign\u2019s final days, describing a revenue shortfall that ultimately killed his bid.\n\n\n\n            By \nNick Gass\n\n\u201cI also looked and tried to see if I could drag this out another couple weeks or another month and see how it went,\u201d he said, noting that the dire fundraising situation \u201cwasn\u2019t going to change substantially.\u201d\nWalker said he intends to reach out to most other major donors individually and then resume his focus on his Wisconsin agenda. \n\u201cThe best thing I can do is get out around my state, continue to push even more bold, positive reforms,\u201d he said, adding that he intends to complete his second term and is undecided about whether to seek a third in 2018. He said he\u2019ll help the eventual Republican nominee in Wisconsin and plans to campaign aggressively for Sen. Ron Johnson\u2019s re-election next year.\nWalker reiterated complaints about the negative tone of the Republican primary, which he outlined during his Monday press conference. He said it crystallized for him during last week\u2019s debate at the Ronald Reagan library in California, which he said was punctuated by questions about Donald Trump\u2019s personal attacks. He lamented the \u201cankle-biting and the name-calling\u201d that have defined the race.\n\u201cWhat I admired most about President Ronald Reagan was his eternal optimism,\u201d he said. \u201cSadly, that\u2019s missing from the campaign right now.\u201d\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "On call to donors, Scott Walker challenged candidates to narrow the field against the frontrunner.", "title": "Walker to GOP rivals: Let's stop Trump", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/scott-walker-donors-stomp-trump-213994", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "trade", "personality"], "people": ["Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Jesse Rifkin", "Rachael Bade", "Henry C.
