{"body": "   Ohio Gov. John Kasich (Steven Senne/Associated Press)  Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who is campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination with a unique message\u00a0of compassionate conservatism and cultural inclusion, will pick\u00a0up a head-turning endorsement Monday in the Bible Belt. Alabama Gov. Robert J.\u00a0Bentley (R) plans to endorse Kasich at a campaign event in\u00a0Birmingham, according to a Kasich campaign official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose the plans. With Bentley's backing, Kasich\u00a0hopes to show\u00a0that his message can\u00a0appeal across the Republican spectrum \u2014 from the Midwest, where he\u00a0has been a popular governor, to New England, where he is rising\u00a0in the New Hampshire polls and now to the South. Bentley will be the third sitting Republican governor to endorse a candidate in the 2016 presidential race. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and Maine Gov. Paul LePage are backing\u00a0New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who served as chairman of the Republican Governors Association during their 2014 gubernatorial elections. Bentley's endorsement of Kasich\u00a0is a blow not only to Christie, but also to the other governors in the race, especially Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a fellow Southerner, and former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who led a neighboring state. Alabama is planning to hold a relatively early\u00a0primary on March 1, along with a number of other Southern states, as part of the \"SEC primary.\" These states are central to the strategies of\u00a0Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and\u00a0former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee in particular. In 2012, Bentley held back on endorsing a candidate, although he said he voted for Rick Santorm in the Alabama\u00a0primary. Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, won the state's\u00a0primary over former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, the eventual nominee. Although Bentley and Kasich\u00a0were first elected governors in 2010, they have no strong friendship, said the Kasich official, making an\u00a0endorsement this early in the campaign cycle unusual. Last week, following what many critics consider a\u00a0standout performance by Kasich in\u00a0the first primary debate, Bentley reached out to the Ohio governor and\u00a0said he was impressed with his message and wanted to get involved in his campaign, the official said. Bentley offered his endorsement and the two governors quickly arranged for the announcement in Birmingham. The event will take place at the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame, where the governors are likely to make light of the sports rivalry between the\u00a0Bentley's alma mater, the University of Alabama, and Kasich's, Ohio State University. Kasich plans to give Bentley a football signed by Urban Meyer, the head coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes. Bentley could\u00a0play a leadership role in Kasich's campaign, perhaps as a surrogate or senior adviser or to assist with fundraising, although no\u00a0terms have been worked out, said the Kasich official. Kasich's visit to Alabama will be brief. After the Monday morning event, he will fly to South Carolina for two afternoon campaign events. Kasich will officially file his paperwork to appear on the primary ballot at the state Republican Party headquarters in Columbia and he will address the Americans for Peace, Prosperity and Security Forum in Myrtle Beach. On Tuesday, Kasich will visit the Iowa State Fair, where he will tour the fairgrounds with Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who has not endorsed a candidate, and speak at the fabled Des Moines Register Soapbox.", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Kasich to pick up major endorsement from Alabama governor", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/17/kasich-to-pick-up-major-endorsement-from-alabama-governor/", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "economy"], "people": ["Rick Santorum", "Mitt Romney", "Robert J.
