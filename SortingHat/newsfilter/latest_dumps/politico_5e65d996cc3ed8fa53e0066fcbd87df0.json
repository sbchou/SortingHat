{"body": "POLITICO\nAn early filing of the day's tax news\nBy Katy O'Donnell\n8/18/15 9:59 AM EDT\nWith assistance from Toby Eckert\nIRS: OOPS, BREACH HIT WAY MORE PEOPLE THAN WE THOUGHT. The IRS disclosed Monday that it is reaching out to nearly 400,000 more taxpayers about the security of their sensitive information over the \u201cGet Transcript\u201d breach the agency first discovered in May. The agency said earlier this summer that people used taxpayer information culled from third-party sources to get access to over 100,000 taxpayer accounts through the IRS\u2019s \u201cGet Transcript\u201d application. A review of the breach led the IRS to discover fraudsters infiltrated 220,000 additional accounts and were blocked from accessing 170,000 others.\nStory Continued Below\nThe IRS has emphasized that the original identifying information needed to get into Get Transcript was stolen elsewhere, but it is thought that criminals used the application to get information from old tax returns to file fraudulent ones going forward. That could mean an even tougher 2016 filing season for hundreds of thousands of people next year. The IRS is providing the afflicted taxpayers with free credit monitoring.\n\u00a0\u2014 LAWMAKERS PLEDGE HELP AND OVERSIGHT. Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), the chairman of the Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee, called the news \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d in an emailed statement Monday. \u201cTaxpayers deserve to know that the IRS is taking every possible step to safeguard their personal information. Today's revelation that the IRS didn't fully understand this security breach for months is not confidence-inspiring,\u201d Roskam said. \u201cThe Oversight Subcommittee will continue to work to get to the bottom of this breach and work with the IRS to improve cybersecurity systems guarding taxpayers\u2019 personal data.\"\nSenate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) was less critical but still made clear he was keeping an eye on the tax agency: \u201cI spoke with the IRS commissioner today and our team is being briefed on developments. We need to do a better job of protecting taxpayers and I welcome swift action from the IRS to address this situation now and against future cyberthreats.\u201d\nWyden and Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch have been exploring potential private-sector solutions to the IRS\u2019s security woes since April, and the IRS held a public-private security summit this year to try to get a handle on the problem.\nWALKER\u2019S O-CARE PLAN INCLUDES SLIDING-SCALE TAX CREDITS. GOP presidential candidate Scott Walker will unveil an Obamacare replacement plan today that would shift authority to the states and give uninsured consumers access to sliding-scale tax credits, Pro Health\u2019s Jennifer Haberkorn and Kyle Cheney report. Walker says he would use age, not income, to calculate the sliding-scale credits, a system he says would eliminate any need for IRS oversight.

Tax Analysts\u2019 Jeremy Scott takes on Harvard Professor (and potential Democratic presidential candidate) Lawrence Lessig\u2019s argument that Congress can\u2019t get anything done because of campaign finance \u2014 at least when that argument is applied to Congress\u2019 apparent inability to pass tax extenders in anything other than an ad hoc, slapdash fashion. \u201cLessig argues that politicians basically sell year-to-year extensions of tax policy to donors,\u201d Scott writes. \u201cBasically, Lessig is saying that each year Congress pretends it might not renew extenders in order to build support, and he believes support is just a euphemism for cash.\u201d Not so, says Scott.\nEven if Lessig\u2019s theory applies to other matters, \u201ca quick perusal of the history of extenders reveals that budgetary gimmicks and deficits are more responsible for the yearly extenders dance than institutional corruption,\u201d Scott writes. \u201cWhenever permanent extensions are proposed, it isn't lobbyists and campaign finance directors who are outraged or railing against it \u2014 it's deficit hawks and some Democrats. ... It's the parties' concerns over seeming weak on the deficit, not their desire to sell the same tax favors over and over again, that likely explains why extenders are an annual problem that never seems to go away.\u201d Read more: http://bit.ly/1fl1pN5\nHAPPY TUESDAY!

There\u2019s a serious point behind the stunt, he insisted on his HBO show \u201cLast Week Tonight.\u201d \u201cThe IRS regulations are close to meaningless,\u201d he told viewers, after skewering money-grubbing televangelists who routinely fleece their flocks. Oliver said he filed paperwork with the IRS \u201cto test the legal and financial limits of what religious entities are able to do.\u201d He added, \u201cIt was disturbingly easy.\u201d http://bit.ly/1PgPLPE\nSTATE ROUNDUP \u2014 \nTAX ME, PLEASE! It\u2019s not often that a business advocates for a higher tax on some of its most loyal customers. But that\u2019s exactly what a convenience store trade group is doing in Missouri. The state\u2019s Petroleum Marketers and Convenience Store Association is pushing a ballot initiative that would raise Missouri\u2019s lowest-in-the-nation cigarette tax to 40 cents a pack from 17 cents, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. The group is circulating petitions for two versions of the initiative \u2014 one that would spend the roughly $800 million in proceeds on transportation; the other would send the money to the state\u2019s general revenue fund. It\u2019s not exactly clear why the group, which has opposed three other cigarette tax hikes rejected by voters, would favor the tax increase. But the petroleum marketers have expressed concern about Missouri\u2019s transportation funding problem. And other proposals would make the cigarette tax even higher, ranging from a 50-cent boost to a 73-cent hike. http://bit.ly/1HTbw2s\nA SPOONFUL OF SUGAR: Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner has a tax plan that he hopes will attract Democrats who control the Legislature: freeze local property taxes for two years and in return you\u2019ll get $74 million for financially struggling school districts, notably Chicago\u2019s. \u201cThe state would contribute $200 million a year for two years toward pension and health care costs at [Chicago Public Schools] without a reduction in the district's $600 million state grant funding,\u201d Reuters reports. There\u2019s a catch, however: The legislation would allow local officials to curb collective bargaining, weaken prevailing wage requirements and restrict workers' compensation claims. Most Illinois Democrats would probably consider either one of those things a poison pill. http://reut.rs/1UPjMJX\nGRAD STUDENTS LOSE HEALTH SUBSIDIES IN MO.: The University of Missouri is getting rid of subsidies that help cover health insurance for graduate students who teach at the school, pointing to an IRS interpretation of the Affordable Care Act as the culprit. The law \"prohibits businesses from providing employee subsidies specifically for the purpose of purchasing health insurance from individual market plans,\u201d school officials said in a letter to students, according to an AP story. Because the university\u2019s student health insurance plan is covered by Aetna, the school fears it would be fined for subsidizing an individual market plan.\nAfter getting negative feedback, the school\u2019s chancellor wrote of a short-term solution: \u201cIn Fiscal Year 2015, the university spent $3,938,793.28 in subsidizing the health insurance costs of over 3,000 graduate students. I have directed that this same amount be provided to eligible students based on a formula developed by the Office of Graduate Studies and that the entire amount be made available as soon as possible. This, I understand, is only a short-term \u2018fix.\u2019\u201d Read the chancellor\u2019s announcement here: http://bit.ly/1EyKAVB and the AP\u2019s story here: http://bit.ly/1EyKOfc\nQUICK LINKS: \n\u00a0\u2014 National Taxpayers Union VP: \u201cTax reform must start somewhere\u201d: http://bit.ly/1E1q4lv\n\u2014 More on Etsy\u2019s Irish tax strategy: http://on.wsj.com/1K2FlUg\n\u2014 ICMYI: The Guardian\u2019s \u201cInside the world\u2019s greatest tax havens, in pictures\u201d: http://bit.ly/1THi6VI\n\u2014 IRS: No such thing as a free lunch (not even in Silicon Valley): http://bit.ly/1hjfhJB\n\u2014 DOJ recants leak claim in trial of former Ways and Means member Aaron Schock: http://politico.pro/1DYXnpq\nDID YOU KNOW?

It is a mental torture I find debasing,\u201d he wrote in \u201cSpeak, Memory.\u201d Sometimes he had to sleep, he conceded, \u201cbut I simply cannot get used to the nightly betrayal of reason, humanity, genius.\u201d Can\u2019t say we relate.\nBy MATT LATIMER\nBy JACK SHAFER\nBy ADAM WREN\nBy SEN.
