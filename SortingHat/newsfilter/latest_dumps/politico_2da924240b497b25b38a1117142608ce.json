Bill Clinton \u201892.\nBack then Mario Cuomo, Gennifer Flowers and the ROTC were threatening to deny a Clinton the prize. Now it\u2019s Joe Biden and an email server. If Hillary seems unfazed, perhaps it\u2019s because if you are a Clinton, you\u2019ve seen it all before.\nThere are differences in the two predicaments of course. Cuomo would have been an instant, if not dominating, frontrunner if he had entered (A December 1991 New Hampshire poll showed Cuomo tied with Paul Tsongas at 15 percent, with Bill Clinton only at five.) Biden has polled poorly versus Clinton all year long. In fact three years ago, Biden was the one deemed the political liability by pundits, stoking chatter that Hillary would replace him as Vice-President to salvage Barack Obama\u2019s re-election.\nAnother significant difference is that the Bill Clinton \u201cscandals\u201d didn\u2019t surface until after Cuomo passed on the race. If Biden jumps in, it will be because questions about Hillary\u2019s trustworthiness are weighing her down.\nThere was nothing Bill could do to affect Cuomo\u2019s decision. But there is something Hillary can do to dissuade Biden: fortify her poll numbers and put to rest concerns among, as Obama campaign adviser David Plouffe once called them, the Democratic \u201cbedwetters.\u201d\nOne of Hillary\u2019s chief media antagonists on the email issue, National Journal\u2019s Ron Fournier, said in April the best remedy is to just \u201cHand over the email server.\u201d Since she hasn\u2019t, he recently offered on Twitter that \u201cIf authenticity is the coin of the realm of modern politics (it is), @VP could (*could*) beat @HillaryClinton\u2026\u201d\nBut the Clinton campaign experience of 1992 challenges both of Fournier\u2019s premises: that \u201cauthenticity is the coin of the realm\u201d and full capitulation to media demands is the best way to earn it. And Hillary\u2019s strategy to push past the character attacks is straight out of the 1992 playbook.\nBill Clinton dispatched Tsongas by March 1992 despite the fact that voters saw the former Massachusetts senator, known for saying \u201cI\u2019m not Santa Claus,\u201d as the honest choice. That was the first sign that winning the \u201cauthenticity\u201d battle wasn\u2019t everything.\nStill, focus groups run by the Clinton campaign during the primaries were disturbing. The notion of Clinton as a phony had taken root, complicating his ability to put away Democratic rival Jerry Brown and more importantly, damaging his general election hopes. By the end of the primaries, Clinton would be running third behind President George H. W. Bush and the yet-to-declare independent Ross Perot.\nClinton\u2019s pollsters concluded that voters weren\u2019t giving his policy ideas a hearing because they couldn\u2019t get past the character question. But instead of revealing details about extramarital affairs or apologizing for trying to avoid combat in Vietnam, the focus group testing uncovered another way out: personal biography.\nAs chronicled in the book Quest For The Presidency 1992, the campaign embarked on an intensive research project starting in April to discern exactly what troubled voters and what information would ease their concerns. \u00a0They learned the problem for Bill was not the specifics of the character attacks. The problem was that the attacks created the perception he was a typical politician out for himself and not a change agent that would help the public.\nTo change perceptions, one focus group of mainly Bush and Perot supporters was told that Clinton \u201chad been born in a small town in Arkansas,\u201d \u201cstood up to his drunken stepfather and made him stop abusing his family,\u201d \u201cworked his way through college\u201d and \u201cwon a Rhodes scholarship.\u201d Minds then opened up to hearing about his gubernatorial record on jobs, education and welfare, as well as how he locked up his brother on drug charges instead of pulling strings. \u201cSounds like he has a lot more morals than the papers give him credit. And ethics,\u201d said one persuaded participant.\nOnce the primary season ended, the campaign went back to square one and told his story from the beginning. Between the end of the primaries and the beginning of the Democratic convention in July, the polls began to move in the Clinton\u2019s direction. After the convention, an ad titled \u201cJourney\u201d featured Clinton telling his life story using some of the language tested in the focus groups. The Museum of the Moving Image calls it \u201cone of the most compelling biographical ads ever made.\u201d\nStill, the Clinton campaign never fully put the matter to rest \u2013 to this day Bill Clinton is called \u201cSlick Willie.\u201d The Bush campaign hammered him on \u201ctrust.\u201d An October 1992 poll had tepid results regarding whether Clinton was \u201chonest\u201d: 31 percent said yes and 32 percent said no. A debate preparation memo based on more focus group research warned that voters \u201cwant to see for themselves if they can \u2018trust Bill Clinton.\u2019\u201d\nYet on Election Day, the veracity question wasn\u2019t dominant. The exit poll asked voters what candidate qualities mattered most: pro-Clinton \u201cchange\u201d voters outnumbered pro-Bush \u201chonest and trustworthy\u201d voters.\nFast-forward to today. Hillary Clinton was whacked by the email flap in March before she officially announced in April. Her direct defense failed to satisfy and ongoing investigations keep the story churning.\nSo what was the subject of her first online ad one month after her kickoff? Well what do you know, a biographical ad about her mother\u2019s hard-luck childhood and how it shaped her outlook on life. And her first televised ads revealed this month are variations on the same theme, tying her mother\u2019s trials to Hillary\u2019s record and values.\nSome Republican operatives giddily suggested a panicked Hillary moved up the timeframe for placing her first ads on Iowa and New Hampshire television this week to blunt the Biden buzz. A spokeswoman calmly responded on Twitter that the campaign \u201cDidn't buy for Aug [previously] as to not tip off our many opponents.\u201d Regardless of which side you believe, the ad itself is not a rush job, but a carefully considered strategy rooted in the 1992 experience.\nWill it work this time? While the strategy is basically the same, there are differences in the circumstances.\nBill had barely been on the national stage and people\u2019s perceptions of him had not been fully formed. Hillary has been the public eye for two and a half decades and opinions on her are firmer. \u00a0Bill also had a more powerful personal story to tell, with plenty of dramatic plot points, and a greater distance between his upbringing and his adult success. Hillary has to lean on her mother\u2019s story to give her own narrative punch. The flip side is that Bill\u2019s scandals were more sensational. The email server issue still lacks a dropped shoe; perhaps less biography is necessary to dull the impact.\nThere is also Fournier\u2019s suggestion that \u201cauthenticity\u201d matters more today than before. Certainly, Barack Obama and George W. Bush successfully cultivated individual personas that did not feel manufactured by political consultants. But we can\u2019t presume that means authenticity trumps competence, ideology, values and policy positions.\nDonald Trump is authentically Donald Trump, but Hillary trounces him in every trial heat because he flops on all the other measures. Similarly, lots of people have a soft spot for \u201cUncle Joe,\u201d but how many \u201cauthentic\u201d gaffes could he make before Democrats scurry back to the comfort of Hillary\u2019s wonkish competence?\nThe 1992 Clinton campaign figured out that \u201cauthenticity\u201d could be redefined on its own terms and downplayed so the election can turn on different qualities. If Hillary can execute the same game plan, and stabilize her numbers into the fall, not only would Biden be denied a clear opening, but Republicans might have to reconsider if rehashing the 1992 Bush campaign strategy is their best approach for beating the 2016 Clinton.\nBill Scher is the senior writer at the Campaign for America\u2019s Future, and co-host of the Bloggingheads.tv show \u201cThe DMZ\u201d along with the Daily Caller\u2019s Matt Lewis.\nThe Friday Cover\n By ADAM WREN\nThe POLITICO Mag Profile\n By LUKE O\u2019BRIEN\nSponsored Content\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The Clinton presidential campaign was biting its collective nails as a towering Democratic Party figure left everyone guessing whether he would jump in the race late.
