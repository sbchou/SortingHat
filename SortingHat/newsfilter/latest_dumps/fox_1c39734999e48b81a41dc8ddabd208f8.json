But it sure has been a smack in the forehead to the media and political establishment.\nCarson has gotten 1/1000th\u00a0of the attention lavished on Donald Trump, but here he is in a Des Moines Register poll, tied with him for first in Iowa, 23 percent each. He\u2019s also second to The Donald in South Carolina.\nThe retired neurosurgeon is quietly riding the wave of anger at professional politicians, and he is temperamentally Trump\u2019s opposite, soft-spoken and self-effacing. Carson has a quiet charisma, and while he is not miles deep on some issues, that seems to matter less this year.\nBut let me venture a prediction. Since journalists haven\u2019t viewed the doctor as a serious threat for the Republican nomination, Carson hasn\u2019t gotten much tough media scrutiny. That is about to change.\nTake the recent disclosure that Carson was engaged in fetal tissue research in 1992. He has an explanation as to why that is different than what Planned Parenthood does in helping harvest organs for sale, which he has criticized. The story was a bit of a blip, quickly vanishing from the radar. Had Carson been treated as a front-runner, it would have been chewed over for days.\nAt the same time, Carson has greatly improved as a candidate. In his early months on the trail, he kept making rookie media mistakes, which made me initially think he was not ready for prime time.\n\nThere was the time he likened ObamaCare to slavery. There was the time he told Chris Cuomo that being gay was a choice because some men go to prison and come out gay\u2014comments for which Carson later apologized. But those gaffes have faded. \u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned how to phrase things in a way that people can actually hear what I\u2019m saying,\u201d Carson told me in a recent interview. \u201cIf you use certain words, it can be the most wonderful thing, they won\u2019t hear it.\u201d\nThe smarter approach, he says, is \u201cdialing back what I say. The things I\u2019ve said, I truly believe. But I recognize it has been hurtful.\u201d\nIowa is a good state for Carson because of its many evangelical voters. It was, after all, Carson\u2019s criticism of President Obama at a National Prayer Breakfast that boosted his national profile, leading to a Fox News contributor gig before he jumped into the 2016 race.\nStill, the man has raised about $10 million, barely a tenth of Jeb Bush\u2019s haul, and he\u2019s beating the former Florida governor in some polls. What gives?\nAmerica hasn\u2019t really heard Carson\u2019s personal story, how he was raised by a single mother in a dangerous, drug-infected section of Detroit and rose to become chief of neurosurgery at the Johns Hopkins Children\u2019s Center in Maryland.\nIn a USA Today op-ed last week, Carson said the anger of Black Lives Matter demonstrators is misdirected: \u201cOf course, the protesters are right that\u00a0racial policing issues exist and some rotten policemen took actions that killed innocent people. Those actions were inexcusable and they should be prosecuted to deter such acts in the future.\n\u201cBut unjust treatment from\u00a0police did not fill\u00a0our inner cities with people who face\u00a0growing hopelessness. Young men and women\u00a0can't find jobs. Parents don't have the skills\u00a0to compete\u00a0in a\u00a0modern job market. Far too many families are\u00a0torn and tattered by self-inflicted wounds.\u201d\nHe has the standing to make that critique. Even more interesting is that he has a message for the Democratic Party: \u201cLet's\u00a0tell them, we don\u2019t want to be clothed, fed and housed. We want honor and dignity.\u201d\nBut he also has a message for the Republican Party: \u201cWe need to tell them\u00a0they have ignored us for too long. They need\u00a0to\u00a0invite us in and\u00a0listen to us. We need to communicate and find a different way.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the voice of an outsider. He may not have filled in how cutting back on government\u00a0 programs can nonetheless help blacks in poverty, but he is willing to take on the GOP.\nThe Christian Science Monitor observes that a \u201cdimension that cannot go unstated is that Carson is African-American, important to Republicans tired of being reminded that they are woefully deficient in their support among minorities. He is, to some, the Republicans\u2019 Barack Obama \u2013 and perhaps even more authentically black than President Obama, who grew up in Hawaii and was raised largely by his white mother and her parents.\u201d\nWhat about his broader message? A National Review cover story notes \u201can interesting contrast between Carson\u2019s rhetorical style \u2014 mild-mannered, low-affect; a surgeon\u2019s calm \u2014 and his content, which is blunt and apocalyptic: If we do not act now, America as we know it will cease to exist. President Obama and the progressive Left have done their best to destroy the nation from within\u2026\nIf things were not so dire, Carson says, he would have retired to the golf course. But things are dire.\u201d\nThe magazine also chides Carson for having \u201ca way of hitting odd, uncomfortable, and over-the-top notes. References to \u2018socialism\u2019 and \u2018totalitarianism\u2019 creep into his speeches (an oblique reminder that he has said contemporary America is \u2018very much like Nazi Germany\u2019). He talks about the \u2018wars\u2019 the president has tried to stir up: \u2018race wars\u2019 and \u2018age wars.\u2019 He recommends framing policies not as \u2018conservative\u2019 or \u2018liberal,\u2019 but as \u2018pro-American\u2019 or \u2018anti-American.\u2019 Even if you know what he\u2019s getting at, it\u2019s a bit much.\u201d\nWell, maybe. Ben Carson has yet to be fully tested, by either the media or his political rivals. But so far, he has cleared the early hurdles with surprising ease.\nClick for more from Media Buzz\nmedia-buzz\n\nMedia Buzz, hosted by Howard Kurtz, airs on Sundays at 11AM and 5PM ET on Fox News Channel.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this show\n\n\n\n", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "MEDIA BUZZ: How Ben Carson raised his game under the radar - Change in GOP debate criteria could put Fiorina into main event - A.B.
