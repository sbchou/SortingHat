{"body": "In announcing his candidacy for president on Tuesday, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) decided to forgo a teleprompter.\u00a0The not-so-subtle message: I'm a guy who's going talk off the cuff and tell you like it is. Christie, whose political star has dropped off a cliff since his 2013 reelection amid\u00a0the Bridgegate scandal and budget problems in his home state, is banking his campaign on being the straight talker. \"I mean what I say, and I say what I mean, and that's what America needs right now,\" he said. [Yes, it's possible Chris Christie lost his moment] But if Christie's going to be the straightest of talkers in the 2016 race, he's going to have to work for\u00a0that mantle.\u00a0That's because plenty of other Republicans have laid claim to it in one way or another. Indeed, it seems everyone wants to ride the Straight Talk Express (or at least make us think they are). Let's start with Chris Christie     New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, straight shooter. (Jeff Zelevansky/Getty)   During his campaign launch in New Jersey, Christie\u00a0talked extensively\u00a0about actually being a straight shooter: \"You're going to get what I think whether you like it or not or whether it makes you cringe every once in awhile or not.\" \"When I am asked a question, I'm going to give the answer to the question\u00a0that's asked not the answer my political consultants told me to give back stage.\" \"The truth will set us free, everybody.\" More evidence from his campaign launch of his straight-shooter bid: \"If Jefferson and Adams realized compromise was a dirty word, we'd still be under the Crown of England.\" \"I don't do something great every day. I'm human.\" \"I am not running for president of the United States as a surrogate for being prom king of America.\" Jeb Bush     Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, straight shooter. (REUTERS/Brian Snyder)   The former Florida governor is also in the running for your straight-shooter\u00a0vote. In his June 15 launch, Bush tried to downplay expectations of his front-runner, family-dynasty status by saying: \"Not a one of us deserves the job by right of r\u00e9sum\u00e9, party, seniority, family or family narrative. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s turn.\" Even before his official candidacy, he was lobbying for the straight shooter award: \u201cMy dad is the greatest man alive. If anyone disagrees, we\u2019ll go outside,\u201d he said at the Detroit Economic Club in February. On illegal immigration in April 2014: \"Yes, they broke the law, but it\u2019s not a felony. It\u2019s an act of love.\" [Rating the 2016 candidates' many contortions on immigration] On education reform at a December Wall Street Journal event: \"The fact is, the end is near if we don\u2019t fix this.\" Actually, Bush\u00a0said a lot at that December event that qualifies as straight shooter, including: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would be a good candidate or a bad one, but I kinda know how a Republican could win.\" And finally, Bush said a\u00a0Republican nominee needs to be willing to \"lose the primary to win the general without violating your principles.\" Translation: I'm not going to pander to you. I am what I am. Lindsey Graham     Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) straight shooter. (AP Photo/Rainier Ehrhardt)   The South Carolina senator is on the bottom of many polls but the top of journalists' quotable lists. A quick rundown: \"We tried tall, good looking, smart, nice, great family man. Vote for me, we\u2019re not going down that path again,\" he said at a Mitt Romney-hosted summit in Utah in June. \u201cHere\u2019s the question for the country: Can you be single and still be president? Is it a job for married people only? \u00a0Is there a sign on the White House, \u2018Single people may not apply?\u2019 I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t seen it,\" he said in a June interview with Yahoo on being unmarried. On Caitlyn Jenner: \"I\u2019m a pro-life, traditional marriage kind of guy, but I\u2019m running to be president of the United States. If Caitlyn Jenner wants to be a Republican, she is welcome in my party.\u201d [Lindsey Graham nailed it on Caitlyn Jenner and Republicans] On his plan to win the nomination (which most candidates are loathe to set expectations on): \u201cFor a guy like me, it\u2019s pretty simple. I do well in Iowa and finish in the top tier in New Hampshire, I\u2019ll win South Carolina. By the end of South Carolina there are three or four people left at the most.\u201d And the foreign policy hawk offers\u00a0a lot of straight talk about the Middle East: \u201cEverything that starts with \u2018Al\u2019 in the Middle East is bad news,\u201d\u00a0he told Talking Points Memo in May. In a June NBC interview\u00a0on Iraq: \"You don't get out.\" John Kasich     Ohio Gov. John Kasich, straight shooter (AP Photo/Steven Senne)   Where to begin with Ohio's\u00a0very quotable\u00a0governor, who is getting closer to a 2016 bid? We wrote a story in early June calling him the campaign's new straight shooter. (Apparently Christie didn't like that.) Among the gems: I didn\u2019t get scared out, I got destroyed out,\u201d he told The Washington Post's Dan Balz recently of his 2000 presidential run. \u201cI had no money and no oxygen.\" On Bush's nonprofit and super PAC, \"Right to Rise\": \"I don\u2019t know anything about [Bush\u2019s theme]. I really don\u2019t. I\u2019ve never listened to him. What\u2019s 'Right to Rise?' Getting up in the morning?\u201d he said in May. And as to why he was campaigning in New Hampshire:   John Kasich on why he's in NH today: \u201cFrankly, I thought Jeb was going to suck all the air out of the room, and it just hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d \u2014 Scott Conroy (@ScottFConroy) June 4, 2015  And there's been more Kasich quotes\u00a0since, including:   Can Kasich just gaggle all day long? He\u2019s amazing. \"John Sununu is my Sacagawea in N.H. I couldn\u2019t have a better Sacagawea\u2026.\" \u2014 Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) June 12, 2015  And we'll end\u00a0from a zinger last year\u00a0we had to mention. Kasich said this at a\u00a0Koch-sponsored conference, when a donor asked him why, as a Republican governor, he expanded Medicaid: \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, lady. But when I get to the Pearly Gates, I\u2019m going to have an answer for what I've done for the poor.\u201d Oh, and he's basically insulted the entire state of Iowa. Donald Trump     Donald Trump, straight shooter? (Richard Ellis/Getty Images)   In his head, the real estate mogul and laughing stock of the 2016 campaign is a straight shooter. \"Straight talk\" is how he defends much of his ballyhoo: \"The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else\u2019s problems,\"\u00a0he said at his June 16 presidential launch. [Donald Trump's big mouth taught us a valuable lesson about the power of Latinos] Actually, that gloriously incoherent speech from Trump's launch had a lot of straight talk, at least by Trump's definition. Among them: \"I'm rich.\" \"You have to be hit by a tractor -- literally, a tractor -- to use [Obamacare].\" \"When did we beat Japan at anything?\" So, which candidate is pulling ahead in the straight shooter category?
