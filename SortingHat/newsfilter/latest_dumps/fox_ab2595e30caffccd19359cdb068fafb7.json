Pope Francis will meet with the President and speak to America\u2019s bishops. An arrival ceremony at the White House today will feature 15,000 Americans. During our show there\u2019s a papal motorcade from the White House to Saint Matthew\u2019s Cathedral. He\u2019ll meet with various church officials before holding a Noon prayer service in Spanish. Afterwards he heads via motorcade to what is the Catholic version of an embassy called the Nunciature. We\u2019ve got Fox team coverage, and we\u2019ll talk to Shepard Smith and some other guests about the historic visit.\nThe Chinese President Xi Jinping also in the United States visiting Seattle before heading for Washington. Dan Springer reporting.\nThere\u2019s lots of political news today too.\nLive events with Lindsey Graham, Carly Fiorina and this afternoon, Donald Trump.\nNew polling out this morning from Bloomberg. It shows Biden surging even though he hasn\u2019t officially entered the race for the White House.\nThe Bloomberg poll still has Clinton in the lead with 33%, Biden gets 25% and Sanders with 24%. The polling was of Democrats and Democratic leading voters.\n\nHillary Clinton has come out against the Keystone Pipeline.\nBloomberg is reporting the FBI has recovered some email from Hillary Clinton\u2019s private server. Private and work emails were deleted. Bloomberg\u2019s Del Quentin Wilber writes, \u201cThe Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s success at salvaging personal e-mails that Clinton said had been deleted raises the possibility that the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s correspondence eventually could become public. The disclosure of such e-mails would likely fan the controversy over Clinton\u2019s use of a private e-mail system for official business.\u201d\nFor more news, follow me on Twitter: @ClintPHenderson\n\u00a0\nhappening-now\n\nJon Scott and Jenna Lee will take YOU to news when and where it happens.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this show\n\n\n\n", "byline": "", "description": "Pope Francis in America.
