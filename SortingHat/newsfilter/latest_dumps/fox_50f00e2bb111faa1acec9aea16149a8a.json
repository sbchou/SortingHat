Maybe one of these days they\u2019ll be right.\n\u201cTrump Momentum Shows Signs of Stalling,\u201d declares Politico, adding that \u201crivals were taking heart that maybe, just maybe, the air has begun to seep out of the Trump balloon.\u201d Quoted: an unnamed \u201cstrategist at a rival campaign.\u201d  ABC\u2019s The Note: \u201cThe frontrunner looks vulnerable -- and, perhaps oddly, it's not his policy positions or political history that matter in this equation. It's his very Trump-ness that has him now in this position, with rival campaigns seeing signs that its novelty is wearing off.\u201d\nNew York Times: \u00a0Donald J. Trump\u00a0was never exactly a happy warrior, but with some of his Republican rivals gaining on him, he is showing clear signs of discontent.\nWashington Post: \u201cRepublican leaders who have watched Donald Trump\u2019s summer surge with alarm now believe that his presidential candidacy has been contained and may begin to collapse.\u201d\n\nOh wait, that one was from August.\nObviously, Trump couldn\u2019t keep rising forever or he\u2019d hit 100 percent. He\u2019s down a little bit, perhaps because of the second debate. So let\u2019s look at the numbers:\nIn the new Fox poll, Trump leads with 26 percent, followed by Ben Carson with 18 percent, and Carly Fiorina and Marco Rubio at 9.\nIn the Bloomberg poll, it\u2019s Trump 21, Carson 16, Jeb 13 and Carly 11.\nAnd Quinnipiac has it as Trump 25, Carson 17, Carly 12 and Jeb 10.\nSo not only are the media straining to find evidence of a sharp Donald decline, they have completely miscalculated Carson\u2019s chances. After the doctor\u2019s muted performance in the CNN debate, one pundit after another predicted he would start dropping. After saying on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that he would not advocate a Muslim president, much of the media said he had gone too far and showed evidence of bigotry. But Carson remains a strong second-place contender.\nLet\u2019s review all the times the press proclaimed that Trump to be on the verge of sinking:\nHis comments about Mexican immigrants. His comments on John McCain\u2019s war record. His comments on Megyn Kelly. His comments on Fiorina\u2019s face. His failure to correct a questioner who called President Obama a Muslim.\nSo maybe media folks should get out of the prediction business. Of course the race will tighten eventually as other candidates follow Scott Walker\u2019s lead. But no one knows how long that will take.\nTrump is keeping busy with his attacks on the media, including his latest boycott of Fox News for what he deems unfair coverage. Fox has hit back by saying his attacks on the network\u2019s anchors and hosts are getting stale and tiresome. (Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes spoke to Trump yesterday, a company statement says, and they plan what the network calls a \u201ccandid\u201d meeting next week to address Trump\u2019s complaints and any \u201cmisunderstandings\u201d without compromising Fox\u2019s standards.)\nThe Donald\u2019s main complaints are that the network has too many Trump-bashers on and that Fox hasn\u2019t shown polls that give the billionaire an even wider lead. These tend to be online polls, which I and many others regard as unscientific and worthless.\nTrump also complained about CNN in his lengthy interview with Alisyn Camerota on \u201cNew Day.\u201d He called CNN\u2019s Sara Murray an \u201cabsolutely horrible reporter\u201d and \u201cterrible and disgusting reporter\u201d\u2014because, he said, she had reported there were empty seats at his South Carolina event the day before (as did other journalists). Trump told the anchor to report all this to CNN President Jeff Zucker.\nAnd he tweeted that the \u201cfailing\u201d Politico (which ran the aforementioned headline) \u201cmay be the most dishonest of the media outlets\u2014and that is saying something.\u201d\nOf course, Trump can quickly revise his opinion. He spent months ripping Chuck Todd, but now, after a few \u201cMeet the Press\u201d appearances, says he likes the guy. And all the Sunday shows except \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d and all the morning shows keep letting him call in, unlike other candidates, because he is, well, good for ratings.\nTrump\u2019s broadsides against the fourth estate only help him with Republican voters who are fed up with the media establishment as well as the political establishment. The same is true when the pundits, especially the conservative pundits, keep pounding him. But however much they might wish it to be so, that doesn\u2019t mean his campaign has peaked.\nClick for more Media Buzz\nmedia-buzz\n\nMedia Buzz, hosted by Howard Kurtz, airs on Sundays at 11AM and 5PM ET on Fox News Channel.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this show\n\n\n\n", "byline": "", "description": "I woke up early yesterday, flipped on the TV, and saw that Donald Trump was calling into MSNBC.", "title": "Faceoff: Trump rips media as pundits insist he\u2019s in decline", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/k6HxMybMI-Y/", "topics": ["immigration", "personality"], "people": ["Roger Ailes", "Howard Kurtz", "Sara Murray", "Jeff Zucker", "Scott Walker", "Donald Trump", "Chuck Todd", "Marco Rubio", "Donald J.
