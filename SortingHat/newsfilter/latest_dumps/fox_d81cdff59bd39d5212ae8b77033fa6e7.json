Elected officials routinely using personal laptops, cellphones and email accounts for government business, but open-records fights over private emails have produced mixed results.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton faces questions over her use of a private account and server while serving as secretary of state.\nIn June, The Chicago Tribune filed a lawsuit against the Emanuel administration seeking more than two dozen email chains believed to be related to a no-bid Chicago Public Schools contract under investigation. The lawsuit alleged the city's response violated the Illinois Freedom of Information Act by withholding some chains and redacting other portions without giving a reason. City officials argued they were in compliance with the law.", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Chicago Tribune sues Mayor Emanuel over private email use", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/09/25/chicago-tribune-sues-rahm-emanuel-over-private-email-use/", "topics": ["personality", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Rahm Emanuel", "Hillary Clinton", "Kelley Quinn", "Gerould Kern", "Mayor Rahm Emanuel"], "orgs": ["City Council", "Chicago Public Schools", "Chicago Tribune", "Freedom of Information Act"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-09-25 06:14:26", "org": "fox", "article_id": "d81cdff59bd39d5212ae8b77033fa6e7", "date_access": "2015-09-25 06:00:07.593915"}
