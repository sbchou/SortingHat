{"body": " Genial U.S. Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D-Va.) is calling his colleagues \u201cimmoral.\u201d The loyal Democrat finds President Obama\u2019s justifications \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cweird.\u201d  His targets likely aren\u2019t surprised or upset. Kaine has been talking this way for a year now.  The cause of his frustration is the undeclared war against the Islamic State, which began with airstrikes in Iraq last August.  A freshman who in 2012 followed Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) from the Virginia governor\u2019s mansion into the U.S. Senate, Kaine has carved out a space for himself on an issue that has no natural party or political constituency \u2014 war powers. It\u2019s a passion that has earned him the respect of colleagues and helps fuel speculation that he is a contender for Democratic vice presidential nominee in 2016. What it has not gotten him is results.  \u201cCongress has refused to debate or vote with respect to this war with the Islamic State,\u201d Kaine said in a speech at the libertarian CATO Institute Thursday. \u201cCongress would rather hide from its constitutional duty to declare war than have a meaningful debate over when and how the U.S. should engage.\u201d  Kaine has said that his commitment to the issue is about protecting the Constitution. He first introduced legislation to approve the war against the Islamic State last September, shortly after Obama gave a prime-time speech outlining his offensive strategy.  \u201cIf Congress isn\u2019t willing to do the hard work \u2013 to debate and vote on an authorization \u2013 we should not be asking our service members to go into harm\u2019s way,\u201d he said.  [Inside the overbearing, paranoid White House foreign policy team]  While the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed an authorization in December, Republicans, who took over the chamber in last year\u2019s elections, said they wanted to craft their own version in January. Obama sent his own proposal in February. In June, Kaine and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) introduced their own authorization measure. While Kaine said the committee has had \u201ca few discussions,\u201d no authorization has emerged. He called Congress \u201cdisturbing\u201d in March, \u201cshameful and cowardly\u201d in May and \u201cmaddening\u201d in June.  The White House has maintained that the 2001 authorization of use of force against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks covers the campaign against the Islamic State. That\u2019s the argument Kaine called \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cweird,\u201d given that Islamic State did not exist then.  While the senator said that for months a \u201cconspiracy of silence\u201d ran between the White House and Capitol Hill, he now believes the president is on his side.  \u201cI think he now would like us to get this fixed,\u201d Kaine said after his speech. \u201cI\u2019ve certainly talked to members of his Cabinet who want us to get this fixed. ... They say keep up the work on this, we really need an authorization.\u201d  White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday that there is \u201cfrustration\u201d in the White House at \u201ca United States Congress that seems very interested in discussing this issue but not actually doing anything.\u201d Kaine said he has also talked to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton about this issue \u201cgenerally,\u201d but not the details of legislation or whether the 2001 authorization still applies.  \u201cWe talked about just the challenges that we have, and the importance of congressional prerogatives and Congress and the executive working closely,\u201d he said.  It\u2019s Congress, he said, that may not \u201chave the backbone to do it.\u201d Outside the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he named Sens. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Angus King (I-Maine), and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) as supporters. Inside the committee, he said, Republican and Democratic leadership agree that something needs to be done but say that for the next two months it will be \u201call Iran all the time.\u201d  He believes in their commitment to taking up authorization in mid-September, he said, \u201cbut there has been a reason to avoid it for the last year and I worry that there will be another reason to avoid it.\u201d As he freely admits, Kaine has had far more success constraining the president\u2019s dealings with Iran. For him, congressional approval of a nuclear agreement was mandated by the same constitutional principles as a war authorization. But the partisan politics surrounding Iran made that effort much easier.  There\u2019s \u201cincredible energy and big congressional effort to challenge U.S. diplomacy,\u201d he told the CATO audience, but \u201ccontinued indifference to war.\u201d  Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), the ranking Democratic on the committee, said it was not cowardice or indifference blocking legislation but a political disagreement.   \u201cI\u2019m with Sen. Kaine,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s one difference here and that\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m not sure there is a path forward.\u201d  Some Republicans want a much broader authorization than Democrats or the White House support, including more expansive allowance for ground troops.  Even Kaine\u2019s fans view his cause as close to quixotic. Kaine himself acknowledged that many people consider the issue \u201ca boring one.\u201d Introducing him Thursday, CATO Vice President Gene Healy praised the senator\u2019s views as \u201cold-fashioned\u201d and \u201cincreasingly rare.\u201d The war\u2019s anniversary, he predicted, \u201cwill get far less attention than the clown car wreck of the first GOP primary debate.\u201d  ", "byline": "", "description": "The genial senator is a lonely voice for making the nation\u2019s undeclared war with the Islamic State official.", "title": "One year later, Virginia\u2019s Timothy M.
