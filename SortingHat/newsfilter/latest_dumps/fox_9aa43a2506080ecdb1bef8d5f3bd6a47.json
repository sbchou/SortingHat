Bush for the worst terrorist attack in our nation\u2019s history.\nTake MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews, who is pumped up over the Trump offensive:\u00a0\u201cThe Democrats never had the stones to go out and challenge George W\u2026 because they probably felt that would be un-nice. Trump isn\u2019t un-nice, he\u2019s willing to be tough.\u201d\nBrad Woodhouse, a former Democratic Party spokesman, sent out an email saying \u201cTrump is right about 9/11.\u201d That linked to a liberal piece in the Atlantic with the same headline.\nAny fair review of what happened would conclude that the Clinton and Bush administrations shared responsibility for the attacks that claimed the lives of 3,000 Americans. The intelligence failures over the al-Qaeda plot, which had been in the works for years, certainly predate Bush, who had only been in office for eight months. But it\u2019s also true that the classified presidential daily briefing on Aug. 6, 2001 warned Bush: \u201cBin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.\u201d\u2014and there were other warnings as well.\n\nIn pure political terms, Trump has shifted the campaign conversation in a way that hurts Jeb. The more time that Jeb spends talking about 2001, the less time he spends talking about the future. And the more time he spends defending his brother, the more he reminds voters that he is the third Bush to seek the White House\u2014which undermines Jeb\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m my own man\u201d theme.\nThis has become a Trump specialty, to jab at his rivals with a provocative comment that forces them to spend days counterpunching.\nThe contretemps began with a television interview on Bloomberg, when Trump said this about the 43rd president: \u201cI mean, say what you want, the World Trade Center came down during his time.\u201d When anchor Stephanie Ruehl objected, Trump said people could blame Bush or not, but this was a fact: \u201cThe World Trade Center came down during his reign.\u201d That prompted Jeb to tweet that the billionaire\u2019s comments were \u201cpathetic.\u201d\nSince the Trump line contradicts Jeb\u2019s narrative that his brother \u201ckept us safe,\u201d Bush stepped it up on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d saying Trump is not serious when it comes to foreign policy: \u201cDoes anybody actually blame my brother for the attacks on 9/11? If they do, they\u2019re totally marginalized in our society.\u201d\nBut nobody this side of the conspiracy nuts is blaming George Bush for the attacks; some are saying (which was widely reported in the following years, though little remembered now) that his administration missed important signals and that law-enforcement and intelligence agencies failed to share information.\nTrump elaborated Monday\u2019s on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d and Tuesday on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d saying his tougher approach to immigration might have kept most of the hijackers out of the country. (This is debatable, as most of them had valid student and tourist visas.)\nAnd the new focus on what was dubbed the War on Terror enabled Trump to pivot to Iraq, saying on CNN it was \u201cjust a disastrous decision\u201d for the former president to launch that invasion and destabilize the Middle East.\nTrump also told anchor Alisyn Camerota that \u201cthey knew an attack was coming. George Tenet, the CIA director, knew in advance there would be an attack, and he said so.\u201d\nIt sounded at first glance like Trump might be wading into murky waters, but the key phrase is \u201can attack.\u201d Tenet was indeed worried about an al-Qaeda attack\u2014he insisted on a meeting with Condi Rice to press the point\u2014but he didn\u2019t know when and where, or that planes would be hijacked.\nWhile liberals are jumping on this Trump bandwagon, some conservatives are upset. Fox\u2019s Dana Perino, Bush\u2019s former press secretary, accused Trump of peddling \u201cliberal conspiracy theories.\u201d\nThe Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial page, a major detractor, ran a piece titled \u201cTrump\u2019s 9/11 Truthing.\u201d The headline is unfair because truthers are those who say the Bush administration was complicit in the attacks.\n\u201cMr. Trump is now trying to blunt that rebuke by distorting the truth about the hijackers and the\u00a0 Osama bin Laden\u00a0era\u2026Blaming George W. Bush for the 9/11 attacks is like blaming President\u00a0Obama\u00a0for the recession that followed the 2008 financial panic,\u201d the Journal says. \u201cThe rise of al Qaeda had been going on for years, and its first attack on U.S. soil was its bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993.\u201d\nNational Review, which is hostile to The Donald, published a column yesterday in which Jeb said Trump \u201cechoes the attacks of Michael Moore and the fringe Left against my brother is yet another example of his dangerous views on national-security issues\u2026\n\u201cDonald Trump simply doesn\u2019t know\u00a0what he\u2019s talking about. And his\u00a0bluster overcompensates for a shocking lack of knowledge on the complex\u00a0national-security challenges\u00a0that will confront the next president of the United States.\u201d \u200e Perhaps it\u2019s just a coincidence, but Mike Murphy, an 18-year Jeb adviser who runs his Super PAC, broke a long period of media silence by calling Trump \u201ca false zombie front-runner. He\u2019s dead politically, he'll never be president of the United States, ever. By definition I don't think you can be a front-runner if you're totally un-electable,\u201d Murphy told Bloomberg.\nSo Jeb World is fully engaged. And since Bush\u2019s interviews tend not to generate much news, maybe this has brought him more media attention than he\u2019s gotten in weeks.\nBut he\u2019s playing very much on Trump\u2019s turf, and that has hurt. In the latest CNN poll, Trump hit 27 percent, and Bush is at 8\u2014numbers that, however early, Jeb needs to find a way to change.\n\u200eClick for more from Media Buzz\nmedia-buzz\n\nMedia Buzz, hosted by Howard Kurtz, airs on Sundays at 11AM and 5PM ET on Fox News Channel.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this show\n\n\n\n", "byline": "", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of Jeb Bush\u2019s brother over the 9/11 attacks is resonating strongly with one group:", "title": "Trump\u2019s 9/11 sparring with Bush: The left piles on Jeb\u2019s brother", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/aJoXGra5P3g/", "topics": ["personality", "immigration", "terrorism"], "people": ["Brad Woodhouse", "Jeb World", "George Tenet", "Howard Kurtz", "Jeb Bush", "Donald Trump", "George W.
