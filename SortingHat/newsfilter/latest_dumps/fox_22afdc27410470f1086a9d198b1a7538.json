Scott Walker debuts today its first ad for its multi-million-dollar Iowa ad barrage.  The spot from Unintimidated PAC touts the governor\u2019s \u201cdecisive action\u201d in Wisconsin taking on big labor in 2011 as an example of Walker\u2019s ability to \u201cfight and win.\u201d \u201cOur big bold reforms here in Wisconsin,\u201d Walker says in the ad, \u201cTook the power out of the hands of the big government special interests and put them firmly into the hands of the hard-working taxpayers. Now more than ever America needs a president who will fight and win for America\u201d  The ad is part of a $7 million Iowa buy and will begin airing Tuesday.  Betting big on South Carolina - Unintimidated PAC plans to spend a total of more than $9 million boosting Walker in South Carolina, New Hampshire and Nevada before nominating contests in each state, WSJ reports. \u201cThe super PAC is devoting the bulk of the new spending, more than $8 million, to advertising in South Carolina.\u201d  PLEADING INSANITY: HILLARY\u2019S CAMPAIGN WOES MOUNT Imagine that it\u2019s the day of Hillary Clinton\u2019s defiant March press conference at the United Nations in which she dismissed any claims of mishandling sensitive material or taking any undue risks.  If we had told you then that the biggest story six months later would be her IT guy invoking his right to not incriminate himself in an ongoing FBI probe into her sketchy server, what would you have said?  How about \u201cYikes!\u201d  You would have figured that her candidacy had sustained tremendous, perhaps irreparable damage. And you would have been right.  The substance here matters. People here say the Clintons always survive because of her husband\u2019s multiple near-death political experiences. But those things were about the pleasures of the flesh and his own weaknesses. What got him out of trouble as a candidate and in his impeachment was that Democrats could say that Republicans are sex-obsessed weirdos, and do so with a wink and a nudge.  The Clinton mojo only worked because of the underlying subject.  A senior aide invoking his constitutional right against self-incrimination is a big deal no matter what \u2013 just imagine if this were Jeb Bush\u2019s or Scott Walker\u2019s IT guy. But it\u2019s consequence grows exponentially when the underlying substance involves potential for criminal charges for the mishandling of state secrets and exposing them to our enemies abroad because of Hillary Clinton\u2019s desire to keep her own communications secret from her political enemies here at home.  That\u2019s not something that a campaign can wave away as prurient or misplaced.  We add to that the allegations of payola, reinforced today by the discovery of emails from Clinton pushing to help a company that would hire her husband months later and pay him more than $16 million.  Clinton\u2019s campaign has been saying for months that the damage from these ongoing scandals will abate once Republicans are judged to be overplaying their hands. On national security and corruption, the table limits are pretty high.  Clinton with her brazen response in March that she destroyed evidence she claims would clear her name certainly looks like the one who has done the overplaying here.  Emails show Hillary helping firm that paid Bubba big bucks - Inside Higher Ed: \u201cOn the campaign trail Hillary Clinton has been critical of for-profit colleges and has called for tougher regulation of the sector. During her first year as secretary of state, however, Clinton pushed for the inclusion of a large for-profit education company at a higher education policy dinner hosted at the U.S. Department of State. Clinton wrote in an email to a top aide that she wanted to add Laureate Education to the guest list for the event. Describing Laureate as \u2018the fastest growing college network in the world,\u2019 Clinton said the company was \u2018started by Doug Becker who Bill likes a lot.\u2019 \"It's a for-profit model that should be represented,\" she added in the August 2009 email. A senior vice president at Laureate was added to the guest list, a separate email shows. Former President Bill Clinton several months later became an honorary chancellor for Laureate International Universities, a role for which he was paid $16.5 million between 2010 and 2014. Clinton stepped down from the position earlier this year.\u201d  BAIER TRACKS: HEY, JOE\u2026 \u201cWhen one of your aides decides to plead the Fifth to avoid answering questions about setting up your personal computer server that is now in FBI custody, it\u2019s not the best news for your political campaign.  When your main ally on the Benghazi committee that is investigating you offers this explanation to the Washington Post \u2013 \u2018ranking Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), said about the Clinton aide\u2019s decision,\u00a0\u2018Although multiple legal experts agree there is no evidence of criminal activity, it is certainly understandable that this witness\u2019s attorneys advised him to assert his Fifth Amendment rights, especially given the onslaught of wild and unsubstantiated accusations by Republican presidential candidates, members of Congress and others based on false leaks about the investigation\u2019 \u2013 you know there is an issue.  And when every day seems to bring another nugget from the mining of information in the released emails, you can probably expect another challenger in the form of the current Vice President very soon.\u201d \u2013 Bret Baier  Biden fired up in stump speech - WashEx: \u201cVice President Joe Biden on Wednesday was scheduled for a Miami speech on the importance of community colleges, but ended up delivering a rousing address on how to strengthen the middle class and renew the American dream, one that\u2019s likely to fuel more speculation that Biden will soon enter the 2016 race for the White House. The swirl of speculation about his entrance into the presidential race, especially at a speech in the critical swing state of Florida, wasn\u2019t lost on the vice president.\u201d  Early Hillary backer Cuomo now says Biden run good for Dems - The Hill: \u201cNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), who endorsed Hillary Clinton months ago, said Wednesday that a Joe Biden run could be good for Democrats. \u2018If he did run, I think all Democrats would be in a bind, because they\u2019d have a choice of a number of good candidates,\u2019 Cuomo said in Manhattan, according to\u00a0multiple\u00a0reports. \u2018But that\u2019s a good situation to be in, right?\u2019 he added. Cuomo\u2019s comments came following an event at New York University\u00a0when he was asked if he would be \u2018in a bind\u2019 over whom to support in the race,\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0noted.\u201d  Redford: Dem race is bland, boring and empty - \u201cI\u2019m glad [Donald Trump is] in there because him being the way he is, and saying what he says the way he says it, I think shakes things up and I think that\u2019s very needed. Because on the other side it\u2019s so bland, it\u2019s so boring, it\u2019s so empty.\u201d \u2013 Actor Robert Redford in an interview with Larry King.  WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026 History: \u201c[On this day in 1935] A new land-speed record is set by Britain\u2019s famed speed demon, Sir Malcolm Campbell. On the Bonneville Salt Flats of Utah, Campbell and his 2,500-hp motor car\u00a0Bluebird\u00a0made two runs over a one-mile course at speeds averaging 301.129 mph. In breaking the 300-mph barrier, he surpassed the world record of 276.82 mph that he had set earlier in the year\u2026Sir Malcolm went on to set three more consecutive land-speed records at Daytona Beach: 253.968 mph in 1932, 272.465 mph in 1933, and 276.710 mph in early 1935. Seeking a surface fast enough to propel him over the 300-mph mark, Campbell took Bluebird to the searing Bonneville Salt Flats of Utah, where the very level, smooth flats are as solid as concrete by summer\u2019s end. On September 3, 1935, he set a new record of 301.129 mph. The attempt almost ended in disaster when\u00a0Bluebird\u00a0suffered a burst tire near the end of the first run, but Campbell managed to maintain control and then make the requisite second run within the hour.\u201d  Got a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT? Email\u00a0FoxNewsFirst@FOXNEWS.COM  POLL CHECK Real Clear Politics Averages Obama Job Approval: Approve \u2013 44.7 percent//Disapprove \u2013 51.4 percent Directions of Country: Right Direction \u2013 28.7 percent//Wrong Track \u2013 63.3 percent  HIGH STAKES POKER AT TRUMP TOWER It\u2019s not unreasonable for a party to avoid devoting energy to the campaign of a person who might sabotage its chances. After all, parties are designed to win elections, not be ideological vessels or to advance individuals.  But the pledge being circulated to the GOP campaigns from the Republican National Committee is definitely a dagger pointed at Donald Trump\u2019s heart. Other candidates are stampeding to sign up today to show they\u2019re committed to breaking the party\u2019s presidential drought next year.  Trump has called a press conference for this afternoon at his Manhattan fortress and RNC Chairman Reince Priebus is headed to Trump\u2019s tower to make the case for party unity. Unlike most politicians, with Trump we can hardly guess what he\u2019ll ever do.  As Fox News colleague Serafin Gomez reported, the plan for a loyalty oath had been in the works for weeks. It\u2019s tricky stuff.  If he signs it, as Politico reports he will, Trump loses, as he called it, his leverage and some of his appeal as a dangerous man. Plus, his scoring standard changes and his various apostate views -- tax increases, Planned Parenthood funding, his support for impeaching George W. Bush for the Iraq war -- become bigger deals.\u00a0Trump wants to be judged as an independent running as a Republican, not a Republican, per se. If he is being scored for loyalty and consistency, things get dicier.  But, depending on what his response is and what the enforcement mechanisms are, not signing would almost certainly keep him from the nomination and the presidency, but if he chose to burn down the GOP starting tomorrow he could certainly help deliver the White House back to the Clintons.  Club for Growth might go for Trump blitz - The Hill: \u201cFresh from Club for Growth\u2019s\u00a0Twitter fight\u00a0with Trump\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0night, the group\u2019s president David McIntosh wants to warn every conservative voter he can about the economic policies of the GOP front-runner\u2026Asked how far he would go to destroy Trump\u2019s candidacy; McIntosh would not rule out using Club for Growth\u2019s super-PAC to blitz the billionaire during the lead up to the primaries.\u201d  [Trump could\u2019ve been even richer, says National Journal.

Nativism -- we are exceptional; we are better people than they are; we were here first -- is very dangerous and leads to ugly results.\u201d Read more here.  Carson\u2019s $9 million summer - USA Today: \u201cDr. Ben Carson, who is\u00a0surging in Republican presidential polls, also is raking in campaign dollars. Officials with the retired neurosurgeon\u2019s campaign say they have collected $9 million in July and August, a time when political fundraising typically slows. The summer haul means Carson\u2019s total fundraising has hit nearly $20 million.\u201d  Cruz woos Jews in Florida ahead of Iran vote - Miami Herald: \u201cTexas Sen. Ted Cruz came to South Florida to woo Jewish donors as Congress prepares to vote on President Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran. And while he didn't hold any public events -- and doesn\u2019t plan to anytime soon -- Cruz said in a phone interview with the Miami Herald\u2026\u2018We have tremendous support in Florida, and I have been very, very encouraged. We\u2019ve been down to Florida quite a number of times,\u2019 he said.\u201d  Kasich backs off on minimum wage hike - WaPo: \u201cAt his first two events of a two-day New Hampshire swing, Gov. John Kasich (R-Ohio) drew a mix of Republican voters, independents and curious Democrats. At the home of Republican donors, and at a historic general store in this town, he talked at length about how he worked with both parties, and how reforming government programs didn't mean shredding them. He did the same earlier in Michigan, even telling a reporter that he favored a \"reasonable\" federal minimum wage, and that Ohio's $8.10 -- higher than the federal wage -- made sense locally. But after a town hall here, Kasich rebuffed the idea of raising the federal minimum wage. He told reporters that any increase in the minimum wage should be done state by state, but that it should obviously increase.\u201d  POWER PLAY: ROGINSKY TAKES FIVE Democratic strategist and all-around smart person Julie Roginsky says her party is in good shape to retake the Senate next year despite the bruising defeats of 2014.

Wesh: \u201cA king cobra has reportedly escaped from its owner in the Orlando area, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The escaped king cobra was reported Wednesday by its owner, who is a licensed and bonded to care for exotic animals, but the snake actually went missing Tuesday, officials said. The privately owned, non-native, venomous snake was reported to have escaped from its cage at a home in the 4800 block of North Apopka Vineland Road in Orlando. \u2018It wasn\u2019t deliberately let out from what we can see. Looks like it escaped its cage it was in,\u2019 said Capt. Chris Roszkowiak of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The snake is approximately 8 feet and is green and yellow. A permit is required to possess a king cobra and owners are required to report escaped animals immediately. The owner, Mike Kennedy, is an exotic animal dealer and star of the Discovery Channel reality show \u2018Airplane Repo.\u2019 Officials said he could face criminal penalties for not telling authorities about the escape immediately.\u201d  AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026 \u201c\u2026It used to be if you\u00a0were a police officer in a\u00a0confrontation your instant one thought would\u00a0be how do I escape alive?
