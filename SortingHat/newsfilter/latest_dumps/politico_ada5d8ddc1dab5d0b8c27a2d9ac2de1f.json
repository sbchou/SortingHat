Front runner Hillary Clinton and four rivals will meet tonight in Las Vegas at a forum hosted by Facebook and CNN [http://politi.co/1R7hUJX]. We don\u2019t expect the candidates to get too far into the education policy weeds, but that doesn\u2019t mean our topic du jour won\u2019t get air time. Clinton said recently in New Hampshire that she\u2019s sure to give a shout-out in tonight\u2019s debate to pre-K. College affordability issues could also get some love. In contrast to Republican candidates who have emphasized the need to innovate and make higher education more efficient, Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley have made a big push on the campaign trail to make college free or reduced in price [http://politi.co/1N8DWLD]. \u201cIncreasing incomes and economic mobility are defining narratives of Democratic candidates' campaigns this cycle,\u201d Jen Mishory, the executive director of the Young Invincibles told Morning Education. \u201cWe know that higher education is a critical way to increase take-home pay and improve employment prospects, so I'd be surprised if college affordability, quality, and student debt don't come up early on.\u201d (If you need a comparison refresher on the candidates\u2019 higher education plans, see Allie Grasgreen Ciaramella\u2019s story from August: http://politico.pro/1VOowhN.)\nStory Continued Below\n\u2014 Clinton already has attempted to differentiate her plan from Sanders, saying his would provide a free college education to even mega-rich Donald Trump\u2019s children [http://politi.co/1QUOgHN]. Given this emphasis, Alex Smith, the national chairman of the College Republican National Committee said she\u2019d like to hear how the candidates would \u201cdisrupt an outdated, top-down K-12 and higher education system to best meet the needs of a 21st century students. So much of what the Democrats have proposed maintains the status quo and keeps students in a metaphorical box.\u201d Noting that over a recent six-year period states cut their higher education budgets by 25 percent, Peter McPherson, the president of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, said he\u2019d like to ask, \u201cHow would you use federal policy to incentivize states to make the investments that are needed to adequately support public higher education?\u201d\n\u2014 Clinton enters the debate with the backing of both the AFT and NEA [http://politi.co/1PcmSGA]. But K-12 likely won\u2019t get the same billing as higher education. K-12 issues have been more under the radar this campaign season. It\u2019s also a more complicated topic for Clinton given divisions in the Democratic Party over issues such as charter schools and teacher evaluations based on test scores.\n\u2014 Nina Rees, president of CEO of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, said if given the chance, she\u2019d love to know what the candidates would do differently on the education front. \u201cTo the extent they support a strong federal role in education and more funding, where would they make these investments?\u201d Rees said. \u201cSpecifically, how will Hillary Clinton walk the line between her past support for merit pay and alternate routes to teacher certification without catching the ire of the teachers unions who endorsed her.\u201d JoAnn Bartoletti, the executive director of the National Association of Secondary School Principals, said she just hopes the candidates stay off the \u201ceducation in crisis\u201d bandwagon. She\u2019d like the candidates to address the issue of how to get Americans to regard education as a top career choice. \n\u2014 As for Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee, it\u2019s worth noting that Webb was an architect of the Post-9/11 GI Bill that\u2019s provided billions in school aid to Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and their families. Chafee is a big proponent of the metric system [http://politi.co/1R73t8x]. \n\u2014 O\u2019Malley on Monday picked up the endorsement of a DREAMer, Iowa student Kenia Calderon, a junior at Drake University. She and her family are natives of El Salvador, and Calderon came to the U.S. a decade ago. Calderon praised O\u2019Malley\u2019s record on immigration as governor of Maryland, including passing the Maryland Dream Act. More: http://huff.to/1GECprH.\nGOOD TUESDAY MORNING, OCT. 13.

NO CANDIDATE LEFT BEHIND: Ben Carson tells theeagle.com in College Station, Texas, he\u2019d like to make public universities bear some of the cost of student loans [http://bit.ly/1PauZEL], in contrast to Sanders\u2019 plan to make public colleges and universities tuition free. \"The answer is not to create more debt or create income redistribution,\" Carson said. \"We should ask why college tuition is advancing so rapidly and get to the root of the problem.\" Carson said holding universities accountable for the interest on student loans and only making students responsible for the principal of the loans would push universities to find a way to rein in the cost of a degree, the newspaper reported.\nNEW FEDERAL ACTION ON ACCREDITATION, INNOVATION: Competency-based education, Pell Grants for prisoners, and now innovative college partnerships: The Education Department has been moving full steam ahead with new experimental sites, loosening federal financial aid regulations that restrict the flow of dollars toward programs that could make colleges more efficient, accessible and affordable. On Wednesday, the department plans to announce a new experiment \u201cto accelerate and evaluate innovative partnerships between traditional and non-traditional education providers to provide students with the education and training they need for the careers of today and tomorrow,\u201d an official said. And that\u2019s not all: Expect news later this month on steps the department will take to promote transparency and emphasize outcomes throughout the accreditation process.\n\u2014 \u201cThis experimental site complements programs like the First in the World grants that support approaches to transform education and training for the future,\u201d the official said. \u201cAt the same time, we need to assure a reliable baseline of confidence in the quality and performance of postsecondary options for both existing institutions and emerging models. Rigorous accreditation is central to establishing that confidence.\u201d\n\u2014 Officials will also reiterate their increasingly frequent calls on Congress to lend a hand \u2014 in this case, with helping to focus accreditors on student success. All the action builds on Education Secretary Arne Duncan\u2019s summer speech at University of Maryland-Baltimore County, where he laid out priorities for Higher Education Act reauthorization [http://1.usa.gov/1JMrfBU]. The bill\u2019s 50th anniversary is less than a month away.\nSETTING SCORES FOR PARCC: The Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education will vote today on adopting a set of threshold test scores to determine student achievement levels on the PARCC test. Superintendent John White has said [http://bit.ly/1KWMFQj] the vote is critical to Louisiana being able to compare itself to other states that took the PARCC exam this spring. The state also released student scores Monday and measured them using the threshold that White hopes BESE will adopt. They show [http://bit.ly/1L8tyTk] that Louisiana has a lot of room for improvement. The scores are well below the state\u2019s long-term achievement goals, but White said the new tests and higher academic standards will pave the way for better outcomes, the Advocate reports [http://bit.ly/1jlaYi3]. \u201cThe results are not surprising,\u201d White said. \u201cThe real question ahead of us is not did our students significantly change but how will we change as adults in using the tests.\u201d\n\u2014 Arkansas is the second state after Ohio to come under fire for differing from PARCC\u2019s definition of proficient, allowing more students to be considered college- and career-ready even though they didn\u2019t hit high marks on the exam. PARCC says students are ready when they hit a level four and up, meaning they \u201cmet expectations\u201d or \u201cexceeded expectations.\u201d But Arkansas decided [http://bit.ly/1jtkkYp] that students are ready for college and career when they hit level three and up, which includes students who \u201capproached expectations\u201d on the exam.\n\u2014 Massachusetts state senators passed an amendment last week that could slow down the state\u2019s decision to fully implement PARCC. It would force the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to evaluate how much it would cost to fully implement PARCC versus the state\u2019s longstanding MCAS exam for high school students. State Secretary of Education Jim Peyser is supposed to make a formal decision on which test Massachusetts will go with in November. More in the Daily News of Newburyport: http://bit.ly/1RDpNHR.\n\u2014 On a related note: Passing rates on Indiana\u2019s state test could plummet by about 16 percentage points in English and 24 percentage points in math compared to 2014 if the state board takes action this week, Chalkbeat Indiana reports: http://bit.ly/1LKPpno.\nEDU-GOVERNING IN THE GOLDEN STATE: California Gov. Jerry Brown powered through a raft of education legislation on campus sexual assault [http://politico.pro/1RCmXCS], charter schools, school mascots, for-profit colleges and beyond, all passed by the state legislature this year. Brown had until Sunday to act on the bills. He signed a measure [http://bit.ly/1MnKrap] that would ban public schools from using Redskins as a mascot. (A national first, EdSource reports: http://bit.ly/1LrBGzG.) He vetoed a bill requiring a climate survey of public colleges and universities every two years, saying it was unnecessary. [http://bit.ly/1ZwApO3] He vetoed another bill that would ban for-profit charter school operators.
