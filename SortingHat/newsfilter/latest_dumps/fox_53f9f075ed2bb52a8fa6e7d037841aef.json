{"body": "\nTexas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz's presidential campaign has raised more than $14 million since he launched his bid for the party nomination just over three months ago, his campaign said Sunday.\nThe money comes from more than 120,000 donors who made an average contribution of $81.\nPresidential candidates are required to report detailed fundraising figures though the end of June to the Federal Election Commission by mid-July, but Cruz is among a handful of contenders who have announced overall totals ahead of the disclosure date.\nRepublican Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon and political novice, will report having raised $8.3 million for his presidential candidacy, his campaign said on Wednesday. On the Democratic side, front runner Hillary Rodham Clinton will report having raised $45 million.\nCruz was the first major Republican to wade into the GOP primary, which will soon have 16 formally declared candidates. After his March 23 announcement at Liberty University in Virginia, his campaign raised just over $4 million in the final week of that month. Since then, he's collected another $10 million, his campaign said. Cruz also transferred $250,000 from his Senate campaign to his presidential campaign, according to documents filed with the FEC.\n\"The grassroots energy and support we are seeing is overwhelming,\" Cruz said in a statement.\nCruz also will benefit from several super PACs that are supporting him and can raise money without contribution limits. Those groups have previously said they have raised $37 million.\nPresidential campaigns must report their fundraising details to federal regulators by July 15. Outside groups such as super PACs have a later deadline.", "byline": "", "description": "Texas GOP Sen.
