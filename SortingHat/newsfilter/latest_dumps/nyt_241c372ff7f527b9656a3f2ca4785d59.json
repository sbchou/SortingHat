{"body": "John A. Boehner\u2019s decision to resign as speaker of the House \u2013 the culmination of years of intraparty tensions that have cleaved Republicans during President Obama\u2019s administration \u2013 set off unrestrained glee at the Family Research Council\u2019s Values Voter conference in Washington on Friday, where it was all anyone wanted to talk about.\n\nWith one exception: The Republican presidential candidate who has been leading in nearly every poll had little to say about the decision by the most powerful Republican in Congress to quit.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a big decision that he made, it\u2019s a great decision,\u201d said Donald J. Trump, interviewed as he descended a staircase in the Omni Shoreham. \u201cI think so. I think it\u2019s good for everybody. I think it\u2019s time \u2013 he\u2019s been there a long time. But I think it\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump then turned to his interviewer. \u201cWhat do you think, what do you think?\u201d he demanded.\n\nAsked if Mr. Boehner, who was facing the prospect of being ousted by conservatives in his caucus, had been forced out, Mr. Trump said, \u201cWell, could be.\u201d\n\nThen he again tried to turn the tables: \u201cWhat do you think? You tell me.\u201d\n\nAsked about who should replace Mr. Boehner, Mr. Trump offered no names.\n\n\u201cI think they probably have four or five good choices, we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a fight. It looks like it\u2019s going to be fight.\u201d\n\nAnd who should replace Mr. Boehner? \u201cI don\u2019t have a preference,\u201d he said.\n\nDown the stairs and close to the ballroom where he would speak, Mr. Trump was swarmed by reporters who also wanted to ask him about Mr. Boehner. He repeated his answer \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s time\u201d \u2013 and kept walking.\n\nBut then a reporter asked him about Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, another Republican presidential candidate with whom Mr. Trump has exchanged barbs this week.\n\nFor that subject, Mr. Trump had time to stop in his tracks.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t show up to vote for one thing,\u201d said Mr. Trump, turning to the cameras and uncorking a now-familiar attack on Mr. Rubio\u2019s record of absenteeism from Senate votes.\n\nAsked if he thought Mr. Rubio was a \u201cthreat,\u201d Mr. Trump said he did not.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s a baby,\u201d he said.", "byline": "JONATHAN MARTIN", "description": "The Republican presidential candidate was uncharacteristically vague when asked his views on House Speaker John A.
