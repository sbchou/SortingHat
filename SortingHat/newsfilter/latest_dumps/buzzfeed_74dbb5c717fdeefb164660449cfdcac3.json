I love what I'm doing, I really like it.\"\n\"But I do get tired of seeing what's happening with this country,\" Trump continued. \"And if it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally, because I really am tired of seeing what's happening with this country \u2014 how we're really making other people live like kings, and we're not.\"\nTrump offered praise for all three of the major candidates in the race. \n\"I think that probably George Bush has an advantage, in terms of the election,\" said Trump. \"But I think Jesse Jackson's done himself very proud, I think Michael Dukakis has done one hell of a job. [...] I think people that are around all three of those candidates can be very proud of the jobs they've done.\"\nAsked by Winfrey if he believed he could win, Trump said he \"would have a hell of a chance.\"\n\"I would say that I would have a hell of a chance of winning, because I think people \u2014 I don't know how your audience feels \u2014 but I think people are tired of seeing the United States ripped off,\" Trump argued, promising that if he were in charge, \"[t]his country would make one hell of a lot of money from those people that for twenty-five years have taken advantage\" of the United States. \nTrump concluded by insisting that he would abandon an unacceptable status quo. \nIn Donald Trump's America \"[i]t wouldn't be the way it's been,\" Trump declared. \"Believe me.\"\n\nHere's the video:\nyoutube.com", "title": "That Time In 1988 Trump Told Oprah What Was Wrong With America's Foreign Policy", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/ilanbenmeir/that-time-in-1988-trump-told-oprah-what-was-wrong-with-ameri", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Jesse Jackson", "Michael Dukakis", "Ronald Reagan"], "orgs": ["United States."], "authors": [{"author_id": 20926, "fullname": "ilan ben-meir", "primary_org": "buzzfeed"}], "date_written": "2015-07-15 20:04:53", "org": "buzzfeed", "article_id": "74dbb5c717fdeefb164660449cfdcac3", "date_access": "2015-07-15 20:01:10.931912"}
