Huckabee, however, struggled to raise money in his previous presidential effort. He did not seek the nomination in 2012.\n\nAn ordained Southern Baptist minister, he is deeply popular among social conservatives, the base of the Republican Party that propelled him to early success in 2008. This time around, however, Huckabee faces more stiff competition in winning over that base, with candidates like Dr. Ben Carson and Sen. Ted Cruz also vying to assume the mantle of champion of the religious right.\n\n\n ", "title": "Mike Huckabee Officially Enters 2016 Race", "url": "http://www.buzzfeed.com/kyleblaine/mike-huckabee-officially-enters-2016-race", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Scott Olson", "Mike Huckabee", "Ben Carson", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": ["Republican Party"], "authors": [{"author_id": 6689, "fullname": "kyle blaine", "primary_org": "buzzfeed"}], "date_written": "2015-05-05 16:04:14", "org": "buzzfeed", "article_id": "128401a0077fe786698cd063880b23cf", "date_access": "2015-05-05 15:26:06.305332"}
