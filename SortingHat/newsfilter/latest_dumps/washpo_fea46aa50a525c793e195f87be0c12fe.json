{"body": "   (@khloekardashian)  It\u2019s easy to assume that the political world disdains or ignores pop culture. But when one of the world\u2019s biggest rap stars announces he\u2019s running for president, even the most hardened critics sit up and take notice. Such was the case on Sunday night when Kanye West said he will throw his hat in the ring for president in 2020. West made the bizarre announcement at the MTV Video Music Awards in Los Angeles. The event is not typically on the radar of the D.C. political class, but political Twitter lit up nonetheless with plenty of serious and un-serious reaction to the idea of a Kanye candidacy. As our colleagues over at The Fix point out, politics as entertainment seems to be approaching its peak.   If @realDonaldTrump can run for President, so can @kanyewest. Oh and i'd vote for Kanye over Trump. #VMA2015 \u2014 Hilary Rosen (@hilaryr) August 31, 2015    Everybody's mood\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Syz9InbtkK \u2014 Michelle Malkin (@michellemalkin) August 31, 2015  West mentioned his desire to run for president offhandedly while accepting the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award, the VMA\u2019s biggest honor. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I stand to lose after this, it don\u2019t matter though, because it ain\u2019t about me, it\u2019s about new ideas, bro, new idea. People with ideas, people who believe in truth,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yes, as you probably could have guessed by this moment, I have decided in 2020 to run for president.\u201d   pic.twitter.com/OdPQ9JlfYD \u2014 Kourtney Kardashian (@kourtneykardash) August 31, 2015  What? A moment later, West seemed to admit he was high. \u201cY\u2019all might be thinking right now, \u2018I wonder, did he smoke something before he came out here?\u2019 And the answer is yes, I rolled up a little something, I knocked the edge off.\u201d Maybe that explains it.   Kanye 2020 will have by far the best ropeline music in presidential history \u2014 Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) August 31, 2015  The idea of Kanye running for president is less difficult to imagine in the age of Donald Trump. Political observers keep waiting for Trump to drop out. Some assume his bid is a stunt. But given the massive publicity surrounding the former reality TV star\u2019s campaign, it\u2019s not hard to believe there are other celebrities out there thinking they should give politics a try. Not that West needs the PR boost. He seems to have that part figured out.   Kanye is either a Republican or thinks Hillary will lose, or thinks her first term will be a failure. #2020 \u2014 Rory Cooper (@rorycooper) August 31, 2015    So @kanyewest says he's running for prez in 2020\u2013why wait?? \u2014 Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) August 31, 2015  So will he or won\u2019t he? Unlikely but impossible to know for sure. Political journalists were quick to joke about the chances:   Kanye heads to Israel next month http://t.co/XH0wwM9XEa #2020 #kidding \u2014 Blake Hounshell (@blakehounshell) August 31, 2015  But, of course, the best punchlines come from the truth:   There's a \"Ready for Kanye\" PAC http://t.co/Ug9GblVN82 pic.twitter.com/dQvqEXzhou \u2014 Greg Giroux (@greggiroux) August 31, 2015  As a bonus, there is already a Kanye West Wing Tumblr.
