But in Clinton\u2019s camp, she\u2019s hardly seen as a threat.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear when you talk to Republicans that she\u2019s a flash in the pan,\u201d said one Washington-based Democratic strategist familiar with the thinking inside Clinton\u2019s operation, who also dismissed her as \u201cthe flavor of the month.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s a perfect foil for Trump. But she does not appear to have any lasting power,\u201d he added.\nHalf a dozen Democratic strategists and donors echoed that view, noting Fiorina\u2019s low polling ceiling and rejecting the idea that the former Hewlett Packard CEO\u2019s gender would pose a problem for Clinton.\n\"There's no sense that just because she's a woman we should take her more seriously,\" said another Clinton-aligned Democrat.\nPlus, they say, the playbook against her \u2014 perfected by Sen. Barbara Boxer, a Clinton ally who beat Fiorina in a 2010 Senate race \u2014 is so obvious that even if she did break to the top of polls, she would be easy to dispatch.\n\u201cWhen people find out she ran her company into the ground and jumped out of the plane with a golden parachute, they\u2019ll run,\u201d said California Democratic strategist Ace Smith, who worked on Boxer\u2019s campaign and played Fiorina in the senator\u2019s 2010 debate prep.\nOr, in the words of the D.C. Democrat close to the campaign: \u201cThe playbook on her is just devastating. It makes the stuff against Mitt Romney look like child\u2019s play.\"\nAll it would take to beat her would be television spots featuring the workers who were laid off under Fiorina at HP, multiple Democrats said. And it doesn\u2019t hurt that Jim Margolis, who made Boxer\u2019s 2010 brutal ads against Fiorina, is now Clinton\u2019s lead ad-maker.\nOne particularly effective Boxer ad noted that, \"while Californians lost their jobs, Fiorina tripled her salary, bought a million-dollar yacht and five corporate jets.\"\n\n\n\n            By \nEliza Collins\n\nSo there\u2019s no new Fiorina task force in Brooklyn or at the offices of the pro-Clinton super PACs. Her name isn\u2019t popping up in strategic planning meetings or on calls with donors. Clinton hasn\u2019t started calling her out on the campaign trail. Nobody in Brooklyn has even called Smith \u2014 who ran Clinton's California and Texas operations in 2008 \u2014 to ask for advice in handling her, he said.\nNor has Fiorina\u2019s post-debate polling pop vaulted her into the category of serious contenders in the Clinton camp\u2019s eyes \u2013 a tier that, with Scott Walker out of the race, is now down to Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and John Kasich.\n\u201cHonestly, I haven\u2019t seen anything different except people saying, in general conversation, \u2018I\u2019d hate to work for her,\u2019\u201d said top Clinton donor and fundraiser Alan Patricof. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s worried.\u201d\nOne of the breakout moments for Fiorina at last week\u2019s debate was her impassioned riff against Planned Parenthood \u2014 \"If we do not stand up and force President Obama to veto [funding], shame on us,\" she said \u2013 and Clinton allies see that answer, particularly coming from the only woman in the GOP field, as major ammunition against her party.\nAfter the debate, Clinton\u2019s camp focused on Republicans\u2019 plan to turn the Planned Parenthood funding squabble into a government shutdown fight, and Fiorina\u2019s comments were front and center.\n\u201cThose 25 seconds where she made that emotional plea for a shutdown moved the whole debate over,\u201d explained the strategist close to the Clinton camp. \u201cThe likelihood of a shutdown and the pressure on Republican candidates to endorse a shutdown is a very good thing for Democrats in general, for the Clinton campaign, for everybody.\u201d\n\nHEALTH CARE\n\n            By \nBrett Norman\n\nStill, while the campaign itself has not attacked Fiorina, two of her allies \u2013 Planned Parenthood and EMILY\u2019s List \u2013 have both started going after her more intensely. And Democratic opposition research groups have been shoring up their material on the former executive \u2014 some of it inherited from Boxer\u2014 officials at those groups told POLITICO.\nAnd that, some acknowledged, is indeed because of Fiorina\u2019s position as the sole Republican woman in the race. But it\u2019s not because they see her as a dangerous candidate in her own right.\nWhile Fiorina is unlikely to be the nominee, many Democrats expect her to eventually reprise her summertime role as Clinton\u2019s main antagonist when she becomes an attack dog for the eventual Republican standard-bearer \u2014 so there\u2019s value in getting ready to rough her up.\n\u201cShe can still play an effective role as a surrogate in the general,\u201d said one Washington Democrat who predicts the party\u2019s machinery will eventually ramp up against her.\n\u201cAt some point Fiorina was going to feel the heat. This just happens to be her moment in the sun.\u201d\nFiorina's campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Hillary Clinton's campaign isn't sweating the rise of the GOP's new star.", "title": "Clinton laughs off Fiorina's surge", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/hillary-clinton-laugh-carly-fiorina-213938", "topics": ["abortion"], "people": ["Alan Patricof", "Burgess Everett", "Kenneth P.
