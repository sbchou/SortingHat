The rest of the candidates, those who have registered at least one percent in three national polls, will appear in an earlier debate at 6 p.m. ET.\u00a0\nThe amount of time between the two debates is especially problematic for a candidate like Carly Fiorina, who did well in Fox News' earlier debate (which was four hours ahead of the primetime debate) and is angling to make it to the main stage for the second round.\nFiorina\u00a0is charging that the Republican National Committee should be doing more to ensure that the debate stage represents the true top 10 candidates. At issue, her campaign says, is that CNN should not be giving as much weight to the earlier polls conducted before the first debate. Fiorina began surging in the polls after the first debate, but it's unlikely that enough polls would be conducted, or that Fiorina's surge will be strong enough, to push her into the top ten.\nIf the debate were held today, the candidates who would be in the 9p.m. debate are Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie. Those in the 6p.m. debate would be Rick Perry, Carly Fiorina, Bobby Jindal, Rick Santorum, George pataki, and Lindsey Graham.\u00a0\nUPDATE (10:15p.m.):\nIn a statement, a CNN spokesperson said that the debate criteria will not be adjusted due to FEC guidelines, but that the network believes they are fair.\n\"CNN published the criteria for the CNN-Reagan Library debate on May 20th. It will encompass polling data from three weeks prior to the first debate and five weeks following.\u00a0 Federal Election Commission guidelines make it clear that these criteria cannot be changed after they have been published. We believe that our approach is a fair and effective way to deal with the highest number of candidates we have ever encountered,\" the spokesperson said.\u00a0\n\nHadas Gold is a reporter at\u00a0Politico.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "CNN announced there will be three hours between the debate for the lower-tiered candidates and those at the top of the heap.", "title": "The 'Happy Hour' debate is back", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/08/the-happy-hour-debate-is-back-213089", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Michael Grunwald", "Nicholas Kusnetz", "D.C.
