{"body": "   Donald Trump answers a question at the Republican presidential debate on Thursday in Cleveland (Brian Snyder/Reuters)  ATLANTA -- Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has ended his relationship with Roger Stone, his longest-serving political adviser and a controversial consultant, and says that he is moving quickly to \u201csurround myself only with the best people\u201d as his 2016 campaign deals with a wave of criticism over disparaging remarks the GOP front-runner\u00a0made Friday on CNN about Fox News Channel anchor Megyn Kelly. Dismissing calls for him to leave the race, Trump, in a series of phone interviews\u00a0with The Washington Post, said he firmly believes he can capture the White House without the support of the Republican establishment, which has grown increasingly hostile toward the real-estate mogul. He cited his support among frustrated members of the GOP\u2019s base as well the \u201cmillions of people everywhere\u201d who are unhappy with the political class as his coalition. \u201cI have a lot of money and I\u2019m not getting out. I\u2019m going to win,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou watch, when this campaign is over, I win. As good as I\u2019m doing, and I\u2019m leading the polls, it\u2019s just the start.\u201d \u201cI terminated Roger Stone last night because he no longer serves a useful function for my campaign,\u201d Trump added. \u201cI really don\u2019t want publicity seekers who want to be on magazines or who are out for themselves. This campaign is not about them. It\u2019s about victory and making America great again.\u201d For decades, Stone has been a colorful and at times maligned figure in the Republican Party who relishes political combat and playing a role in causing or exposing unseemly scandals. \u201cPolitics with me isn\u2019t theater,\u201d Stone once told the Weekly Standard. \u201cIt\u2019s performance art. Sometimes, for its own sake.\u201d A devotee of all things Richard M. Nixon, Stone went\u00a0so far as to tattoo the former president\u2019s grinning face on his back. [Stone worked on Nixon's Committee to Re-elect the President] These days, Stone is known for being a self-described \u201chit man\u201d for various campaigns. Trump said that his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, is reaching out this weekend to dozens of early-state operatives and conservative leaders around the country with the goal of expanding Trump\u2019s nascent political network and organization. \u201cI\u2019m going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people. We want top of the line professionals,\u201d he said. The timeline for Stone\u2019s exit from Trump\u2019s inner circle is disputed. Trump insisted that he and Stone, who have been quarrelling for weeks over Trump\u2019s political strategy, was \u201cfired\u201d late Friday after Trump heard from associates about Stone\u2019s grumblings over Trump\u2019s behavior and Trump\u2019s refusal to take his advice ahead of Thursday\u2019s GOP debate in Cleveland. In a phone call Saturday, Stone \u201ccategorically denied\u201d being fired. \u201cI\u2019ll let my resignation letter speak to the other issues,\u201d Stone said in the call. \u201cI have great personal affection for Mr. Trump and wish him well.\u201d Later, in a Twitter message, Stone wrote: \u201cI fired Trump.\u201d In the letter, which was obtained by The Post, Stone expressed regret for the end of a \u201cclose relationship \u2013 both personal and political/professional \u2014 since the 1980s.\u201d But, he added, since \u201ccurrent controversies involving personalities and provocative media fights have reached such a high volume that it has distracted attention from your platform and overwhelmed your core message \u2026 I can no longer remain involved in your campaign.\u201d Trump\u2019s reaction to Stone\u2019s letter: \u201cI fired him Friday night. We sent him a notice.\u201d In conversations Saturday, Trump also responded to the decision made Friday by conservative commentator Erick Erickson to rescind Trump\u2019s invitation to speak Saturday at the close of the RedState gathering here, which was attended by hundreds of anti-establishment activists. Erickson, in an interview Friday, said his\u00a0revulsion at Trump\u2019s remarks about Kelly spurred him to act. \u201cI think there is a line of decency that even a non-professional politician can cross,\u201d Erickson said. \u201cSuggesting that a female journalist asking you a hostile question is hormone related, I think, is one of those lines.\u201d Trump\u2019s CNN interview Friday evening instantly drew criticism after he said Kelly, one of the moderators of Thursday\u2019s Republican presidential debate in Cleveland, \u201chad blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.\u201d Trump on Saturday dismissed Erickson\u2019s influence in GOP circles. \u201cI never liked Erick Erickson, never felt he was the real deal. He knows that, believe me. But he invited me. I said, I\u2019ll go and make a speech. I\u2019m leading in the latest polls in Georgia, I love Georgia, I love Atlanta, so I thought, why not?\u201d he\u00a0said. \u201cEven though it\u2019s not even a big room, I thought I\u2019d make a speech and see some friends and come back the following day.\u201d Trump said he\u2019ll come to Georgia at another time and meet with conservative activists. [Conservatives grapple with surprise Trump snub] Turning to Fox News, Trump said he will continue to war with the network, in spite of its popularity with conservative voters. \u201cFox has had a tremendous backlash about what happened during the debate. And it isn\u2019t so powerful like we thought. Without me, they would have had a million people watching, not 24 million.\u201d On Kelly, Trump said he would not apologize for CNN comment about her and blood. \u201cShe\u2019s a lightweight as a reporter, very unprofessional. Her questions were ridiculous. Only a deviant would think I was saying anything about blood somewhere other than her eyes or her nose. I was using an old expression and nothing more. It wasn\u2019t even a complete sentence.\u201d Since he was no longer flying his private Boeing 757 to Atlanta, Trump said he spent Saturday in New Jersey huddling with friends and would spend the weekend at his properties in the area, being interviewed by reporters and discussing with Lewandowski details about ramping up his campaign\u2019s efforts. \u201cI wish Roger well,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re moving on from him. We\u2019re looking ahead. I am running to win this race. I\u2019m not giving up. This is about the people \u2013 not about him, not about me. I want this to be serious, I really do.\u201d", "byline": "", "description": "GOP front-runner says he fired Stone, but adviser says he resigned after continued disagreements over how campaign was being run.", "title": "Trump ends relationship with longtime political adviser Roger Stone", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/08/trump-ends-relationship-with-longtime-political-adviser-roger-stone/", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "personality"], "people": ["Erick Erickson", "Corey Lewandowski", "Brian Snyder", "Donald Trump", "Megyn Kelly", "Richard M.
