Rand Paul's 2016 presidential campaign is rolling out a set of endorsements from state legislators in caucus states on Thursday, POLITICO has learned.\nThe move underscores Paul's effort to turnaruond lackluster polling and stay competitive in the presidential race by focusing more on caucus states. The hope is that Paul's push to win over delegates now will open a pathway that other campaigns ignore as they tear each other apart jockeying for placement in the earliest primary states. So over the past month or so, Paul has made a concerted push to campaign harder in caucus states like Maine, Washington, Wyoming, and Utah.\nStory Continued Below\nAs part of that push, Paul has secured the endorsements of a number of state lawmakers in those states. The announcement on Thursday includes endorsements in Nevada, Minnesota, Kansas, and Utah. In Nevada, Assemblywoman Shelly Shelton, Assemblyman John Moore are backing Paul. In Minnesota, it's state Sen. Roger Chamberlain, state Sen. Brendan Peterson, Minnesota Republican Liberty Caucus Chairman Neil Lynch. In Kansas, it's state Rep. Brett Hildabrand. And in Utah, state Sen. Mark Madsen, state Rep. Jacob Anderegg, and Utah County Commissioner Bill Lee are all backing Paul.\n\n\n\n            By \nHadas Gold\n             and \nAlex Isenstadt\n\nPaul's campaign advisers say they're particularly optimistic about picking up more endorsements in Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, and Nevada. More endorsements in Utah and Wyoming are also in the pipeline, a Paul aide said. The campaign also hopes that its efforts to organize Paul chapters on college campuses will pay off in caucus states.\nThe endorsements come a day after CNBC announced its criteria for the next Republican presidential debate on Oct. 28 \u2014 which look like trouble for Paul. Under the network's criteria, Paul, who is currently polling at 2.3 percent in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls, could well fall short of making the debate stage.\n\"We feel really confident that we're going to make the next debate,\" Michael Biundo, the Paul campaign's chief strategist for New England, said.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Rand Paul rolls out caucus state endorsements", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/rand-paul-2016-caucuses-214301", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Rachael Bade", "Henry C.
