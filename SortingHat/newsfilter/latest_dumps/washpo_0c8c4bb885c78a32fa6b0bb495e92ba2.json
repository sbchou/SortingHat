{"body": "   Joe Biden in the Oval Office earlier this month. (Reuters/Jonathan Ernst)  THE BIG IDEA: Buzz about Joe Biden jumping into the race keeps getting louder. The Post\u2019s chief correspondent, Dan Balz, reports on the front page this morning that the vice president is now leaning more toward running than earlier in the summer. \u201cThough Clinton has a huge head start, there is confidence that plenty of talent is still available for a Biden campaign team,\u201d he writes. \u201cAmong the issues up for discussion is how difficult it would be to put together an operation that could compete effectively against Clinton in the Iowa caucuses, where organization is considered one key to success.\u201d Biden received President Obama\u2019s \u201cblessing\u201d during a one-on-one lunch yesterday, CNN reports. \u201cThe President made clear he would not stand in his way or counsel him against a run,\u201d a senior Democrat told the network. Last night, Biden and his chief of staff huddled with former top Obama advisers Anita Dunn and Bob Bauer, one of Washington\u2019s best known power couples,\u00a0at his residence. Major Democratic fundraisers are being invited to meet with the VP at the Naval Observatory after Labor Day,\u00a0per Matea Gold. \u201cAmong the guests invited to the gathering are top bundlers who raised large sums for the Obama-Biden campaigns in 2008 and 2012.\u201d REALITY CHECK: There has been a peculiar undercurrent to some of the Biden coverage in recent days: a\u00a0notion that the 72-year-old has nothing to lose by taking on Hillary Clinton in a last-ditch, long-shot bid. There are problems with that scenario. While Biden certainly\u00a0has many accomplishments during his\u00a0four decades in the Senate and 6 1/2 years in the\u00a0White House, giving him as much a claim to be Obama\u2019s natural successor as anyone,\u00a0taking on Hillary is a risky endeavor.\u00a0Here are eight reasons why:  A Biden bid could take an emotional toll on his family. Balz reports that \u201cpersonal issues stand as the biggest unresolved obstacle, with Biden trying to gauge whether his family is emotionally prepared for a grueling campaign while still grieving the recent death of his son Beau.\u201d People familiar with his deliberations say \u201cthe elder Biden is concerned about whether his relatives could handle a bid for the presidency and its time demands on the family patriarch.\u201d He\u2019ll face more scrutiny than at any time since Obama picked him in 2008. Hillary Clinton and her team will not ignore Biden if he runs. They\u2019ll punch back hard. One possible line of attack: The former secretary of state tells audiences that she supported the raid that killed Osama bin Laden while Biden opposed it.\u00a0Looking further back, don\u2019t forget about Biden\u2019s much-criticized role as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman during the Clarence Thomas hearings. If you have forgotten, fear not, a movie (starring Kerry Washington as Anita Hill) is coming soon. The whole episode will certainly not be helpful as Biden, who aborted his 1988 bid after revelations of plagiarism,\u00a0takes on a woman looking to break the ultimate glass ceiling. Biden\u2019s legendary gaffes, often chalked up to \u201cJoe being Joe,\u201d would get covered more critically by the media. In 2007, the VP described Obama as \u201carticulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy.\u201d In 2012, he told a predominantly African-American audience that Mitt Romney would rewrite banking regulations: \u201cHe is going to put y\u2019all back in chains.\u201d The chance of humiliation is significant. Biden is known for being\u00a0good at retail campaigning, but it\u2019s also true that he received just 1\u00a0percent of the vote in the 2008 Iowa caucuses. He didn\u2019t just do badly; he completely tanked, finishing fifth\u2014behind Bill Richardson. Biden will never be able to compete dollar-for-dollar with the Clinton juggernaut. Some key Obama bundlers told Matea Gold yesterday that they\u2019ll stay loyal to Hillary: \u201cAndy Spahn, a major Hollywood fundraiser who advises Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg, wrote in an e-mail that he has \u2018much respect for the job Biden has done as VP but it\u2019s too late in the game to mount a credible campaign.\u2019\u201d Progressives are by no means certain to rally around Biden. Elizabeth Warren, who met with Biden over the weekend, could not realistically endorse him as long as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is in the race. In fact, her advisers went out of their way to downplay the significance of their meeting, stressing that she also met privately with Hillary earlier this year.\u00a0Representing Delaware, Biden supported the bankruptcy bill that Warren made her name crusading against. \u201cWarren called Biden out in her autobiography as one of several high-profile Democrats who championed bankruptcy legislation,\u201d NPR notes. A Biden bid would make things awkward in the White House. Publicly, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest noted yesterday that the president has said picking Biden was \u201cthe smartest decision he ever made in politics.\u201d While also praising Hillary, Earnest declared that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t rule out an [Obama] endorsement\u201d one way or the other.\u00a0Privately, there are palpable doubts that Biden has a prayer against Clinton. \u201cSkepticism about Mr. Biden\u2019s electability looms inside the White House,\u201d Carol E. Lee reports in today\u2019s Wall Street Journal. \u201cMr. Obama\u2019s top aides also have increasingly raised concerns about the complications a Biden candidacy would bring to the West Wing.\u201d It could make it harder for Biden to play an influential inside role if he\u2019s running for president. Biden could be blamed for costing Democrats the White House if he bloodies Hillary.\u00a0He\u00a0could force Clinton to spend resources or move further to the left, though Hillary would still likely win the nomination. This could distract from internecine warfare on the Republican side and make it harder for Clinton to appeal to independents in the general election. If it stayed a close race, and Hillary lost, that could deeply tarnish Biden\u2019s legacy.  WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: \u2014 China\u2019s main stock index plunged further overnight, ending 7.6 percent lower. Other Asian markets fared slightly better, with Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia and Singapore ending the day slightly ahead. Japan\u2019s Nikkei Index was down 4 percent, though Europe\u2019s markets opened higher.\u00a0Wall Street was volatile yesterday, though the futures markets point to a better day today.  Experts are divided over how significant these swings are\u00a0long-term.\u00a0Larry Summers tweeted yesterday:\u00a0\u201cAs in August 1997, 1998, 2007 and 2008 we could be in the early stage of a very serious situation.\u201d\u00a0China \u2014 with its massive debt load \u2014 has been long ripe for a crisis, obviously. But Harvard University economics professor Kenneth Rogoff\u00a0believes China can pull out of the situation given its large savings.\u00a0Still, China\u2019s troubles threaten what has been a \u201cslow but steady\u201d expansion for the U.S. economy,\u201d the Wall Street Journal notes. Republicans quickly integrated China-bashing into the presidential campaign, with Scott Walker demanding President Obama call off next month\u2019s state visit from Chinese Xi Jinping. Donald Trump agreed, telling Fox News\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly last night: \u201cI would not be throwing (Xi) a dinner. I would get him a McDonald\u2019s hamburger and say we\u2019ve got to get down to work.\u201d  \u2014 Jeb\u00a0Bush\u2019s campaign is trying\u00a0to get spending under control. The high command in Florida asked workers to tighten their belts a few weeks ago and a few staff members took pay cuts. A spokesman acknowledged \u201ctargeted cutbacks\u201d\u00a0to\u00a0the New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman but denied they are\u00a0the result of struggles to raise hard money.  Against\u00a0this\u00a0backdrop, Jeb is stepping up his efforts to woo\u00a0Sheldon Adelson,\u00a0the billionaire who could theoretically\u00a0drop tens of millions of dollars into his super PAC.\u00a0At the very least, the Nevada\u00a0casino magnate could command a rival candidate\u2019s super PAC not to spend his millions\u00a0on anti-Jeb ads. The Bush campaign deployed Columba Bush to Vegas to meet with his wife, Miriam, and tour the \u201cDr. Miriam and Sheldon G. Adelson Clinic for Drug Abuse Treatment & Research.\u201d\u00a0Mrs. Bush wrote an op-ed in yesterday\u2019s Review-Journal praising the Adelsons: \u201cI was impressed with Dr. Adelson\u2019s understanding of the complexities of substance abuse, as well as her passion to address this deadly epidemic sweeping across Nevada and the rest of our nation.\u201d Meanwhile, Bush was on the defensive again yesterday over his \u201canchor baby\u201d comments. The former Florida governor dismissed the controversy surrounding his use of the term during a visit to the\u00a0U.S.-Mexico border, saying that he merely used the term to describe instances in which non-Americans abuse the law to gain citizenship for their children, and that he was really referring more to\u00a0ASIANS. The Asian comment has led to a round\u00a0of fresh stories, and it seems likely this will cost\u00a0Bush\u00a0at least one more news cycle. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) started the pile on with this statement last night: \u201cJeb Bush\u2019s comments regarding the children of Asian immigrants are derogatory and offensive. He should immediately retract his statements and apologize to the Asian community for his insensitive behavior.\u201d\u00a0(Video\u00a0of Jeb\u2019s comment)  GET SMART FAST:  Sierra Leone\u2019s last known Ebola patient, Adama Sankoh, was released singing and dancing.

(Los Angeles Times) North and South Korea reached an agreement early Tuesday to resolve the showdown on the divided peninsula, with Pyongyang promising to express regret for recent provocations, including a land-mine attack that severely injured two South Korean soldiers. In return, Seoul agreed to turn off the loudspeakers that have angered Pyongyang so much that it had entered what the North called a \u201cquasi-state of war.\u201d (Anna Fifield) Ashley Madison\u2019s parent company offered $500,000 Canadian ($377,000) to anyone providing information leading to the arrest of those behind the hack, which has also reportedly led to at least two suicides.

The Air Force is set to deploy a small number of F-22 fighters to Europe, the first deployment of its kind, as a part of the continuing effort to reassure allies in the region. The Air Force\u2019s secretary also announced that a contract for a new long-range bomber would be awarded soon, and the project would not be considered a \u201cnew start\u201d program that could be halted if Congress fails to pass a budget for fiscal 2016, Reuters reports. \u201cNorthrop Grumman Corp, maker of the B-2 bomber, is competing against a team made up of Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp for a deal that could be worth $50 billion to $80 billion to the winning bidder.\u201d Ferguson announced that it will withdraw all warrants issued prior to Dec. 31, 2014, whether such warrants are for minor traffic violations or more serious offenses, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. The amnesty affects close to 10,000 warrants. The Louisiana state trooper who was shot in the head during a traffic stop on Sunday died yesterday, making him at least the 21st on-duty police officer to be shot and killed by gunfire in 2015. The Secret Service became concerned in March when a drone was spotted flying near the president as he golfed in Florida, the Palm Beach Post reports. The Sigma Nu chapter at Old Dominion University has been suspended after fraternity brothers hung offensive banners\u00a0in front of the house to welcome new students. Here\u2019s a picture:     @raaaae  POWER PLAYERS IN THE NEWS:  North Dakota\u2019s Republican governor, Jack Dalrymple, announced he won\u2019t seek reelection next year. Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp kept the door open to running for the seat in a statement yesterday, which (if it happens in the deeply-red state) would be a big blow to her party\u2019s hopes of retaking the Senate. Sen. Debbie Stabenow\u00a0(D-Mich.) sided with President Obama on the Iran nuclear deal, meaning that deal foes will now need 10 of the 11 undecided senators to override a veto if they send a resolution of disapproval to the president\u2019s desk. A top fundraiser for Scott Walker, Skybridge Capital\u2019s Anthony Scaramucci, met with Donald Trump yesterday to discuss defecting to Trump\u2019s campaign, the businessman told the Wall Street Journal. Scaramucci, Walker\u2019s\u00a0national finance co-chair, said he told Trump he won\u2019t jump campaigns and asked him to stop bashing hedge-fund managers. Rick Perry\u2019s Iowa campaign chair, Sam Clovis, quit, partially\u00a0because he is no longer being paid. Clovis, a social\u00a0conservative, said he\u2019s talking with another campaign. A lawyer for Huma Abedin, the top Hillary aide,\u00a0accused Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley\u00a0of making \u201cunsubstantiated allegations\u201d that \u201cunfairly tarnished\u201d her\u00a0reputation.

California Gov. Jerry Brown attacked the oil industry for selling a \u201chighly destructive\u201d product. The broadside comes as part of an effort by California Democrats to slash in\u00a0half the Golden State\u2019s gas consumption by 2030. RNC chairman Reince Priebus called Trump \u201ca net positive\u201d for the GOP in an interview on Wisconsin TV. Ohio Gov. John Kasich has avoided taking a position on a controversial bill, likely to pass the state legislature, which would ban abortions because the baby has Down syndrome. (Fox News) A Quinnipiac poll out this morning puts Kasich\u2019s approval rating at 61 percent in the Buckeye State, with only 28 percent disapproving. He\u2019s the only incumbent Republican governor running for president who is popular back home. A new Gallup poll finds 65 percent of Hispanics have a negative view of Trump. (Bloomberg) Former Alabama Gov. Bob Riley endorsed Jeb, days after the sitting GOP governor endorsed Kasich. Trent Lott, meanwhile, endorsed Kasich. Former New Hampshire Gov. John H.

Since May 2015, 14 fin whales, 11 humpback whales, one gray whale and four unidentified specimens have been found dead along shorelines in the Gulf of Alaska\u2026This year\u2019s total is roughly three times the annual average for the region, leading the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to declare the deaths an \u2018unusual mortality event.\u2019 Researchers believe the most likely cause is \u2018unusual water conditions:\u2019 Over the past two years, a large mass of warm water that climatologists have dubbed\u00a0 \u201cthe blob\u201d has persisted in the north Pacific, and El Ni\u00f1o 2015 is pushing more warm water into the region.\u201d Corrections: Yesterday\u2019s 202 included an incorrect filing deadline for getting on the primary ballot in Texas.

The ruling more widely cements the agency\u2019s power to regulate and fine firms that lose consumer data to hackers, if the companies engaged in what the FTC deems \u2018unfair\u2019 or \u2018deceptive\u2019 business practices\u2026\u2019This a huge victory for the FTC, but also for American consumers,\u2019 says [Electronic Privacy Information Center attorney] Alan Butler Butler, who filed an amicus brief defending the FTC\u2019s authority earlier in the case.\u201d \u2014 Politico, \u201cState GOP leaders plot to tie Donald Trump\u2019s hands,\u201d by Alex Isenstadt: \u201cAmid mounting concerns about Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy from the GOP establishment, Republican leaders in at least two states have found a way to make life a lot harder for him. The Virginia and North Carolina parties are in discussions about implementing a new requirement for candidates to qualify for their primary ballots: that they pledge to support the Republican presidential nominee \u2014 and not run as a third-party candidate \u2014 in the general election.\u201d \u2014 New York Times, \u201cJohn Kasich balances his blue-collar roots and ties to Wall Street,\u201d by Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Steve Eder: \u201cAs a congressman and as governor, Mr. Kasich has made hardscrabble stories of life in McKees Rocks a cornerstone of his political biography. And now the story of his blue-collar roots is an important part of how he is trying to distinguish himself in a crowded presidential primary field and draw a contrast with two of his leading competitors, Donald J. Trump and Jeb Bush, who both grew up in wealthy families. But there is a chapter in Mr. Kasich\u2019s life story that conflicts with this narrative: the nearly eight years he spent as an investment banker with Lehman Brothers, the now-defunct Wall Street firm. Mr. Kasich\u2019s career at Lehman, neatly tucked between his time as a congressman and his election as governor, coincided with the bank\u2019s messy collapse in September 2008, a downfall that helped throw the American economy into free fall.\u201d \u2014 The New Yorker, \u201cHillary\u2019s email tangle,\u201d by Steve Coll: \u201cNow the Clintons again confront a scrum of Republican congressmen and conservative activists who are clearly out to get them. Yet the tenacity of Republican opposition researchers does not by itself explain why Clinton and her husband are so often beset by accusation. Both of them too often co-author their dramas by obfuscating and tolerating conflicts of interest, such as when, between 2009 and 2013, with Hillary Clinton guiding American foreign policy, the Clinton Foundation accepted large donations from foreign governments, including several that abuse human rights. The e-mail case is, so far, a more ambiguous tangle.\u201d HOT ON THE LEFT Political flyer circulated in Detroit suburb: \u2018Let\u2019s get the blacks out.\u2019 From Talking Points Memo: \u201cA political flyer circulated anonymously in a Detroit, Michigan, suburb Friday promoted white candidates running for office, with a message that read, \u2018Let\u2019s get the blacks out.\u2019 \u2026 The back of the flyer featured a picture of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed teenager who was killed in 2012 by volunteer neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman.
