But he is particularly focused on stopping pregnant women from illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border for the purpose of having a child or \u201canchor baby,\u201d which reduces the likelihood of the parents being deported.\nTrump announced his plan Sunday, calling the amendment the country\u2019s \u201cbiggest magnet for illegal immigration.\u201d And he continues to suggest his lawyers think the amendment might not withstand a court challenge.\n\u201cI was right,\u201d Trump, the billionaire businessman and top GOP candidate, said Friday night at rally in Alabama. \u201cYou can do something, quickly.\u201d\nHowever, other candidates and legal experts are split on the issue.\n\u201cTrump thinks \u2018our country is going to hell.\u2019 Well, there is likely little more than a chance in hell that we are going to amend the Constitution,\u201d Jessica Levinson, a law professor at Loyola University of Los Angeles, said Wednesday. \u201cAmending the Constitution is one of the most serious things that lawmakers can do. Therefore the path to doing it is rightfully arduous. I would put the chances \u2026 as beyond a longshot.\" \u00a0\n\nTo be sure, changing the Constitution, the supreme law of the land, would require a two-thirds vote in Congress, then ratification from three-fourths of state legislatures. It could also be changed through a constitutional convention in which at least 34 states convene to vote on an amendment, which would then need ratification from at least 38 states.\nTrump since announcing his candidacy in mid-June has made illegal immigrants from Mexico a top concern and has suggested several solutions -- including a wall along the southern border and the change to birthright citizenship.\n\u201cMany lawyers are saying that\u2019s not what (the amendment) is,\u201d he told Fox News on Monday. \u201cThey say it\u2019ll never hold up in court. It\u2019ll have to be tested.\u201d\nTrump six-page immigration proposal was released on the campaign website on Sunday. And within hours, questions about it had become a litmus test for fellow GOP White House candidates and largely divided the field.\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Whaler on Monday said he agreed that birthright citizenship should be ended but that he didn\u2019t back the part of Trump\u2019s plan that calls for deport the so-called anchor babies.\n\u201cI categorically disagree with Trump and Gov. Walker on this point,\u201d former 2016 GOP candidate and former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore said a day later. \u201cDenying people citizenship is wrong. \u2026 I\u2019d very surprised if any lawyer would tell Donald Trump anything like this.\u201d\nOn Thursday, fellow Republican candidate and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush defend using the term.\n\u201cYou give me a better word and I\u2019ll use it,\u201d he told reporters on the campaign trail. Bush earlier in the week commended Trump for producing a comprehensive plan but suggest the issue of what to do with illegal immigrants in the United States must be addresses in a more \u201crealistic\u201d way.\nThe amendment was ratified to the Constitution in 1868, roughly 11 years after the landmark Supreme Court decision Dred Scott v. Sanford that denied citizenship to all African American, whether free or slaves.\nAnd the amendment has already withstood a Supreme Court test. In 1898, the high court ruled that San-Francisco-born Wong Kim Ark was a citizen despite being born to parents of Chinese descent living in the U.S.\nBen Carson, a retired pediatric neurosurgeon and another of the 17 major GOP candidates, said Tuesday that the U.S. allowing the so-called anchor babies \u201cdoesn\u2019t make any sense at all.\u201d\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham also agreed this week that the birthright citizenship issue must be addressed but told CNN that fixing the county\u2019s broken immigration system must come first and that he disagrees with Trump\u2019s call for \u201cforced deportation.\u201d\nSupporters of such a change argue that most European countries don\u2019t automatically grant citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants.\nThe issue has also been a complicated for GOP candidate Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a former Supreme Court lawyer who in 2011 suggested the conservatives would be making a \u201cmistake\u201d in trying to fight against the amendment.\nThis week, Cruz, born in Canada to an American-born mother and Cuban immigrant father, said he supports changes to birthright citizenship.\nCritics of the amendment are trying to make the argument before votes that the hundreds of thousands of children who fall into that category are costing them millions in tax dollars.\nHowever, Levinson questions whether enough Americans will buy the argument.\n\u201cIt may be politically popular with a certain segment of the electorate, but I do not believe this is a mainstream view,\u201d she said, arguing two- thirds of Americans support a path to citizenship or permanent legal status for illegal immigrants. \u201cThis is an argument that is likely to gain traction in the primary elections, but I think it could be viewed quite differently in the general election.\u00a0\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s call to end birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants has refueled the immigration debate and spilt the GOP field and legal experts who question whether such a change is possible.", "title": "Trump's call to end abuse US birthright citizenship divides GOP field, legal experts", "url": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/-UUZlpzZ_Sc/", "topics": ["immigration"], "people": ["Jim Gilmore", "Wong Kim Ark", "Lindsey Graham", "Jessica Levinson", "Jeb Bush", "Donald Trump", "Dred Scott", "Ben Carson", "Ted Cruz"], "orgs": ["GOP White House", "Supreme Court", "GOP", "Congress", "United States."], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-08-22 16:00:17", "org": "fox", "article_id": "5abc39388c42afe6c2ea5f39e4ba24e8", "date_access": "2015-08-22 15:20:04.684687"}
