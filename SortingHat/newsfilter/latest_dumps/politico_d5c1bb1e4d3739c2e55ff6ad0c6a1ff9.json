That was not exactly positive,\" he added, a reference to Bradley Podliska, a former investigator on the Republican side of the panel, who went public with allegations about the committee's mission to destroy Clinton's political reputation.\nStory Continued Below\nTrump then remarked that he saw a \"big pivot\" in Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) in the way the investigation might run.\n\n\n\n            By \nJosh Gerstein\n\nAppearing on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, Gowdy said the he had told fellow GOP colleagues to \"shut up talking about things that you don't know anything about. And unless you're on the committee, you have no idea what we've done, why we've done it and what new facts we have found.\" He also told POLITICO in an interview published Sunday that \u201c[w]hen I hear that \u2018it\u2019s about her,\u2019 it is so hard for me.\" \n\u201cYou are not worth 18 months of my life, with all due respect. Four dead people are, but you\u2019re not,\" Gowdy said of the former secretary of state.\n\"And then yesterday, I watched Trey, who I do respect, I think he's a terrific guy, but he seemed to be doing a big pivot. He said, 'Well this isn't about Hillary Clinton.' You know I'm pretty good at figuring this stuff out, and he seemed to be doing Sean, I'm sure you saw it, he seemed to be doing a big pivot away from Hillary Clinton. And I was trying to figure out what that was all about. So you may not be as happy as you think with these hearings. I just don't know. The hearings \u2014 I was looking forward to them,\" he added. \n\"But with all that's happening, and I was surprised that he pivoted away so much from Hillary. He said these hearings are not about her, actually \u2014 we want to discuss other people much more so. And it sounded like he was sort of pulling away from going after her. So I'm going to have to see what the hearings are all about,\" he concluded.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Donald Trump criticizes Trey Gowdy", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/donald-trump-criticizes-trey-gowdy-214991", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "immigration"], "people": ["Ray Takeyh", "Katy O'Donnell", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Ben Bernanke", "Joe Pompeo", "Anna Palmer", "Hadas Gold", "Paul Demko", "Lauren French", "Steven Shepard", "Joe Biden", "John Boehner", "Brian Mahoney", "Theodoric Meyer", "Nahal Toosi", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Patrick Temple", "Nick Gass", "Trey Gowdy", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Glenn Thrush", "Donald Trump", "John Bresnahan", "Marco Rubio", "Carl Icahn", "Eliza Collins", "Paul Ryan", "Nicholas Vinocur", "Brianna Ehley", "Tim Starks", "Adam Sneed", "Jeremy Herb", "Hillary Clinton", "Jack Lew", "Jake Sherman", "Victoria Guida", "Josh Gerstein", "Eric Wolff", "Bill Tomson", "Darius Tahir", "Sean Hannity", "Caitlin Emma"], "orgs": ["EMV", "NRCC", "Congress", "Senate", "UAW", "House Democrats", "PAC", "Treasury", "Metro", "GOP", "House Freedom Caucus", "House Select Committee"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30728, "fullname": "nick gass", "primary_org": "politico"}, {"author_id": 31592, "fullname": "gabriel debenedetti", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-10-21 12:05:07", "org": "politico", "article_id": "d5c1bb1e4d3739c2e55ff6ad0c6a1ff9", "date_access": "2015-10-21 19:00:23.850558"}
