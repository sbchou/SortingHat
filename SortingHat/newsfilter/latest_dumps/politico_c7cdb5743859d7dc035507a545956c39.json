Bernie Sanders has emerged as her primary opponent.\nAlso on POLITICO\nADAM B. LERNER\nBut the fundraising haul comes as the political world awaits news of the calendar second-quarter figure of Republican Jeb Bush, who has reportedly told donors they have helped him raise his own record-breaking amounts.\nCampaigns must disclose their second-quarter fundraising totals to the Federal Election Commission by July 15, though figures will likely trickle out between now and then. Clinton\u2019s campaign was the first to volunteer its numbers.\nBy JONATHAN RAUCH\nBy MOHAMMAD ALI SHABANI\nBy MICHAEL SHERMER\nBy JOHN SIDES and  ERIC MCGHEE\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The Clinton camp says the number bests Obama's record in 2011.", "title": "Hillary raises $45 million in her first quarter", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/hillary-clinton-campaign-fundraising-first-quarter-119636.html", "topics": ["campaign_finance", "personality"], "people": ["Barack Obama", "Gabriel Debenedetti", "Hillary Clinton", "Bernie Sanders"], "orgs": ["Federal Election Commission", "PAC"], "authors": [{"author_id": 31592, "fullname": "gabriel debenedetti", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-07-01 16:18:41", "org": "politico", "article_id": "c7cdb5743859d7dc035507a545956c39", "date_access": "2015-07-01 16:20:03.725099"}
