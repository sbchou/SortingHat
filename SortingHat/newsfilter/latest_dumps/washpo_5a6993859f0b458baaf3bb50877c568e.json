{"body": "   Jim DeMint (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak)  Heritage Action, the powerful conservative outside group, has distributed criteria to presidential campaigns for who will be allowed to appear at its\u00a0September 18 forum in Greenville, S.C. Former South Carolina \u00a0Sen. Jim DeMint, who now runs the Heritage think tank, will play a prominent role, as will Gov. Nikki Haley, at the afternoon forum. The standard is looser than the top 10 Fox News will allow\u00a0into its\u00a0August debate. A candidate needs to register at or above 3 percent in the national polling average for RealClearPolitics as of July 20, or they need to register at or above one percent support for at least one day between Aug. 1 and Aug. 30. Michael Needham, CEO of Heritage Action, says he wants to make this \u201cthe most substantive policy discussion of the 2016 Republican primary.\u201d Candidates will field detailed questions about conservative policy priorities.\u00a0Invitations will be sent as candidates reach the threshold.\u00a0The event is likely to run from around 4 p.m. to 10 \u00a0p.m., though the schedule is being sorted out. It will take place at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena. In addition to South Carolina activists, the event coincides with the annual meeting of Heritage Action\u2019s most engaged\u00a0activists from around the country.
