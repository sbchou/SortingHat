Why federal departments are nearly immortal.\nWe're working on more stories right now\nJosh Gerstein on the Courts, Transparency, & More\n09/04/15, 02:29 PM EDT\nThe Justice Department's move to put more than 30 lawsuits relating to the emails of Hillary Clinton and four of her top aides in front of a single judge appears unlikely to be resolved before mid-September at the earliest.\nU.S. District Court Judge Ellen Huvelle issued an order Friday (posted here) giving plaintiffs in the various Freedom of Information Act cases until September 14 to respond to the government's request to name a coordinating judge to oversee deadlines for search and production of various sets of emails, as well as contentious issues relating to State's obligations to preserve records that may be responsive to the public records requests at issue.\nWhile no action to coordinate the cases seems likely before the conservative groups and media organizations who filed the FOIA suits weigh in, it's possible some judges could act sooner to suspend the State Department's obligation to meet deadlines to produce emails from private accounts maintained by Clinton or former State Department aides Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin, Jake Sullivan and Philippe Reines.\nIn the past two days, Justice Department lawyers have filed motions to stay deadlines and further action in dozens of pending cases. However, the government says it will not seek to disrupt the order that has led to monthly releases of batches of the 54,000 pages of emails Clinton turned over to the State Department last year. Those releases are set to continue through January, days before the first big test for Clinton's presidential campaign: the Iowa caucuses.\nWhile government lawyers said they intended to have Chief Judge Richard Roberts take up the coordination motion, the order issued Friday signaled that Huvelle was handling the matter on behalf of the court's Calendar and Case Management Committee.\nIn related news, one of the key litigants in the Clinton email FOIA battles has tapped a new, high-powered attorney. Former Solicitor General Ted Olson of law firm Gibson Dunn entered a formal appearance on behalf of Citizens United, a conservative group which has been a Clinton nemesis for decades. Olson is best known in recent years for leading the Republican wing of legal support for court rulings upholding a constitutional right to same sex marriage.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Plaintiffs in the various FOIA cases have until September 14 to respond to the government's request to name a coordinating judge to oversee deadlines for search and production", "title": "No decision likely on Clinton email suit consolidation until mid-September", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2015/09/no-decision-likely-on-clinton-email-suit-consolidation-until-mid-september-213353", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["Ray Takeyh", "Ted Olson", "Kim Davis", "Rachael Bade", "Henry C.
