I am by nature a somewhat conservative person,\u201d he added. \u201cI never looked at putting a label on myself, because frankly putting a label on myself, it didn\u2019t matter \u2014 I wasn\u2019t in politics \u2026 It was something that absolutely had no bearing on me.\u201d\nBy ROBERT EPSTEIN\nBy WILLIAM MCCANTS\nBy TOM KEANE\nBy JACK SHAFER\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "\"When you get down to it, I am a conservative person.
