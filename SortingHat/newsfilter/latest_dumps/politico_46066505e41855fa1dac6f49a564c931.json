John McCain said Monday. But he should apologize to others.\n\u201cBut I think he may owe an apology to the families of those who have sacrificed in conflict and those who have undergone the prison experience of serving their country,\u201d McCain said during an interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\nMcCain, a five-term senator who spent more than five years in the \u201cHanoi Hilton\u201d as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, said he is used to barbs and rhetoric in the political arena.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a hero, but those who were my senior ranking officers, people like Col. Bud Day, a congressional Medal of Honor winner, and those that have inspired us to do things that we otherwise wouldn\u2019t have been capable of doing. Those are the people that I think he owes an apology to,\u201d McCain said.\nFor his part, Trump is not backing down on his comments criticizing the senator\u2019s service. And he has fresh venom for his fellow 2016 contenders as well.\nDuring an appearance at the Family Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa, Trump created an uproar when he told pollster Frank Luntz of McCain: \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d\nThe comments were the latest in a back-and-forth between Trump and the Arizona senator, who went on record in a New Yorker interview last week, calling the candidate\u2019s supporters at a Phoenix rally \u201ccrazies.\u201d\n\u201cI thought it was a term of endearment,\u201d McCain said Monday about the term \u201ccrazies,\u201d adding that he meant it in a way of \u201cpaternal affection\u201d toward Arizona\u2019s political diversity.\nTrump\u2019s remarks provoked widespread condemnation, but he responded to the backlash by doing what he did before on immigration: doubling down.\nIn an Monday interview with NBC\u2019s Matt Lauer on \u201cToday,\u201d Trump again blasted McCain for what he called the \u201cterrible job\u201d he has done for veterans and noting an article from journalist Sharyl Attkisson that concluded that The Washington Post mischaracterized the quote.\nBut he also said he did not expect the comments would turn into an issue.\n\u201cWe talk about John McCain, and I think it\u2019s great. He is a very brave man and all of that, but we don\u2019t talk about the people who weren\u2019t captured, and that\u2019s what I was trying to refer to, and I think I did. And by the way, if you see the news conference right afterwards, a few minutes afterwards, everything was perfect,\u201d Trump said, referring to a press availability after the event in Ames.\n\u201cI never even thought this would be an issue,\u201d Trump added. \u201cMy opponents have brought it up. These are guys who have zeros in the polls.\u201d\nAsked by Lauer if he would say the same thing to McCain\u2019s face, Trump said he would not but took issue with the way his remarks were being characterized.\n\u201cNo, and if you go on [to the next sentence], Matt, see that\u2019s what you don\u2019t do,\u201d Trump said, as Lauer tried to interject.\n\u201cExcuse me, excuse me, Matt, because you\u2019re the media, and you do the same thing. And the next sentence, was \u2018He is a war hero,\u2019 and I said that, but they don\u2019t want to play that and you don\u2019t want to play it \u2026 Excuse me \u2026 Savannah [Guthrie] started it off \u2026 and if you would have let it run another three seconds \u2026 What I do have problems with is that he called 15,000 people that showed up for me to speak in Phoenix, he called them \u2018crazies,\u2019 because they want to stop illegal immigration,\u201d he added.\n\u201cWe did run the other part of your comments, Mr. Trump. So please don\u2019t say that we didn\u2019t, because we did,\u201d Lauer responded.\n\u201cThen why did Savannah start off by saying I said that he was not a war hero. I never said that. I said he was a war hero, Matt. So you misrepresent, just like everyone else,\u201d Trump said.\nTrump also blasted McCain\u2019s stance on immigration reform and border security.\n\u201cHe\u2019s terrible,\u201d Trump remarked. \u201cAnd he\u2019s doing a horrible job with the vets.\u201d\nHe then tied the two issues together.\n\u201cFrankly, illegal immigrants get treated better than many of our vets. It\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d he added.\n\u201cA number of my competitors for the Republican nomination have no business running for president. I do not need to be lectured by any of them. Many are failed politicians or people who would be unable to succeed in the private sector. Some, however, I have great respect for,\u201d he wrote in a USA Today op-ed published Sunday evening.\n\u201cThe reality is that John McCain the politician has made America less safe, sent our brave soldiers into wrong-headed foreign adventures, covered up for President Obama with the VA scandal and has spent most of his time in the Senate pushing amnesty. He would rather protect the Iraqi border than Arizona\u2019s,\u201d Trump wrote.\nEchoing a campaign statement, he noted his support for getting a New York City memorial built for Vietnam War veterans and his work in financing a parade in the same city for 25,000 veterans.\nPoliticians on both sides of aisle have piled on against the Republican billionaire candidate, with some urging him to drop out of the presidential race entirely.\n\u201cEnough with the slanderous attacks,\u201d former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tweeted Saturday.\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, no stranger to going after Trump\u2019s effect on the GOP, denounced his remarks later in his appearance on the dais with Luntz, saying that every prisoner of war \u201cdeserves our recognition and respect.\u201d\nFormer Texas Gov. Rick Perry called on Trump to withdraw from the race in a statement on Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing an individual who\u2019s more interested in throwing invectives and this hyperbolic rhetoric out there, rather than laying out solutions,\u201d he told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd in a \u201cMeet the Press\u201d appearance on Sunday.\nIn another interview with NBC published Monday, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said that \u201cat a minimum,\u201d Trump \u201cneeds to apologize.\u201d He added, \u201cI think more people need to push him.\u201d\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio said Trump\u2019s comments disqualify him from the presidency. \u201cThis is an insult to all POWs, all men and women who have served us in uniform and have been captured,\u201d Rubio said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday.\nThe Republican National Committee itself denounced Trump\u2019s criticism of McCain, the party\u2019s 2008 nominee, as well. \u201cSenator McCain is an American hero because he served his country and sacrificed more than most can imagine. Period. There is no place in our party or our country for comments that disparage those who have served honorably,\u201d RNC spokesman Sean Spicer said in a written statement released Saturday.\nAt least one GOP contender declined to directly criticize Trump, however. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called Senate colleague McCain a \u201chero\u201d in a CNN interview Sunday but said we would not speak ill of a fellow Republican. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do it,\u201d he said.\nHillary Clinton lambasted Trump\u2019s remarks at a state Democratic Party dinner in Arkansas on Saturday night. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful, and so is the fact that it took so long for his fellow Republican candidates to start standing up to him,\u201d she told a room of about 1,500 Democrats. \u201cThe sad truth is if you look at many of their policies, it can be hard to tell the difference.\u201d\nSecretary of State John Kerry, whose own record in Vietnam became an issue in the 2004 presidential campaign, defended McCain\u2019s service. \u201cIf anyone doesn\u2019t know that John McCain is a war hero, it only proves they know nothing about war and even less about heroism,\u201d Kerry said in a statement.\nAs far as McCain himself, the Arizona senator and one-time Republican presidential nominee demurred on whether Trump should pull out of the race.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a decision that he would have to make,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can assure you, if you talk to our veterans, and I\u2019ve had a flood of calls \u2026 they are not happy.\u201d\nBy ROBERT DALLEK\nBy JOSH ZEITZ\nBy COLIN WOODARD\nBy JAY FAISON \n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Politicians on both sides of aisle have piled on against the Republican billionaire candidate.", "title": "McCain on Trump: I don't need an apology, but others deserve one", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/donald-trump-john-mccain-feud-veterans-usa-today-op-ed-120347.html", "topics": ["immigration", "personality"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "John Kerry", "Frank Luntz", "Sean Spicer", "Lindsey Graham", "Jeb Bush", "Rick Perry", "Hillary Clinton", "Donald Trump", "Chuck Todd", "Marco Rubio", "Sharyl Attkisson", "Bud Day", "Ted Cruz", "Scott Walker", "Matt Lauer"], "orgs": ["Family Leadership Summit in Ames", "Senate", "Democratic Party", "Hanoi Hilton", "Republican National Committee", "RNC", "MSNBC", "GOP"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30728, "fullname": "nick gass", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-07-20 11:50:35", "org": "politico", "article_id": "46066505e41855fa1dac6f49a564c931", "date_access": "2015-07-20 12:20:03.490891"}
