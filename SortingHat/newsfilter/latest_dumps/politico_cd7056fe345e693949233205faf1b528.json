Martin O'Malley, former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb \u2014 attracted more than 1 percent support in the poll.\nOn the Republican side, Donald Trump leads at 28 percent. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has focused his campaign on New Hampshire, took second with 12 percent support, with Ben Carson in third with 11 percent support.\nIn Iowa, Clinton's lead over Sanders has narrowed significantly. The former secretary of state now leads Sanders, 48 percent to 37 percent, down from a 29-point lead in an NBC News/Marist poll earlier this summer. (With Biden included as an option, Clinton earns 38 percent, compared to 27 percent for Sanders and 20 percent for the vice president.)\n\n\n\n            By \nTheodoric Meyer\n\nIn the GOP caucuses, Trump and Carson have put some distance between them and the rest of the field. Trump is at 29 percent, and Carson is at 22 percent. The next-closest candidate, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, is at 6 percent.\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who led Trump in a July NBC News/Marist poll in Iowa, was at just 5 percent, joined by Carly Fiorina and Rand Paul.\nThe polls were conducted Aug. 26-Sept. 2. In Iowa, there were 345 potential Democratic caucus participants and 390 Republicans; the margins of error are plus-or-minus 5.3 and 5.0 percentage points, respectively. In New Hampshire, there were 356 potential Democratic primary voters and 413 Republicans; those margins of error are 5.2 and 4.8 points; respectively.\n\n                                            By \nJennifer Haberkorn\n\n\n                                            By \n Frank Cerabino.\n\n\n                                            By \nMatt Latimer\n\n\n                                            By \nHugh Hewitt\n\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Poll: Sanders leads Clinton in New Hampshire, closing in Iowa", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/poll-sanders-maintains-his-lead-in-new-hampshire-213373", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["Nick Gass", "Scott Walker", "Wasserman Schultz", "Kim Davis", "Rand Paul", "David Kendall", "Rachael Bade", "Gerald Ford", "Heather Samuelson", "Henry C.
