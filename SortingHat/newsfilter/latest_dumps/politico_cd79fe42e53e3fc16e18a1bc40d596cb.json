Kevin Brady huddled with roughly 50 K Streeters Thursday afternoon on Capitol Hill to discuss his upcoming bid for the Ways and Means gavel, as a three-way race begins to take shape.\nOhio Rep. Pat Tiberi is whipping support for the gavel, and California Rep. Devin Nunes will consider a bid if Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan wins the speakership. Brady, however, is second in seniority on the committee, and he told downtowners he would jump into the race if Ryan wins the speakership, according to several sources familiar with the meeting.\nBrady ran against Ryan for the chairmanship in 2014, but later took his name out of consideration.\nOne of the chief criticisms of Brady's candidacy is that too many Texans hold committee gavels \u2014 there are six chairmen from the Lone Star State. Brady told the lobbyists that it wasn't an issue because some of those chairmen are term-limited and would no longer lead the panels in the next Congress, according to sources familiar with the meeting. In fact, none of them are term limited until 2018.\nA Brady spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Three-way race taking shape for Ways and Means chairman.", "title": "Three-way race taking shape for Ways and Means chairman.", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/the-gavel/2015/10/ways-means-chairman-race-215080", "topics": ["personality", "trade", "abortion", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Devin Nunes", "Isaac Arnsdorf", "Sidney Blumenthal", "David Kendall", "Rachael Bade", "Elena Schneider", "Anna Palmer", "Hadas Gold", "Eric Schultz", "Carla Marinucci", "Austin Wright", "Tim Starks", "Michael Bloomberg", "Joe Biden", "Jenny Hopkinson", "Brian Mahoney", "Josh Gerstein", "Annie Karni", "John Cornyn", "Katie Glueck", "Nick Gass", "Trey Gowdy", "Seung Min Kim", "Donald Trump", "John Bresnahan", "Jake Sherman", "Eliza Collins", "Paul Ryan", "Brianna Ehley", "Lauren French", "Lynn Westmoreland", "Adam Sneed", "Jeremy Herb", "Daniel Strauss", "Kevin Brady", "Hillary Clinton", "Pat Tiberi", "Emanuel Cleaver", "Eric Wolff", "Darius Tahir", "Caitlin Emma"], "orgs": ["Congress", "IPAB", "AARP", "Senate", "CISA", "GOP"], "authors": [{"author_id": 31395, "fullname": "anna palmer", "primary_org": "politico"}, {"author_id": 31180, "fullname": "jake sherman", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-10-22 22:44:21", "org": "politico", "article_id": "cd79fe42e53e3fc16e18a1bc40d596cb", "date_access": "2015-10-22 22:00:26.338579"}
