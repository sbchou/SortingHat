(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)  A top aide to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton testified on Thursday for more than nine hours before a congressional committee investigating the Benghazi attacks and Clinton\u2019s use of a private e-mail server. Cheryl Mills served as Clinton\u2019s chief of staff at the time of the Benghazi attack and has been a confidant and legal adviser to the Democratic presidential front-runner since the early 1990s. Details of her testimony will be treated as classified pending further review, but Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.),\u00a0chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, told reporters after the hearing that Mills answered all of the committee\u2019s questions. \u201cThe dialogue was professional and productive,\u201d Gowdy said. Mills\u00a0declined to answer any specific questions about her testimony \u201cThe tragedy in Benghazi was about more than what\u2019s happening in this room,\u201d Mills said.\u00a0\u201cIt is about the loss of individuals who were dear to the State Department and dear to this country.\u201d Mills\u2019s closed-door testimony before the House Select Committee on Benghazi comes right after the release of roughly 7,000 pages of e-mails from Clinton\u2019s private server by the State Department, which has been doing the releases on a rolling basis since the former secretary turned them over to the department in December. [Clinton, using private server, wrote and sent e-mails now deemed classified] Mills testified under oath and responded to questions from both Democrats and Republicans.\u00a0Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) the top Democrat on the committee, told reporters on Thursday that Mills requested that she be allowed to give her testimony in a public session to avoid having any of her\u00a0comments taken out of context. But that request was denied by the committee. \u201cShe wanted the public to hear everything she had to say,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cI think one of her concerns was that there would be leaks.\u201d Instead the closed session was held in a secure room in a basement of the Capitol. Cummings\u00a0called on\u00a0Gowdy\u00a0to\u00a0release a full transcript of the testimony to avoid leaks and allow Mills\u2019s testimony to be judged as a whole. [Sign up for The Daily 202, The Washington Post\u2019s new political tipsheet] Mills is among several aides who have been called before the committee in recent weeks.\u00a0Jake Sullivan, Clinton\u2019s deputy chief of staff during that period and current foreign policy adviser to her campaign, is scheduled to answer questions Friday. Mills was also\u00a0among several officials whose e-mails were redacted because of national security concerns. On Monday, the attorney for another State Department staffer, Bryan Pagliano, informed the committee\u00a0that he would assert his Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions to avoid incriminating himself. Pagliano set up the server in her New York home in 2009 after first serving on her 2008 campaign for president. [Staffer who worked on Clinton\u2019s private e-mail server faces subpoena] The probe and a related public records case have become a nagging thorn in the side of Clinton in her bid for the 2016 presidential nomination. Clinton is currently subject to five separate investigations, including three on Capitol Hill, according to a Washington Post analysis. The Republican-led committee was originally established to investigate the State Department response to the 2012 embassy attack but expanded into a broader probe after it was revealed that Clinton used a private e-mail server to conduct official business. Democrats, including Cummings, have accused Republicans\u00a0using the investigation to derail Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign rather than investigate the terror attack. \u201cOne of the things that certainly concerns me is that this investigation has turned into a quest to derail Clinton nomination by any means necessary,\u201d Cummings said during a break from the hearing on\u00a0Thursday. \u00a0", "byline": "", "description": "Mills's before the House Select Committee on Benghazi comes right after the release of roughly 7,000 pages of e-mails from Clinton's private server by the State Department.", "title": "Top Clinton aide testifies in closed-door session on Capitol Hill", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/09/03/top-clinton-aide-testifies-in-closed-door-session-on-capitol-hill/", "topics": ["personality", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Trey Gowdy", "Bryan Pagliano", "Cheryl Mills", "Hillary Clinton", "Jake Sullivan", "Elijah Cummings"], "orgs": ["State Department", "House Select Committee"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30993, "fullname": "kelsey snell", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-09-03 23:10:29", "org": "washpo", "article_id": "2a213ed771c456ae369148bdbe497fbd", "date_access": "2015-09-03 23:00:04.768812"}
