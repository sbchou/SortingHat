And when your prophecies don\u2019t come to pass, the way out is simple. You just point at the unicorn barn. That\u2019s where the other guys \u2013 the bad guys who are too scared, too stupid or too corrupt \u2013 keep the solutions locked away.  Republicans won\u2019t agree to an unconditional increase to the debt limit? Mint a $1 trillion coin, Mr. President. Supreme Court rules against conservatives on same-sex marriage? Simple: Just ignore the court.  Any criticism of the plans can be brushed away by calling for another unicorn release (FYI: they eat mostly Frankenberry and pepperoni pizza Combos): \u201cwinning the messaging war\u201d or similar claptrap that imagines an unpopular point of view will garner more support in the midst of a vicious public struggle. Or that shame somehow still exists in American civic life.  None of this is to say that politicians don\u2019t sometimes fail because they are scared (often), stupid (sigh) or corrupt (occasionally). Stipulated. But the unicorn wranglers are the ones who exploit the failing system by making impossible promises.  Last week, President Obama rustled up a whole herd of unicorns on the issue of gun control. To listen to the president, one would have assumed that there was a piece of legislation or a serious proposal under consideration that would have prevented the most recent campus killings.  In this version, Republicans are too scared, stupid and corrupt to allow this \u201ccommon sense\u201d legislation to advance. But that\u2019s not the case. In recent years, Democrats have focused mostly on closing loopholes in federal background checks \u2013 especially on private sales.  But in none of the recent mass shootings that spur these occasional surges in media interest in gun control has the so-called \u201cgun-show loophole\u201d been a factor. There were lapses in the application of existing laws and failures to report obvious mental illnesses, certainly, but not one used a private sale to circumvent the law.  We had a similarly disjointed conversation after the 2012 massacre in Newtown, Conn. Then, the focus was on banning certain weapons, and reinstating the lapsed \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban. But that turned out to be false prophecy, too. So the movement moved back to the background check argument.  The president knows about these disconnections. But, he argued Thursday, it is appropriate to politicize the moments that refocus public attention on the issue of gun laws. Well, maybe.  It\u2019s certainly fine to use a searing incident to advance legislation to prevent its recurrence. But it\u2019s neither wise nor appropriate to exploit a tragedy for achieving a substantially unrelated goal.  There\u2019s no way to know how many or how few of the more than 11,000 homicides committed with firearms in 2013 (the most recent data available) were facilitated by a private sale. If you want to close the loophole, then find the victims of it and make martyrs of them. But don\u2019t placate your political base and stoke contributors on the grounds that you have a solution. And certainly don\u2019t do so with the deaths of citizens as props.  But who wants to tell voters a sad story about complicated public safety in a world where pistols outnumber functional families, of unraveled communities and the pharmacological palliatives pasted on top of them? Calling to regulate the firearms industry more sure sounds better.  There is one plan that might arguably prevent mass shootings. The president made passing reference to something in the vein when he mentioned that Australia had changed its laws in response to a mass shooting there. What he was referring to was a 1996 law that enacted a sweeping ban on many firearms, including existing ones, and set rigid requirements for gun licenses.  A ban and mass confiscations might work (or it might not) but at least it is on topic. But is the president really ready to lead the fight for a constitutional amendment to allow such a thing? Or wreck the remainder of his presidency in a legal fight over the Second Amendment he would surely lose?  Most likely, Obama will blame the bad guys in the other side and then fill the feedbags with Frankenberry. On to the next fundraiser, guys.  And now we know what Hillary Clinton is going to do, too.

One Democratic strategist who has talked with Biden insiders about the run told Fox News First that it seemed the team was trying to \u201cget to yes\u201d and that many had already made up their minds. Cillizza asks the right questions about a hypothetical Biden run:  \u201cBut what happens from there? Are undecided Democratic voters reminded of the things \u2014 his tendency to just say stuff, his long years spent in official Washington, etc. \u2014 that made Biden less than appealing as a candidate for the big job during his past two bids? Or would a Biden candidacy lead to a reevaluation of Clinton by many establishment types who have stayed with her simply because they can\u2019t imagine backing Sanders? Could Biden, under this scenario, trigger a full-scale revolt against Clinton by some (or many) of the establishment building blocks of her candidacy?\u201d  Bernie crowds break records again - Byron York checks the temperature on the Bernie Sanders movement in Boston. The answer: \u201cIn 2007, candidate Barack Obama, drawing rockstar crowds on his way to the White House, held a rally on Boston Common that drew 10,000 people. It was the biggest political gathering in Massachusetts in decades. On Saturday Bernie Sanders brought more than twice that number, an estimated 24,000, to the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center -- close to 20,000 inside the cavernous building and the rest watching a big screen outside.\u201d  IT\u2019S OFFICIAL: HASSAN CHALLENGES AYOTTE Roll Call: \u201cGov. Maggie Hassan announced Monday she is\u00a0challenging GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte for Senate in the Granite State, rather than seek a third term as governor. It\u2019s a move Democrats say gives the party its\u00a0best shot at picking up a seat that will prove critical to Senate control\u2026. In recent months, a\u00a0handful of polls found Hassan and Ayotte tied in a head-to-head match-up. And Democrats say Hassan will be a strong fundraiser with a proven history of winning statewide in New Hampshire. But Ayotte starts the race with a significant cash on hand advantage and the power of incumbency, giving her a slight edge more than a year from Election Day.\u201d  WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026 National Geographic: \u201cIn a study published recently in the\u00a0journal Animal Behaviour, [Kaeli Swift] found that\u00a0American crows\u00a0associate people seen handling dead crows with danger, and can be wary of feeding near such people. At the start of her two-year experiment, Swift put out food at over a hundred sites where in Washington State, which attracted breeding and nesting crows. Swift then had about 25 human volunteers don masks and asked them to stand near the food for 30 minutes, in clear view of the crows\u2026Each volunteer was either holding a dead crow, standing near a dead red-tailed hawk\u2014a crow predator\u2014or standing near a dead red-tailed hawk holding the dead crow\u2026As the control variable in the experiment\u2026there was either no volunteer present or one who was empty-handed. Almost universally, the crows responded to seeing the people and dead birds by \u2018scolding\u2019\u2014or putting out an alert call to other crows.\u201d  Got a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

This week\u2019s Power Index reflects the shifting ground in two of those states.  Especially in New Hampshire where this month\u2019s NBC/WSJ Marist poll shows Carly Fiorina making a 10-point leap: from 6 percent last month to 16 percent this month. She still trails frontrunner Donald Trump, but her Granite State surge shows a potential path for Fiorina who has been mostly surfing the national zeitgeist.  The bad news was for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, whose numbers receded after a media blitz from his super PAC helped get him to the top tier there. He now sits in seventh place behind fellow all-or-nothing-in-New Hampshire candidate Gov. Chris Christie.  But if anyone has a reason to breathe a sigh of relief at this poll it\u2019s Jeb Bush who gained 3 points and finished in third place, but not enough to offset continuing national woes.  Bush spent the weekend weathering the fallout from saying \u201cstuff happens\u201d about a recent mass shooting. It may not have an immediate effect on Bush\u2019s polling, but now is certainly not the time that Bush can afford to look wobbly before skeptical donors.  The early state verdict on poll-leading Trump: he led both surveys but showed new weakness, especially in New Hampshire where Trump saw a 7-point decrease.  1)\u00a0Ted Cruz; 2)\u00a0Carly Fiorina\u00a0[+1]; 3) Marco Rubio\u00a0[+1]; 4)\u00a0Jeb Bush\u00a0[-2]; 5)\u00a0Donald Trump;\u00a06)\u00a0Ben Carson; 7)\u00a0Chris Christie\u00a0[+1]; 8)\u00a0John Kasich\u00a0[-1]; 9)\u00a0Mike Huckabee; 10)\u00a0Bobby Jindal [previously unranked]  On the radar:\u00a0Rand Paul,\u00a0Rick Santorum,Lindsey Graham,\u00a0George Pataki,\u00a0Jim Gilmore  What would you say?\u00a0-\u00a0Give us your take on the 2016 Power Index we will share the best and brightest with the whole class.

So what? One could argue that by the same logic that Republicans use to say that taxpayer funding for the group\u2019s non-abortion-related activities, Fiorina\u2019s patronage of the firm generates revenues that facilitate its overall operations, thereby indirectly supporting the Planned Parenthood contributions of others. You wouldn\u2019t know that from the lede of the story, which is part of the ongoing media irradiation of the only female GOP contender, but that\u2019s the crux: \u201cAsked if Fiorina has a problem with Ayco distributing funds to Planned Parenthood, and if she\u2019s ever lobbied them to stop, [campaign spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores] said, \u201cCarly has no control over those clients and their giving preferences.\u201d Asked why Fiorina doesn\u2019t just find a donor-advised fund that vows never to give money to Planned Parenthood on behalf of anyone, Flores didn\u2019t respond.\u201d  [But along with the press lashing, Fiorina\u2019s rise has given her the chance to make her case to deep-pocketed donors in the Koch network. Or so says Reuters.]  POWER PLAY: TWO-FRONT WAR ON PLANNED PARENTHOOD Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge is locked in a fight in her state over defunding Planned Parenthood, and making a push for the Supreme Court to reconsider Arkansas\u2019 struck-down ban on abortions after the first trimester. She tells Chris Stirewalt how the battle is going. WATCH HERE.  NEWT, RYAN RALLY TO MCCARTHY Presenting himself as a uniter, Jason Chaffetz, R- Utah, announced his bid Sunday to become the next House speaker, challenging next-in-line Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and vowing to \u201cbridge the divide\u201d that has roiled the chamber\u2019s Republican caucus. \u201cI\u2019m offering myself as an alternative,\u2019 Chaffetz told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Chaffetz\u2019s entry may be uniting Republicans, but perhaps not as he had intended. McCarthy appears to have the support of a majority of House Republicans \u2013 making him the likely winner of a closed-door election set for Thursday.  While neither McCarthy nor Chaffetz appear to have a clear path to the necessary 218 votes from the full House later this month, McCarthy is rallying. He now has support from Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich calling McCarthy \u201cfar and away the best man to be Speaker\u201d  Scalise claims he\u2019s got the votes - WaPo: \u201cRep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) said Sunday he has secured enough votes to be elected House majority leader in elections scheduled for Thursday, putting him in position to move a rung up on the GOP leadership ladder. Scalise, the sitting majority whip, made the announcement in an evening conference call with supporters. He said he won the commitment of his 124th supporter in recent days, giving him the requisite margin in the 247-member House Republican Conference, according to three people familiar with the call.\u201d  [Despite a push by some members to delay the elections, Boehner\u2019s office tells Fox News\u2019 Chad Pergram \u201cAll leadership elections remain on Thursday.\u201d]  Tweetstorm - Deriding the media\u2019s framing of Speaker\u2019s race as a \u201c[R]eductionistic choice: small-ball Establishment vs wild-eyed Visigoths who want to burn govt to ground,\u201d Nebraska\u2019s junior Sen.

OH, IN THAT CASE\u2026 Yahoo!: \u201cA driver will not be facing criminal charges for having a brown bear in the back of his car - because the animal was apparently wearing a seatbelt. The astonishing images were caught on camera in Yekaterinburg, Russia, earlier this month. Stunned motorists couldn\u2019t believe their eyes when they spotted the bear lounging in the rear of the Volga. They even saw it playfully sticking its head out of the window\u2026Local police said it was not illegal to transport bears in this way - as long as they wore a seatbelt, in accordance with the Russian road traffic laws.\u00a0They did not specify whether they had spoken with the driver or how they had verified that the bear was wearing a seatbelt. But officers confirmed they would not be taking any legal action against the driver.\u201d  Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News. Want FOX News First in your inbox every day?
