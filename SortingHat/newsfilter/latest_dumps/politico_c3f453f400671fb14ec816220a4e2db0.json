Marco Rubio said Wednesday.\nSitting down for an interview with \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d the Republican presidential contender responded both to a clip of Obama teasing critics of the Iran deal that \u201ceverything would be fine\u201d if former Vice President Dick Cheney had been on the negotiating team and Donald Trump\u2019s latest remarks.\nStory Continued Below\nAnd the way Trump has behaved recently is neither \u201cdignified\u201d nor \u201cworthy\u201d of the presidency either, Rubio added.\nMore on POLITICO\n\u201cWe already have a president now that has no class. I mean, we have a president now that does selfie stick videos, that invites YouTube stars there, people that eat cereal out of a bathtub,\u201d the Florida senator remarked, recalling the president\u2019s past social media forays.\nThe next presidency, Rubio said, needs to restore \u201cdignity and class to the White House.\u201d\n\u201dI don\u2019t believe that some of the language that Mr. Trump is employing is worthy of the office. I just do not,\u201d Rubio said.\nBy ADAM WREN\nBy MATT CAROTENUTO and  KATHERINE LUONGO\nBy REP.
