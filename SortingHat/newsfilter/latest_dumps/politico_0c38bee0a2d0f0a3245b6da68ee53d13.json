Jackson\n7/22/15 6:23 PM EDT\nTHE CLOCK: 475 days until Election Day 2016 \u2026\nDEBATE CLOCK: 15 days until the first Fox News GOP debate in Cleveland...\nStory Continued Below\nBUSH\u2019s REFORM MYTH: POLITICO\u2019s Marc Caputo and Eli Stokols report: In his highly touted speech on government reform this week, Jeb Bush accused President Barack Obama of waiting too long to remove tainted appointees, saying he would take on \u201cMount Washington\u201d in the same way he made \u201cMount Tallahassee\u201d more accountable when he was governor of Florida.\nBut his eight-year record shows he often stood by appointees who were mired in scandal or mismanagement until long after damaging revelations emerged, and in only two reported instances clearly fired agency heads \u2014 one accused of sexual harassment, and another of taking kickbacks.\nBush publicly backed embattled appointees at the Department of Children and Families \u2014even amid revelations that the agency lost track of 515 children under state care, including a child who was murdered. He supported his corrections chief throughout a scandal involving guards engaging in beer-soaked brawls, stealing state property, selling steroids, and impressing inmates into forced labor. Bush finally fired the prison chief, Jimmy Crosby, in early 2006 when it became clear he was part of a bribery and kickback scheme, for which he was later convicted.\nBush also supported a state law-enforcement commissioner accused of inappropriately interfering in the investigation of the death of a 14-year-old boy beaten by guards at a boot camp. The commissioner ultimately resigned after making inappropriate comments about \u201cBarack Osama\u201d and \u201cJesse James\u201d \u2014 his nicknames for then-Sen. Barack Obama and Jesse Jackson, who were invited to a march in protest of the boot-camp death.\nRead the full story tonight on POLITICO.com\nHappy Wednesday and welcome to today\u2019s 2016 Blast.
