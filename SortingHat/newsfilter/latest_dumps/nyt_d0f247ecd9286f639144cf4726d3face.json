{"body": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s entry into the race for the presidency has goosed the egos of some conservative ganders.\n\nWayne LaPierre, the C.E.O. and executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, on the eve of Clinton\u2019s announcement said of President Obama at the group\u2019s annual meeting, \u201cwhen he\u2019s finished, he intends to go out with the coronation of Hillary Rodham Clinton.\u201d There were boos. LaPierre continued: \u201cYeah, I have to tell you, eight years of one demographically symbolic president is enough.\u201d There were cheers.\n\nFox News\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly ratcheted up the rhetoric on Monday. With the words \u201cHILLARY CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT\u201d in yellow and all-caps next to his face, he bemoaned the idea that \u201cour traditional American values are under siege nearly everywhere,\u201d and then added: \u201cIf you\u2019re a Christian or a white man in the U.S.A., it\u2019s open season on you. Therefore, Hillary Clinton has an advantage.\u201d\n\nIn a way, one would expect nothing more from these men. They are simply playing to their bases.\n\nAs U.S. News and World Report put it in 2013 when noting a Pew Research Center report: \u201cWhite men represent just a third of the U.S. population, but about 60 percent of adults with guns in America today are white men.\u201d\n\nAnd as for Fox, the website Mediaite reported in December that just 1 percent of Fox News viewers are black.\n\nAnd yet, this faux oppression makes a mockery of very real oppression. Aside from the hilarity of the incongruous spectacle of two incredibly powerful white men grousing about the lowly plight of white men in general is the utter ridiculousness of the idea itself.\n\nAnd unfortunately, this isn\u2019t a new idea, but the resurrection \u2014 or elongation \u2014 of an existing one.\n\nIn 2012, the conservative commentator Matt K. Lewis wrote an entry on The Daily Caller under the headline \u201cThe silent war on noncollege-educated white men.\u201d\n\nThat same year, the conservative blog RedState.com published an essay under the headline, \u201cThe Democrat War on White Men.\u201d It included lines like \u201cDemocrats hate White Men\u201d (capitalization theirs), \u201cWhite Men in unions are tolerated and helped by Democrats \u2014 but only if they fall in line to punish other White Men\u201d and \u201cWhite Men were politically neutered and forgotten about.\u201d\n\nSuzanne Venker wrote an opinion piece in 2013 on FoxNews.com under the headline \u201cMen \u2014 the new second class citizens.\u201d She included the following passage:\n\n\u201cYet it is males who suffer in our society. From boyhood through adulthood, the White American Male must fight his way through a litany of taunts, assumptions and grievances about his very existence. His oppression is unlike anything American women have faced.\u201d\n\nIn August, Representative Mo Brooks, a Republican of Alabama, said on Laura Ingraham\u2019s radio show that there is a \u201cwar on whites that\u2019s being launched by the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nOne thing that makes this line of reasoning so grating is the degree to which money and power in this country continue to be dominated by white men. As The Guardian reported in 2013, the \u201cU.S.\u2019s top-paid executives in 2012 represent technology, coffee, and sporting goods companies \u2014 and all are white and male.\u201d\n\nThinkProgress, expanding on the report, explained:\n\n\u201cA big part of the lack in diversity on the list is the lack of diversity among executives overall. Women hold few of the top jobs at major companies. There are now 22 at the helm of Fortune 500 companies with Lynn Good\u2019s appointment as CEO of Duke Energy in July, which means less than 5 percent of those positions are filled by women.\n\n\u201cTop executives are also not racially diverse. Among Fortune 500 CEOs, six are black, making up just 1.2 percent. There are eight Latino and eight Asian CEOs, accounting for just 1.6 percent each.\n\n\u201cBut even when they reach the highest rungs, women are still paid less than their peers.\u201d\n\nIn politics, the race and gender inequities are also stark.\n\nAs The Washington Post reported in January, \u201cthe new Congress is 80 percent white, 80 percent male and 92 percent Christian.\u201d\n\nSo much for white Christian men being under attack.\n\nThis presidential season has the promise to bring a tremendous amount of diversity. Not only is Clinton the leading figure on the Democratic side, but the Republicans have a plethora of diverse options, at least in terms of race, ethnicity and gender.\n\nJeb Bush and Marco Rubio both have strong ties to the Hispanic community. Rubio is Hispanic and Jeb Bush has a Mexican-born wife and once, inexplicably, listed himself as Hispanic on a voter form.\n\nThe disastrous Louisiana governor, Bobby Jindal, who is Indian-American, is mulling a run. (I\u2019m not sure Jindal would approve of that hyphenation, by the way, because in a 2013 Politico essay he chafed at what he saw as us placing \u201cfar too much emphasis on our \u2018separateness,\u2019\u201d and rebuffed that idea of hyphenation, saying, \u201cHere\u2019s an idea: How about just \u2018Americans?\u2019\u201d)\n\nBen Carson, the brilliant neurosurgeon and baffling political figure, who is African-American (sorry, Governor Jindal), is scheduled to make an announcement in Detroit next month about whether he will enter the race. Carson is the same man who once said that white liberals are \u201cthe most racist people there are\u201d and don\u2019t want people to \u201ccome off the plantation.\u201d\n\nEven Carly Fiorina, who was forced out as the C.E.O. of Hewlett-Packard, is expected to run for the Republican nomination. But some Republican king makers \u2014 or queen makers \u2014 seem to see her more as a tool than as a true talent. As Time magazine recently reported: \u201cA Republican strategist told Time last year that Fiorina could be a potent weapon for the GOP in the coming cycle. \u2018The most effective way to criticize a woman is to have another woman do it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThis is a flawed field, to be sure, but it is diverse. The last thing we need is for men like LaPierre and O\u2019Reilly to complain about the prospects of an expansion of power that would include more people who don\u2019t look like them.\n\nAmerica is moving forward, tilting and transforming, and the bulwarks of traditional powers are crumbling.", "byline": "CHARLES M.
