And across the Hill campus, a source said Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans also want to know more about Samuelson\u2019s work was doing, who followed Clinton to the State Department after working on her 2008 campaign.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cI\u2019m not exactly certain what day, but obviously she had a role in the email issue and so it\u2019s important for us to get the facts as to what her instructions were and what her knowledge was and really what happened surrounding the email decisions \u2014 and so yes, we\u2019ll be hearing from her,\u201d said Rep. Susan Brooks, an Indiana Republican who sits on the Benghazi panel, on Monday.\nIf Samuelson does not appear willingly, the committee could decide to subpoena her, according to one Republican source familiar with the investigation.\nClinton\u2019s former chief of staff Cheryl Mills said Samuelson was the attorney who went through each email to preliminarily decide which messages were work related and should be turned over, several sources told POLITICO last month. Samuelson has not responded to requests for comment.\nRepublicans are likely to ask Samuelson about what instructions she was following while combing through Clinton\u2019s emails. Under preservation rules at federal agencies, even emails with the slightest bit of work-related information in them must be stored as public records.\nThe GOP hopes to question Samuelson following the latest revelation that suggest Clinton may not have turned over all her work-related email traffic.\nEarlier this year, Clinton said she did not begin using her homemade email server until March of 2009, about two months after she began working at the State Department. \nBut according to reports, the State Department said Friday it received copies of a January 2009 exchange from Clinton's private account with Gen. David Petraeus, correspondence that only came to light after it was forwarded to State from the department\u2019s inspector general and the Defense Department. \nClinton dodged questions about the matter on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d Sunday.\n\u201c[W]e have a very thorough review process that we conducted, and my attorneys supervised it,\u201d Clinton said last Sunday. \u201cThey went through everything. And what we had available at the time was turned over.\u201d\nWhen pressed about the timeline discrepancy between when she began using the private account and the Petraeus message, Clinton added: \u201cThere was a transition period. You know, I wasn't that focused on my email account to be clear here.\u201d\nSince Clinton used a personal server rather than a State.gov account, her legal team was tasked with going through each message to decide which should be preserved and turned over to the State Department.\nMills and Clinton\u2019s lawyer David Kendall made the ultimate decisions about what exactly was turned over, Clinton camp sources say. Her team said they then deleted the rest of the \u201cpersonal\u201d emails\u2014but the FBI, which is investigating whether classified intelligence was ever put at risk, has recovered those documents, according to reports.\nNow Republicans want to hear from Samuelson. The Benghazi committee months ago found more than a dozen other undisclosed work-related emails Clinton had not turned over after subpoenaing her ally Sid Blumenthal for any correspondence he had with Clinton that was related to Libya.\nRepublicans are concerned that more may have been kept from the public.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s essential we talk to her,\u201d said Rep. Lynn Westmoreland (R-Ga.).\n Clinton\u2019s camp has said that they were over-inclusive in what they classified as an official document. And State has had to return some messages they say are not official. But it\u2019s unclear exactly how they classified the information as \u201cpersonal\u201d and work related.\nAccording to her Linked-In profile, Samuelson, who received her law degree from American University, began working for Clinton in the fall of 2002 as the assistant treasurer for her political action committee, Hill PAC, and as deputy director of compliance for Friends of Hillary.\nShe stayed there four years before joining Hillary Clinton for President in January 2007. For nine months she worked on compliance issues before serving as director of vetting in the campaign\u2019s counsel\u2019s office.\nWhen Clinton moved to State, so did she, working for four years as senior advisor and White House liaison at the State Department from January 2009 to March 2013.\nShe then served as assistant counsel at the White House from then until April of 2014.\nIt is unclear where she is now, but a Maryland State Bar Association listing shows her address is now in Brooklyn, N.Y., which is also where Hillary for America is headquartered.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "GOP wants to hear from Clinton email screener", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/hillary-clinton-emails-benghazi-214188", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Joseph J.
