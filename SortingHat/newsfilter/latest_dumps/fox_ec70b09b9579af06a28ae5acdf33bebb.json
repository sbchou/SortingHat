Rick Perry announced Friday that he's suspending his presidential campaign, becoming the first in the crowded Republican field to bow out.\u00a0\nThe longest-serving governor in Texas history announced his decision during a speech Friday night in St. Louis before conservative activists.\u00a0\n\"I am suspending my campaign for the presidency of the United States,\" Perry said.\u00a0\nPerry, who also ran in 2012, has struggled to get his campaign off the ground, finding himself strapped for cash and stuck polling at near 1 percent.\u00a0\nIn his St. Louis speech, Perry took some parting, albeit veiled, shots at primary front-runner Donald Trump, saying the eventual nominee \"must make the case for the cause of conservatism more than the cause of their own celebrity.\"\u00a0\nBut he went on to say, \"We have a tremendous field of candidates -- probably the greatest group of men and women -- I step aside knowing our party is in good hands.\"\u00a0\n\nHe said the party must \"listen to the grassroots, listen to that cause of conservatism.\"\u00a0\nPerry is the first major candidate to bow out, leaving the field of Republicans at 16 candidates, just days before the next GOP debate.\u00a0\nAt the lead-off GOP debates in August, Perry's polling left him in the undercard debate, but former HP head Carly Fiorina stole the spotlight in that event. She has climbed in the polls since; Perry has not, and was again relegated to a pre-debate forum at next week's debate at the Reagan Library outside Los Angeles.\u00a0\nHe still delivered a stronger performance at that first debate than he did four years ago, when he couldn't remember the third federal agency he'd promised to close if elected and muttered, \"Oops\" -- a moment that doomed his bid in 2012. But few noticed in a GOP campaign dominated by billionaire Donald Trump, who stole away Perry's Iowa campaign chairman after Perry was forced to suspend paying members of his staff as his campaign fundraising dried up.\u00a0\nA group of super PACs, largely funded by three big Perry backers, briefly kept him afloat by raising $17 million, hiring their own Iowa staff and producing television and digital ads and mailers. His decision Friday appeared to come as a surprise to those groups.\u00a0\nA pro-Perry super PAC emailed its supporters Friday morning saying it was back on television in Iowa to promote his candidacy. A Twitter message from the group sent later in the morning further emphasized, \"In It For the Long Haul.\"\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "FIRST TO GO: Perry suspends '16 bid", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/11/perry-suspends-presidential-campaign/", "topics": ["personality", "women"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Carly Fiorina", "Rick Perry"], "orgs": ["Reagan Library", "PAC", "GOP", "PACs"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-09-11 22:51:22", "org": "fox", "article_id": "ec70b09b9579af06a28ae5acdf33bebb", "date_access": "2015-09-11 22:20:03.052501"}
