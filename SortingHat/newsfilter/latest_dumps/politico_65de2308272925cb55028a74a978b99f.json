His adviser says he fired Trump.  \nBy Marc Caputo\n8/8/15 2:40 PM EDT\nRoger Stone is a Republican operative who has worked for Reagan and Nixon. | Getty\nDonald Trump made the surprising announcement Saturday afternoon that he was firing his top adviser, Roger Stone, but hours before the political consultant\u2019s friends told POLITICO that he was actually quitting.\n\u201cSorry @realDonaldTrump didn\u2019t fire me- I fired Trump. Diasagree with diversion to food fight with @megynkelly away core issue messages,\u201d Stone, referencing Trump\u2019s battle with a moderator of Fox\u2019s Republican debate Thursday, said just before 3 p.m. on Twitter.\nStory Continued Below\nEarlier in the day, Stone\u2019s friends told POLITICO that he sent an email to Trump announcing his decision to leave the campaign. More than an hour later, Trump told a Washington Post reporter he fired Stone. The news coincidentally hit Twitter about 15 minutes after Stone told a Fox News TV show that he couldn\u2019t appear Saturday because he was no longer affiliated with the campaign, friends say.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe Roger got out-Trumped, that he got out-Stoned,\u201d one of Stone\u2019s friends said. \u201cRoger\u2019s mistake was trusting Donald and not establishing a clear record that he was resigning first.\u201d\nRegardless of who resigned or was fired first, the campaign shakeup was the first sign that Trump\u2019s election effort was seriously damaged from within after his Thursday night debate performance and his subsequent comments in which he attacked one of the Fox debate moderators, Megyn Kelly.\nHours before Stone was planning to quit, conservative Erick Erickson disinvited Trump from his RedState gathering on Saturday because of Trump\u2019s increasingly misogynistic attacks on Kelly.\nStone would not comment to POLITICO, but his friends shared a copy of the email he sent Trump in which he expressed gratitude concerning their longtime relationship, which dates back to the 1980s.\nAlso on POLITICO\nKATIE GLUECK\n\u201cI was proud to have played a role in the launch of your presidential campaign. Your message of \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 harkened back to the Reagan era. Restoring national pride and bringing jobs back to America - your initial and still underlying message - is a solid conservative message. In fact, it catapulted you instantly into a commanding lead in the race,\u201d Stone\u2019s email said.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the current controversies involving personalities and provocative media fights have reached such a high volume that it has distracted attention from your platform and overwhelmed your core message,\u201d Stone wrote. \u201cWith this current direction of the candidacy, I no longer can remain involved in your campaign.\u201d\nThough longtime friends, Stone and Trump have clashed before \u2013 in part because the two men share such similar combustible personalities. Both men are from New York; Stone lives in Fort Lauderdale now and Trump owns the Mar-a-Lago mansion to the north in Palm Beach. A longtime Republican operative, Stone became a libertarian. Trump has flirted with leaving the GOP as well.\nThe two clashed after Stone \u2013 known universally in political circles as a Nixon-era \u201cdirty trickster\u201d \u2013 helped bring down Trump friend and New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer in a prostitution scandal. But soon Stone and Trump were back and working together.\nStone\u2019s friends say internal troubles in the Trump campaign were roiling before Thursday\u2019s debate. Stone had increasingly felt that the campaign team surrounding Trump was feeding his bad habits: megalomania and peevishness. Stone wanted the campaign to focus on a message about taking on the political establishment and running government like a business.\nThen the debate happened, in which Kelly asked Trump about his comments calling women he didn\u2019t like \u201cfat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.\u201d\nTrump joked that he was referring to just one TV personality, \u201conly Rosie O\u2019Donnell.\u201d\nKelly continued and pointed out that Trump\u2019s \u201cTwitter account has several disparaging comments about women\u2019s looks. You once told a contestant on \u2018Celebrity Apprentice\u2019 it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees.\u201d\nTrump derided what he called the scourge of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and then said he wasn\u2019t always serious. \u201cAnd honestly Megyn, if you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me. But I wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\nTrump proceeded to do just that later in the evening, posting another\u2019s message on his Twitter account that called Kelly a \u201cbimbo.\u201d\nAlso on POLITICO\nBEN SCHRECKINGER\nThe next morning, Stone had to fight Trump\u2019s handlers to meet with him for 15 minutes, prompting the following exchange that both of Stone\u2019s friends tell POLITICO happened:\nStone: \u201cDonald, stop with the Megyn Kelly shit. It\u2019s fucking crazy. It\u2019s killing us.\u201d\nTrump: \u201cWhat do you mean? I won the debate. People loved it.\u201d\nStone: \u201cYou didn\u2019t win the debate.\u201d\nTrump: \u201cYes I did. Look at the polling. Look at Drudge.\u201d\nStone: \u201cThe Drudge Report poll isn\u2019t a scientific poll. You won\u2019t give me the money to pay for a scientific poll. And you\u2019re off-message.\u201d\nTrump: \u201cThere are other polls.\u201d\nStone: \u201cThose are bullshit polls, Donald. They\u2019re not scientific polls. We need to run a professional campaign and talk about what people really care about.\u201d\nTrump: \u201cWe\u2019re winning.\u201d\nAfter the meeting, Trump did the opposite of what Stone had recommended by going on CNN and trashing Kelly. \u201cYou could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her \u2014 wherever,\u201d Trump said, a comment perceived by many to be a reference to a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle. Trump\u2019s campaign later denied that interpretation, but by then Stone was consulting his friends about quitting.\n\u201cHe is losing his grip on reality,\u201d Stone told them. \u201cHe has these yes-men around him. And now he\u2019s living in a parallel world.\u201d\nThe following morning, Saturday, Trump was disinvited from the RedState gathering of conservatives in Georgia. Trump claimed he didn\u2019t mind being disinvited. About that time, on Saturday morning, Stone\u2019s friends confirmed to POLITICO that he was intending to leave the campaign.\nAlong the way, and soon after informing some at Fox, Trump allegedly trumped Stone.\n\u201cWell this is what happens when you deal with Donald Trump,\u201d one of Stone\u2019s friends said.\nBy ADAM WREN\nBy MICHAEL D'ANTONIO\nBy POLITICO MAGAZINE\nBy JONAH SHEPP\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "Trump says he fired his campaign adviser.
