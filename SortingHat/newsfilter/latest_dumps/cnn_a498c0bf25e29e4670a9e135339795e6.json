{"body": "Burlington, Vermont (CNN)Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders sets out to scale a political mountain on Tuesday as he formally jumps into a Democratic primary race dominated by runaway frontrunner Hillary Clinton.\nThe self-described \"Democratic socialist\" will launch a campaign critical of the power of Wall Street that will spotlight wide gaps between the wealthy and other Americans and vow to tackle global warming and college debt, at an evening rally in Burlington.\nHundreds of supporters are expected to join Sanders on the shore of Lake Champlain, at a rally that will feature free helpings of the local \"Ben and Jerry's\" ice cream, before he heads off to make a populist case to voters in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire.\nRELATED: Sanders says Clinton's wealth is 'a problem'\n\"I don't know if it's a winning strategy or not, but this is what I do know: The middle class of this country is disappearing despite the fact that people are working longer hours and they're earning lower wages,\" Sanders told CNN's \"Reliable Sources\" on Sunday.\n\"We have seen an explosion in technology and productivity and yet all of the increase in income and wealth is going to the top 1%. Do you think that that's an important issue to discuss?\"\nSanders, who trails Clinton in most polls by around 50%, is the longest of long-shot candidates as his politics sits well to the left of the mainstream of the Democratic Party, let alone most of the rest of American voters.\nBut despite that, polls show that assuming Vice President Joe Biden, and liberal favorite Elizabeth Warren don't take Clinton on, Sanders is now currently the best-placed Democrat to serve as an alternative to the former secretary of state.\nAnd even if he is not able to threaten Clinton's dominance, he can help shape the contours of the Democratic race for president and possibly pull Clinton away from the political center ground that she prefers to occupy.\nSince he confirmed on April 30 that he would launch a presidential run, Sanders, 73, has enjoyed a boost in the polls in the key early states.\nA Quinnipiac University polls in Iowa found that 15% of likely caucus goers would back him while 18% of likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire backed his campaign. Clinton however dominated the surveys, with 60% and 62% ratings in the two polls, respectively.\nRELATED: Clinton's super PAC fundraising irks progressives\nHowever, while he lags behind Clinton, Sanders, for now, is ahead of other possible Democratic long-shot candidates, including former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who is set to make an announcement on his intentions at the weekend and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb.\nThe polls reflect the fact that many Democrats privately believe that Clinton is the best chance they have to hang on to the White House, and the former secretary of state is an even more prohibitive frontrunner than before she lost to Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary race.\nBut there remain serious questions among many in the grass roots about her ties to Wall Street, and on whether, after decades at the pinnacle of politics, she truly identifies with the struggles of the everyday Americans that she is making painstaking efforts to court in the early stages of the White House race.\nClinton's 2002 Senate vote to authorize the Iraq war, a conflict Sanders opposed, and a perception that she is more hawkish on foreign policy than President Barack Obama, also troubles some Democrats.\nSo Sanders, a rumpled and sometimes grumpy figure, who prides his independence and who has spent decades questioning the power of corporate America and the morality of an economy he says skews towards the rich, may be in the right place at the right time.\nHe will also be targeting liberal Democrats who are pining for a run from another populist economic crusader Warren, who insists she is taking a pass on the race despite wildfire support among the party's grass roots.\nIn many ways, Sanders is an anti-politician. Despite serving as mayor of Burlington for four terms and winning seats in the House of Representatives and the Senate, he glorifies in being an outsider, and with his wild white hair and brusque manner lacks the polish of most Washington politicians -- and presidential candidates.\nAnd if he was ever going to run for president, 2016 is the year. The issue of economic inequality, which he has been hammering for decades, is suddenly at the center of presidential politics, given the reality that many Americans are yet to see the benefits of the recovery from the worst recession since the 1930s.\nSanders will be especially closely watched for the way he handles Clinton and could pose perhaps the most risk for the former first lady on the debate stage, where he can be a tenacious advocate for his policy positions.\nClinton will be mindful of the fact that the first signs of vulnerability in her 2008 Democratic primary campaign came when she tripped up in an exchange with another long-shot contender, then Sen. Christopher Dodd.\nOne area where Sanders could make things dicey for Clinton is over the vast Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade pact which is at the centerpiece of Obama's foreign policy. Sanders and many liberal Democrats oppose the deal because they believe it will accelerate the loss of U.S. jobs to low wage economies overseas. Clinton has yet to say whether she is for or against the proposed deal. \nWhile Sanders has said he will not shirk from taking on her policy positions, he's also vowing not to make it personal.\n\"Will I criticize Hillary Clinton on her position of TPP, or the lack of position?  Will I criticize her on her views of Wall Street?  Will I criticize her on foreign policy? That's what democracy is about,\" he told CNN. \"But taking cheap shots at people, making it personal, I don't think that's what politics should be about.\"\nAs well as challenging his opponents, Sanders often has sharp words for the media and frequently complains campaign journalists concentrate too much on the \"gossip\" or politics and the triviality of campaigns, rather than serious issues.\n", "byline": "", "description": "\n    \n", "title": "Bernie Sanders takes aim at Wall Street", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/26/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign-launch-vermont/index.html", "topics": ["economy", "trade"], "people": ["Christopher Dodd", "Martin O'Malley", "Joe Biden", "Hillary Clinton", "Barack Obama", "Jim Webb", "Elizabeth Warren", "Bernie Sanders"], "orgs": ["Senate", "Democratic Party", "PAC", "Quinnipiac University", "House of Representatives"], "authors": [{"author_id": 2324, "fullname": "stephen collinson", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-05-26 19:02:08", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "a498c0bf25e29e4670a9e135339795e6", "date_access": "2015-05-26 18:10:41.304803"}
