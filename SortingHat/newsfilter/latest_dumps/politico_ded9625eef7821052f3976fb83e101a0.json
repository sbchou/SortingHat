But Clinton's overall fundraising machine remains formidable: combined with the $47.5 million she raised in the second quarter, her campaign has brought in roughly $75 million in six months.\" Clinton's campaign has not yet released cash on hand numbers. http://politi.co/1N2APYb\n- \"Ben Carson fundraising accelerated to $20 million in third quarter,\" by The Wall Street Journal's Rebecca Ballhaus: Ben Carson's campaign raised more than $20 million in the third quarter, bringing his total for the year to $31 million. But he's been burning through the money - the campaign had only $12 million in cash on hand at the end of the quarter. Still, his team seems excited. \"The campaign on Wednesday celebrated the quarter with a chocolate cake, with 'tons of icing,' according to a spokeswoman, with the number $30 million drawn on top. That number had to be changed to $31 million halfway through the day as final contributions came in.\" http://on.wsj.com/1FH4l3o\nDays until the 2015 election: 33.

Sittenfeld, the Cincinnati city councilman running against former Gov. Ted Strickland in the Ohio Democratic primary for the chance to take on GOP Sen. Rob Portman, will release a new video on Thursday, his campaign said. The video attempts to tie Portman to Donald Trump by highlighting Portman's statement that he would support the GOP presidential nominee no matter who it is - even Trump, Sittenfeld says in the video.\n- Watch the video: http://bit.ly/1hcW8bc\nHOW THEY VOTED - Toomey, DeSantis vote against spending bill: It took the resignation of House Speaker John Boehner and went down to the final day of funding, but the House and Senate have both passed clean bills funding the government for the next 10 weeks. How did the senators up for reelection next year vote? Of the Senate Republicans thought to even be slightly vulnerable in 2016, three voted against the bill and can expect Democrat attacks for \"trying to shut down the government\": Sens. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, John Boozman of Arkansas and Rand Paul of Kentucky.\n- As for House members running for Senate, Rep. David Jolly (R-Fla.) voted for the bill, while Rep. Ron DeSantis, who's running against Jolly in the primary, voted against it. Rep. Marlin Stutzman (R-Ind.) and his more establishment-oriented rival in the Indiana GOP primary, Rep. Todd Young, both voted against the bill. Rep. Joe Heck (R-Nev.) voted in favor. Among potentially vulnerable House Republicans running for reelection, Reps. Rod Blum of Iowa and Frank Guinta of New Hampshire voted against the measure.\nPRESIDENTIAL SPEED READ \n- \"The cruelest month of the 2016 race,\" by POLITICO's Edward-Isaac Dovere: \"October is when the 2016 campaign gets real. Two debates are coming - one that will likely winnow the GOP field and one that could rearrange the Democratic race. A Benghazi hearing will either be a showcase or a feeding frenzy. And campaign fundraising reports are going to be making a lot of decisions for people, whether they like it or not. It's showtime for Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, who were supposed to be on glide paths by now. It's also put up or shut up time for Joe Biden - and if the answer is yes, the time to find out whether the public polls he's been solely relying on to gauge the race bear any relation to reality, or if the bottom will drop out as soon as he goes from potential to actual candidate.\" http://politi.co/1L5CF8u\n- \"Hillary Clinton camp is making moves to check Joe Biden,\" by The New York Times' Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman: \"Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign, increasingly worried about the threat of a challenge from Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., is making a sudden and urgent effort to throw roadblocks into his path. After months of voicing doubt about a challenge from the vice president, Clinton campaign operatives are viewing Mr. Biden's entry into the contest as a serious possibility and are trying to rally the party's apparatus and its donors to her side.\" http://nyti.ms/1JF4EGJ\n- \"Club for Growth warns fiscal conservatives about Kasich's 'mixed record,' by POLITICO's Daniel Strauss: \"A new white paper by the conservative group the Club for Growth concludes that Ohio Gov. John Kasich's economic record should make fiscal conservatives nervous. \"While there are pro-growth steps along the way in his political career, there are enough big government missteps to send a clear warning to fiscal conservatives,\" the paper concludes. The white paper , obtained by POLITICO, is not uniformly critical of the 2016 Republican presidential candidate, who has positioned himself as a budget hawk. But it concludes that Kasich has a 'mixed record on matters of economic liberty' - one that 'might have been even worse had a Republican Legislature not stopped some of his tax proposals.'\" http://politi.co/1jzX4IE\nCODA - QUOTE OF THE DAY: \"What's the expression? I'm the bacon in the breakfast experience, not the egg?\" - Jeb Bush made use of an odd breakfast metaphor on Wednesday. http://bit.ly/1QM4x1o\nTheodoric Meyer is a reporter for Campaign Pro.\nHe joined POLITICO after more than two years at ProPublica, where he covered campaign finance.
