Johnson had a hand in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy (he wrote a 2013 book on the conspiracy), that Chelsea Clinton is not Bill Clinton's biological daughter (\"I think we make a very strong case,\" he told Hannity), and that presidents Clinton and George H.W. Bush \"trafficked millions worth of cocaine\" through Mena, Arkansas, among other theories.\n\"I have hired personal security,\" Stone tweeted Oct. 7. In his interview with Hannity, he was more direct about the threat he perceived: \u201cIf in a couple of weeks they tell you I was depressed and I committed suicide, it\u2019s a lie.\"\nA selection of his recent tweets:\nTold you so - scholar says LBJ killed JFK http://t.co/lFzgRGvLrp pic.twitter.com/aNFXPJvphs\n\u2014 Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) October 14, 2015\nHUGE Scandal - Chelsea isn't Bill Clinton's Daughter? - The Political Insider http://t.co/LYEcsC4LQj\n\u2014 Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) October 13, 2015\n.@billclinton exposed as a serial rapist and @HillaryClinton his enabler - Oct 13 http://t.co/FzaSNmGPaH pic.twitter.com/tBCe1dEgU0\n\u2014 Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) October 12, 2015\n\n.@billclinton was tossed out of Oxford for raping a 19 year old http://t.co/LAe9oqCs0y pic.twitter.com/ZypV1uewTG\n\u2014 Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) October 12, 2015\nTrump's the One ! @realDonaldTrump #Trump2016 It's #YUGE pic.twitter.com/9WUKOzC8aT\n\u2014 Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) October 13, 2015\nThese two trafficked millions worth of cocaine thru Mena Arkansas it's detailed in http://t.co/8uGDxK7xyK pic.twitter.com/psYN2ipfPd\n\u2014 Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) October 11, 2015\nWebb Hubbell's daughter @ChelseaClinton before and after plastic surgery to conceal this truth pic.twitter.com/eHMyg79X1h\n\u2014 Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) October 9, 2015\nI have hired personal security- my book exposing the criminality of the Clintons out Oct 13- http://t.co/LAe9oqCs0y pic.twitter.com/VJFwXjVNyi\n\u2014 Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) October 7, 2015\nStone had previously advised Trump's campaign until early August, when the two parted ways amid disputed circumstances. But Stone, who has been a fierce supporter of Trump on Twitter and elsewhere in the media, said that his former boss probably hadn't read his book.\n\"Book has been out 24 hours so I doubt he has had time to read it \u2014 he is kinda busy being the FRONTRUNNER for president,\" Stone said in email to POLITICO. \"Donald and I have been friends for 30 years \u2014 he knows I am both meticulous in my research and relentless in expressing my point of view as well as being politically incorrect and fearless.\"\n\"I suspect Trump will like my next book, Jeb and the Bush Crime Family, even more,\" he added, referring to his upcoming work set for release on Jan. 19.\nNeither the Trump campaign nor the Clinton campaign responded to requests for comment.\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Trump embraces sensational anti-Clinton book by former aide Roger Stone", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/donald-trump-roger-stone-controversial-clinton-book-214790", "topics": ["personality", "trade", "immigration"], "people": ["Isaac Arnsdorf", "Burgess Everett", "Kyle Cheney", "Matt Latimer", "Anna Palmer", "Hadas Gold", "Chelsea Clinton", "Carla Marinucci", "Austin Wright", "Sean Hannity", "Richard Nixon", "Charles Schwab", "Brian Mahoney", "Isaac Dovere", "Theodoric Meyer", "Nahal Toosi", "Caitlin Emma", "Donald Trump", "Darius Tahir", "Victoria Guida", "Nick Gass", "Alex Isenstadt", "Jennifer Scholtes", "Bill Clinton", "Toby Eckert", "John F.
