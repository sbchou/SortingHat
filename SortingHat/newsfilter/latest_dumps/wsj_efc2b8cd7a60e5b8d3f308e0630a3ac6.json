{"body": "Think Tank asked contributors to share their views on the highlights and low points of Wednesday night\u2019s Republican debate. This post will be updated as more responses\u00c2\u00a0come in.\nAs far as I am concerned Carly Fiorina won the prime-time debate. Her ability to stick to her talking points while finding ways to advance her own positions was amazing. Unlike most politicians, she was incredibly disciplined. She may have a flawed business record, but she turned in a strong debate performance, weaving together views on Iran and abortion and speaking powerfully about her family\u2019s experience with drugs.\nFrom what I can tell, Donald Trump\u00c2\u00a0was on his best behavior. That is not to say it was good behavior\u2013but he did not engage in some of the incendiary anti-immigrant rhetoric that he has used in the past.\nThe loser has got to be Gov. Chris Christie. Sure, he used the word braggadocio\u2013which was awesome\u2013but as much as he tried to insert himself into the debate he failed. His tough-guy persona fell flat once again.\nJim Manley, director of the communications practice at QGA Public Affairs, is a former aide to Sens.\u00c2\u00a0Harry Reid\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0Edward Kennedy. He is on Twitter:\u00c2\u00a0@jamespmanley.\u00c2\n\nAll the candidates helped themselves Wednesday night except Donald Trump, John Kasich, and Mike Huckabee. Carly Fiorina was remarkable. She is a far different candidate this time than she was in the 2010 California Senate campaign and during her time as a McCain presidential campaign surrogate. Her team has clearly prepped her and armed her with useful facts that she is skillfully deploying.\nIn the end, Mr. Trump seemed spent. Mr. Kasich struggled to find a showcase moment. And Mr. Huckabee was fairly unmemorable.\nAmong those in middle: Jeb Bush made no mistakes (and after 2.5 hours seemed to\u00c2\u00a0be just warming up)\u00c2\u00a0and was tougher on Mr. Trump, though there is likely to be more clarification on his statement that Chief Justice John Roberts has made some \u201cgood decisions.\u201d Mr. Rubio was excellent on foreign policy, demonstrating that although he may have the worst Senate attendance record he has stayed on top of the Senate Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committee portfolios. Ted Cruz\u2013who seemed very proud that he can pronounce \u201cKhamenei\u201d\u2013has a disciplined style of speaking directly to the camera that is a bit reminiscent of an attorney advertising on local TV. Ben Carson\u2018s quiet performance was very good, but it did nothing to dispel the impression that the surgeon lacks governance and political knowledge. Scott Walker\u00c2\u00a0did well, but he didn\u2019t seem aggressive enough in injecting himself in the discussion. Rand Paul was best on the medical marijuana question, but I\u2019m not sure what that gets him in a GOP primary. Chris Christie fell flat in trying to own the strategy of refocusing the debate on the problems of typical Americans.\nJuleanna\u00c2\u00a0Glover is a corporate consultant and Republican policy and communications adviser who has served on the staffs of\u00c2\u00a0George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, John Ashcroft, and others. She has co-hosted fundraisers for former Florida governor\u00c2\u00a0Jeb Bush.\u00c2\u00a0She is on Twitter:\u00c2\u00a0@juleannaglover.\u00c2\nALSO IN THINK TANK:\nWant to Understand Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Strategy?
