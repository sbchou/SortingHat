{"body": "Getty\nBy Nick Gass\n7/1/15 10:58 AM EDT\nUpdated 7/1/15 11:54 AM EDT\nMacy\u2019s is dumping Trump, too. But according to Trump, he\u2019s dumping Macy\u2019s.\nThe retail chain announced Wednesday that it is pulling all Donald Trump-brand merchandise, weeks after the Republican presidential candidate referred to immigrants from Mexico and other countries as \u201ckillers and rapists.\u201d The candidate has continued to reiterate his remarks in recent days.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cWe are disappointed and distressed by recent remarks about immigrants from Mexico. We do not believe the disparaging characterizations portray an accurate picture of the many Mexicans, Mexican Americans and Latinos who have made so many valuable contributions to the success of our nation,\u201d Macy\u2019s said in a statement Wednesday, first reported by CNN.\n\u201cIn light of statements made by Donald Trump, which are inconsistent with Macy\u2019s values, we have decided to discontinue our business relationship with Mr. Trump and will phase-out the Trump menswear collection, which has been sold at Macy\u2019s since 2004.\u201d\nIn a separate statement, Trump said that it was his decision to end his business relationship with the company \u201cbecause of the pressure being put on them by outside sources.\u201d\n\u201cWhile selling Trump ties and shirts at Macy\u2019s is a small business in terms of dollar volume, my principles are far more important and therefore much more valuable,\u201d the billionaire candidate said, adding that he has \u201cnever been happy about the fact that the ties and shirts are made in China, and should I start a new product line in the future, I would insist that they are made in America.\u201d\nA MoveOn.org petition urging the Cincinnati-based company to get rid of Trump\u2019s products, and his association with the brand had drawn more than 700,000 signatures as of Wednesday morning.\nAlso on POLITICO\nSTEVEN SHEPARD\n\u201cMacy\u2019s: Donald Trump does not reflect \u2018the magic of Macy\u2019s,\u2019\u201d the petition reads, in reference to the store\u2019s slogan and its mission statement. \u201cWe urge you to sever ties with him. Macy\u2019s says it has a strong obligation to be \u2018socially responsible\u2019 and that \u2018actions speak louder than words.\u2019 Indeed. It\u2019s time to act.\u201d\nAngelo Carusone, the executive vice president of progressive media watchdog Media Matters for America, created the petition in 2012 and praised the decision on Wednesday.\n\u201cIn the last few days, Donald Trump has demonstrated what participants in the Dump Trump effort have been warning Macy\u2019s about for years \u2014 that Donald Trump\u2019s brand of bigoted bullying is simply bad for business,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAfter more than three years of allowing Donald Trump\u2019s toxic brand to turn off thousands of customers and damage their own reputation, Macy\u2019s has finally made the right decision to stop investing in and supporting Donald Trump. Onward!\u201d\nMacy\u2019s decision comes on the heels of separate announcements by NBCUniversal and Univision, which said its networks would not air the telecast of the annual Miss USA pageant, partially owned by Trump.\nNBC also announced that he would no longer appear on \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d\nAlso on POLITICO\nHADAS GOLD\n\u201cClearly, NBC and Macy\u2019s support illegal immigration, which is totally detrimental to the fabric of our once great country,\u201d Trump said in his statement.\nOn Tuesday, Trump announced that he was suing Univision for $500 million, alleging a breach of contract and defamation.\n\u201cNothing that I stated was different from what I have been saying for many years. I want strong borders, and I do not support or condone illegal immigration,\u201d he said in his statement, which he also posted to his Instagram account.\nA Univision spokeswoman called Trump\u2019s suit \u201cboth factually false and legally ridiculous.\u201d\nBy JONATHAN RAUCH\nBy MOHAMMAD ALI SHABANI\nBy MICHAEL SHERMER\nBy JOHN SIDES and  ERIC MCGHEE\n\u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "The retail chain announces that it is pulling all Donald Trump-brand merchandise.", "title": "Macy's dumps Trump", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/donald-trump-macys-pulling-merchandise-119633.html", "topics": ["mexico", "immigration"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Nick Gass", "Angelo Carusone"], "orgs": ["Univision", "NBCUniversal", "Macy", "HADAS GOLD"], "authors": [{"author_id": 30728, "fullname": "nick gass", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-07-01 15:58:19", "org": "politico", "article_id": "122933ba920a27135a3742cecc3d895e", "date_access": "2015-07-01 16:20:05.057996"}
