{"body": "WASHINGTON \u2014  For Senator Ted Cruz to call his party\u2019s leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, a liar as he did Friday and again Sunday in the Senate was an extraordinary personal attack, but given how much the conservative base of the Republican Party has come to loathe its leaders, it was also good politics for the struggling presidential candidate.\n\nWhile tensions between the ideological purists of the base and the pragmatists of the party establishment have simmered for decades, the breach has widened in recent years to nearly unbridgeable. Many Republicans now lament that the divide goes a long way to explain why their party lately has had so much trouble governing in Congress and picking a presidential nominee.\n\n\u201cWe are struggling to prove that we can be a governing party,\u201d said Vin Weber, a Republican strategist and former congressman.\n\nMr. Weber was saying much the same during the prolonged fight in Congress last winter, when conservatives threatened to shut down the Homeland Security Department unless President Obama reversed immigration orders shielding many illegal residents from deportation. Then, too, Mr. McConnell provoked conservatives\u2019 wrath by engineering Republicans\u2019 retreat to prevent a shutdown.\n\nThis time the issue that incited Mr. Cruz was Mr. McConnell\u2019s green light for a vote to reauthorize the long bipartisan Export-Import Bank, which conservatives want to eliminate as \u201ccorporate welfare.\u201d\n\nBut these intraparty battles could look trifling, Mr. Weber and other party leaders fear, compared to what the Republican-controlled Congress could face this fall: An escalation of infighting over essential bills to finance the government in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 and to increase the nation\u2019s debt limit. An impasse would risk a governmentwide shutdown or default, which based on past episodes could damage Republicans with the public.\n\nBut not with the conservative base, or with conservative news media and the conservative advocacy groups like those backed by the billionaire Koch brothers, who all demand confrontation. That is the audience that Mr. Cruz and other Republican senators running for president are playing to. Increasingly, so are rank-and-file Republican lawmakers without White House ambitions.\n\nTherein lies the governance problem for Mr. McConnell, the Senate majority leader from Kentucky, and House Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio.\n\nFor congressional Republicans, following the leader down a pragmatic path of compromise can get the followers in trouble back home, or worse, attract a more conservative opponent in the next primary election.\n\nConversely, attacking the leader wins points with the conservative base, as Mr. Cruz is counting on to catch up with Donald J. Trump, who has taken a lead in some polls by positioning himself as the most antiestablishment contender of all. Soon after attacking Mr. McConnell on Friday, Mr. Cruz dialed into the radio shows of the conservative celebrities Rush Limbaugh and Mark R. Levin. Mr. Limbaugh called the Cruz attack \u201cMr. Smith Goes to Washington-type stuff.\u201d Mr. Levin posted on Twitter, \u201cLet\u2019s see how many others in the Senate have a backbone & call out McConnell.\u201d\n\nThe roots of the current base-versus-establishment dynamic go back two decades, after Republicans broke Democrats\u2019 40-year lock on a House majority in 1994. The party\u2019s base had shifted to the more conservative and populist South from the Northeast and Midwest. Also, conservative media was popular and expanding: Its initial alliance with the Republican establishment was evident when party leaders, including Mr. Boehner, made Mr. Limbaugh an honorary House Republican for his role in helping make them a majority.\n\nLike Mr. Boehner, many in today\u2019s party establishment once were proud troublemakers for conservatism themselves \u2014 Mr. Weber was, along with Newt Gingrich, a leader among right-wing rebels in the House through the Ronald Reagan and George Bush administrations \u2014 and they remain conservative still by any nonpartisan measure. But governing often means compromising.\n\nBy the early 2000s, conservative voters grew increasingly antagonistic toward party leaders, and so did the conservative media that both reflects and drives opinion among its hard-line audience. With Republicans in control of both the White House and Congress for six years, many conservatives were disillusioned and angered by the George W. Bush era\u2019s legacy of deficits, mismanagement in Iraq and during Hurricane Katrina, recession, financial collapse and federal bailouts.\n\nThe election of Mr. Obama and a Democratic-controlled Congress for a time caused Republicans to unite in opposition, and Mr. Obama\u2019s policies, like the Affordable Care Act, gave rise to the Tea Party. Republicans won a House majority again in the 2010 midterm elections with an influx of Tea Party supporters.\n\nBut the rapprochement between party leaders and the base soon was strained by the realities of governance. Republican leaders were unable to fulfill their promises to stop Mr. Obama on health care, immigration and federal spending.\n\nBy last January, despite another successful midterm election in November that gave Republicans a Senate majority too, pent-up frustration led House hard-liners to try to oust Mr. Boehner \u2014 egged on by conservative voters, news media and activist groups.\n\nEven allies acknowledge that Republican leaders\u2019 repeated promises since 2010 on matters like Obamacare or immigration, while intended to reassure the base in the moment, only end up stoking its anger when the promises cannot be kept. The president, after all, has a veto.\n\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican leadership adviser and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said, \u201cI always felt that the major goal the day after the election last November should have been to lower expectations.\u201d Among conservatives, he said, \u201cThere was this sort of notion that somehow they were running Washington, which is nuts.\u201d\n\nBut spreading that notion is the conservative media, which has expanded in recent years, on air and online, to become many conservatives\u2019 sole source of news, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nMr. Levin, for example, drew sustained cheers at a conservative conference in February for a rant lambasting Republican leaders more than Mr. Obama. \u201cThe Republicans said that if we gave them the Senate along with the House, they\u2019ll do great things,\u201d he shouted. \u201cThey\u2019ve done nothing!\u201d\n\nSteve Deace, an Iowa-based syndicated radio host and columnist popular with conservatives, has his own lexicon for the Republican establishment: \u201cthe surrender caucus,\u201d \u201cgirly men\u201d or \u201clords of the realm.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is by any measure the most conservative Republican caucus in my lifetime,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, a member of the Republican leadership from Oklahoma. But for the conservative media and the conservative base, he said, \u201cThe idea of getting half of a loaf and moving down the road is just anathema to them.\u201d He added, \u201cThey\u2019re looking for fights to pick with, quote, establishment Republicans, unquote.\u201d\n\nWith 2016 approaching, so are a number of Republican presidential candidates beyond Mr. Cruz. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin recently tweeted this: \u201cOn the campaign trail for 28 hours with head not hitting the pillow, blasting GOP leadership for false promises.\u201d\n\nThe conservative radio host Laura Ingraham approvingly retweeted that, to her own 546,000 followers.", "byline": "JACKIE CALMES", "description": "A breach within the Republican Party widens, with some congressional leaders becoming the brunt of ideological and even personal attacks.", "title": "Political Memo: As the G.O.P.
