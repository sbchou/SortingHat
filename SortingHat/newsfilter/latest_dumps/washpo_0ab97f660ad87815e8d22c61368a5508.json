{"body": " As Jeb Bush was campaigning to be governor of Florida, real estate mogul Donald Trump sought a meeting with one of Bush\u2019s closest allies in the state legislature. Trump wanted to discuss his plan to loosen Florida\u2019s gambling restrictions so he could partner with an Indian tribe and open a casino in the state. He met twice with the lawmaker, then-soon-to-be state House Speaker John Thrasher, once for lunch at the 21 Club in New York and again at Trump\u2019s extravagant Palm Beach estate, Mar-a-Lago. And as Thrasher recalls, Trump was clear about his views on easing Florida law. The 1998 meetings have taken on new importance now, as Trump is running for president by presenting himself as a populist political outsider who is free from the influences of special interests that can sway typical politicians like Bush. In a memorable debate confrontation, Bush accused Trump of being a \u201cspecial interest\u201d who gave him money in the 1990s in hopes of legalizing casino gambling but failed to sway him, because, Bush said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be bought by anybody.\u201d Trump denied Bush\u2019s claim as \u201ctotally false.\u201d \u201cI promise,\u201d Trump said in the Wednesday night debate, \u201cif I wanted it, I would have gotten it.\u201d But documents and interviews show Trump did seek to open the door to casino gambling in Florida during Bush\u2019s time. Trump had donated to the state GOP, and, according to Thrasher and another former state official who held meetings on the issue on Bush\u2019s behalf, made his views known in the state capital. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that Trump was interested,\u201d said Thrasher, the former state House speaker who met with the mogul and is now backing Bush\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cThat was the subject of the meetings.\u201d Moreover, officials said, Trump has remained interested in expanding his casino business into Florida \u2014 hiring a Tallahassee lobbyist and meeting with lawmakers in recent years. During a January 2014 golf outing at a Trump course, the mogul pressed then-incoming state House Speaker Steve Crisafulli (R) on possible gambling expansions in Florida. Crisafulli said that Trump \u201chas spoken to me as recently as last year about several of his business ventures, including his interest in establishing a destination resort style casino in Florida.\u201d Trump, who has made his successful business negotiations central to his presidential campaign, has never won the legal right to build a casino in Florida.  [Inside the Trump-Bush melodrama: Decades of tension and discomfort]  Trump allies say his recollection of the casino issue in Florida was accurate. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, said the business \u201cnever asked Jeb Bush personally to approve casino gambling.\u201d Roger Stone, a Trump confidante and former campaign adviser, told Fox News this week that Trump has tried to get casino gambling under Bush\u2019s Democratic predecessor, Lawton Chiles, but his efforts \u201cceased\u201d with Bush\u2019s 1998 election, given Bush\u2019s \u201cwell known\u201d opposition to expanding gambling. Trump\u2019s Florida experience represents a wrinkle in the populist critique he is presenting to voters in his presidential campaign. Trump has said he knows most elected officials have been bought by donors \u2014 because he used to be the one doing the buying. But in Florida, Bush remained a steadfast opponent of expanded gambling. That outcome has given Bush, who has dropped in the polls amid withering attacks from Trump, a chance to try and turn the tables. And it highlights Trump\u2019s tendency to obscure his business failures as he portrays himself as a perpetual winner.  [Here\u2019s what Jeb Bush, underdog, looks like]  When Bush was running for governor in 1998, casinos with table games were illegal in Florida. Casinos were opposed by many politicians in both parties and by some business leaders, who saw gambling expansion as a threat to a state tourism industry that marketed itself around the world as family-friendly. But the Seminole Indian tribe was pushing to be allowed to open a new facility.  Bush\u2019s opposition, however, was stalwart \u2014 he had sat on the board of a group opposed to expanding gambling. In stepped Trump and his campaign support. In December 2007, Trump hosted a $500-a-head fundraiser for Bush at his Trump Tower apartment in New York. A few months later, he made a $50,000 donation to the Republican Party of Florida.  Democrats, including Bush\u2019s 1998 opponent, then-Lt. Gov. Kenneth H. \u201cBuddy\u201d MacKay, charged that Trump was attempting to buy a change of heart from Bush. Carol Licko, who served as Bush\u2019s general counsel for his first year in office, recalled attending as many as a dozen meetings with representatives from the Seminole Indians after Bush took office to discuss the tribe\u2019s interest in crafting a compact with the state of Florida that would allow casinos. At the time, she said she understood that Trump would be involved and said she recalled the developer had representatives at some of the meetings.  Bush remained firmly opposed, however, and the Seminole Indians did not ultimately win the right to run slots and some other Vegas-style games until the election of Bush\u2019s successor, Charlie Crist.  By that time, Trump was no longer involved in the proposal. One of Trump\u2019s partners later said he \u201cdeclined to pursue the opportunity\u201d after Bush failed to support it, according to a regulatory summary of a Florida lawsuit stemming from the plan.  Trump sued the partner, accusing him of fraudulently using his name after he had backed out, according to media reports. Trump\u2019s interest in a casino in Florida, however, has not faded. He hired a lobbyist to press for the idea again after he purchased the Doral Resort & Spa in Miami in 2012. For the past two years, Trump has backed bills in the Florida legislature that would allow the creation of \u201cdestination resorts,\u201d high-end casinos at a handful of luxury Miami hotels. \u201cHe believes in it. He thinks it makes sense. He thinks Vegas is taking advantage of Florida,\u201d said Brian Ballard, the Florida lobbyist Trump hired to work on the issue. Now, Ballard is a supporter of Bush. He attended Wednesday\u2019s debate and said he was \u201cstunned\u201d when the casino issue popped up. \u201cI felt like someone was going to ask me to testify,\u201d Ballard joked Ballard said Trump had not been \u201cobsessed with\u201d the issue. He said Trump had concluded in recent months that the legislature is unlikely to comply with his wishes given the opposition by businesses such as Disney. Ballard added that he doubted Trump supported Bush and the state GOP in the 1990s in order to curry favor on the issue, as Bush\u2019s opposition was widely known. \u201cIt was a bad investment, if anyone ever thought they'd donate to Jeb to try to expand gaming here,\u201d Ballard said.
