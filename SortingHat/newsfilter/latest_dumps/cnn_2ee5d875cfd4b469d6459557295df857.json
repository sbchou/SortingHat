The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n (CNN)Both Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush tried this week to show America their fun, human sides. And both pretty much failed.\nThey were valiant attempts. Bush appeared Tuesday in a highly coveted guest slot on Stephen Colbert's premiere as host of \"The Late Show.\" And Clinton was a guest during the premiere week of the new season of \"Ellen.\" (The segment, taped Tuesday, will air Thursday.) \nThere were some moments of levity, to be sure: In an online-extra clip, Colbert made Bush read a more Trump-like answer in a mock prep for the next GOP debate, and a 5-year-old presidential trivia buff quizzed Clinton on \"Ellen.\" But I use \"levity\" here in relative terms -- levity in the same way that, say, balloons add levity to a giant, dull, gray, heavy rock.  \nClinton and Bush are both slipping in the polls -- their sense of electoral inevitability thrown off track by more unpredictable -- and thus more real-seeming -- candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. Part of the appeal of Trump and Sanders may be ideological -- Sanders appealing to progressives and Trump to far-right reactionaries -- but much of their success speaks less to what they are than what Bush and Clinton aren't. Electorally speaking, Clinton and Bush aren't stuck between a rock and a hard place. They are that rock.  \nPersonal charm and charisma have always been factors in modern politics, especially since the rise of television; the candidate-as-rock-star dynamic that arguably began with Ronald Reagan hit warp speed with Barack Obama. It's now almost expected that viable candidates deliver it: Supporters are no longer just voters but fans, even groupies. With branded T-shirts to match.\nWhere does this leave Clinton and Bush? Well, they have the money, the political machines and even the merchandise. They just don't seem to have the personal pizazz.\nThe Clinton campaign acknowledged as much recently in interviews with The New York Times suggesting that the candidate would, suddenly, seek to show more heart and humor. In a tweet, progressive blogger Zaid Jilani wondered, \"Do they just recalibrate her, like a robot? What if the servers go down, does she at least have offline mode?\"  \nThe appearances of Bush and Clinton on \"The Late Show\" and \"Ellen\" did indeed have that feel: \"Now we're in funny mode, but let's not look like we're trying.\" Bush, leaning casually on one arm, poked fun at his \"Jeb!\" logo, saying the exclamation point \"connotes excitement.\" And after critiquing his brother's fiscal performance as president, he joked to Colbert's brother -- a conservative voter, in the audience -- \"I want your vote.\"\nFor her part, Clinton responded to critiques that she'd be one of the oldest presidents elected by saying she prefers to think about how she'd be \"the youngest woman ever elected president of the United States.\" And about Kanye West's pledge to run for president in 2020, Clinton quipped, \"If I'm running for re-election, wait!\" \nBut that was about it. No question, Clinton's interview was more softball than Bush's -- Ellen DeGeneres said at one point, \"You are the smartest, most qualified person for this job\" -- but even under such overall amiable conditions, neither candidate managed to show his or her soft side. Generally, the appearances were as awkward as, say, watching Clinton dance with Amy Schumer and Pink. (Reader, it happened.) \nShould how loose and personable -- relatable -- you are matter in elections? Obviously smarts and qualifications are non-negotiable essentials, but we're all human, and we naturally want to vote for candidates we think would have our own best interests at heart. And, in part, likability is a proxy for the sense that a candidate \"gets it\" -- gets us.  \nEither way, that horse has left the gate -- politics and celebrity and the cult of personality (see Trump) are increasingly and inextricably intertwined. We may hope that the 2016 election will be about immigration reform and economic inequality and foreign policy and jobs and a host of other vitally important issues.  But it will also be about \"Ellen\" and Colbert -- and whether the celebrity culture has finally, completely subsumed politics. In the face of that, can old-school, issue candidates survive?\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.\n", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush try to show their human sides", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/09/opinions/kohn-hillary-jeb-on-tv/index.html", "topics": ["immigration", "economy", "personality"], "people": ["Amy Schumer", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton", "Donald Trump", "Barack Obama", "Sally Kohn", "Stephen Colbert", "Bernie Sanders", "Ronald Reagan"], "orgs": ["GOP"], "authors": [{"author_id": 12262, "fullname": "sally kohn political commentator", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-09-09 19:27:29", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "2ee5d875cfd4b469d6459557295df857", "date_access": "2015-09-09 18:41:14.351311"}
