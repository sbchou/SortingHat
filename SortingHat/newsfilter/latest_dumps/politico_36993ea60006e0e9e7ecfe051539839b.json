The bill's backers, both on Capitol Hill and in the oil industry, are eyeing as many as 30 Democratic votes for the proposal despite the turnaround of one key minority-party vote, Rep. Gene Green (D-Texas). \nStory Continued Below\nA frequent ally of oil thanks to his ties to refiners, Green voted for the bill in committee but plans to oppose it on the floor after talks derailed over bolstering its protections for domestic processors of crude. The bill's low-water mark for bipartisan support lies around 16, its number of Democratic co-sponsors, and a last-minute push by environmental groups coupled with a White House veto threat could keep its numbers lower than supporters hope. \nFractured Freedom Caucus? One amendment to watch during the exports debate is Rep. Justin Amash's bid to strike language added on the bill's way to the floor that boosts Maritime Security Program payments in an effort to win extra Democratic votes. Heritage Action for America slammed the addition as an earmark, raising the prospect of fraying conservative support, but exports backers cheered when Rep. Jim Bridenstine \u2014 like Amash, a member of the influential House Freedom Caucus \u2014 blogged in favor of the new language.\nWhat happens next? No matter how the House vote shakes out, the exports bill continues to face strong headwinds in the Senate. Check out Elana Schor's dispatch from earlier this week on the long-term state of play for overseas oil trade. \nFRIDAY I'M IN LOVE: I'm your host Eric Wolff, and hey, the week didn't turn out too wonky after all! Thanks Rep. McCarthy! But if you've got some wonkiness to share, feel free to send it my way at ewolff@politico.com, or follow us on Twitter @ericwolff, @Morning_Energy, and @POLITICOPro. \nCBO: CAPITO BILL WOULD NOT STOP EPA FROM REGULATING POWER PLANTS: Sen. Shelley Moore Capito's ARENA Act throws out a bushel of EPA rules and adds a host of new requirements on EPA if it attempts to regulate carbon from power plants new and old. But the Congressional Budget Office said yesterday it doesn't believe the agency would be deterred from proposing a new carbon rule for power plants consistent with those requirements: \"The bill would not prohibit EPA from continuing to work on activities related to power plants, such as developing guidance and providing technical assistance to states. Based on information from EPA, CBO estimates that implementing this legislation would not have a significant effect on EPA\u2019s workload or spending related to power plant emissions.\" \nOOPS, THEY DID IT AGAIN: Just two months after EPA accidentally spilled 3 million gallons of wastewater into Colorado\u2019s Animas River, the agency is behind another \u2014 significantly smaller \u2014 spill. Workers at the Standard Mine, which produced silver until the 1970s, were drilling a tunnel to bypass a collapsed part of the mine when about 2,000 gallons of wastewater spilled from a pond. The wastewater likely made its way into Coal Creek, but the mayor of nearby Crested Butte said yesterday that the town's water supply was not affected. Standard Mine was one of the sites where remediation work was halted by EPA for a few weeks following the Gold King spill, but work resumed last month after officials said they had ensured an emergency response plan was in place. More from the Denver Post: http://dpo.st/1RwzHLp\nEPA learns from its mistakes: \"EPA immediately notified the Town of Crested Butte water treatment plant and called the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment spill hotline,\" Liz Purchia, EPA's top spokeswoman, told ME. \"Based on the neutral pH levels, the quantity of water released, and flow levels downstream in Coal Creek, the Town of Crested Butte did not close its water intakes. Subsequent investigation found no visible plume or signs of significant impacts in downstream locations.\"\nINTERIOR DIVES INTO ANIMAS SPILL: Pro's Alex Guill\u00e9n has the story: \"The Interior Department will conduct a wide-ranging technical review of the Animas River spill accidentally caused by EPA workers in August at the Gold King mine in Colorado, according to a Superfund work form ...The Aug. 20 document for the first time outlines how Interior's Bureau of Reclamation will conduct its review, for which $125,000 has been allocated. The review is focused on technical matters rather than legal issues like potential negligence.\"\nTHE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE WORKS FOR TIME-SHARE TOO? For years, high government officials stayed at the Brinkerhoff Lodge in Grand Teton National Park for free, or at a steep discount. The lodge is only open to federal employees on an official visit. But according to an Interior IG report released yesterday, Park staff created a one-hour briefing just to meet this requirement. Vice President Joe Biden and other Obama administration officials took the parks up on this amazing offer! Your host has the details. (In case you missed the South Park reference: http://on.cc.com/1DG5KSe)\nIT'S SCIENCE: EPA's top air official, Janet McCabe, has once again taken to the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal with a letter defending a regulation \u2014 this time the ozone standard. \"You blindly ignore science, the law and history,\" she writes of the Journal's own editorial slamming the new standard. \"Science tells us that too many people are still exposed to too much ground-level ozone and that it makes people sick, puts them in the hospital and shortens their lives, so the law requires an ozone standard to better protect all of us, but especially children, who are particularly at risk.\" \nDON'T CRY FOR ME, GOP CONGRESS: When ME boarded his trusty Morning Bicycle yesterday to commute to the newsroom, Kevin McCarthy was a freight train with one destination: Speaker of the House of Representatives. About a half hour later, as ME locked up the MB in the garage below POLITICO'S gleaming headquarters, Republicans were weeping in the cloakroom over McCarthy's decision to bail out. As POLITICO readers know, Republicans floated many names to take the job (at one point in the day Pro's Elana Schor told her colleagues that if called, she would serve). By sundown, all eyes turned to a reluctant Rep. Paul Ryan, as GOP leaders pled with him to take the job. POLITICO's Jake Sherman, John Bresnahan, Anna Palmer, and have the story, and stay with The Gavel for regular updates on leadership races. \nENERGY BILL FOR TRIBES PASSES: The House of Representatives defied a presidential veto threat and passed the Native American Energy Act yesterday. The bill would make it easier for tribes to lease their land for energy production, whether mining, drilling, or wind farms. \nENVIROS STILL TRYING TO INFLUENCE DEBATES: Last month Tom Steyer, the billionaire climate activist, called on Anderson Cooper, moderator for the first Democratic debate next week, to grill the candidates on their positions on climate change. CNN, which is hosting the debate, will be taking questions from Facebook. The League of Conservation Voters will reach out to its members today to find the perfect question. It will post the question to Facebook, and then mobilize its membership to \"like\" the question to the top of the list.\nNOW AVAILABLE: POLITICO PRO LEGISLATIVE COMPASS \u2014 POLITICO Pro, POLITICO\u2019s premium subscription service, has released a first-of-its kind legislative data analytics and decision-making tool that helps policy professionals manage and act on legislation.
