Reid\u2019s most notable act as majority leader was to torch the longstanding Senate rule requiring a 60-vote threshold for presidential nominations. And even in the minority, Reid has dutifully protected the president from having to veto legislation by engaging in extraordinary measures. But most of all, Reid has been on message for Obama. The most notable example was Reid\u2019s baseless claim that Mitt Romney paid no taxes. Reid, who has made a career out of his rapport with the rich and powerful, has gleefully hammered at the same \u201cmillionaires and billionaires\u201d that have been the economic boogeymen of the Obama era. But now the men have something else in common other than a Koch habit: They are both lame ducks.\n\n[Reid\u2019s announcement comes on the heels of an inspector general\u2019s report that ripped a powerful Homeland Security official for helping powerful Democrats, including Reid\u2019s patrons.]\n\nFreedom\u2019s just another word\u2026 - How long Reid can hold power in the wake of his announced retirement is an open question. Does he even mean to stay on? Perhaps Reid has cut a deal with his most likely successor, Hillary Clinton\u2019s chief Senate ally Chuck Schumer of New York for an orderly transition at a later date. Whatever the case, it\u2019s hard to imagine that Reid would make this move at this moment with no plan in place. If Reid is, like Obama, still in a position of authority but beyond the reach of voters, things could get interesting. Provided Reid has the help of Obama and the support of those Senate Democrats who still stand stalwart for the president, the president and the Senate Democratic leader could be quite the lame duck duo.\n\nBattle Royale - The alternative to a \u201cThelma and Louise\u201d ending for Obama and Reid is pretty interesting in its own right. If Reid steps aside soon and leaves a vacuum, the fight between Schumer and other members of Team Hillary against liberals cranky about the direction of their party in the Clinton restoration would be quite telling about the depth of the divisions within the party.\n\nPOLL: HILLARY SEES BIG DROP IN FAVORABILITY\nOn the eve of Hillary Clinton\u2019s anticipated bid for the White House, a new poll finds a double-digit drop in the number of Americans who view her favorably. CBS News: \u201c[Clinton\u2019s] favorable views are 12 points lower than they were in the fall of 2013, just months after leaving her position as secretary of state\u2026When asked to evaluate Hillary Clinton on some key characteristics, the public gives Clinton her most negative marks on honesty. Fewer than half - 42 percent- say she is honest and trustworthy, while more - 47 percent \u2013 don\u2019t think she is\u2026. More than six in 10 Americans do not think it was appropriate for Hillary Clinton to use a personal email address and server for work-related matters as secretary of state\u2026. Members of Clinton\u2019s own party - 65 percent - say her motivations for using a private email were about convenience, but 62 percent of Republicans think Clinton was trying to keep information from becoming public.\u201d\n\nPower Play:\u00a0Sticky situation - Against a scandal-plagued backdrop, Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton is soon to launch her 2016 presidential campaign.\u00a0Will her troubles become footnotes or will Republicans or a potential Democratic rival make them stick? The Washington Post\u2019s Aaron Blake and The Weekly Standard\u2019s Daniel Halper join Chris Stirewalt to offer their take.\u00a0 WATCH HERE\n\nSENATE VOTES 100 TO 0 FOR IRAN SANCTIONS\nReuters: \u201cThe U.S. Senate voted unanimously on Thursday for a non-binding amendment to a budget bill intended to make it easier to reimpose sanctions if\u00a0Iran\u00a0violates a nuclear deal. The vote was 100-0 for the amendment, sponsored by Republican Senator Mark Kirk, which would establish a fund to cover the cost of imposing sanctions if Tehran violated terms of an interim nuclear agreement now in effect, or the final agreement negotiators hope to reach before July. The Senate spent Thursday voting on dozens of amendments to a budget resolution. The votes are non-binding because the legislation will not become law, but many senators introduce amendments to send political messages.\u201d\n\n[Fox News: \u201cThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee asked the Obama administration Thursday to turn over all reports and documents, including intelligence information, related to last year\u2019s exchange of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl for five members of the Taliban.]\n\nObama opposes Pentagon hike without domestic spending bump - WashEx: \u201cDefense Secretary Ashton Carter said Thursday that President Obama will oppose Republican budget plans to increase the Pentagon\u2019s funding while maintaining steep cuts for other federal agencies. \u2018The current proposal to shoehorn [the Defense Department\u2019s] base budget into our contingency accounts would fail to solve the problem while also undermining basic principles of accountability and responsible long term planning,\u2019 Carter said at a speech at the State Department.\u201d\n\nSenate approves budget, delays \u2018doc fix\u2019 - Roll Call: \u201cThe Senate adopted the GOP\u2019s budget blueprint on a 52-46 vote following an epic vote-a-rama that featured dozens of test votes on everything from carbon taxes to Social Security benefits for same-sex marriages. Two Republicans eyeing the White House voted no: Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, but otherwise the vote was party line\u2026 With the budget resolution passing well after 3 a.m., the senators put off working on the House-passed \u2018doc fix\u2019 bill. That sweeping Medicare measure will be considered after the two-week break, [Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, and he expects it to pass with the Senate with overwhelming support.\u201d\n\n[While the Senate passed the Republican budget plan, the tricky part is in the House and Senate reconciling the two resolutions through some politically tricky items. WashEx breaks it down.]\n\nBoehner rebuts Obama\u2019s Cleveland claims - House Speaker John Boehner offers an op-ed in the Cleveland Plain Dealer in response to a recent speech by President Obama in that city: \u201cIf we\u2019re going to truly bring about the growth America needs, Washington can\u2019t just slap a new slogan on the same old approach\u2026In stark contrast to the president's budget, which never, ever balances, House Republicans passed a pro-growth balanced budget this week. It addresses the government's spending problem head-on, and paves the way for job creation, a simpler and fairer tax code -- and it protects critical programs like Medicare and Social Security.\u201d\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026\nFor nearly 30 years, Maryland resident Brian Flam has made his pursuit collecting autographs from Minor League baseball players. Flam has traveled up and down the Eastern Seaboard to amass nearly 150,000 signed cards from Minor League baseball players, along with signed memorabilia from Hall-of-Famers. Flam is considered a master in the craft of autograph seeking, also known as graphing. Vice Sport\u2019s John Stillman examines the paradox \u201cgraphers\u201d like Flam face, being a \u201cpure collector\u201d as opposed to online \u201cdealers,\u201d that merely accumulate signatures and seek to turn a profit. While the Internet has offered an \u201cinformation explosion,\u201d purists argue it is no substitute for the good ole days of \u201ckids at the ballpark holding balls through the fence.\u201d Now young fans, the pure collectors argue, are standing shoulder-to-shoulder with dealers.\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT? Email FoxNewsFirst@FOXNEWS.COM\n\nPOLL CHECK\nReal Clear Politics Averages\nObama Job Approval: Approve \u2013\u00a045.3 percent//Disapprove \u2013 50.9 percent\nDirection of Country: Right Direction \u2013 30.4 percent//Wrong Track \u2013 60.4 percent\n\nBORDER CONTROL: WALKER TRIES TO GET FOOTING ON IMMIGRATION\nThe WSJ story splurped onto the Internet looking just like the kind of item that could end a presidential campaign. Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., had flip-flopped again (de-flopped?) on immigration while talking to potential supporters at a closed-door meeting in New Hampshire. Deceit! Betrayal!\u00a0 Except that it apparently didn\u2019t happen. According to the host of the event and others who spoke to the NYT, what Walker said in private is what he said in public.\n\nWalker, like fellow contender, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., before him, recanted his support for a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d immigration overhaul. And like Rubio and other supporters, blames faithlessness by President Obama for the switch. Walker executed his reversal at the start of the month, prompting detractors to accuse him of Romneysian inconstancy. If Walker were caught touting the insincerity of his conversion among elites in private, it would likely be the beginning of the end of his campaign. And coming in the newspaper of record for the Republican Party would be a double death blow. It may have been baloney, but it highlights Walker\u2019s vulnerability on the most explosive issue in the GOP.\n\nWalker says he favors border security and immigration controls first, but opposes mass deportations of illegal immigrants. He also says he no longer favors fast-track qualifications for citizenship that were part of the original legislation. The Journal\u2019s heat depended on redefining the word \u201camnesty\u201d to be \u201ca phrase widely employed by people who believe immigrants who broke the law by entering the country without permission shouldn\u2019t be awarded legal status or citizenship.\u201d Amnesty, as Brit Hume has been telling us for months, is \u201ca general pardon for offenses, especially political offenses, against a government, often granted before any trial or conviction.\u201d For example, the courts are currently blocking Obama\u2019s effort to grant an indefinite amnesty to as many as five million illegal immigrants by executive decree. That\u2019s an amnesty, albeit one potentially subject to rescission. If amnesty is redefined to mean anything other than deportation, then most Republicans would be guilty of supporting \u201camnesty\u201d in the eyes of the Journal.\n\nAnd so we see Walker\u2019s problem: Without a specific plan of his own or a consensus position to embrace or oppose, he is subject to the kind of semantic game the Journal reporter played, let alone the handiwork of his fellow conservative candidates covetous of the top slot in race to be the alternative to Jeb Bush. It is serendipitous then for Walker to be in Texas today getting a tour of the Texas-Mexico border from Gov. Greg Abbott. Abbott, recently elevated to conservative hero status by his electoral carpet bombing of liberal icon Wendy Davis, can be Walker\u2019s best guide not just on the terrain, but the issue. If he embraces Abbott\u2019s position, not only will Walker be taking the advice of a fellow governor, but also one who is unassailable in the GOP (and who also happens to be the governor for two other contenders).\n\nWalker taps Talent as top foreign policy hand - KTRS: \u201cFormer Senator Jim Talent has his eyes set on 2016. Not as a candidate, but as Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker\u2019s senior policy adviser. Walker, a Republican, is expected to make his candidacy for president official later this year. Talent, a former member of both the U.S. House and Senate from Missouri, will serve as Walker\u2019s top adviser on both foreign policy and defense. Talent had been courted by several other major GOP contenders for a similar position following his policy role on former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign. \u2018I\u2019m pleased to be advising Governor Walker\u2019s Our American Revival committee. He is a strong conservative, a proven leader and a proven winner,\u2019 Talent said in a statement. \u2018I support his ideas and agenda and have been especially impressed with his interest and foundational understanding of defense and foreign policy issues.\u2019\u201d\n\nPOWER PLAY: SIXTEENERS, START YOUR ENGINES\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has turned the key on an official 2016 White House bid. The questions for the rest of the GOP contenders: How much time is left? How much room is left, and for whom? Aaron Blake of the Washington Post and The Weekly Standard\u2019s Daniel Halper join Chris Stirewalt to mull over the possibilities. WATCH HERE.\n\nJeb\u2019s faithful - National Journal introduces us to some of the politicos charged with Jeb Bush\u2019s sales pitch to faithful Christians, the key bloc if the former Florida governor is to keep conservative Republicans from uniting against him: \u201cIn this endeavor, his old friend Jim Towey will be a key asset. When Bush first ran for governor in 1994, Towey was on the other side, serving as [Gov. Lawton Chiles\u2019s] director of Florida\u2019s Health and Human Services agency. The loss that sparked Bush\u2019s conversion led to an after-election lunch with Towey, a relative stranger but also a high-profile Catholic whose brain Bush was eager to pick. The two quickly became the closest of friends, and that friendship, in turn, led to Towey\u2019s appointment as the second director of George W. Bush\u2019s faith-based initiatives. Towey is now president of Miami\u2019s Ave Maria University, one of the nation's foremost incubators of conservative Catholic doctrine, while serving unofficially as Bush's point man for religious outreach.\u201d\n\n[NYT reports on how Bush\u2019s educational foundation is proselytizing for the controversial curricula: \u201c\u2026the education foundation he started is going further, offering classes to policy-makers in how to communicate about standards, including referring people to materials that support the Common Core\u2026\u201d\u2019]\n\nCruz tries his pitch in New Hampshire - Sen.

Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), have introduced legislation that would undo gun laws in the District of Columbia, some of the strictest in the nation. If embraced by Republican leaders of the House and Senate, the legislation could force a Second Amendment showdown with President Obama by pushing the needle on gun control far to the right on the streets of the nation\u2019s capital, just two years after the president failed in his attempt to win stricter gun-control laws nationwide.\u201d\n\nBracket busting with Dr. K - The Sage of Studio One, Dr. Charles Krauthammer, explains why he feels the odds are in Rubio\u2019s favor if he decides to mount a White House bid.\n\nKasich turns off supply-siders - National Review: \u201cDining with a group of influential pro-growth conservatives at the Four Seasons restaurant in Manhattan on Wednesday \u2013 economists Larry Kudlow, Arthur Laffer, and Stephen Moore were in attendance \u2013 [Ohio Gov.

Kasich\u00a0answered in the affirmative.\u00a0\u2018Obamacare\u2019s\u00a0a bad idea because it\u2019s top-down and does not control costs,\u2019 Kasich said.
