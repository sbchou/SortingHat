{"body": "POLITICO\nAn early filing of the day's tax news\nBy Brian Faler\n8/25/15 9:59 AM EDT\nWith assistance from Adam Sneed\nNRA SUES SEATTLE OVER GUN VIOLENCE TAX: The influential gun rights advocacy group filed suit Monday to throw out Seattle\u2019s new tax on guns and ammunition. \u201cAnti-gun activists in Seattle have chosen to violate the Washington state Constitution and trample upon the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens,\u201d said Chris Cox, head of the group\u2019s lobbying arm.\nStory Continued Below\nTim Burgess, the president of the Seattle City Council, called the lawsuit unsurprising. \u201cWe were pretty certain we probably would be sued,\u201d he told POLITICO. The NRA is arguing the tax, which is partially aimed at compensating the city for costs associated with gun violence, violates Washington\u2019s so-called preemption laws that bar city and county officials from approving gun restrictions that aren\u2019t sanctioned by the state government.\nBurgess scoffed. He argues the ordinance is primarily a tax measure \u2014 not a firearms one \u2014 and that local officials are free to impose taxes. \u201cWe don\u2019t view this as a gun regulation measure,\u201d Burgess said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tax.\u201d\n\u201cThe issue for the court is going to be does the firearm regulation preemption statute extend to our taxing authority, and does it preempt our tax authority as well?\u201d he said. \u201cThe city will argue that it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nHOUSE REPUBLICANS MULL \u2018CADILLAC TAX\u2019 REPEAL: The Hill reports, \u201cRep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), chairman of the Ways and Means Committee's Health Subcommittee, said he expects a comprehensive bill repealing health care taxes to be ready sometime after lawmakers return from recess. \u2018We\u2019re going to continue to focus on Obamacare implementation, but we're also looking at a number of the tax provisions that need to be repealed,\u2019 Brady said in an interview on Monday.\u00a0While it\u2019s too early to say what will be included, Brady said members are gauging support for various provisions \u2014 including the repeal of the controversial \u2018Cadillac\u2019 tax on high-cost health plans. ... When asked about several possibilities, including the Cadillac tax, Brady said: \u2018I think all those are in the mix.\u2019 He added that the final decisions will ultimately come from the full committee and its chairman, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).\u201d http://bit.ly/1MPA1FD\nAbout half of the House has signed on as co-sponsors to one of two House bills proposing to rescind the 40 percent tax on pricey health care benefits. The main obstacle to repealing the hugely unpopular tax is the Obama administration,\u00a0which believes, like most economists, that the Cadillac tax is needed to help slow the growth in health care costs. Axing the tax would also blow a $90 billion hole in the budget.\nA REMINDER WHY THE CADILLAC TAX IS SO UNPOPULAR: The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation is out this morning with a report warning that 26 percent of employers offering health benefits could be hit by the tax in 2018, with the figure climbing steadily higher in subsequent years. The report tracks projections from others who see the tax taking an ever-larger bite, mostly because it applies to a broad swath of benefits and because it\u2019s pegged to a relatively slow measure of inflation. Kaiser says large companies with 200 or more workers will be hit especially hard, as will those with flexible spending accounts.

The survey will revise the agency\u2019s tax, spending and deficit projections for the next decade.\n2016 ROUNDUP \u2014 \nTRUMP\u2019S QUALMS WITH THE FLAT TAX: One day after complaining hedge fund managers were \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d when it comes to paying taxes, Donald Trump said he\u2019s not sure about the flat tax. While rivals such as Rand Paul, Mike Huckabee and Ben Carson have embraced the tax, which is always popular with the Republican base, Trump said he\u2019s concerned it would leave the rich paying too little. \u201cOne problem I have with a flat tax is that rich people are paying the same as people that are making very little money,\u201d he told \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cI think there should be a graduation of some kind, because as you make a certain amount of money, I think you should have to graduate upward.\u201d\nFACT-CHECKING KASICH:\u00a0Republican presidential candidate John Kasich says he\u2019s cut taxes by $5 billion, and The Washington Post says that figure \u201clargely checks out,\u201d though it\u2019s not sure about his claim to have passed the most tax cuts of any sitting governor. The Post agrees his tax cuts put him in the top five states but says \u201ccomparing tax cuts across states accurately is difficult and not always an accurate comparison, because states have varying budget cycles and types of tax revenue.\u201d What\u2019s more, \u201cit also is important to give context to the amount of tax revenue cut in a state, by comparing it to the share of the economy.\u201d\u00a0See here: http://wapo.st/1MIQ5HR\nINTERNATIONAL \u2014 \nPROFILING CORPORATE TAX CHEATERS? Are companies owned by people from foreign countries with high rates of corruption more likely to cheat Uncle Sam? NPR takes a look at research by a Middle Tennessee State University professor who sees a link. \"'What we find is that foreign-controlled corporations with owners from more corrupt countries evade more U.S. tax as measured by the IRS,\u2019 Jason DeBacker told NPR. \u2018So you get this strong relationship between corruption in the home country of those foreign controllers and the evasion in the U.S.\u2019\u201d See the story here: http://n.pr/1fBUpvg\nTAX ADMINISTRATION \u2014 \nHERE COME THE LAWSUITS: Our Toby Eckert reports: \u201cTwo Texas women have filed a lawsuit against the IRS, and are seeking class action status, for a data breach that exposed\u00a0hundreds of thousands of taxpayers to potential fraud.\u00a0Becky Welborn of Dripping Springs, Texas, and Wendy Windrich of Conroe, Texas, allege they were victimized by the data breach and that the IRS \u2018deliberately and intentionally decided not to implement the security measures needed to prevent the subject data breach.\u2019 Both women claim they are now at risk of further fraud because their information was stolen and that they will have to take costly and time-consuming steps to protect themselves.\u201d http://politico.pro/1JgMONp\nTHE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PART OF THE PROBLEM? \u201cThe chairman and ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee asked four data centers that administer federal payroll systems for a range of information on wage and tax statement practices, citing the growing risk of tax fraud from delays in getting W-2s to the Social Security Administration and state tax agencies,\u201d Eckert reports.\u00a0\u201cLags in reporting wage and withholding information leave federal employees more vulnerable to stolen-identity refund fraud or delays in receiving legitimate refunds since tax agencies are unable to tell whether a tax return includes real or fictitious data, Sens. Orrin Hatch and Ron Wyden noted in letters to the offices.\u201d http://politico.pro/1Efi5kK\nGOVERNORS SET SIGHTS ON ONLINE TAX BILL: The National Governors Association will keep lobbying lawmakers to address online sales taxes when Congress resumes next month. In a letter laying out legislative priorities for the fall, NGA Executive Director Dan Crippen listed the Remote Transactions Parity Act as the top item his group is focused on this session. That bill, from Rep. Jason Chaffetz, would make consumers pay sales taxes for the state they\u2019re in when they purchase something online. The measure \u201clevels the playing field between online and brick-and-mortar retailers ... allowing states to collect a tax already owed to them,\u201d Crippen said.\nQUICK LINKS:\n\u2014 AP warns of another Obamacare/tax snafu: http://bit.ly/1hXlOcR\n\u2014 The Wall Street Journal on the estate tax fight of Tom Clancy\u2019s widow: http://on.wsj.com/1JstQk7\n\u2014 Malcolm Gladwell elaborates on his critique of university endowments: http://n.pr/1EcfKHh\n\u2014 John Oliver\u2019s church is a hit: http://thebea.st/1Eex2nc\nDID YOU KNOW?
