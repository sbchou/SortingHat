You know, it\u2019s a lot more history lessons, just a lot more stuff. We\u2019re sort of back to [the way] we started the show.\u201d  Corey Harrison said his favorite part of working on the show is helping viewers learn about the history behind the antiques showcased in their pawn shop. \n\u201cI love hearing from parents that \u2018It\u2019s a reality show I can watch with my kids that I don\u2019t feel like I am actively making them dumber, and they actually learn a little bit.\u2019\u201d \nTo keep up with their red carpet commitments, the filming of the show and running their pawn shop, Corey Harrison said he relies on a diligent assistant who helps him schedule his time. His dad, on the other hand, said he just tries to do it all. \n\u201cI manage my time. I\u2019m slightly a workaholic, and my wife yells at me a lot for it,\u201d Rick Harrison said with his signature chuckle. \n\u201cPawn Stars\u201d airs Thursdays on the History Channel.", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "&lsquo;Pawn Stars&rsquo; predict 2016 Prez", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2015/05/14/pawn-stars-talk-politics-and-promise-more-stuff-less-fluff-in-new-episodes/", "topics": ["campaign_finance"], "people": ["Rick Harrison", "Corey Harrison", "Marco Rubio"], "orgs": ["History Channel"], "authors": [], "date_written": "2015-05-14 10:44:09", "org": "fox", "article_id": "32621564442757a8f473692af5d619f8", "date_access": "2015-05-14 10:20:18.963528"}
