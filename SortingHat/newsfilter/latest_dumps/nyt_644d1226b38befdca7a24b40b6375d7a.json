{"body": "ROCK RAPIDS, Iowa \u2014  In a state that prizes retail campaigning, nothing is more revered than \u201cthe full Grassley\u201d \u2014 a politician\u2019s visit to all of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties, named for the state\u2019s peripatetic senior senator, Charles E. Grassley.\n\nRick Santorum became the first presidential candidate this year to complete the marathon with a rally last Tuesday in Lyon County in the northwest corner of the state, a four-hour drive from Des Moines, where grain elevators loom like mountain ranges and FM stations broadcast hog prices and news of Asian trade deals.\n\nGov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who has visited 25 counties, has announced his own plans to complete the circuit, in a state he considers crucial in his path to the nomination.\n\n\u201cPeople say: \u2018Why?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Santorum told a crowd in Rock Rapids, the Lyon County seat. \u201cThe idea is to make yourself available to the people who have the responsibility, as you do, to suggest to the American public who should be the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nYet this faith in candidates meeting as many voters as possible, which underpins Iowa\u2019s claim to special status as the first nominating state, is looking increasingly frayed.\n\nAs both parties\u2019 nominating races are shaped by the 24-hour news cycle, social media and national debates, the key to winning the early states has come uncoupled from actually campaigning there.\n\nMr. Santorum may be the first candidate to visit all 99 counties this year, but in Iowa he is polling at only 1 percent. Mr. Walker, who led for months in Iowa polls, has fallen behind Donald J. Trump \u2014 whose popularity has soared thanks to Twitter and cable TV \u2014 and Ben Carson, who had a standout debate performance in August.\n\nAn inconvenient fact for supporters of retail campaigning is that the half-dozen Republican candidates who have logged the most visits to Iowa this year \u2014 Mr. Santorum, Rick Perry, Mike Huckabee, Gov. Bobby Jindal and Senator Rand Paul \u2014 are in the bottom half of polls of the state\u2019s Republican caucusgoers.\n\nMr. Santorum acknowledged that the campaign landscape had shifted.\n\n\u201cIowans live in America,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cAnd who is America focused on right now?\u201d The answer was implicit: Mr. Trump, who has been to Iowa only a smattering of times. \u201cWho runs hour-and-a-half press conferences on major cable networks?\u201d Mr. Santorum added. \u201cIt\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\nThe decision by the Republican National Committee to allow national TV networks to set debate rules also took the spotlight off early voting states. With 17 candidates in the Republican race, the decision by both Fox News and CNN to create two debate tiers by averaging national polls has made visiting early nominating states less important, as candidates focus instead on the debates and social media.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has managed the national social media brilliantly,\u201d said Karl Rove, the Republican strategist. But Mr. Rove was unwilling to dismiss hands-on campaigning in the early voting states, saying the two strategies complement each other. \u201cThe question is: At the end of the day, will Iowa and New Hampshire say, \u2018I\u2019ve seen enough to make a judgment about Trump\u2019?\u201d\n\nIowa\u2019s political class, from the governor on down to the candidate volunteers in its 1,600-plus caucus precincts, has a vested interest in promoting frequent candidate visits to the state.\n\n\u201cThe best advice I could give to anybody is what\u2019s worked well for me: Don\u2019t forget any part of Iowa. It\u2019s called the full Grassley,\u201d Mr. Grassley said at a news conference with Mr. Walker in June.\n\nBut the record of success is mixed. Former Representative Michele Bachmann completed a 99-county tour ahead of the 2012 Republican caucuses, but finished sixth. Mr. Santorum, who also did a full Grassley, won, but only by a razor-thin margin over Mitt Romney, one of the least frequent travelers to the state.\n\nSupporters of retail politics said it was important in building a network of activists. \u201cMany won\u2019t make a decision until they\u2019ve met one on one with all the candidates they\u2019re considering,\u201d said Eric Woolson, an Iowa adviser to Mr. Walker. \u201cIf a candidate hasn\u2019t been available, that candidate is more likely to be marked off activists\u2019 lists of finalists.\u201d\n\nOn the Democratic side, Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose 17 days in the state are fewer than those spent by her rivals Martin O\u2019Malley and Bernie Sanders, returned to Iowa on Labor Day weekend. She planned to attend events at a house party in Cedar Rapids and a coffee shop in Newton.\n\n\u201cThere is no magic elixir,\u201d said Matt Paul, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Iowa director. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of real hard work, organizing and connecting with Iowans where they are.\u201d\n\nBrad Anderson, a Democratic strategist who supports Mrs. Clinton, said the results of intense retail campaigning do not kick in until December, a few weeks before the caucuses, when a front-runner often stumbles.\n\n\u201cThe two best examples are John Edwards in 2004 and Rick Santorum in 2012,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth worked hard, traveled to all 99 counties, and both saw a surge in the polls late in the game when Iowans began to have doubts about front-runners Howard Dean in 2004 and everyone but Santorum in 2012.\u201d\n\nMr. Santorum, 57, a former senator from Pennsylvania, said he had been inspired to visit every Iowa county while serving with Mr. Grassley in Washington.\n\nThe question trailing Mr. Santorum this year is why \u2014 after finishing as the runner-up to Mr. Romney in the Republican nominating race in 2012 \u2014 is he doing so poorly. His support declined from 6 percent in a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll in May to 1 percent in August.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard more than once people saying he had his chance,\u201d said Josh Bakker, the chairman of the Republican Party of Lyon County, where Mr. Santorum finished his tour. \u201cHe\u2019ll have a hard time overcoming that has-been thing.\u201d\n\nMr. Santorum\u2019s explanation is different: After being out of the public eye for three years, he must reintroduce himself to Iowans.\n\nHe ended his 99-county run in Lyon County because its deeply conservative voters gave him his largest margin of victory in the state in 2012.\n\nHe spoke at an evening family picnic that included a bounce house with inflatable corn stalks and a tent supplied by Pizza Ranch, the ubiquitous Iowa chain. A busload of supporters from an evangelical church in Sioux City attended.\n\nHe laid out his credentials as a staunch opponent of abortion and gay marriage, noting he was the only senator who ever \u201cforced a vote\u201d on a constitutional amendment to define marriage as between one man and one woman.\n\nNational Republicans preferred to soft-pedal \u201cmoral and cultural issues,\u201d Mr. Santorum said, and big donors pressure candidates to ignore them.\n\nUnlike better-funded Republicans, Mr. Santorum visited all 99 counties because he sought the support of grass-roots conservatives, not the party elite, he said.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m looking for is people who want to take this country back for what\u2019s good and true and right,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m here in Lyon County tonight.\u201d", "byline": "TRIP GABRIEL", "description": "Rick Santorum is the first candidate this year to visit all of Iowa\u2019s 99 county\u2019s, but he has yet to catch up in the polls to Donald J.
