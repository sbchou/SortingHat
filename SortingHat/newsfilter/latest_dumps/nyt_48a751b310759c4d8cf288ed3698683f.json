{"body": "Candidates make a lot of claims in campaigns that no one should really take seriously. They\u2019re going to fix the economy, lower taxes and \u201ccreate jobs\u201d at the same time. They are going to make the middle class prosperous again. They are going to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon by the force of their own leadership.\n\nTo make it more fun this year, presidential contenders are coming up with some bizarre reasons why you should believe them.\n\nDonald Trump knows he is not offending Hispanic Americans with his racist comments about Mexican immigrants, because he employs a lot of Hispanic people and they must be O.K. with it. What\u2019s amazing about him, really, is that playing the presidential campaign like a reality show (calling Lindsey Graham an idiot, for instance, and telling the world his cell phone number) seems to be working with the right-wing Republicans in New Hampshire who tend to vote in the primary.\n\nScott Walker, and various other current and former governors, want everyone to believe that they are going to be great economic stewards because they did such a good job in their home states, even though their home states did not do well at all under their leadership.\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton wants everyone to believe she is just a regular grandma who can relate to ordinary people\u2019s problems because, well, just because.\n\nAnd now comes Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor and former televangelist. After he said President Obama was leading the Israelis \u201cto the door of the oven\u201d with the Iran nuclear deal, Mr. Huckabee said Jews were not offended by his unarguably offensive and condescending comment.\n\nWhat is his evidence for this? \u201cThe response from\u00a0Jewish people has been overwhelmingly positive, the response from Holocaust survivors, from the\u00a0children of Holocaust survivors,\u201d the former Arkansas governor said on NBC\u2019s Today Show. \u201cI was last night in an event. I was probably one of four gentiles in the entire event \u2014 it was a Jewish event. People were overwhelmingly supportive.\u201d\n\nApparently, not every Jewish person on earth was represented at that meeting. The Anti-Defamation League, which includes a few Jews, condemned Mr. Huckabee rather strongly. It said his comments were \u201cout of line and unacceptable.\u201d\n\nNot so, says Mr. Huckabee and he can prove it. He\u2019s visited Auschwitz not once, but three times and \u201cstood at that very place.\u201d\n\nWell, I guess that\u2019s case closed.
