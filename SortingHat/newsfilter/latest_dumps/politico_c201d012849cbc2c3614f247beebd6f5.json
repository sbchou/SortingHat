{"body": "POLITICO\nAzi Paybarah and Jimmy Vielkind's must-read briefing informing the daily conversation among knowledgeable New Yorkers\nBy Mike Allen, Azi Paybarah and Jimmy Vielkind\n8/18/15 7:21 AM EDT\nBy Azi Paybarah in Manhattan, Jimmy Vielkind in Albany, and Mike Allen in D.C., with Daniel Lippman\nDE BLASIO AIDE: \u2018WE DON\u2019T READ POLLS\u2019 -- POLITICO New York\u2019s Laura Nahmias: Alicia Glen, the city\u2019s deputy mayor for housing and economic development, on Monday dismissed the results of a series of Quinnipiac polls released earlier this month showing Mayor Bill de Blasio with record-high disapproval numbers, while also conceding the city could do a more robust job of trumpeting its achievements. The interview came the same day the New York Times ran a story on Page 1 in its print edition about de Blasio\u2019s tumultuous summer. In the story, people identified as the mayor\u2019s allies questioned whether de Blasio and his administration are doing enough crowing about what\u00a0they\u2019ve actually achieved.\nStory Continued Below\n-- \u201cWe\u2019re not going to worry about poll numbers,\u201d she said. \u201cQuite frankly, we as policy makers and government officials need to be focused on keeping our head down, identifying where the growth sectors are, making sure that people have places to live, makings sure that pre-K is up and running and then measuring those results. And maybe we need to share them with the public more but we don\u2019t read polls. We\u2019re talking about real things that matter to real New Yorkers. \u2026 When you look at the numbers that really matter for New Yorkers, the number of affordable housing units we\u2019ve been able to preserve and produce in our first year, substantially more than even projected and we look at where private sector job growth is, again, up four and a half percent since we've been in office, those are the kind of numbers that people should be focused on.\u201d http://politi.co/1Je4P0c SEE THE NY1 INTERVIEW: http://goo.gl/MpzNdN\n-- HOW TO GET HIS GROOVE BACK -- New York magazine\u2019s Chris Smith: \u201cAcknowledge the problem. \u2026 Stop blaming the media for bad press and start selling more good news. \u2026 Dial down the national progressive push. \u2026 Come up with an effective state progressive challenge to Cuomo or sue for peace. \u2026 Get out on the street \u2014 and not just in Park Slope.\u201d http://goo.gl/uttEoS\n-- Tune In at 10 a.m.: POLITICO New York\u2019s Azi Paybarah appears on WNYC\u2019s \u201cBrian Lehrer Show\u201d to discuss \u201chow between the squabbles with the governor, the Legionnaires\u2019 outbreak, the Uber fight and dipping poll numbers, Mayor de Blasio is struggling to control the public's perception of him and his accomplishments.\u201d\nCUOMO PITCHES GENERAL ELECTRIC\u2014POLITICO New York\u2019s Jimmy Vielkind: Gov. Andrew Cuomo visited top General Electric executives last month as part of an ongoing campaign to lure the company\u2019s headquarters from Connecticut, POLITICO New York has learned. Cuomo, a Democrat, visited the industrial conglomerate\u2019s C-suite in Fairfield on July 30. While the governor listed a trip to Connecticut on that day, his office did not provide any further details of his itinerary, and spokespeople have refused requests for comment for more than two weeks. But two people briefed on the trip say Cuomo and several aides met with top GE executives about a possible move to Westchester County\u2014roughly 30 miles away\u2014and incentives New York might offer. One of the people said GE's chief executive officer, Jeff Immelt, was not present for the meeting, but that he and Cuomo have spoken by phone about the possible relocation. Last year, when both men appeared at GE's research center in Schenectady, Cuomo called Immelt \u201ca great citizen for this country.\u201d\nGE spokesman Dominic McMullan responded to inquiries with a general statement: \u201cWe have formed an exploratory team to assess the company\u2019s options to relocate corporate headquarters. The team is currently engaged in the process and is taking many factors into consideration. When there is a final decision on relocation, we will communicate it publicly.\u201d \u00a0http://politi.co/1TP4FOs\nSERVICE!\u2014\u201cA de Blasio donor with building problems gets results,\u201d by Politico New York's Conor Skelding: \u201cWhen a water main broke in a Greenwich Village co-op, knocking out heat and water, one resident didn\u2019t just call 311. She called City Hall. \u2026 The resident, Roberta Kaplan, is a partner at Paul, Weiss, the law firm, and a generous donor to Democratic candidates for public office. ...\nA water main had broken, interfering with electrical service and the boiler, according to two Department of Buildings complaints dated Jan. 17, 2014. Both of the complaints that affected Kaplan's building were marked priority B, meaning they were non-emergency complaints, to which D.O.B. aims to respond within 40 days. The department averaged 34.6 days in fiscal year 2014, according to the 2015 Preliminary Mayor\u2019s Management Report. But the department investigated the electrical complaint on Jan. 17, the same day it was filed, and the boiler complaint on Jan. 18, the day after it was filed.\u201d http://bit.ly/1JhJ8y9\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201c[T]he mayor needs some upbeat optics as soon as possible.\u201d -- New York magazine\u2019s Chris Smith: http://goo.gl/uttEoS\nLOTTERY OF THE DAY: Enter to win Senator Schumer\u2019s guest ticket to see Pope Francis\u2019s congressional address: http://1.usa.gov/1gShPgU\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY: Touro Law dean Patricia Salkin, State Senate lawyer Jess Cherry, Cuomo administration Capital Region rep Mark Streb, veteran radio broadcaster Bob Hennelly, Wall Street Journal EMEA resources editor Mike Amon \u2026 CBS New York reporter Sonia Rincon \u2026 and James Polite, a former intern for then-New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, who has an inspirational story http://goo.gl/nPdIbC\nTABS -- News: TIT FOR BRAINS: New York\u2019s Finest on the job in Times Sq.\u201d -- Post: \u201cBLOOD & GUTS: Yanks win as pitcher drilled\u201d -- amNY: TRUMP HOLDS COURT\u201d\n-- Newsday: \u201cPlane crashes on LIRR Tracks: FINAL MINUTES\u201d -- Metro: \u201cChamp-urrado: Nominated.

And unlike James Baldwin\u2019s \u2018The Fire Next Time,\u2019 where Baldwin urges his teenage nephew \u201cto believe that revolutionary change is possible,\u201d Coates\u2019 book, written as a letter to his teenage son, \u201cseems to be written on the opposite side of the same coin. Rather than urging his son to awaken to his own power, Coates emphasizes over and over the apparent permanence of racial injustice in America.\u201d Michelle Alexander in the Times: http://goo.gl/GA4ZLK\nLEGISLATIVE GAZETTE ENDING PRINT EDITION\u2014James Nani in the Times Herald Record: \u201cThe Legislative Gazette, an all-intern-written weekly newspaper based in Albany but run by SUNY New Paltz, will stop printing by the end of this month, after 37 years.

Elisha, who died Sunday at the age of 92 after suffering a stroke, was an ever-moving star, a man who always seemed to be at the nexus of whatever important work was going on at the time. It would seem it would take more than one lifetime to cram all of Elisha's passions and endeavors in. . . If his rhetoric wasn't being called \u2018inflammatory\u2019 by an Assembly Democrat in the 1980s when he was advocating for state ethics laws as executive director of New York Common Cause, he was working to right the legacy of the men in the Army\u2019s 27th Infantry Division who lost so many lives fighting on South Pacific islands, where he himself was stationed during World War II. http://bit.ly/1TOLtjQ\nTOPLESS IN TIMES SQUARE -- News\u2019 Rocco Parascandola, Molly Crane-Newman, Maria Villasenor, and Corky Siemaszko: \u201cThere were no tips from this pair of NYPD boobs. While the brass grapple with a strategy to corral the herd of topless women who critics say shake down Times Square tourists for tips, two beat cops took turns posing for pictures with nearly-naked ladies who had the Stars and Stripes painted across their breasts. \u2026 Told that Police Commissioner Bill Bratton was not a fan, [one topless performer] laughed. \u2018The police love us,\u2019 she said. \u2018I don\u2019t care what the police commissioner says, the police love us. They always come over and say hi to us. We don\u2019t cause problems.\u2019 The other topless performer, who lives in Queens, said this was not the first time she had posed with some of the city\u2019s Finest. \u2018It happens to me repeatedly, with different officers,\u2019 \u2026 The NYPD had no comment on the photos snapped by the Daily News.\u201d http://goo.gl/sLD1ae\nSHOOTINGS PROMPT TOWN HALL MTG IN BROOKLYN -- DNAinfo\u2019s Rosa Goldensohn: \u201cPublic Advocate Letitia James will hold a town hall meeting at her old City Council district on Wednesday to address locals\u2019 concerns about rising gun violence. The forum was called in response to an increase in shootings in the neighborhood over the last few weeks, a spokeswoman for the public advocate said. \u2026 There have been 15 shootings in the 88th precinct so far this year, almost double the 8 shootings that had been reported during the same time last year, police statistics show. \u2026 The meeting, which is open to all, will take place at the Emmanuel Baptist Church at 279 Lafayette Ave. in Clinton Hill from 6 to 9 p.m. Aug. 19.\u201d http://goo.gl/hzyKxG\nTRUMP DISMISSED -- Post\u2019s Julia Marsh, Priscilla DeGregory and Sophia Rosenbaum: \u201cRepublican front-runner Donald Trump spent Monday in Manhattan Supreme Court waiting to be called for jury duty \u2014 but was dismissed by the end of the day because the month is so slow in terms of cases. The real-estate mogul pulled up to court fashionably late \u2014 just after 9:10 a.m. \u2014 in a Lincoln town car limousine dressed in a navy blue suit that he paired with a blue-and-white striped tie. \u2018It\u2019s my duty, and I\u2019m happy to do it,\u2019 Trump said, who has been fined in the past for never showing up to court for previous summonses. Trump was dismissed at 3:55 p.m. along with the rest of the jury pool because court business is so slow. He doesn\u2019t have to report for a second day of service.\u201d http://bit.ly/1JcXTjU\nMEET THE CANDIDATES: EMILY\u2019s list, which steers money toward Democratic women running for office, announced Katie McGinty, a candidate for the U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, will be the fourth female aspirant during a luncheon panel on Sept. 28.

Sherwin Belkin of Belkin Burden Wenig & Goldman, who has helped landlords with buyouts in the past, questioned a package of bills passed last week that would curtail a property owner\u2019s right to offer tenant buyouts in the interest of limiting what the sponsors deem is harassment. \u2026\n\u201cBelkin argued the bills actually restrict free speech by limiting the contact a property owner can have with a tenant. He took particular issue with a requirement that tenants be advised of their rights in writing when made a buyout offer. He does not have any clients looking to sue, but believes the issue is ripe for litigation. \u2026 The Councilmembers who sponsored the bills adamantly disagreed with his interpretation.\u201d http://politi.co/1Je51ws\nLIBRARY LIVES ON\u2014\u201cIn Rockaways Library, \u2018a Sign of Recovery,\u2019\u201d by Corinne Ramey: \u201cWhen the Peninsula branch of the Queens Library opens to the public on Tuesday, it will be the first time in nearly three years that local residents have a fully restored library. The library, which just received a $3.6 million renovation, has been closed to the public since superstorm Sandy. The facility, which had been slated for renovation before the storm, was decimated: Water inside the building rose to 4 feet, tossing shelves and books around the room. Data and electrical wires were destroyed, a window shattered and books washed down the street. The library is one of four in the Rockaways damaged during Sandy, and the last to reopen, a library spokeswoman said.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1Je3x5q\nTHE HOME TEAMS -- POLITICO New York\u2019s Howard Megdal: Yankees 8, Twins 7: Old friend Eduardo Nunez, now with the Twins, bobbled a bases loaded grounder in the tenth, and it felt like old times.\n-- The day ahead: the Yankees host the Twins again.
