{"body": "Jeb Bush went to the border town of McAllen, Tex., on Monday to raise money and to talk about immigration, in English and fluent Spanish. Because the Republican presidential campaign has been so fixated on border security and the immigrant peril \u2014 thank you, Donald Trump \u2014 it was a chance to see how the supposed expert on this fraught subject handled it.\n\nShort version: He was awful.\n\nIn less than 15 minutes, Mr. Bush managed to step on his message, to give Mr. Trump a boost, and to offend Asian-Americans, a growing population that is every bit as important as Latinos in winning presidential elections. And he failed to give Latino voters any persuasive evidence that he had anything better to offer them than his opponents in a revoltingly xenophobic Republican campaign.\n\nIt may be time to offer this forlorn candidate some free advice. Although if he really is the smarter Bush, he knows these things already:\n\n1.) He should never let himself say the words \u201canchor babies\u201d ever again. He got in trouble for using that derogatory reference to the children of unauthorized immigrants in passing, in an interview, then dug himself a hole by defending his use of it. On Monday, he dug deeper. He tried to explain that he had been talking about \u201cAsian people\u201d who arrive on tourist visas through organized schemes to give birth to American babies on American soil.\n\nThough the phenomenon is real, Mr. Bush was blasted by Asian-American groups for repeating the slur. And, astoundingly, he handed Mr. Trump the opportunity to send out tweets like this: In a clumsy move to get out of his \u201canchor babies\u201d dilemma, where he signed that he would not use the term and now uses it, he blamed ASIANS.\n\nIt was such an unnecessary battle to wade into \u2013 maternity tourism is not what Mr. Trump and his enablers on the restrictionist right are talking about. When they say \u201canchor babies,\u201d they are talking about the browning of America, with its growing Latino population, and recasting it as a sinister plot by child-rearing Mexicans. They want to upend the 14thAmendment, and the country\u2019s family-based immigration laws, to keep the population as white as can be. Maternity tourism by middle-class foreigners is a separate, much smaller issue; changing the Constitution to stop it, as one immigrant rights advocate once put it, is like killing a fly with an Uzi.\n\n2.) He should lighten up. Mr. Bush probably wants to come across as a happy warrior, but he\u2019s a testy and peevish one, and pedantic, to boot. \u201cIf he\u2019s interested in a more comprehensive approach\u201d to immigration, Mr. Bush said of Mr. Trump, \u201che might want to read my book.\u201d As reporters kept baiting him with he-said-this-what-do-you-say questions, his exasperation overflowed. Hence the Asian quagmire.\n\n3.) His campaign should get better at stage-managing press events. This one, at a Mexican restaurant, was weirdly free form, with kids yelling and assorted invitees mumbling at the microphone. The grim, adobe-and-stucco backdrop was like a Spanish colonial dungeon; it looked as if the grim-faced Mr. Bush had come to announce the arrest of Zorro.\n\n4.) When he does choose to tell the truth, he should find a more persuasive way to do it. On Monday, he attacked the Trump immigration plan, which centers on building a Great Wall of Mexico and forcing millions of people to the other side of it. \u201cIt would cost hundreds of billions of dollars,\u201d Mr. Bush said, as well as \u201cviolate people\u2019s civil liberties\u201d and \u201ccreate friction with our third-largest trading partner.\u201d That is a fair reading of what Mr. Trump wants. But to win the nomination, Mr. Bush has to win over a fair chunk of the aggrieved, frightened Trump voters, who probably don\u2019t care about trade friction with rapist-killer exporting countries, or the cost of a border wall. Mr. Bush may have better ideas, but they have to cut through the fog of Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s commonly believed that Republicans are sealing their general-election doom with all this hating on immigrants. If anyone could avoid that fate, it should be someone like Jeb Bush, born in Midland, Tex., and reared in Houston, with a Latina wife, Latino children and flawless command of Spanish. Even as Mr. Trump rages and bellows, there should be room for a Republican to send a message that most American voters, who are moderate on immigration, will hear. But for all his paper qualifications, Mr. Bush has been angering to many, boring to many others, inspiring to none.
