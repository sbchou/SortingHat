{"body": "NEW YORK Carly Fiorina has emerged as the Republican candidate of the moment in conservative fundraising circles, drawing the notice of the billionaire Koch brothers and other wealthy donors who could instantly remake her shoestring presidential campaign.\nFiorina's show-stealing performance in a Republican presidential debate last month, and her subsequent surge in the polls, has prompted industrialists Charles and David Koch to take a \u201cserious look\u201d at the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, according to three sources close to the brothers.\nShe has now moved to the short list of candidates the Kochs may support with their reported $1 billion war chest, the sources said. Florida Senator Marco Rubio is among those on the coveted list, the sources said.\nA spokesman for the Kochs declined to comment\nOther politically powerful mega donors are also lining up.\nTexas oilman T. Boone Pickens hosted a packed luncheon at a posh Dallas venue for Fiorina in late September, while venture capitalist Tom Perkins is planning a fundraising gala in California in the next few months. \n\u201cMy money is on her,\u201d said Perkins, who served on HP's board during Fiorina's tenure. \u201cI think she could be president.\u201d\nAs the only woman on stage at the Sept. 16 debate, Fiorina emerged as the most effective candidate in taking on front-runner Donald Trump, chastening the celebrity real estate magnate for his controversial comments about her looks.\n\u201cThe emails have not stopped\" since then, said seasoned California political fundraising consultant Karolyn Dorsee, who is working on behalf of several Republican presidential candidates, including Rubio and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. \"Everybody wants her, nationwide, in every single state.\u201d\nEven before her rapid rise in the polls - she has vaulted to second place in the key early voting state of New Hampshire - Fiorina had already garnered about $2 million in support from the likes of reclusive hedge fund baron Robert Mercer and former Univision CEO Jerrold Perenchio. \n\n\"SHE'S PRETTY VIABLE\"\nFiorina's campaign now appears far less of a long-shot than it did over the summer, when she was struggling with sparse crowds, scant name recognition and a coffer of just $5 million that put her at the bottom of the money race. \nHer campaign thus far has been a bare-bones operation, relying on a young, relatively low-paid, skeletal staff as opposed to the sprawling operations built by more well-endowed candidates like Bush.\nSupport from the Kochs would change her operation overnight.\n\u201cWe think she\u2019s pretty viable,\u201d said broadcasting billionaire Stanley Hubbard, a member of the Koch brothers' network of conservative advocacy groups who donates heavily to political candidates.\nThe Kochs have been keeping a close eye on Fiorina ever since she announced in May, the Koch sources said. They extended an invite to her to speak at their exclusive summit of rich donors at an oceanfront luxury resort in August along with Rubio, Bush, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, and Texas Senator Ted Cruz. \nFiorina, the lowest polling candidate at the gathering, impressed the big money attendees with her mastery of policy detail and heavyweight stage presence. \"She's good in the room,\" said one participant at the event, who declined to be named.\nThe Fiorina campaign, and the independent fund-raising Super PAC supporting her, declined comment. \nThe Kochs, who own America\u2019s second-largest private company, have backed Fiorina in the past, notably when she ran unsuccessfully against incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer for her California Senate seat in 2010.\nAt the time, the Kochs had helped mount a campaign for Proposition 23, a ballot measure designed to suspend the state law banning higher carbon emissions that was ultimately defeated. Fiorina also supported the measure. A Koch Industries PAC helped sponsor a Washington fundraiser for Fiorina at the time and gave $10,000 to her campaign.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As Fiorina's money problems fade, some high dollar donors who have already contributed are now considering doubling down. Dallas philanthropist Elloine Clark has so far written one $100,000 check to the Super PAC supporting Fiorina. She says she may give more. \u201cI think she\u2019s unflappable,\u201d said Clark. \u201cAnd she doesn\u2019t react like an adolescent.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n (Reporting By Michelle Conlin; Additional reporting Emily Stephenson in Washington, D.C.; Editing by Paul Thomasch and Ross Colvin)", "byline": "", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Carly Fiorina has emerged as the Republican candidate of the moment in conservative fundraising circles, drawing the notice of the billionaire Koch brothers and other wealthy donors who could instantly remake her shoestring presidential campaign.", "title": "Koch brothers, other 2016 mega donors warm to Carly Fiorina", "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/dFzSxOQf0mg/story01.htm", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["Karolyn Dorsee", "Stanley Hubbard", "Emily Stephenson", "Michelle Conlin", "David Koch", "T.
