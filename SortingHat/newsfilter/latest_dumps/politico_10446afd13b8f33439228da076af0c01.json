Others, it said, would be let go.\n\u201cWe talked to all the staff,\u201d said Bob Haus, Perry\u2019s top strategist in the state. Haus said he would still work for the former Texas governor, but on an unpaid basis.\nThe decision was widely anticipated, with Perry\u2019s advisers informing Iowa staff last week that a cut-back was on the immediate horizon. In the days prior, some of Perry\u2019s staff had been working on an unpaid basis for a period of time.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s based financial reasons,\u201d said Haus, adding that the former governor did not wish to see staff go unpaid. \nOne top Perry adviser, Karen Fesler, submitted her letter of resignation on Monday and said that she would be joining Rick Santorum's campaign. Fesler, an influential activist in the state, also worked for Santorum in 2012.\n\nAlex Isenstadt is a reporter for Politico.\n\n                                            By \nNahal Toosi\n\n\n                                            By \nSam Nunn\n                                             and \nRichard Lugar\n\n\n                                            By \nMatt Latimer\n\n\n                                            By \nAaron MaK\n\n \u00a9 2015 POLITICO LLC", "byline": "", "description": "", "title": "Perry cuts Iowa team to one paid staffer", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/rick-perry-2016-iowa-staffers-cut-213188", "topics": ["personality"], "people": ["Sam Nunn", "Burgess Everett", "George Mitchell", "Wasserman Schultz", "Ray Kelly", "Liz Cheney", "Rachael Bade", "Ali Breland", "Matt Latimer", "Hadas Gold", "Jeremy Corbyn", "Marc Caputo", "Laurens Cerulus", "Al D'Amato", "Anthony Weiner", "Sarah Palin", "Kevin Robillard", "Andrew Restuccia", "Richard Lugar", "Nahal Toosi", "Josh Gerstein", "Annie Karni", "Rick Perry", "Bobby Jindal", "Bernie Sanders", "Scott Walker", "Zeke Turner", "Nick Gass", "Alex Isenstadt", "Rick Santorum", "Isaac Dovere", "Jamie Johnson", "Jeb Bush", "Danny Vinik", "Andrew Glass", "Donald Trump", "John Bresnahan", "Glenn Thrush", "Elizabeth Warren", "Jennifer Shutt", "Ben Schreckinger", "Brian Faler", "Bob Haus", "Karen Fesler", "Matthew Karnitschnig", "John Kasich", "Huma Abedin", "Barack Obama", "Dick Cheney"], "orgs": ["Sens", "Soviets", "European Union", "USDA", "United States."], "authors": [{"author_id": 30728, "fullname": "nick gass", "primary_org": "politico"}], "date_written": "2015-08-31 17:43:45", "org": "politico", "article_id": "10446afd13b8f33439228da076af0c01", "date_access": "2015-08-31 17:00:15.476937"}
