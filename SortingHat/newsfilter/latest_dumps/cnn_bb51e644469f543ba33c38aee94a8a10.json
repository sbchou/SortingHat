{"body": "Washington (CNN)Donald Trump is highlighting the support of a politician who, without a doubt, does not back his presidential campaign.\nBut in an Instagram video posted Tuesday, former President Bill Clinton offers appears to shower praise on Trump in an edited mash-up of public appearances.\nBut Clinton, of course, is married to Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton and supports her bid for the White House.\nPulling clips of Bill Clinton explaining the appeal of Trump's presidential campaign in an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria late last month and on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" the Trump campaign opens the video with a suggestive question: \"An endorsement from Bill Clinton?\"\n\"He's a master brander,\" the former president says in the mash-up. \"And he's the most interesting character out there ... And there is a, a macho appeal to saying I'm just sick of nothing happening, I make things happen, vote for me.\"\nThe 15-second video interlaces audio of Clinton praising Trump with images of the billionaire on the campaign trail and ends with an emphatic \"Thank you Bill!!!\" message on the screen.\nThe video also includes a clip of Bill Clinton saying, \"And I like him\" about Trump in an interview on CNN in 2012 in which he also said Trump \"has been uncommonly nice to Hillary and me\" and knocked the billionaire for continuing to press the notion that Obama was not born in the U.S.\nIn his appearance on Colbert's show, Clinton also said Trump's campaign \"may have a short half-life.\"\nAnd in his interview with Zakaria, Clinton said Trump has \"a lot of pizzazz and zip.\" \nThe former president has been much more critical of Trump in other interviews, knocking him for running a \"fact-free\" campaign and said of Trump, \"You can't -- and you shouldn't be able -- to insult your way to the White House.\" \nWhen asked about the Trump video, Bill Clinton's spokesman directed CNN to a specific quote from the former president about the mogul: \"The thing about branding is you can be fact-free.\"\nTrump has repeatedly taken to Instagram to post short videos boosting his candidacy or taking shots at others, including Hillary Clinton.\nCNN's Dan Merica contributed to this report.", "byline": "", "description": "Donald Trump is highlighting the support of a politician who, without a doubt, does not back his presidential campaign.", "title": "Trump video highlights Bill Clinton's praise", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/20/politics/donald-trump-bill-clinton-instagram/index.html", "topics": ["personality", "campaign_finance"], "people": ["Bill Clinton", "Hillary Clinton", "Donald Trump", "Fareed Zakaria", "Stephen Colbert", "Dan Merica"], "orgs": ["Trump"], "authors": [{"author_id": 2323, "fullname": "jeremy diamond", "primary_org": "cnn"}], "date_written": "2015-10-20 23:30:08", "org": "cnn", "article_id": "bb51e644469f543ba33c38aee94a8a10", "date_access": "2015-10-21 02:32:47.301384"}
