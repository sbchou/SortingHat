{"body": "The Democratic Governors Association raised $17 million in the first six months of this year, according to numbers released by the group\u00a0to the Wall Street Journal Thursday.\nThe amount trails the $24.4 million that its counterpart on the GOP side, the Republican Governors Association, raised so far this year to help officials competing for gubernatorial seats.\nBut DGA officials argued that they are chipping away at a traditional money gap between the groups. The DGA has trailed the RGA\u2019s figures so far this year by $7.4 million. That\u2019s less than the two-to-one fundraising lead that the Republican group has held over its Democratic equivalent in some other years.\n\u201cWith Congress broken, Democratic supporters understand that much of the action is in the states. That\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing record investment in electing Democratic governors,\u201d said Elisabeth Pearson, the DGA\u2019s executive director.\nRGA officials argued that the fundraising gap isn\u2019t any narrower between the two groups, and contended they are still better positioned to retain and capture additional gubernatorial seats.\n\u201cThey are still raising significantly less than the RGA, limiting their ability to play in many governor\u2019s races,\u201d spokesman Jon Thompson said about Democratic group. \u201cThe RGA is in a strong financial position to go on offense over the next two years and expand our majority of 31 GOP governors.\u201d\nOnly three states have contests for governors this year, though two are open seats. Democratic Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear is term-limited, as is Republican presidential candidate and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. Incumbent Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican, is seeking re-election in the fall.\nLast year, Republicans increased the number of gubernatorial\u00a0seats they held to 31 from 29. The RGA raised more than $100 million in 2014, while New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was its chairman, a record that gave the Republican presidential contender a boost in the party.\nNext year\u2019s gubernatorial contests will be more numerous, with 12 states holding elections in a presidential year. Media buying tends to be more expensive in presidential years, and the groups are expected to hang on to some of their cash going into next year.\n______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nPolitics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.
