{"body": "POLITICO\nMike Allen's must-read briefing on what's driving the day in Washington\nBy Mike Allen\n8/11/15 6:37 AM EDT\nBy Mike Allen (@mikeallen; mallen@politico.com) and Daniel Lippman (@dlippman; dlippman@politico.com)\nGood Tuesday morning. JUST POSTED \u2013 \u201cRand Paul faces emerging doubts at home: Paul has been furiously lobbying Kentucky Republican leaders ahead of an Aug. 22 decision to rewrite party rules so he can run for president and reelection to his Senate seat simultaneously,\u201d by Kyle Cheney and Manu Raju: \u201cThough that approval once seemed assured, several members of the party executive committee told POLITICO they\u2019re seeing increasing trepidation, in part because of Paul\u2019s perceived fade from contention but also because he hasn\u2019t yet fulfilled promises to cover the cost of any changes.\u201d http://politi.co/1UAgWIT\nStory Continued Below\nTHE CONVERSATION: Jeb Bush was criticized for holding back when he was unexpectedly attacked by Hillary Clinton before the National Urban League in Fort Lauderdale 10 days ago. He\u2019ll make up for it tonight, with tough(ish) talk at the Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., in a speech billed as \u201ca vision for confronting and defeating radical Islamic terrorism,\u201d with \u201cspecific prescriptions for addressing the threat of global jihad, in particular ISIS.\u201d\nFrom the excerpts, emailed to reporters last night: \u201cISIS grew while the United States disengaged from the Middle East and ignored the threat. And where was Secretary of State Clinton in all of this? Like the president himself, she had opposed the surge, then joined in claiming credit for its success -- then stood by as that hard-won victory by American and allied forces was thrown away. In all her record-setting travels, she stopped by Iraq exactly once.\n\u201cWho can seriously argue that America and our friends are safer today than in 2009, when the President and Secretary Clinton -- the storied \u2018team of rivals\u2019 -- took office? So eager to be the history-makers, they failed to be the peacemakers. It was a case of blind haste to get out, and to call the tragic consequences somebody else\u2019s problem. Rushing away from danger can be every bit as unwise as rushing into danger, and the costs have been grievous.\u201d Full excerpts (Jumbo shrimp!) http://politi.co/1J0HPS5 ...

With a special, original introduction, Noonan chronicles her career in journalism, the Reagan White House, and the political arena.\u201d\n--From the intro: \u201cTo me writing is a full-body exercise: What you write comes from your brain, heart, spirit, soul and psyche, you hold nothing back, all parts are engaged. You are asking people for five minutes of their time to read you. They're busy. You have to show them from the top that you're engaged, that you mean it, that there's something you think is important that should be said. ...\n\u201cPeople ask the difference between column writing, book writing and speechwriting. In one sense they\u2019re not different: You're writing. You're laying pipe only the pipes are thoughts, as John Gregory Dunne once said. But the best definition of writing I ever heard came from the great historian David McCullough, who said, in conversation, \u2018To write is to think, and to write well is to think well.\u2019 You think about what you want to say, you clarify it, question it, then say it.\u201d See the cover. http://bit.ly/1gZdgSK\nCOVERING THE COVERAGE -- \u201cCBS News to overhaul 2016 convention coverage,\u201d by AP\u2019s Lynn Elber in Beverly Hills: \u201cCBS News will overhaul its coverage of the 2016 ... conventions to emphasize participants \u2018on the ground\u2019 rather than chatter in the network\u2019s skybox, CBS News President David Rhodes [told the summer tour of the Television Critics Association]. ...
