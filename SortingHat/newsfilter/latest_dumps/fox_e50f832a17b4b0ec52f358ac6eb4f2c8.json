John McCain, R-Ariz. and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., escalated Wednesday when McCain called the 2016 presidential hopeful \u201cthe worst possible candidate\u201d on the issue of national security.\n\nMcCain\u2019s comments, made on Fox News\u2019 \u201cYour World with Neil Cavuto,\u201d were in response to Paul calling McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C,. \u201clapdogs for President Obama\u201d on foreign policy.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT\n\nPaul made his remarks Tuesday on Fox News\u2019 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d when asked about recent criticisms of his foreign policy outlook by Graham and McCain.\n\n\u201cThis comes from a group of people who have been wrong about every foreign policy issue over the last two decades,\u201d Paul said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really the one standing up to President Obama, and these people are essentially the lapdogs for President Obama and I think they\u2019re sensitive about that.\u201d\n\nMcCain responded in full force Wednesday:\n\n\u201cSenator Paul is the worst possible candidate of the 20 or so that are running on the most important issue, that is national security.\u201d\n\nMcCain said Paul had in the past doubted if ISIS was a threat to U.S. national security, had proposed a budget that would cut defense spending by 30 percent and said Iran wasn\u2019t a threat to Israel.\n\n\u201cThe record is very clear that [Paul] does not have an understanding of the needs or the threats of United States national security,\u201d McCain said.\n\nHowever, when asked if he would support Paul if he were the nominee against Hillary Clinton, McCain conceded he would.\n\n\u201cI would support the nominee for my party, I am a loyal Republican. I would hope that good sense would prevail here, because the realities of the world today do not allow for isolationist policies,\u201d McCain said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen what happens from \u201cleading from behind,\u201d leading from far behind, and that\u2019s what Rand Paul would do, but I hope that many of us could prevail on him to see the world in a very different light.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by Neil Cavuto if Paul was the worst of all presidential candidates right now, McCain doubled down on his earlier remarks.\n\n\u201cOn national security? Absolutely. There is no doubt in my mind.\u201d\n\nWhen asked who his choice for 2016 was, McCain pointed to a familiar ally.\n\n\u201cLindsey Graham. Lindsey Graham.
