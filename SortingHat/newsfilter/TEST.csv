"City Room: Her Father’s City, and His Daughter’s",nyt,"

When I was 15, I went to visit my father in Manhattan. I was obsessed with the beat authors at the time. We barely knew each other and I don’t think Kerouac or Ginsberg are particularly to my father’s tastes, but he honored my enthusiasm by walking me all over the Village, taking me to the Blue Note for jazz and the San Remo Cafe for coffee.

And then he showed me his New York City. We walked over to where the best pickup basketball games go down. We walked to the World Trade Center (where he worked at the time) and drank more coffee at his favorite table. Sitting at this table, you felt like a conductor in front of an orchestra of escalators — moving stairs churning out an endless symphony of human beings. We walked and we walked and he masterfully erased the distance.

Today he texted me that the San Remo is gone. Just the shell of a building now. “One more memory lost” is what he wrote. And I know what he means, because the conductor’s table is gone, too. But until he texted me, I’d forgotten about that cafe on MacDougal and Bleecker. It was so overshadowed by the awe of getting to know my dad.

Greek Crisis: The Problem With a Euro Fix: What’s in It for the Dutch?,nyt,"Economists agree: If the eurozone does not break up, it will have to move closer together. They’re right. But it’s easy to understand why Europeans are not eager to heed their advice.

Basically, the proposition of European integration is that the Netherlands should end up like Connecticut. And even though Connecticut is a lovely place, the Dutch have good reason to be wary of that. It’s expensive to be Connecticut, because Connecticut has to pay for Mississippi and Alabama.

Large, economically diverse areas can successfully share a single currency if they have deep economic links that make it possible for troubled regions to ride out crises. That means shared bank regulation and deposit insurance, so banks don’t face regional panics; a labor market that lets people move from places without jobs to places with them; and a fiscal union, which allows the government to collect taxes wherever there is money and spend it wherever there are needs.

The United States shows that this approach can work: America’s 50 economically diverse states share a currency quite comfortably, in part because of our banking union (Washington State did not have to bail out Washington Mutual on its own when it failed), our fluid labor market (as oil prices rise and fall, workers move in and out of North Dakota) and our fiscal union (states in economic pain benefit from government programs financed by all states). Nevada does not need to devalue its currency to restore its competitiveness relative to California in a severe recession; instead, Nevadans can collect federally funded unemployment insurance and, if necessary, move to California.

If the Greeks had similar options available in 2008, they would be much better off today. But the European Union’s centralized budget equals only about 1 percent of Europe’s G.D.P., compared with more than 20 percent for the American federal government. A much more centralized E.U. budget, with much more money flowing through Brussels the way it flows through Washington, could provide similar macroeconomic stability to Europe by creating a fiscal union.

But the American fiscal union is very expensive for rich states. According to calculations by The Economist, Connecticut paid out 5 percent of its gross domestic product in net fiscal transfers to other states between 1990 and 2009; that is, its tax payments exceeded its receipt of government services by that amount. This is typical for rich states: They pay a disproportionate share of income and payroll taxes, while government services are disproportionately collected in states where people are poor or old or infirm.

The obvious question, then, about a fiscal union is: What’s in it for the Netherlands (or Austria or Luxembourg)? Is it worth making the euro “work” if that entails devoting several percentage points of your economic output to fiscal transfers to poorer countries, indefinitely, the way Connecticut does to poorer states? Germany has its own reasons to view a large, indivisible eurozone as a source of geopolitical strength, but those benefits are less obvious for the smaller rich countries that must also go along.

Austan Goolsbee, an economist at the University of Chicago, offered one reason rich European countries might sign up for a fiscal union: They like a trade advantage they get from the euro. If each European country had its own money, northern European countries’ currencies would strengthen and southern ones would weaken. That would make exports from places like the Netherlands more expensive and less competitive. Some Dutch exporters might be willing to accept fiscal transfers if that’s what it takes to keep the currency advantage.

But exporters’ gain from a shared currency is consumers’ loss. The same policies that make it easy for Dutch and German companies to sell their goods abroad make it expensive for Dutch and German consumers to buy imported goods. For those consumers, keeping the euro and instituting a fiscal union would be a double whammy: They’d keep overpaying for imported goods, and they’d be paying extra taxes to finance the union.

Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at Columbia University, favors maintenance of the eurozone with closer banking and fiscal integration, including a eurozone-wide income tax to finance safety-net programs. He offers three arguments for why rich countries should be willing to sign up, even though this system would cost them more in taxes than they get back in payments.

“One is, I’d say it’s ethical,” he says. “It’s solidarity, the European project.”

His other two arguments appeal more to self-interest. Without further fiscal integration, geographic adjustment in the eurozone will have to lean on labor mobility. If the Greeks can’t get safety-net payments financed by Europe-wide taxes, many of them will just move to places like the Netherlands, where they might be able to live better even if their Dutch isn’t very good. Additionally, he argues that fiscal integration will promote greater economic equality, and therefore greater macroeconomic stability and fewer crises.

These arguments, or arguments like them, have carried the day in the United States. You could just as easily ask “What’s in it for Connecticut?” and yet voters and officials in states like Connecticut express little desire to unwind the fiscal union; the strong sense is that we’re all Americans and we’re in this together.

For better or for worse, this is not the prevailing attitude in Europe.

The ethical argument for fiscal integration is undermined because Greece and Spain are actually not so poor. If countries like the Netherlands are going to give away their wealth to needier places out of ethical obligation, there are more deserving recipients outside the eurozone. Greece is not even the poorest country within the eurozone, which is why arguments that fiscal integration is ethically necessary are met with skepticism in relatively poor countries like Estonia and Slovakia; they fear fiscal transfers will flow away from them toward countries that are richer but more profligate (i.e., Greece).

Then there are the arguments from self-interest. A more economically integrated Europe would be more economically stable because it could respond more effectively to crises like the one in 2008. That would certainly lead to higher economic output in places like Greece. But would it really mean better economic performance in already high-performing countries? It certainly feels counterintuitive to tell a wealthy, well-governed country like the Netherlands or Austria that its economy will become more stable if it becomes more integrated with Greece’s.

Further, an economic union can promote economic stability only if it is politically stable, so market participants can have confidence that fiscal transfers and bank guarantees will remain in place. Magnanimous attitudes like the ones expressed by the people of Connecticut (or a lack of awareness about how many of their tax dollars are being spent in other states) aren’t just necessary for the adoption of a fiscal union; they’re a key to making it work over the long run.

The simultaneous necessity for — and revulsion at — greater fiscal integration in Europe helps explain one aspect of the continuing Greek negotiations that, at first, looks mysterious from the outside. Before this week’s crisis, the Greeks and other European governments were not actually that far apart on the substantive terms of a continued Greek bailout; they disagreed a bit, at the margins, about how much fiscal austerity Greece must implement and how much debt restructuring it should get. Yet Northern European governments looked poised to push Greece out of the eurozone over those small disagreements, and may still do so in the future.

If the only viable option for maintaining the eurozone in the long run requires deeper fiscal links; and if those deeper fiscal links will mean large, indefinite fiscal transfers away from rich countries; and if rich countries entered the eurozone in the first place only because they didn’t believe they would need to make such transfers, then is it hard to understand why those rich countries might not be eager to resolve the Greek crisis in a way that keeps Greece inside the zone?

“Clearly, they’re not at the sense of solidarity that we have as a nation,” Mr. Stiglitz said. “If you are going to get stabilization policies that work, you’re going to have to get outside the mind-set of ‘why should I help my neighbor?’ ”

If the response is “Why this neighbor?” your continent may simply not be cut out for a deeper fiscal union.

On the other hand, it’s worth noting that Connecticut never explicitly signed up for this neighbor-funding arrangement, either. Like the eurozone, the United States wasn’t much of a fiscal union at the time of its founding. Fiscal centralization came gradually over the centuries, often in response to crises like the Great Depression.

It’s possible that countries like the Netherlands and Austria could gradually stumble toward financing their neighbors as Connecticut has. But if the gradual American process has to be the model, we will all be long dead before the eurozone is fixed.",0.0028734871840967874,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.0031422193081077554, u'mexico': 0.00099124847140467714, u'abortion': 0.001349139584723869, u'immigration': 9.8753000507004223e-05, u'trade': 0.0076470638393195314, u'campaign_finance': 0.0047149404367155525, u'other': 0.019678143204816437, u'china': 0.0021060870489451717, u'military': 0.0018165261904365424, u'terrorism': 0.0026741646193081453, u'economy': 0.94543590451773629, u'health': 0.0019565581434796719, u'women': 0.0083892516344994152}"
Telethon that Jerry Lewis memorably ran pulls the plug,fox,"			
			 
						
						
							Sept. 2, 1990. Jerry Lewis makes his opening remarks at the 25th Anniversary of the Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon fundraiser in Los Angeles. (The Associated Press)
						
					
						
					The Muscular Dystrophy Association telethon is ending its annual Labor Day telethon, a television tradition for decades that has slowly disappeared from view since the sudden end of Jerry Lewis' role as host following the 2010 show. 
The telethon was a relic from a different age, a tuxedoed Lewis oozing show biz schmaltz and hosting stars from Frank Sinatra to Jennifer Lopez over 45 years, pushing through his exhaustion to sing ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" as a tote board rang up millions of dollars in donations. 
From 21 and a half hours in Lewis' final year, the show had been reduced to two hours the last two years on ABC. 
""It's not a 21-hour world anymore,"" said Steve Ford, MDA executive vice president, on Friday. 
With television time costly, the MDA's fundraising efforts will move primarily online, he said. The success of a viral event like ""The Ice Bucket Challenge"" proves this is a potent area for philanthropy, he said. 
""The real heroes have always been our families, and what we need to do is make sure that every dollar we raise is spent working for our families,"" he said.
 
The Labor Day tote board hit a record of $65 million in 2008, a figure Ford said reflected a full year's worth of fundraising activities capped off by the telethon. The MDA says the telethon itself has been responsible for more than $2 billion in giving. 
Lewis' abrupt exit, announced by the MDA a month before the 2011 telethon, was never fully explained. 
The 89-year-old comedian declined to comment on Friday's announcement, a spokeswoman said. 
His history with the charity goes back nearly to its beginning: the MDA was started in 1950 and, a year later, Lewis and his comic partner Dean Martin mentioned the charity on their NBC show. The two comics hosted a 1956 telethon before breaking up. Lewis began hosting it regularly in 1966, starting on a single television station in New York. 
The telethon was not without controversy; in the early 1990s it was picketed by a handful of disabled people who said people with the disease were being made objects of pity by Lewis to raise money. 
Yet his roster through the years represented a who's who of entertainment, including a post-Beatles John Lennon, Michael Jackson singing with and without his brothers, Liberace, Johnny Cash, Ray Charles and Celine Dion. Former Johnny Carson sidekick Ed McMahon filled the same role with Lewis on Labor Day for many years. 
In 1976, Sinatra engineered a reunion of Lewis with Martin, his estranged former partner. 
With years of telethon tapes, the MDA has the equivalent of years of show biz gold in its vaults. Ford said the MDA has been discussing with Lewis ways to release some of this archived material.",0.1692844345595971,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.013043324799216945, u'mexico': 0.031198379679017518, u'abortion': 0.020443445963071176, u'immigration': 0.02850605874092468, u'trade': 0.093980938378608964, u'campaign_finance': 0.06173758240556132, u'other': 0.56254310556950782, u'china': 0.030873156383389822, u'military': 0.016007730953199815, u'terrorism': 0.047657893362674009, u'economy': 0.03653804569973073, u'health': 0.038754810606297742, u'women': 0.0187155274587994}"
"Critic’s Notebook: Mark Morris’s Transcendent ‘L’Allegro,’ Captured on Film for PBS",nyt,"Since its premiere in 1988, Mark Morris’s full-length dance staging of Handel’s oratorio “L’Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato” has provoked two widespread reactions. One: How blessed we are to live in an age in which such miraculous beauty is made! Two: When will this be filmed and made available to a wider public?

That question now finds its answer in a new television film directed by Vincent Bataillon. Recorded last year at Madrid’s Teatro Real, it will be broadcast on Friday on PBS as part of “Great Performances,” with an introduction by Mikhail Baryshnikov and interviews with Mr. Morris, some members of the Mark Morris Dance Group and his music director, Colin Fowler.

More even than many other pieces by Mr. Morris, “L’Allegro” is a subtle philosophical essay, a study of contrasting ways of living and thinking. This dualism derives from Milton’s fraternal-twin poems about lives of action and contemplation, “L’Allegro” and “Il Penseroso.” (Handel’s librettist Charles Jennens arranged sections from Milton’s poems in alternation while adding his own Moderato, part of which — for the heavenly “As steals the morn” — is adapted from Shakespeare’s “The Tempest.”)

Often the choreography is remarkably pictorial: we see meadows, hills, a lark, a nightingale, a hunt, a shepherd shocking girls with his tales — a delectable wealth of recognizable incident. And equally often we switch into realms of pure form, as if addressing larger truths.

Mr. Bataillon’s camera does a felicitous job of catching the kinetic energy of Mr. Morris’s dances. A jumping entrance out of the wings, a spinning exit back into them, the sudden arrival of a full ensemble to flood the stage — these are just some of the moments that catch the breath here as it is caught in the theater. Some of the sensuous color spectrum of Adrienne Lobel’s sets and Christine van Loon’s costumes seem yet more wonderful in this recording.

Occasionally the camera goes aloft, as when it gives a full view of 24 dancers in four vertical rows, passing motifs along like messages. Elsewhere there are perfect though brief close-ups to highlight specific choreographic features, though in general the camera attends to the full stage picture.

The camera also feasts on this work’s occasional but haunting use of stillness — an exemplification of the Penseroso life of contemplation. In one group number, dancers fill the stage only to stand motionless, looking upward, their backs to us, like an informal church congregation, while the organ plays; the effect is ideal.

Twenty-six years after I gasped at my first sight of the walking Penseroso “Come, but keep thy wonted state” dance, I gasp again. Here the stage becomes four separate horizontal corridors — itself a magical effect. Each corridor is lighted differently; each is peopled by a seemingly endless stream of lone walking dancers, all in the same contemplative gait with downcast eyes. Amid this studious but monastic cityscape, one man and one woman stand and gaze at each other across the distance. Their eyes are locked on each other; their spreading arms and bobbing heels bespeak their new ecstasy. It’s as if they’re in different realms yet have fallen in love at first sight across the world.

On film this looks like cinematic trickery; it’s worth stressing that it really happens this way in live performance. So do many other marvels of invention; Mr. Morris’s larder of choreographic resources here seems endless.

I love, for example, his several uses of peripheral space. At the Allegro words “At my window, bid good morrow,” there are endearing glimpses of dancers peering briefly out of the wings as if to look for the lark they hear. More startling, in the opening dance of Part 2, are the ways the supporting dancers briefly enter and exit, traveling in arcs parallel to those of the dancer whose solo is the central main action here. They’re like tantalizing glimpses of parallel universes.

Jane Glover, with long experience in this Morris work, conducts with pulse, grace and line. The communicative clarity of the tenor James Gilchrist is striking. My chief reservation is that the diction of the two sopranos, Sarah-Jane Brandon and Elizabeth Watts, is not lucid enough; even so, their phrasing registers keenly.

There are same-sex and gender-reversal effects here that are the more wonderful for being understated. It’s scarcely a big deal that the scene that shows us a male Orpheus then gives him a male Eurydice; if you look carefully, you can even see a man lie down (as women have earlier on) and mime giving birth. I speak of “L’Allegro” with the same wonder that I felt when it was new, but this is also an often-funny and naughty piece. The rush of energy on which it closes reminds us that it is among the most life-affirming dance works ever made. Yes, our age is indeed blessed by such a composition.",0.013270443819525517,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.0049262038821579852, u'mexico': 0.0016684824984974425, u'abortion': 0.0043712390641763091, u'immigration': 0.002963284485100838, u'trade': 0.0070397663131000869, u'campaign_finance': 0.0033574931711910505, u'other': 0.74546332297750384, u'china': 0.0030824045754042836, u'military': 0.0025422768901537263, u'terrorism': 0.0065687139540323266, u'economy': 0.0014851137890117823, u'health': 0.0042916110295107722, u'women': 0.21224008737015976}"
DealBook: Hedge Fund-Backed Investor Puts Himself Up for G.M. Board,nyt,"Updated, 9:28 p.m. | Six years ago, Harry J. Wilson was enlisted by the Obama administration to help overhaul General Motors as part of a taxpayer-financed bailout.

Now, the former Goldman Sachs financier is trying to change the automaker once again — but this time with four big hedge funds on his side.

On Tuesday, Mr. Wilson put himself up for a seat on the G.M. board, as part of a campaign to persuade the company to buy back at least $8 billion worth of shares by next year.

The potential board fight is the latest corporate challenge for General Motors as it wrestles with the biggest safety crisis in its history and the recall of tens of millions of vehicles.

While the company has regained financial strength since the bailout and its return to the public markets in 2010, some investors have complained that it has done little for them.

Backing Mr. Wilson are big hedge fund magnates like David A. Tepper of Appaloosa Management and J. Kyle Bass of Hayman Capital Management. (Mr. Bass has been calling for big share buybacks for months.) All told, the investors own a stake of roughly 2 percent. As part of their arrangement, Mr. Wilson will receive a share of the profits that the investment generates.

Shares of General Motors rose more than 4 percent on Tuesday.

In an interview, Mr. Wilson conceded that the company had made huge strides since the bailout, particularly in changing a corporate culture he derided as broken. But under a succession of leaders, including its current chief executive, Mary T. Barra, the automaker has presided under a largely moribund stock price.

“There’s been growing frustration that’s been coming together,” he said. “We want to help the company go from where it is today to where it should be, a world-class performer on any metric.”

Since its bailout, General Motors has steered a conservative financial course. It has argued that it needs what it has called a “fortress balance sheet,” one that includes $25 billion in cash on hand.

Some of that money has gone toward the costs of the safety crisis. For more than a decade, company officials knew about but failed to fix defective ignition switches in millions of small cars. To allay fears that it was neglecting safety issues, General Motors issued more than 80 recalls last year covering nearly 30 million vehicles. It spent about $3 billion in 2014 to compensate accident victims, fix recalled cars and trucks, and reorganize its vast engineering operations and safety teams.

The recalls took a heavy toll on G.M.’s bottom line. Last week, the company reported net income for 2014 of $2.8 billion, a 31 percent drop from $3.99 billion the previous year.

In a statement, General Motors said that it would evaluate both of Mr. Wilson’s proposals. It added that it had recently announced plans to raise its quarterly stock dividend by 20 percent and would announce other plans to pay out to investors in due course.

But Mr. Wilson, 43, argued that the company had been too conservative in the handling of its finances and had failed to improve on other financial metrics, like operating margin. He said that he had publicly warned G.M. about the potential of an activist investor emerging as early as the fall of 2013.

Last month, he approached Ms. Barra at an investor conference, telling her that he had ideas to share. When they met last week, he laid out several initiatives aimed at bolstering operating performance and paying out more to shareholders. He also disclosed that he wanted a seat on the board to serve as a representative for shareholders.

Though G.M.’s statement suggested that Mr. Wilson’s move was sudden, he contended in an interview that he had tried three times to extend the deadline for nominating directors beyond Monday night at midnight.

An industry analyst said in a research note that the company might decide on a smaller buyback than Mr. Wilson and his investment group have requested.

“G.M. still needs to work through recall litigation and the U.A.W. negotiations,”  Brian Johnson, an analyst with Barclays, said, referring to the United Automobile Workers union. “However, we believe there is a fair likelihood that G.M. enacts some sort of share buyback (perhaps $4 billion) to show investors that it is enhancing shareholder value.”

In some ways, Mr. Wilson’s move harkens back to the beginnings of his career as a financier. Before he joined the Obama administration’s auto task force, he had worked at Goldman Sachs and the hedge fund Silver Point Capital, where he became an expert on investing in distressed companies.

During his time in Washington, he served as the team leader for G.M., supervising the overhaul of the automaker. It was Mr. Wilson who helped devise the administration’s tactic to lend the company the billions of dollars it needed to stay afloat during bankruptcy in exchange for a stake that would be sold down over time. (The government sold the last of its shares at the end of 2013.)

Since leaving the task force, Mr. Wilson ran, unsuccessfully, as the Republican candidate for New York State comptroller before setting up the Maeva Group, a corporate turnaround consulting firm. That latest phase of his career has put him in touch with several notable activist investors, including the billionaire Daniel S. Loeb, who had him installed on the boards of Yahoo and the art auction house Sotheby’s.

Even six years after the auto bailouts, however, Mr. Wilson has remained bothered by how slowly G.M. has been recovering, according to people close to him.

“Harry’s a perfectionist,” said one acquaintance. “It was frustrating him that G.M. wasn’t getting A-pluses across the board.”

Mr. Wilson himself did not shy away from the classroom metaphor in discussing how much room G.M. has to improve.

“They went from a big red ‘F’ before the crisis to much better performance, but they’re not at the ‘A’ they’re capable of,” he said. “I think Mary has the potential to get them there, but I think she needs some help.”",0.090899990229086777,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.0090183825004778399, u'mexico': 0.0024835101777827928, u'abortion': 0.0036808321749739162, u'immigration': 0.011828111250836168, u'trade': 0.0042171260850718496, u'campaign_finance': 0.011946595810538909, u'other': 0.085281495133198867, u'china': 0.02568313370862688, u'military': 0.0062377970129943268, u'terrorism': 0.004820525912583651, u'economy': 0.82258138251934898, u'health': 0.0042652730692046793, u'women': 0.0079558346443612208}"
Contributing Op-Ed Writer: Layers of Loss in New York City,nyt,"WE were sitting in an East Village dive bar, my friend Tim and I, talking about the things we’d lost. This was seven years ago. As it turned out, it was a long list.

Tim’s chief lament was for a purple crayon he’d accidentally dropped into a toilet when he was 6. It fell from his hands as the waters swirled and just like that was lost forever. It made perfect sense to me that my friend, a cartoonist, would miss a crayon. “What about you?” he said.

People ask transgender women like me this question, or some variation on it, more frequently than you’d think, often as a veiled way of asking, “Is there anything that you miss about your earlier life as a ‘man?’ ” Larry King asked me this question once as the cameras rolled, hoping that I would come up with some grotesque nostalgia, perhaps, for writing my name in the snow. But instead I just said, “Pockets.”

“My clothes used to have pockets,” I explained. “Now they don’t.”

Of course, there are plenty of people and things I wish I could see one last time: friends who died young; my mother and father; people I once loved whom I now no longer even know how to find. And those I never met whom I miss all the same: Robin Williams. Jerry Garcia. S. J. Perelman.

I miss listening to big band music on WNEW-AM. I miss reading Russell Baker’s column in The New York Times Magazine. I miss watching the television show “Lost” with my sons.

But the thing I told my friend that I missed that night was in fact something I’d never owned in the first place. “Rock’em Sock’em Robots,” I said. “When I was a child I never had them, and now they don’t make them anymore.”

Rock’em Sock’em Robots was a child’s toy from the 1960s, in which two plastic robots battled in a plastic ring. You operated their punching arms with a pair of controllers. If you landed a punch against your opponent’s robot’s face, his head would pop up on a spring. This was called “knocking his block off.” After knocking someone’s block off, you could restore the robot by pressing down on the head. In the commercials, the announcer said, cheerfully, “But you can press it back on again!”

I know, I know: It wasn’t exactly an Easy-Bake Oven. But I never had one of those, either.

That’s when Tim put down his Belgian ale and said to me, “You know, Jenny, there’s a store less than a block away that has Rock’em Sock’em Robots in the window.”

Our eyes met. A moment later we were running down Second Avenue toward the store called Love Saves the Day, a classic Village boutique that sold a wide variety of kitsch. Pointing to the Rock’em Sock’em Robots on display, I pulled out my American Express and said to the clerk, “Yes, my good man. We’ll have those robots please.”

Less than five minutes after I had told my friend that I’d never, ever have Rock’em Sock’em Robots, I was sitting at a bar knocking his block off. A crowd formed. People asked, first shyly, and then with undisguised joy, if they could have a turn. Rounds for the house were purchased.

That store, Love Saves the Day, was at the corner of Second Avenue and East 7th Street and closed back in 2009. It was in one of the three buildings that were destroyed in a gas explosion on March 29 that took the lives of two men and transformed the familiar corner into a scene of devastation.

People who lived and worked there are going to be spending a long time rebuilding their lives. My own connection with this tragedy is by every measure trivial. But it made me think about the ways in which New Yorkers are used to the things they love morphing over time; places change hands so swiftly here that nostalgia becomes self-defeating. If you’re not careful, you wind up able to see only the things that were, instead of the things that are, or will be.

But there’s no way around this fact: The place that once gave me hope that the things we lose can be restored to us is itself now lost.

I left the bar that night, robots in hand, and got on board the No. 6 train. A man wearing a tie and a tired expression sat down next to me. Without saying a word I spun to my right and nodded to him. He grasped the controllers. A moment later our robots were rocking and socking.

The stranger’s robot delivered an impressive punch, and the head of my fighter bounced up on its spring.

“Hey, I knocked your block off,” he said.

“I know,” I said, reassuringly. “But you can put it back again.”",0.018450076498823076,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.0031910026143824794, u'mexico': 0.011711421461027714, u'abortion': 0.013930935168872467, u'immigration': 0.010533538608062776, u'trade': 0.0048039989423367922, u'campaign_finance': 0.0042112576388891121, u'other': 0.69762417981923119, u'china': 0.0094150840359410893, u'military': 0.0066613302247899332, u'terrorism': 0.022072845173302061, u'economy': 0.0051385450163629704, u'health': 0.0092180216443106585, u'women': 0.20148783965249065}"
Bolt and Farah under spotlight in London,reuters,"LONDON Usain Bolt's suspect hip and Mo Farah's status as the golden boy of British athletics will come under scrutiny when both return to London's Olympic stadium this weekend.
The two-day so-called Anniversary Games, which incorporates a Diamond League meeting, features a glittering cast but six-times Olympic gold medalist Bolt is the undoubted top of the bill when he goes in the 100m on Friday.
The world record holder has looked a long way from the unbeatable sprinter who elevated track and field above the murky waters of its dope-stained past with stunning 100m/200m doubles at the Beijing and London Olympics.
This season though he is yet to dip below 10 seconds in the 100 and missed the recent Jamaican trials with a troublesome hip injury.
Bolt's fitness, and speed will be closely monitored a month before the world championships in Beijing when American Justin Gatlin, on fire this season, will be itching to have a crack at him.
There will be no showdown in London, however, and a fit Bolt looks a strong favorite ahead of European record holder Jimmy Vicaut of France, who ran 9.86 seconds in Paris three weeks ago, and American Mike Rodgers.
With twice-banned Gatlin causing a stir in the athletics world, a sharp 100m by Bolt would be a timely PR boost for a sport still mired in suspicion -- most recently allegations surrounding Alberto Salazar, coach to Britain's 5,000m and 10,000m Olympic champion Farah.
Farah has pledged his allegiance to Salazar, who is being investigated by both USADA and UK Anti-Doping over allegations that he has violated doping rules and will run the 3,000m, also on Friday.
Although there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Farah, it has been an uncomfortable few months for the Briton who, after his extraordinary feats on the those balmy nights in London three years ago, could apparently do no wrong.
""It's not a nice thing but at the same time, I answered everything that I can and it's not in my control, it's nothing to do with me,"" Farah told ITV this week.
""At the minute I just want to carry on running, enjoy what I do. I'm very excited to be able to go back in that stadium and compete in front of my home crowd,"" added the 32-year-old.
Olympic heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis-Hill, another with golden Olympic memories, will be guaranteed a warm welcome as she competes in a variety of events, beginning on Friday with the 100m hurdles where she takes on 2008 Olympic champion Dawn Harper-Nelson.
Kenya's Olympic champion David Rudisha, who broke the world record en route to 800, gold in the Stadium three years ago, lines up over the same distance while Britain's Greg Rutherford, who joined Farah and Ennis-Hill by winning gold on that ""super Saturday"" will face a tough rival in American Marquis Dendy in the long jump.

This Recycled Dress Is Made Of 180 Plastic Bottles (PHOTOS),huffpo,"The project was born in the summer of 2014. Rosa Montesa, an industrial designer from Valencia, Spain, in her 50s, proposed an idea to her mother: Why not work together to make a dress for the traditional Valencian Fallas celebration? She wanted to collaborate to make something, but not in a conventional way. She wanted to do it her way, and her way was recycling.
Montes spent the following year working on her website, Reciclado Creativo (Creative Recycling), and looking for a way to breathe new life into the materials she was taking from her own trash and that of those around her. Plastic bottles, coffee capsules, potato chip bags, sunflower seed shells … all received new life in her hands. First she made a necklace, then a lamp and later flowers. 
Eventually, Montesa decided to focus all her creativity on one project: a dress, which took her only 10 days to create. However, she required far more time for collecting the materials, and designing the dress posed more than a few head-scratching obstacles. Her 17-year-old daughter served as a model, and Montesa's mother acted as an integral collaborative partner. 
“She was always making fallera clothing for me and the family, and I knew that she’d help me do this while respecting the tradition,” Montesa explained in a phone conversation with The Huffington Post Spain. The Valencian Fallas festival traditionally requires elaborate costumes for both men and women.
Deciding how to create a base for the dress was their greatest challenge. “It was the biggest problem we had. I thought of sculpting a base out of containers and plastic bottles, but my mom told me that it had to be over a fabric,"" Montesa explained. ""I said that it didn’t feel right, and that everything had to be recycled material. So we decided to use a glasilla -- the fabric used in haute couture to make the dresses around the models, which is then discarded,” she explained. 
With that issue solved, the creative pair had the task all sewn up (pun intended).
The fabric of the skirt was filled with flowers made of plastic bottles and containers. There are a total of 180 bottles: 70 plastic water containers, 25 blue water bottles, 25 pink water bottles and 60 green sparkling-water cans. 
“I used the bases of the bottles, and with the upper part I decorated the bodice,” Montesa explained. Cutting the bottle into small pieces produced the fragments that form the image on the body of the dress. They were inspired, she says, by the flowers sold in front of North Station in Valencia.
The same plastic fragments served to give color to a pair of shoes that Montesa’s sister-in-law had given her and that, she confesses, had been abandoned in the closet for more than two years.

The glittering pieces on the shawl and apron, which could easily be mistaken for sequins, were made from the insides of potato chip bags. This time she only needed six: “I used baked chips, because they have less oil.” The lace is from a blouse that Montesa’s mother had at home, “adhering to the condition of using recycled material.”

Having done all this, Montesa’s only remaining obstacle lay in making the accessories. The earrings (arracabades), brooch (joja), necklace, chignon needles (agulles) and combs, traditional elements of the festival costume, were all made entirely of recycled material. “The skewers are knitting needles from my mother. They’re made of steel, which is no longer used because it’s heavier -- now they prefer aluminum,” she explained. The flowers that completed the needles were made entirely from coffee capsules. Montesa used a total of 30 capsules to bejewel the chignon needles.
The flowers decorating the earrings and the necklace were also made of this material, and were topped with sunflower shells painted with nail polish, creating an iridescent effect. The same coating was applied to an object containing about twenty peanuts, which was originally going to form a necklace, but, failing to convince its creator, ultimately became a bracelet.

The dress arrived at its final stages toward the end of January, after several delays. “I’ve had interruptions because of lack of material, lack of space to work, and then the holidays,” explained Montesa, for whom even unforeseen obstacles posed no deterrence: “But it’s well known, there’s no misery in a labor of love.”
Montesa said that she enjoyed making the dress very much, and will enjoy it even more when she sees it out in Valencia. “The daughter of a friend is going to wear it to the Falla in my neighborhood.""",0.025491457746744758,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.024314888050587291, u'mexico': 0.031660640122362339, u'abortion': 0.02812831753135361, u'immigration': 0.019314547551660746, u'trade': 0.0071507527544914197, u'campaign_finance': 0.014816961061310776, u'other': 0.18694549030915211, u'china': 0.018180127933273164, u'military': 0.012639428315704464, u'terrorism': 0.033733854943270775, u'economy': 0.0036738705187304519, u'health': 0.021775689175349826, u'women': 0.59766543173275299}"
"Gasoline, eggs lift U.S. consumer prices in June",reuters,"WASHINGTON, July 17 U.S. consumer prices rose for a fifth straight month in June as the cost of gasoline and a range of other goods increased, further signs of firming inflation that strengthen the case for an interest rate hike this year. 
The Labor Department said on Friday its Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent last month after increasing 0.4 percent in May. Last month's increase pushed the year-on-year CPI rate into positive territory for the first time since December.
The energy-driven disinflationary trend appears to have run its course. A report on Wednesday showed producer prices rose in
June for a second straight month. Firming price pressures, together with a tightening labor market and strengthening housing could give the Fed confidence that inflation will gradually rise toward its 2 percent target.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen this week affirmed the U.S. central bank was keen to start tightening monetary policy later this year after keeping its short-term interest rate near zero for more than six years.
In the 12 months through June, the CPI edged up 0.1 percent after being unchanged in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI rising 0.3 percent from May and gaining 0.1 percent from a year ago. 
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, increased 0.2 percent last month after rising 0.1 percent in May. Underlying inflation pressures have been tamed by a strong dollar. 
In the 12 months through June, the core CPI rose 1.8 percent after May's 1.7 percent increase.
Last month, gasoline prices rose 3.4 percent after jumping 10.4 percent in May. Food prices rose 0.3 percent, the largest increase since September 2014, as an outbreak of bird flu in some parts of the country causes a shortage of eggs. Egg prices surged 18.3 percent, the biggest gain since August 1973. 
Elsewhere, the index for rent increased 0.4 percent, the largest rise since August 2013. With the residential vacancy rate near a 22-year low as a firming labor market boosts household formation, shelter costs are likely to continue rising.
There were also increases in the cost of recreation, new motor vehicles, tobacco, airline fares and personal care. These offset declines in the prices for apparel, medical care, used cars and trucks and household furnishings.

GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba –  A military judge is trying to decide whether the attempt to prosecute five prisoners at Guantanamo Bay for the Sept. 11 attacks can resume after stalling for nearly a year because of the revelation of an apparent FBI investigation into members of one of the defense teams. The five defendants are expected back in court Monday for a hearing focused on whether more time is required to explore any potential conflict of interest arising from the questioning by FBI agents of defense team support staff.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT The judge, Army Col. James Pohl, is considering whether to sever one of the prisoners, Ramzi Binalshibh, from the case to get it moving again toward an eventual death-penalty trial at the U.S. Navy base in Cuba. Prosecutors want to keep all five together, arguing that separating the defendants would result in even more delays and cause further pain to relatives of those killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack. ""These are not circumstances that call for severance,"" the chief prosecutor, Army Brig. Gen. Mark Martins, told reporters at the base. Keeping the case intact requires a finding by the judge that the FBI investigation did not create a conflict of interest for the defense attorneys for Binalshibh, whose team was the target of an investigation, the nature and scope of which have not been publicly disclosed. James Harrington, the lead civilian attorney for Binalshibh, said the questioning of his staff has undermined the attorney-client relationship, crucial in a death penalty case. ""Obviously, it's a major disruption in this case and it's also been a horrible disruption within my team,"" Harrington said on the eve of the hearing. Lawyers say the fact that they or members of their staff could be under criminal investigation creates a potential conflict because it raises the possibility they could favor their own interest over that of their clients, easing up on their defense efforts. Earlier, the judge appointed another lawyer to advise Binalshibh on the potential legal implications of the investigation, including whether Harrington can continue to represent him. The revelation that FBI agents had members of Harrington's defense team, as well as staff on other teams, under investigation emerged in April, prompting an immediate halt to the fitful progress toward resolving pretrial issues in what officials have called the most expensive and complex criminal trial in U.S. history. The five, who include the self-proclaimed mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, were arraigned in May 2012 on charges that include terrorism, hijacking and nearly 3,000 counts of murder for their alleged roles planning and providing logistical support for the attack. Defense Attorney James Connell told reporters that the trial is a long way off.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker officially enters 2016 presidential race,cnn," (CNN)Scott Walker, the political phenomenon who rose to national fame by taking on unions in one of the most blue-collar states, tweeted Monday morning confirming that he'll seek the Republican nomination for president, just hours ahead of his in-person announcement.
""I'm in. I'm running for president because Americans deserve a leader who will fight and win for them,"" Walker tweeted, signing the message with his initials ""SW,"" indicating it was written by him and not his staff. 
Walker also put out a video Monday morning, outlining his political history and why he thinks he would be the best candidate to be president. 
His Monday afternoon event in Waukesha, Wisconsin, will be a remarkable political milestone for the 47-year-old second-term governor, who vaulted from the obscurity of the Milwaukee County executive to the top tier of a presidential campaign, thanks in large part to a historic gubernatorial recall effort that nearly ended his career in 2012.
In his first foray into a presidential campaign, Walker -- one of the most recognizable and polarizing governors in the country -- has emerged as a potentially formidable opponent to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Recent polling has shown Walker as one of the major contenders in the presidential race, competing closely with Bush and other prominent Republicans both nationally and in the early presidential states.
Although Walker waited to launch his White House bid until the end of the legislative session in his home state, he has been laying down the groundwork for a national campaign for months. The union-busting governor has been courting donors, traveling overseas and boosting his national profile by publicly tussling with President Barack Obama on issues like the nuclear deal with Iran.
The next several months will be a critical test for Walker. After his campaign announcement, the governor will crisscross the country, presenting himself to voters in Nevada, South Carolina, New Hampshire and Iowa.

A few months after taking office in 2011, Walker signed a measure to curb collective bargaining rights for most public employees in the state, framing it as an effort to take on the ""big government special interests"" and give power back to Wisconsin taxpayers.
The move triggered fierce backlash from labor unions and their progressive allies, sparking massive protests at the state capitol in Madison.
Conservatives in Wisconsin and around the country came to Walker's defense, helping the governor withstand a recall effort in 2012. Walker went on to win re-election by six points in 2014, his third statewide victory in four years.
It is that recall experience, more than any other, that has helped lay the groundwork for Walker's presidential bid. At the time, Walker said his recall victory proved that ""voters really do want leaders who stand up and make the tough decisions.""
That is a message that Walker has promoted in recent months while exploring a presidential campaign, calling on the Republican Party to look for ""fresh leadership"" and someone with ""big, bold ideas and the courage to act on it.""
Veteran GOP strategist Kevin Madden, who served as a senior adviser to Mitt Romney's presidential campaign in 2012, says Walker's union-busting efforts helped him to burnish his conservative credentials by demonstrating his ability to taken on ""the national [Democratic]establishment"" and beat them on three consecutive occasions.

Beyond his record as governor, Walker's Midwestern roots will be an invaluable asset in the GOP nominating fight -- Wisconsin voters haven't picked a Republican for president since 1984.
Walker is poised to make the case that his candidacy could put other Great Lakes states on the electoral map that have been out of reach for Republicans in recent cycles, including Michigan and Pennsylvania, which haven't voted for the GOP nominee since 1988.
""The path for a Republican to win the presidency comes through the Midwest,"" Walker told a crowd in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in April. ""It comes from Iowa and Wisconsin and Michigan and Ohio and we're even going to include Pennsylvania because they're part of the Big Ten,"" he added.
Walker also has a personal narrative that could enable him to appeal to low-income voters, a group Republicans lost overwhelmingly in 2008 and 2012, with the struggles in the latter campaign fueled in part by Mitt Romney's ""47 percent"" comments.
Walker is the son of a Baptist minister and an Eagle Scout, who attended Marquette University for three years before dropping out to take a job with the Red Cross. Walker has taken to citing his humble beginnings during recent appearances, setting up a contrast between his background and that of one of his key 2016 rivals -- Bush.
""I realize unlike some out there I didn't inherit fame or fortune from my family,"" Walker said during a speech to a Christian broadcasters convention in February. ""I got a bunch of things that were a whole lot better than that. I got from my parents and my grandparents the belief that if you work hard and you play by the rules, here in America you can do and be anything you want.""

Walker  has already experienced challenges that come with being thrust into the national spotlight in the months leading up to his campaign's official launch.
Unlike some of his peers in the Republican field like Bush, who lived through the White House campaigns of his father and brother, or former 2012 presidential candidates Rick Perry or Rick Santorum, Walker is facing head-on for the first time the reality of just how much scrutiny comes with a presidential campaign.
And it's shown.
Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Walker raised eyebrows when he seemed to compare the task of fighting ISIS to taking on thousands of protesters in his state.
Earlier
 that month, a trip to London resulted in a slew of unflattering headlines when Walker, despite his best efforts to avoid making news during the overseas trip, punted on a question about the theory of evolution.
In March, several news outlets, including CNN, reported that at a private gathering in New Hampshire, Walker had endorsed a pathway for citizenship for undocumented immigrants. This would have marked a notable reversal for Walker who had staked out a more conservative position on the divisive issue, and pundits were quick to suggest that the governor had flip flopped.
Joe McQuaid, publisher of the New Hampshire Union Leader whose office is a must-visit early state stop for presidential candidates, remarked at the time that the controversy surrounding Walker's reported immigration remarks showed that this is the governor's ""first time outside of Wisconsin.""
""It is a guy in his first presidential campaign trying to get himself grounded and see where he needs to be nuanced,"" McQuaid said in a recent interview. ""He hasn't dealt with these issues on a regular basis.""

Walker could give Bush a run for his money.
Over the past few months, the governor has made aggressive overtures to wealthy financiers and prominent Republican donors, presenting himself as a conservative alternative to others in the field.
Bush's extensive fundraising network, founded on decades-old family friendships, will be difficult to compete with. But in the earliest stages of the campaign, Walker's political action committee, Our American Revival, has boasted impressive commitments and donations from prominent donors and bundlers in fundraising epicenters like New York, California and Texas.
And it's not just deep-pocketed donors that Walker is banking on.
The recall fight that made the governor a national figure could be a boon for his fundraising efforts among small-dollar donors.
Walker raised more than $30 million for the recall campaign, which helped him grow his donor to list to some 300,000 supporters. Walker and his supporters say they're eager to win over a new generation of donors.
""Our donor is not the tried and true Republican donor in New York City that's given to everybody since Reagan, Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of the investment firm SkyBridge Capital who is raising money for Walker, told CNN earlier this month. ""We don't have the mercenary donor that's paying for past political favors.""

"Luxury Public Golf Course, Run by Trump, Opens on Former Bronx Dump",nyt,"After decades of debate, false starts and cost overruns, luxury golf finally arrived in the Bronx on Wednesday, as the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point opened in the shadow of the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge.

Forty years ago, as swaths of the South Bronx blazed, such a news bulletin might have been an April Fool’s joke. But while the public links made its debut on April 1, the 18-hole course marked a milestone for urban fans of golf and the end of a long struggle for the city’s Department of Parks and Recreation.

The parks department already oversees more than a dozen other municipal golf courses, including four in the Bronx. But the new golf course in Ferry Point Park, in the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx, the first built in the city since 1964, represents a departure, elevating municipal golf to a new level of sophistication — and expense.

Greens fees are about three times what they are at the city’s other courses; a city resident will pay $169 to play on weekends, while a nonresident will pay $215. Electric golf carts are outfitted with GPS, allowing golfers, among other things, to order a chicken sandwich and a Bronx Pale Ale while they are playing.

Perhaps paradoxically for such a high-end experience, the 7,400-yard golf course, which received a push forward when the company led by Donald J. Trump won the bid to run it, is built on a former landfill that closed in 1963. Scores of vents jut up from the links to release methane gas. The course is framed by housing projects and other modest buildings on one side.

But out on the links, golfers are immersed in another world. While the greens were still dormant and therefore lacking in color, they nonetheless present a hilly tableau, offering vistas of the Manhattan skyline and the glittering East River around every corner.

On Wednesday, despite temperatures in the 40s, more than 30 foursomes were out on the links, which were designed by Jack Nicklaus and John Sanford in the Scottish style — without trees. (The landscape was in part dictated by the limitations of a former landfill.)

Among the players was the Bronx borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr., who insisted that his score was off the record. “I’m out here on Day 1, letting people know that we have a world-class, P.G.A. links-style golf course right here in the boogie-down Bronx,” he said right before making a crisp drive that elicited whistles from onlookers.

“That was on the record!” he shouted. Half of the course’s 100 employees are Bronx residents.

Higher greens fees do not seem to have scared off potential players. In mid-March, the course started taking reservations for April. “Within 15 minutes all the prime time slots had sold out for every weekend,” said Ronald C. Lieberman, an executive vice president of the Trump Organization.

The development of the course was plagued by problems, including the discovery of toxic substances in the soil. A deal with a developer, Ferry Point Partners, to build the course fell apart in 2006.

The city then built the 192-acre course itself, using city contractors, but costs eventually ballooned to $127 million, and critics questioned the need for an upscale golf course in a borough where a third of residents live below the poverty line. The Trump Organization was chosen in 2010 to operate the course after several earlier attempts to find an operator failed.

The company will soon start construction on a permanent, $10 million clubhouse, which it will finance. In the meantime, a temporary clubhouse has a pro shop and an outdoor grill under a yellow-and-white striped awning.

Both Mr. Trump and city officials hope to eventually lure a professional tournament. “Hopefully, we’ll have majors and P.G.A. championships and Ryder Cups,” Mr. Trump said in a phone interview.

There will be an official opening ceremony in May, with Mr. Trump, Mr. Nicklaus, the parks commissioner, Mitchell J. Silver, and others. By then the grass should be bright green. In keeping with the recent weather, opening day was so chilly that play was delayed by two hours.

“The first person teed off at 10,” said Anthony D. Macari, director of concession architecture and development for the parks department. “It was a little late because of the frost.”",0.96458728002032657,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.026822252851998154, u'mexico': 0.085848426082800217, u'abortion': 0.012731857046362371, u'immigration': 0.4139399103366791, u'trade': 0.078245365929452138, u'campaign_finance': 0.072565193381782453, u'other': 0.15028379185216992, u'china': 0.016253393946928592, u'military': 0.013643837806122189, u'terrorism': 0.0180286291112682, u'economy': 0.078574973199910525, u'health': 0.024178001321799852, u'women': 0.0088843671327264711}"
A Plan to Transform the US Immigrant Detention System,huffpo,"Executive Director, Center for Migration Studies
The U.S. immigrant detention system serves two legitimate purposes, to ensure that persons in removal proceedings appear for their hearings and (if so ordered) can be removed and, in rare cases, to protect the public.  An important report released on May 11 by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, Migration and Refugee Services and the Center for Migration Studies, argues that these goals can be accomplished more humanely and at far less cost through a national infrastructure of community-based, supervised release programs. This blog will outline seven of the report's main findings and corresponding recommendations.
First, the report argues that the status quo detention system should be dismantled and transformed because of the devastating human toll it exacts. As the report puts it, the system ""engenders despair, divides families, causes asylum-seekers to relive trauma, leads many to forfeit their legal claims and fails to treat immigrants with dignity and respect."" It also ""contributes to the misconception that immigrants are criminals.""  In response, the report calls for a substantial investment in alternative to detention (ATD) programs. It argues that each person in the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS's) custody should be placed in the least restrictive program or setting that will reasonably ensure their  court appearances.
Second, the report finds that while the Obama administration's detention reform initiative has had notable successes, at the end of the day the administrative reform initiative will not and cannot result, as promised, in a truly civil immigration detention system. Since its inception in 2009, annual detention numbers have risen. In addition, detainees overwhelmingly remain and will remain in prison-like facilities, subject to standards of confinement more appropriate for criminal defendants. If anything, the trend has been toward greater detention in recent months, with the growth of massive family detention centers. In response, the report recommends that:
Third, immigrant detainees are not criminals. None are serving criminal time, and most lack any criminal record at all. Of the 440,000 persons removed in 2013, about 45 percent were categorized by DHS as ""criminal aliens,"" but nearly one-third of those who were deported as ""criminal aliens"" had been convicted of an immigration-related offense. In addition, 44 percent of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees with criminal histories in 2013 were misdemeanants and others fell within an enforcement category that includes multiple misdemeanants. The report proposes a truly civil immigration detention system that reflects the non-criminal population in civil removal proceedings and DHS's legal authorities.
Fourth, the report finds that immigrant detainees are treated worse than criminals in many respects. For example, most are subject to mandatory detention and are not considered for release by a judge based on family or community ties or on whether they represent a flight risk or a danger. In contrast, virtually all criminal defendants receive custody hearings shortly after their detention and can be released subject to conditions designed to ensure their court appearances and to protect the public. Not all criminal defendants are released, of course, but those who are released, appear for their hearings at high rates. In response, the report proposes that Congress eliminate mandatory detention in all but national security and egregious criminal cases.
Fifth, the report finds that in the vast majority of cases, the purposes of immigrant detention can be achieved through more effective, humane, and less costly alternative to detention programs (ATD).  In 2014, ICE devoted only five percent of its detention budget to ATD programs. Yet on any given day, it held roughly 34,000 in detention and 22,000 in ATD programs. Thus, it dedicated less than five percent of its budget to roughly 40 percent of its case-load, counting both detainees and those in ATD programs. Moreover, ATD programs cost far less than detention and have been proven highly effective at ensuring court appearances. The report recommends that a substantial investment be made in community-based ATD programs. It also argues that ATD programs should be considered a form of custody and (thus) be open to people who are subject to mandatory detention.  
Sixth, the immigration court system is severely underfunded: It receives between one to two percent of the funding received by the immigration enforcement system. As a result, it faces average backlogs of around 18 months in removal cases. Moreover, almost 85 percent of those removed never see the inside of a court, but instead are subject to expedited removal, reinstatement of removal, administrative removal and other summary processes. The report proposes putting all removal cases under the jurisdiction of the immigration court system, expanding funding for this system by an order of magnitude, and providing government-funded legal counsel to indigent persons facing removal.
Seventh, for-profit corporations are administering larger and larger swaths of the detention system -- around 60 percent of detention beds by one estimate. While the detention system should substantially contract, for-profit prisons are aggressively seeking to maximize profits for their shareholders and to expand the market for their services.  As the report puts it: 
Custody determinations and imprisonment implicate liberty, human flourishing, the integrity of families, and contributory justice. States exist to promote these shared 'goods.' Yet the government has increasingly ceded responsibility for this function to private, for-profit entities whose primary loyalties run to their shareholders, not to the common good.
The report recommends that private corporations should have a more limited role in a transformed system.",0.71836252853964955,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.0014709046371137035, u'mexico': 0.00022872675099816367, u'abortion': 0.0021517875304794161, u'immigration': 0.93419810559740624, u'trade': 0.00091101314297303154, u'campaign_finance': 0.0021888352121276649, u'other': 0.015108141162786838, u'china': 0.0040947392325919674, u'military': 0.0025289804283974665, u'terrorism': 0.0049083843477236442, u'economy': 0.005354855048981224, u'health': 0.003032376552965075, u'women': 0.02382315035545552}"
5 Things About Hillary Clinton’s Debt-Free College Plan,wsj,"Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton on Monday announced a new plan aimed at easing what can be a crushing burden of student debt, the latest candidate to weigh in on the question of college affordability.
The centerpiece of her plan would allow for debt-free tuition at public schools, her attempt to address a source of anxiety for American families while advancing one of the left’s most sweeping new ideas.
Here are the five thing to know about her proposal:
The Big Idea: Debt-Free Tuition
The Clinton plan would have the federal government send large grants to states, which would then ensure students can pay tuition without taking out loans. There are strings attached: States would be required to increase their allocations to higher education, and schools would face new constraints on spending. Families would have to contribute what they can afford, according to a financial analysis, and students would be required to work 10 hours per week.
“Everyone is going to have to step up,” Mrs. Clinton said in Exeter, N.H., on Tuesday. “We can’t expect the federal government just to pay the bill for free. That’s not how America works.”
In addition, the lowest-income students would be newly allowed to use federal Pell grants to cover costs such as room and board. Other students could also have those expenses covered if they complete community service and take a public-service job.
Mrs. Clinton’s plan also adopts an Obama proposal for two years of free community college. Together, these ideas would cost about $200 billion over 10 years. The campaign also anticipates another $25 billion for historically black colleges and universities and other schools with modest endowments.
Refinancing Debt
The second plank of her plan would revamp the federal student-loan program to lower borrowing costs for both people who already hold student debt as well as current students at private schools. People could refinance at lower rates—or get lower rates in the first place—and cap payments at 10% of discretionary income. If any money is still owed after 20 years, it would be forgiven.
This portion of the program is estimated to cost $125 billion over 10 years. The entire plan would be paid for by capping deductions available to high-income taxpayers.
Who likes this?
The plan is aimed at addressing concerns of both middle class families worried about playing for college, and college students—also known as young voters—being crushed by heavy debt loads. Information about the plan will be a key element of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign on college campuses this fall.
It was immediately welcomed by activists who have pushed candidates to support “bold” proposals on college affordability.
Mrs. Clinton’s rivals for the Democratic nomination have their own plans for college affordability. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont proposes significant aid to the states to make college tuition-free, not just debt-free. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley has proposed a refinancing program and increased federal financial aid and says he would call on states to freeze tuition
Who Doesn’t Like It?
The plan was immediately attacked by Republicans as a tax hike and an unhealthy new dose of federal control.
“We don’t need more top-down Washington solutions that will raise the cost of college even further and shift the burden to hardworking taxpayers,” said former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is running for the GOP presidential nomination.
Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), another presidential contender, said on Fox News that the Clinton plan would spend money without fundamentally reforming the system.
“This is the thing they always do on the left. She has to figure out who to raise taxes on — so this is about making doing business in America even more expensive — raising taxes, and then taking all that money and pouring it into an outdated higher education system,” he said.
The Clinton campaign did not detail how its version of the tax change would work.
A Bipartisan Plan — Somewhere
While there are deep divides over the solution, there is a remarkable consensus on the problem. Student debt tripled over the past decade, reaching $1.2 trillion in the first quarter of 2015, New York Federal Reserve figures show. Education-related debt is now the highest form of household credit outside of mortgages, surpassing even credit card debt.
Republicans typically have focused on reining in the cost of a college education. Mr. Rubio has proposed allowing students to spend federal aid on programs outside of traditional colleges. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, another presidential candidate, proposed a two-year tuition freeze and a 13% cut to the University of Wisconsin system’s budget.
In another bipartisan signal, Mrs. Clinton also is calling for colleges to be held liable for aid when their students default on loans, an idea that has gained traction among members of both parties as a way to control costs.

Could Reggie Bush fill role of No. 3 wide receiver?,fox,"

There is a void to fill at the No. 3 wide receiver spot due to Jerome Simpson's six-game suspension. Quinton Patten, Bruce Ellington and DeAndrew White are expected to compete for the job, but is it possible offseason addition Reggie Bush fills that role?Head coach Jim Tomsula alluded earlier in the offseason that Bush is more than just a third-down back. The 49ers are expected to use Bush on special teams returning punts and kicks, and as backup to Carlos Hyde. In short, they'll likely use him everywhere. But over his nine-year career, Bush has totaled 466 receptions for 3,489 yards. Even in Detroit during a down season in 2014, Bush still caught 40 passes out of the backfield. It's something to monitor if the 49ers try to test this out in the preseason. (h/t bayareasportsguy.com)

The Agenda
Darren Samuelsohn and POLITICO Pro truth-squad the candidates.
Seven low-rung Republican presidential candidates. Ninety minutes. Talk about fertile ground for playing loose with the facts. 
From exaggerations over political records to ill-advised predictions over exactly what Hillary Clinton would do if she won the White House, the GOP undercard debating in Cleveland took some liberties in their attempts to stand out in a record-sized field.
Here’s POLITICO’s analysis of where the Republican field stretched the truth or just plain got it wrong:
WELFARE REFORM'S AUTHOR? 
Rick Santorum: “I ended a federal entitlement”
The former Pennsylvania senator got into fact check trouble back in 2012 when he made a similar claim in his last presidential run. So it's no surprise he entered hot water again by taking such a large degree of credit for the landmark 1996 law that reformed the welfare program. 
Santorum certainly had a large hand in the law President Bill Clinton signed just months before his reelection. He did serve as a floor manager for starters. But he certainly isn't alone either as the measure's champion. Clinton, for one, had promised in his own 1992 campaign to “end welfare as we know it.” And there's a good chance one of Santorum's 2016 rivals might question his claim too: Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
During that 1996 legislative battle, Kasich was the House bill's lead sponsor as chairman of the House Budget Committee. 
TESTING THE DEFINITION OF A VIABLE FETUS
George Pataki: “Doctors say that at 20 weeks” a fetus is viable
The former New York governor said that as president, he would sign a law to prohibit abortion at 20 weeks because that is the point at which a fetus is viable outside the womb. In fact, it's generally considered to be about 24 weeks — earlier than it was a generation ago. 
There is a Republican-led effort to prohibit abortion at 20 weeks, but it is based on the disputed argument that a fetus can feel pain at that gestational age.
FORGETTING HIS OWN CAP-AND-TRADE RECORD Lindsey Graham:“In her world, cap and trade would dominate. That will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.""
The South Carolina senator was swinging at the potential environmental policies of a future Hillary Clinton administration. But he's also experiencing a bit of policy amnesia here.
While Graham stands out among the giant GOP field for acknowledging man-made climate change, he's also trying to disown his own work with Democrats to pass a cap-and-trade bill during President Barack Obama's first term. Those talks stretched from the fall of 2009 into the summer of 2010 and ultimately came apart amid the BP oil spill. Graham abandoned his legislative partners John Kerry and Joe Lieberman just days before they were to release a major climate bill that would have capped carbon emissions on power plants, petroleum refiners and a range of other major industrial facilities. 
Graham gave a variety of excuses for the backtrack -- he blamed the oil spill, the complexity of the climate bill and he even fingered Harry Reid for forcing a separate immigration debate. But Graham's early efforts -- he co-authored an op-ed in The New York Times with Kerry headlined 'Yes we can (Pass Climate Change Legislation') — helped keep alive an Obama priority that many of his fellow Republicans would just have well preferred to be shelved. Once Graham walked away, the wheels really came apart and Reid pulled the plug about two months later.MAKING HILLARY'S DECISION ON KEYSTONE XL?
Graham: “She’s not going to build the Keystone pipeline. I will.”
The South Carolina senator also went after Clinton over the highly controversial energy project that's been stuck in policy limbo for pretty much all of the Obama administration.
In reality, Clinton has declined to take a position on TransCanada’s Keystone XL pipeline, which would send heavy crude from Alberta oil sands down to refineries in Texas, before Obama announces his decision because she had a role in reviewing the project as secretary of state. 
Clinton’s unwillingness to oppose the pipeline outright has actually fueled criticism from Democratic challengers, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and Sen. Bernie Sanders,both of who have long criticized of the project. 
DEBATABLE CONCLUSIONS ON MEDICAID EXPANSION 
Bobby Jindal: “Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health outcomes.”
It depends on which study you choose.
The Louisiana governor has been a huge foe of Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion and stated an oft-repeated argument voiced by critics -- access to the program doesn’t equate to better health for patients. But the evidence is mixed, with various studies coming to different conclusions about low-income people enrolled in the program.
One of the most widely publicized – and which would back up Jindal’s argument – was a study from Oregon. It found that people newly insured under the Medicaid program after Oregon expanded it in 2008 did not see significant improvement with respect to certain health conditions, including blood pressure and cholesterol. Research also showed that being on Medicaid increased the probability that patients would go to the emergency room to get care.
But other research has shown improvements among patients who are covered by the program. A recently released study focusing on Ohio found that diabetes patients enrolled in a particular Medicaid program received better care and had better outcomes compared to uninsured patients with diabetes. Costs also came in 29 percent lower than expected for the roughly 28,000 adult Medicaid enrollees that were studied.

Jeb Bush rolls out VA reforms in South Carolina,cnn,"Columbia, South Carolina  (CNN)It's no coincidence that Jeb Bush chose South Carolina as the backdrop for the rollout of his plan to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs: the state is seeped in military history, runs several active military bases, and houses a large population of retired veterans. 
CNN Interactive: 2016 election candidates 
After all, according to CNN exit polls from 2012, 21% of GOP primary voters identified as veterans.
The former Florida governor, who did not serve in the military himself but whose father and brother did, has a list of announcements expected Monday, starting with a veterans steering committee list that includes two Medal of Honor recipients here in South Carolina and ten more nation-wide. 
He will meet with these veterans today in a closed-door event in Charleston before he heads to Columbia for a town hall in the evening.
Of the endorsements, Bush said in a press release, ""As President, I'm committed to a safe America through a strong military, and having a strong military includes having policies that will keep our country's commitment to our veterans after active service.""
Bush also laid out his policy agenda for the overhaul of the Department of Veteran's Affairs in two pieces published this morning. 
In an op-ed for the National Review, he outlined several keys areas that need reform: ""empowering"" veterans to be able to choose their own doctors if options are limited within the VA system; recognize that female veterans require other health needs like gynecologists and doctors trained to treat breast cancer; and also the ability for VA doctors to fill prescriptions from outside doctors. 
He attacked the antiquated administrative practices of the department, citing a staggering $4.7 billion spent annually on information technology, while noting that there is not a ""simple app that allows veterans to make appointments, get medical advice, or refill a prescription from a smartphone or tablet."" He also did an interview with Military Times.
Like his campaign refrain of shrinking Washington D.C. politics, Bush wants to see the VA whittled down, saying that it's nearly impossible right now to fire a VA employee and overhead costs are sucking money away from actually caring for veterans.
As CNN previously reported, GOP candidates have been heavy on the pro-military and strong national security front here in South Carolina. Rand Paul spoke to a Concerned Veterans for America forum in Charleston a month ago and echoed some of Bush's same sentiments, especially regarding the ability for veterans to seek outside medical attention if the VA does not suffice. Last week in Anderson, Rick Perry, who himself served in the Air Force, asked the veterans in the room to raise their hands. Many shot up in the air.
South Carolina GOP Chairman Matt Moore describes the veterans' community in the state. ""Almost every other South Carolina voter has ties to the military, either through their work or through a veteran in their family. It's hard to understate how important the military community is in South Carolina."" When asked if any other candidates have secured the kind of veteran support and endorsements like Bush has in South Carolina, he noted, ""Not yet.""

Inevitable no more? Clinton march to party nod disrupted,fox,"







							mboxCreate('FoxNews-Politics-Autoplay-Videos-In-Articles');
						
What looked like a lock when she announced her candidacy four months ago has turned into a scramble for Hillary Clinton as her campaign faces not just challenges from declared candidates but speculation that recent stumbles could draw a party powerhouse like Vice President Biden into the race. 
Already, Clinton's campaign is going up this week with her first television ads in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Analysts suggest her team remembers well the lessons of 2008, when the Iowa caucuses saw the supposed front-runner come in third, and lose momentum after that. 
But unlike 2008, Clinton's biggest threat might be someone who hasn't yet declared. Speculation is mounting that Biden could enter in the fall. And the far left wing of the party appears to be voicing its dissatisfaction with the current front-runner -- with some backing Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who continues to draw big crowds, as the alternative and others still clamoring for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to run. 
Meanwhile, pundits have floated two former nominees from the past two decades, Al Gore and Secretary of State John Kerry, though they've shown little interest in running. The New York Times reported that even Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is being courted to run. 
""I think there's a little panic in the Clinton camp,"" former GOP New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu said Monday. 
A Clinton aide last week disputed the notion the campaign is nervous about Biden, and told Fox News there has not been any shift or new focus on him. 
But the calls for him to run are growing, and even the White House on Monday seemed to fuel the speculation -- as Clinton herself grapples with continuing questions over her use of personal email as secretary of state and other issues. 
In an interview with Fox News, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest acknowledged Biden has ""indicated that he's thinking about it."" Without saying what he thinks the VP's decision should or would be, Earnest heaped praise on the former senator who has been at Obama's side since the 2009 inauguration. 
""The president ultimately wants Democratic voters to decide who they believe the nominee should be,"" Earnest said, when asked what Obama would like to see. He then added: ""The president certainly believes that a spirited contest would be in the best interests of our party, and in the best interest of our country."" 
Asked for comment, Biden Press Secretary Kendra Barkoff issued a statement saying: ""As the Biden family continues to go through this difficult time, the Vice President is focused on his family and immersed in his work. In recent weeks, the Vice President has worked on the nuclear deal with Iran, traveled across the country to highlight the Administration's economic priorities, and more."" 
Fox News also has learned that two longtime Biden confidantes have been brought on board as VP advisers. 
Former senior adviser Mike Donilon has been brought on as a communications adviser, and former Delaware Sen. Ted Kaufman also is now an adviser; each has an office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, next to the White House. Kaufman has a long history with Biden, and was a top campaign adviser in 2008. Donilon worked on Obama's re-election campaign. 
While there are strong suggestions the two were brought on to specifically help Biden during the period of his son's illness and death, they nevertheless have a political history with the vice president. 
In another recent development, a top political aide to Biden's late son joined the super PAC working to recruit the elder Biden to run for president on Sunday. 
Josh Alcorn, a longtime Democratic operative, had been former Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden's top political and fundraising adviser before he died of brain cancer in May. Alcorn will now work with the Draft Biden super PAC. 
On Thursday, Fox News reported that Clinton aides were growing increasingly nervous about the possibility of a Biden run after the vice president's White House chief of staff was spotted having breakfast recently with major Democratic donor Louis Susman, a Clinton friend who served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom under Obama. 
The New York Times reported Sunday that Biden had discussed entering the race with friends, family, and Democratic donors. 
The Times also reported that before Beau Biden died, he tried to convince his father to run. The same Times report said Starbucks' Schultz is being urged to join the race by powerful friends. 
Democratic strategist Doug Schoen said at this stage, with new ads going on the airwaves, the Clinton team is ""fighting to keep her numbers up"" in early voting states in a bid to ""forestall"" the possibility of Biden entering. 
Former Democratic pollster Pat Caddell agreed that Clinton is trying to keep more challengers from jumping in the race. 
""Elizabeth Warren is one of them. John Kerry may be another,"" he said. As for Biden, he said, ""People think he's trustworthy, as opposed to her."" 
While Clinton continues to lead the current primary field handily, recent polls have shown her behind in head-to-head matchups with Republicans. And last week's Quinnipiac University poll showed that, by 57-37 percent, voters said she wasn't honest and trustworthy. 
Aside from Sanders, other declared Democratic candidates are: former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb; former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley; and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chaffee.

ISIS: The terrorist art market,fox,"

					The ideologically-driven destruction of priceless Iraqi artifacts by Islamic State may be a ruse that actually hides a much more cynical operation, in which fakes are smashed to pieces while real treasures are smuggled out of the country and sold on the black market to fund the terrorist army.   

ISIS shocked the world last month with the public destruction of hundreds of seemingly priceless works of art at the Mosul Museum in Iraq. What is not clear upon first watching the devastation is that the bearded men wielding hammers and drills against copies of centuries’ old statues are already responsible for the world’s largest art sales of culturally plundered antique objects.  ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT

However, it is imperative that the objects being imported into the legitimate first world art market appear authentic and are not too recognizable. There is nothing more difficult than selling an artwork stolen from a museum that is beloved by the world, as famous stolen paintings like Eduard Munch’s ‘The Scream’ have taught us in the past. 

The Times of London reports that ISIS has smuggled nearly 100 artifacts looted from the Syrian war into Britain over the past year. As the international art thieves of ISIS demonstrate, however, the mark of a good smuggler is one who possesses mediocre taste. A smuggler attempting to sell Rembrandt’s famous ‘Storm on the Sea of Galilee’, which was stolen in the famous Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum heist, would be quickly apprehended and the painting returned to its rightful place on the wall of the museum. They experience greater success selling unknown and lesser artworks which are easier to smuggle and unload.  

This is not the first time that stolen artifacts have flooded onto the market.  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the FBI launched a major investigation to find stolen Russian religious icons.

When viewing the senseless destruction by ISIS of priceless artifacts that have been preserved by the human race for nearly three millennia, outrage is a natural emotion. However it is important to keep in mind that all media released by this terrorist organization is engineered to promulgate an international brand of ISIS terrorist atrocity.  

The ISIS brand intends to cultivate the image of a barbarian horde seeking to establish a Caliphate that will eviscerate all Arabic culture and iconography predating Islam, whether the material they present is true or not. Barbarian and terror regimes of the past are no strangers to destroying ancient artifacts -- these practices were employed by such groups as the Taliban, Khmer Rouge, and even the ancient Egyptians.

ISIS’ efforts to erase pre-Islamic pictorial art successfully communicates their brand image. What ISIS fails to mention is that they are destroying fakes. Blouin Art Info reports that upon the release of the Mosul Museum video, experts determined that “most, if not all’ of the statuary on view were plaster fakes. The officials at the Mosul Museum had previously transported the originals to the Baghdad Museum. The New York Times reported that many of these sculptures were replicas of ancient objects and a portion of the sculptures on display were reconstructed from fragments which included original shards of ancient sculptures.

This is not to say that the group did not succeed in destroying objects of immense cultural value. The nearby Nergal Gate archaeological site was seriously damaged and the truly magnificent 7th century BC Nineveh winged bulls at this location were lost forever.  

There is no doubt that the video was compelling, however when examining the group’s decision to destroy fake and priceless art objects a more pragmatic financial motivation is revealed. The pattern that emerges in this episode of cultural genocide is that ISIS is destroying only the art that is deemed to be unsaleable in the international art market. Both plaster cast fakes of ancient statues and priceless monumental sculptures cannot be sold or transported in the current international antiquity market. The reproduction sculptures do not have an inherent value as they are replicas and the irreplaceable winged bulls at the Nergal Gate are both too well known and too difficult to transport for them to sell in the art market today.  

Whether worthless or priceless the verdict for destruction is the same. The current terrorist art and antiquities market is dictated by two factors: (1) can an item be transported to a location where a buyer exists for it, and (2) can the artwork be passed off as legitimate once it arrives. 

To be sold an item must be exported from ISIS-occupied territories into nations such as Lebanon or Turkey, which have access to the first world antiquity and art markets. These objects are then smuggled into first world nations and legitimized through art galleries and dealers operating in the art business. 

Although in recent weeks most world attention has been on objects from the ancient cultures of Assyria and Nineveh, Syria remains one of the largest cultural casualties of ISIS expansion. Entire landscapes have been transformed by fighting, rampant looting, and cultural plunder decimating archaeological sites that were untouched just three years ago. The most dramatic example of this is the Seleucid site of Apamea in western Syria. A before and after inspection of satellite images of Apamea shows the scale of the destruction. 

Before the Syrian civil war and subsequent ISIS incursion the site was undisturbed and properly excavated by archaeologists. Since the time of the conflict looters have dug up nearly every square foot of the site in search of valuable antiquities, scarring the landscape with jagged pits. Many of these looted artifacts have made their way into the legitimate art markets in Europe, specifically the U.K. 

Despite the high number of artifacts being removed from ISIS occupied territories the artworks being unloaded by the group are not limited to the heritage of Iraq and Syria. Some of the highest grossing ISIS artworks reported in London include Roman pottery and glass, as well as gold and silver Byzantine coins, according to The Times of London. Despite their ideological opposition to Western Culture and iconography ISIS is guilty of compromising the tenets of their jihad in order to cash in on these more marketable western antiquities. With income from other sources in decline ISIS understands art commerce as an imperative to the continued success of their violent jihad.

The U.S. has also been a hot destination for plundered Syrian antiquities. In September 2014 John Kerry hosted a press conference at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York where he released a “red list of Syrian cultural objects at risk” which included a number of cultural objects which have been removed from Syria in the midst of ISIS’ war. A “red list” was also announced for cultural objects from Iraq and is yet to be released.

The goal of this project was to raise international awareness of threats to Syrian and Iraqi cultural patrimony. However, the sale of ISIS-supplied artifacts reportedly continues in New York and London. New legislation to prevent antiques trafficking in the U.S. is being spearheaded by Massachusetts Democratic Congressman Bill Keating. This intends to make the importation process more difficult thereby decreasing the level of funding that ISIS receives from the international antiquities and art trade.  

Despite all diplomatic and legislative efforts to stymie the trade of ISIS antiquities there appears to be no end to illegal antiquities trafficking in sight. The onus to stop the art market’s funding of the ISIS jihad does not rest solely on the government’s policing of antiquities import. Rather, it also remains the responsibility of galleries, dealers, and sales agents.  

As an industry gallerists must embrace internal and external regulations that establish standards for pre-purchase due diligence and end the era of sales dictated by the mantra “legitimate enough”. There are many miles of red tape, local governmental apathy, and civil litigation which lie between art market regulation and current appropriate art market practices. Until that time we rely on the efforts of the educated collector and the dedicated scholar to raise awareness about the dislocation and destruction of Iraq and Syria’s cultural heritage through the international terrorist art market. All the while dreading the next propaganda atrocity released by ISIS in Iraq and Syria.

Poll: Hillary Clinton's lead shrinks among Democrats,politico,"AP Photo
By Nick Gass
7/15/15 9:46 AM EDT
Hillary Clinton is still leading the Democratic field for 2016, but her lead has shrunk in recent months, according to a new Monmouth University poll out Wednesday, as independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders continues to make steady gains despite trailing by a wide margin.
Among Democrats and those leaning toward the Democratic Party, Clinton picked up the support of 51 percent, down from 57 percent in June and 60 percent in April.
Story Continued Below
Sanders came in second with 17 percent, followed by former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb with 1 percent each. Lincoln Chafee, the former governor and senator from Rhode Island, registered no support.
If Vice President Joe Biden were to run, however, the results suggest that he would take some votes away from Clinton. He has not announced his intentions, but registered voters in the sample backed him with 13 percent, just behind Sanders.
More on POLITICO
Among voters who said they were likely to vote for Biden in the event of his candidacy, a whopping 68 percent said they are currently supporting Clinton, while 18 percent said they are backing another candidate, with 14 percent undecided.
Clinton continues to have the best favorability ratings among her Democratic rivals in the Monmouth poll (74 percent favorable to 17 percent unfavorable), though Biden is close behind (67 percent to 17 percent).
The poll was conducted via landlines and cellphones from a larger July 9-12 survey, which sought the opinions of 1,001 adults nationwide. This particular sample included 357 registered voters who identified themselves as Democrats or leaning toward the Democratic Party, carrying a margin of error of plus-or-minus 5.2 percentage points.
