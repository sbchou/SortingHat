Political Memo: Economic Recovery Under Obama Creates Quandaries for 2016 Race,nyt,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/23/us/politics/economic-recovery-under-obama-creates-quandaries-for-2016-race.html,"WASHINGTON —  When President Obama addressed members of the Democratic National Committee here over the weekend, he offered a glowing account of the economic recovery under his administration.

“America is coming back,” he said after rattling off an array of upbeat economic indicators. “We’ve risen from recession.”

But as both parties begin positioning themselves for the election to succeed Mr. Obama, the politics of the economy are far more complicated than the president would have them. Among Democrats, there are divisions over the degree to which Hillary Rodham Clinton, considered their leading contender, should praise the recovery and run on Mr. Obama’s stewardship of the economy. And Republicans — assessing falling unemployment and soaring job creation under a president with still-mediocre approval ratings — are grasping for the right way to frame their 2016 campaign message.

The coming debate over the economy, and by extension Mr. Obama’s legacy, is a particularly acute topic for governors, who are often judged by voters on their states’ economic performance and who spend much of their time on job creation. As the governors gathered here for their annual winter meeting, there was bipartisan optimism about the economy, but it was guarded.

“In many parts of the country, we are seeing increasing momentum in terms of recovery, but in almost every state, and certainly in parts of Colorado, we are still struggling to get the unemployment down,” Gov. John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado said, “and most importantly the wages still haven’t started rising.”

Colorado’s unemployment rate was down to 4 percent in December, below the national average, which was 5.7 percent in January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But Mr. Hickenlooper’s sober analysis suggests an awareness that voters are not yet enjoying a boon and certainly are not yet fully crediting Mr. Obama for the recovery.

Indeed, a Quinnipiac University poll in Colorado, a crucial swing state, released last week indicated that 58 percent of voters said they wanted the next president to “change direction from Barack Obama’s policies,” and the president’s job approval rating was only 43 percent. Perhaps mindful of such data, Mr. Hickenlooper, a Democrat, indicated that Mrs. Clinton could not run simply on the recent good economic news.

“I am not saying who the candidate is going to be, but I don’t think she will come with, ‘Everything is fine, everything is going well,’ ” he said. “I suspect that she will come forward with some new ideas and some innovative ideas on how we can begin to move wages up and how we can help businesses expand more rapidly and create more jobs.”

Yet in another important state on the presidential map, the Democratic governor said Mrs. Clinton should not be shy about linking herself to Mr. Obama’s record.

“She should embrace the Obama economic policies that have moved the country forward, absolutely,” said the governor, Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, a close friend of both Mrs. Clinton’s and former President Bill Clinton’s. “Go through the numbers, look where we are today. Things are booming.”

But Mr. McAuliffe was quick to add that Mr. Obama could make it easier for Mrs. Clinton to offer that embrace if his administration was more effective in trumpeting the recovery.

“I think they need to do a much better job of explaining their successes,” said Mr. McAuliffe, who was the chairman of Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign. “I don’t get it.”

What most of the governors, in both parties, agreed on was that longstanding wage stagnation was diminishing the political impact of the recovery.

“We still have a wage problem. We are still creating too many low-wage, not family-supporting, jobs,” said Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island, a Democrat who was elected last year in a state that was among the hardest hit by the recession.

Ms. Raimondo, whose state has a 6.8 percent unemployment rate, added: “So there is a lot of work to do. She has a wage problem that she has to fix.”

The country’s structural economic challenges — whether wages, diminished manufacturing or other challenges associated with globalization — are such that Mrs. Clinton must come up with her own agenda, Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, another Democrat, said.

“I think it would be a mistake for somebody to be running on ‘It’s great guns; we just have to keep doing what we’re doing,’ ” Mr. Markell said. “It ought to be, ‘In a changing world, here are the things we need to do differently.’ ”

Early signs suggest that Mrs. Clinton intends to offer proposals that would move beyond Mr. Obama’s ideas — notably a plan to offer incentives to corporations that increase profit-sharing with employees.

If Democrats are grappling with how best to hail the resurgent economy while acknowledging its underlying difficulties, Republicans are engaged in a conversation over whether they should remain critical of the recovery, claim a share of credit for it or move on to different issues.

Many of the Republican governors from states where economic improvement has been significant on their watch are uneasy about their nominee’s continuing to bad-mouth the economy. Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, where unemployment is down to 4.1 percent, said Republican presidential candidates should point to job growth in Republican-led states.

“Take some credit for what Republican governors have done, because the recipe to revitalize the national economy is to do the same thing,” Mr. Branstad said

He also suggested that Republicans ought to focus on national security, an issue on which Mr. Obama may prove to be more vulnerable than the economy.",0.97467803101927508,"(e6bb1be77b2207d34aa3fc023433ddeb,""{'LOC': ['WASHINGTON', 'America', 'Colorado', 'Colorado', 'Colorado', 'Colorado', 'Virginia', 'Rhode Island', 'Delaware', 'Iowa'], 'MISC': ['Democrats', 'Republicans', 'Democrats', 'Republicans', 'Democrat', 'Democratic', 'Democrat', 'Democrat', 'Democrats', 'Republicans', 'Republican', 'Republican', 'Republican-led', 'Republican', 'Republicans'], 'PER': ['Obama', 'Quandaries', 'Obama', 'Mr. Obama', 'Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Obama', 'Mr. Obama', 'John W.

O'Malley hits Clinton on Central American immigrants,cnn,http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/20/politics/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-immigration-refugees-2016/index.html,"Las Vegas (CNN)Hillary Clinton has made a show of staking out ground to President Barack Obama's left on immigration -- yet Martin O'Malley is attempting to out-flank her. 
The former Maryland governor took another swipe at Clinton on Wednesday, blasting the Democratic presidential front-runner for her position that the wave of Central American immigrants who entered the United States last year should be deported.
He also said the immigrants kept in migrant camps in the southern United States -- many seeking asylum -- should be treated as refugees, an issue on which O'Malley broke with the White House last year.
""Without any trial, to pen up children in internment camps is un-American,"" O'Malley told reporters gathered outside the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas. 
Clinton was asked about the issue when she spoke with reporters Tuesday in Nevada. She stood by her position -- which Obama's White House has also taken -- that the undocumented immigrants should be deported. 
RELATED: Clinton team steps up defense in email controversy
""We had an emergency, and it was very important to send a message to families in Central America, 'Do not let your children take this very dangerous journey' because a lot of children did not make it,"" she said. ""They were robbed, they were raped, they were kidnapped, they were held for ransom by smugglers. So I think it was the responsible message, that I and many others, including the White House, was trying to say to families, 'Do not let your children, your young children do this.'""
But Clinton said those immigrants shouldn't be kept in migrant camps indefinitely, suggesting that ""particularly the women and children"" should be moved out and opening the door to keeping some of them within the United States.
""I think we need more resources to process them, to listen to their stories, to find out if they have family in this country, if they have a legitimate reason for staying. So I would be putting a lot of resources into doing that, but my position has been and remains the same,"" Clinton said.
O'Malley, meanwhile, accused Clinton of attempting to duck what he called an ""appalling"" humanitarian crisis.
""Secretary Clinton's seen now, like, four or five different sides of this issue. I'm glad she's thinking about it anyway, but her latest position is wrong,"" he said. 
Struggling to gain traction in the Democratic primary polls, O'Malley has made immigration a focal point of his campaign. He's offered a detailed reform proposal that would extend citizenship to more undocumented immigrants than any other candidate, and he also recently visited Puerto Rico. 
O'Malley said he thinks his far-behind campaign will benefit from a ""summer of anger, frustration and discontent"" that has thrust Donald Trump to the forefront of the GOP field and led Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to gain ground on Clinton. 
""At the end of this,"" he said, ""when the fall comes and January comes, America is going to focus on which new leader can actually move our country forward beyond these rather divided and polarized times.""

Donald Trump answered questions from the media at a press conference. (Photo by Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images)  The toughest question facing candidates who participate in the first GOP debate of the campaign Thursday night won't come from the moderators -- it's the one they're grappling with long before they get on stage: How to deal with the presence of one Donald Trump. The mogul's surge in national polls has elevated him from a novelty candidate to the party’s unlikely frontrunner, and a tempting target. The urge to attack him may be strong -- but his rivals may be better off studying him instead, strategists said during a panel discussion in Cleveland Wednesday hosted by The Washington Post. “A lot of folks, I think, have wasted a lot of energy trying to figure out when Donald Trump’s bubble is going to pop … instead of trying to understand what he’s saying that’s resonating with the American voters,” said former Republican National Committee chair Michael Steele. “What he’s doing is, he’s bringing an unconventional approach to a very conventional process. He’s bringing an out-of-the-box mindset.” Trump has sucked up much of the campaign's media oxygen since he announced his presidential bid in May. He says things -- controversial, headline-grabbing, impossible-to-ignore things -- and has tangled with several of his GOP primary season rivals, including Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and former Texas governor Rick Perry. Some find it difficult to take Trump seriously. But many voters have had no trouble buying into his message, both at the national level and in key early voting states. “I’ve talked to friends in Iowa, and Donald Trump is making good headway in Iowa as well,” said Ohio Democratic strategist Aaron Pickrell, adding that the businessman is not just courting media attention but also building a ground game in those key early voting states. “The guy has basically unlimited money, he has 100 percent name ID, he has a 2-to-1 polling advantage. It’s not like he’s just got this hodgepodge team.” Steele said that while Trump’s tactics might face scorn from the Washington establishment, his lead in the polls and his ability to excite conversation among voters should not be underestimated. “Of course, for the folks in Washington it’s a freak show. But for the rest of the country it’s refreshing, because it’s honest, it’s authentic,” Steele said. GOP strategist Kellyanne Conway, responding to a question by Washington Post chief correspondent Dan Balz, said that Trump should provide a case study for what works for candidates in 2015. “Trump is the person to study instead of the person to beat,” she said. She added that ""the reasons that candidates are usually pushed out of a race don’t seem to apply to him…I think he’ll stay in the race as long as he wants to stay in it.” Conway also said that an aggressive performance by Trump could benefit candidates by giving them a chance to ride his coattails and garner media attention -- but she stressed that they will need to find their own ways to attract voters. “The goal for them is, you made it into the top 10, make sure you make it into the next round,” she said. Steele, asked by Balz how he thinks the candidates should respond to Trump if he goes on offense Thursday, said the other contenders on stage Thursday should focus on pushing their own message rather than reacting to Trump. “Stay in your lane. Let Donald Trump wherever Donald Trump is going to go. Because you can’t compete with that,” he said. ""It’s all about discipline: if you are John Kasich, it is not to your benefit to come on stage and directly take on Donald Trump, because you have your own message. … Do not get off the ramp and go off into the wilderness somewhere.”",0.99999999999033262,"(a4dc679e73087584f39103ba36c2f4e8,""{'ORG': ['US', 'Getty Images', 'Cleveland', 'The Washington Post', 'Republican National Committee', 'GOP', 'Ohio Democratic', 'Washington Post'], 'MISC': ['Scottish', 'GOP', 'American'], 'PER': ['Donald Trump', 'Donald Trump', 'Donald Trump', 'Jeff J Mitchell', 'Donald Trump', 'Donald Trump', 'Michael Steele', 'Trump', 'Lindsey Graham', 'Rick Perry', 'Trump', 'Donald Trump', 'Aaron Pickrell', 'Steele', 'Trump', 'Steele', 'Kellyanne Conway', 'Dan Balz', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Conway', 'Trump', 'Steele', 'Balz', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Donald Trump', 'Donald Trump', 'John Kasich', 'Donald Trump'], 'LOC': ['Turnberry', 'Ayr', 'Scotland', 'Texas', 'Iowa', 'Iowa', 'Washington', 'Washington']}"",,)"

					President Obama has ordered a review of U.S. drone strikes in the wake of the news that a U.S. strike accidentally killed two hostages. President Obama accepts full responsibility for the strikes. One of the most-wanted terrorists Adam Gadahn also killed in a separate strike the same week.

The Chairman of the House Committee investigating the 2012 attacks on Americans in Benghazi is calling Hillary Clinton to testify a two public hearings next month.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT

It comes as questions continue to swirl about the Clinton Foundation. Yesterday the WSJ, the New York Times and The Washington Post all ran pieces raising questions about what some are calling the seeming appearance of quid pro quo between policy and donations. The Clinton campaign has denied any wrongdoing and dismissed the revelations as being part of a political witch-hunt.

Today James Rosen is reporting on the possibility of legal troubles for the Clintons.

We’ll also get a preview of a new documentary Fox is unveiling tonight on the Clinton Foundation and the wealth of the Clintons.

It comes as new polls show a surging Marco Rubio. Still Hillary Clinton remains the dominant force in any matchups in the run for the White House. Dana Blanton writes on FoxNews.com, “Clinton bests each of the Republicans tested in hypothetical matchups for a 2016 presidential contest: she leads Paul 46-43 percent, Bush 45-41 percent, Rubio 46-42 percent, Cruz 47-42 percent and Walker 46-40 percent.  In each of these matchups the candidates are at or within the margin of sampling error of each other.”  

The new polling shows there are some concerns among voters about Hillary Clinton’s honesty.

Italian police have arrested 18 suspected terrorists in a crackdown in Italy. They were allegedly behind a terror attack that killed more than 100 in 2010, and were planning an attack on the Vatican.  It comes as France says it has foiled at least six attacks just since January.

There’s been a surge in ER visits from a new drug called “Spice”. We’ll ask Dr. Ernest Patti about this dangerous new street drug.

"Obama meets Lucy, an ancient 'ancestor,' in Ethiopia",reuters,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/lifestyle/~3/S5cxKa1hBgE/story01.htm,"ADDIS ABABA Barack Obama came to Africa partially to connect with the continent of his forefathers.
On Monday, he met an ancestor of an altogether different kind: ""Lucy,"" the 3.2 million-year-old partial skeleton of a hominid discovered in Ethiopia.
""That's amazing,"" the U.S. president said of the bones, which were brought specially for him to view from a museum to the National Palace, where he was attending a state dinner.
Obama is on a two-country tour of Africa that started in Kenya, where his father was born. He arrived in Ethiopia on Sunday and returns to the United States on Tuesday.
Scientists told reporters the valuable partial skeleton was transported secretly and under tight security out of its museum. Obama was invited to touch one of the bones, something usually only permitted for scientists.
""We honor Ethiopia as the birthplace of humankind. In fact, I just met Lucy, our oldest ancestor,"" Obama told attendees at the state dinner later in the evening.
""When you see our ancestor ... we are reminded that Ethiopians, Americans, all the people of the world are part of the same human family, the same chain,"" Obama said to applause.
A little bit of politics crept in to the moment, as well. 
One of the scientists showing the bones to Obama referenced Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, the billionaire businessman who claimed for a long time that Obama was not born in the United States.
""It shows that every single person here, 7 billion people, including Donald Trump, came down through the chain,"" said Zeresenay Alemseged, referring to Lucy's place in the evolution of humankind.

Clinton campaign struggles against family legacy,cnn,http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/05/politics/hillary-clinton-family-legacy/index.html,"Washington (CNN)A month after launching Hillary Clinton's presidential candidacy, with every moment of her announcement video and reintroduction tour to voters carefully crafted, her campaign team now finds itself consumed by fending off a familiar, yet far more elusive, adversary: The Clinton legacy.
As she visits Nevada on Tuesday and calls for a path to citizenship for immigrants living in the country illegally, her advisers are trying to keep old fires from becoming political obstacles with staying power. Questions about donations to the family's foundation, along with Bill Clinton's defiant comments this week, have alarmed Democrats who hoped she could start her campaign on fresh footing.
Aides to Clinton still insist she will run the race on her own terms without distraction from whirlwinds of controversy. Yet strategists acknowledge sufficient concern by an erosion of trust and credibility that they are forcefully fighting back. One way is through a new blog, ""The Briefing,"" which is notably not devoted to Clinton's platform for 2016, but rather simply fact-checking attacks against her.
""While we will not be consumed by these kinds of attacks, we will also not let them go unchallenged,"" John Podesta, the campaign chairman, said in a message intended to allay any worry among supporters. ""That's why we are building a new one-stop shop to provide the facts about Hillary Clinton's positions and her record.""
It's a key challenge of her candidacy: Shoring up her perceptions of trust and credibility.
The campaign, through its own surveys and focus groups with voters, is closely studying a decline in her approval since she entered the race last month. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday found only a quarter of registered voters said they viewed her as honest and straightforward, down 13 percentage points from last summer. She still fares stronger when facing a Republican rival.
But a central question facing Clinton in her second presidential bid is whether she and her new team of advisers can answer questions and fight allegations openly -- in a far different media climate -- without reverting to a familiar Clinton defensive crouch that all criticism is automatically partisan and no legitimate inquires could exist. 
As Bill Clinton's first televised interview of the campaign still reverberated Tuesday, several top Democrats told CNN they were taken aback by his tone and they wondered anew whether his words could be a detriment to his wife's campaign. Some Democrats said they cringed when he brushed aside questions about collecting $500,000 for delivering a speech by saying: ""I've gotta pay our bills.""
""There is no doubt in my mind that we have never done anything knowingly inappropriate in terms of taking money to influence any kind of American government policy,"" Bill Clinton told NBC News in Nairobi. He also criticized what he characterized as ""political"" attacks on the foundation.
His comments raised more skepticism of the charges included in a book that was released on Tuesday, ""Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.""
Inside the Clinton campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, aides were widely pleased with the disciplined rollout of her announcement tour and the campaign's aggressive rebuttals to the book, written by conservative author Peter Schweizer. 
But now, advisers acknowledge they are bracing for an even more challenging -- and uncertain -- second month of her campaign.
Clinton could be called as soon as May 18 to testify before the House Select Committee on Benghazi in its investigation of the attacks that killed four Americans on Sept. 11, 2012. She also will be questioned over the use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. 
It will be an unusual scene for a presidential candidate: Raising her right hand and swearing an oath to testify during a televised congressional committee. The proceedings have already taken a partisan tone on both sides. Podesta fueled Democratic suspicion in his message to supporters this week, arguing the inquiry by Republicans is part of a ""two-fisted strategy to try to undermine her.""
To be sure, Clinton's trust and credibility are at the forefront of the Republican campaign against her. Republican presidential candidates are spending less time trying to link Clinton to Obama these days than they do raising questions about whether she's trustworthy.
""I think that Bill Clinton is saying what Hillary Clinton has said on many occasions: 'Just trust us,'"" Carly Fiorina said as she announced her candidacy Monday. ""Trust is earned through transparency.""
Republicans are hoping to take a page from the winning Democratic playbook of 2012: Define Clinton in a negative light early by chipping away at her credibility. It's similar to how the Obama campaign rushed to define Mitt Romney, which stuck with him for the duration of the race.
Democrats close to Clinton believe the best antidote to the Republican attacks is to step up her own campaign and begin to aggressively outline what she stands for and why she wants to be president.

"Possum Holler, beignets, and 43 cents: US presidential campaign spending",reuters,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/cyclicalconsumergoodsNews/~3/pnQDNczvJD0/usa-election-frugality-idUSL2N0ZW2PE20150716,"NEW YORK, July 16 Running for president in the
United States often involves juggling perception versus reality.
In the 2016 race, touting your humble origins and frugal tastes
has been part of the daily message for many candidates, even
some of the wealthiest.
But the quarterly financial reports from the presidential
contenders say a little more about how much they are spending,
and where they are spending it, once the cameras are off.
For candidates, a presidential campaign is a whirlwind
national tour, with expenses piling up for everything from
hotels, meals and transportation to more mundane items such as
office supplies, Internet services and even postage.
The reports filed on Wednesday with the Federal Election
Commission detail much of that daily campaign life, in some
cases pulling back the curtain on the contenders for the
November 2016 White House election.
For former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, the restaurant
names on his filing line up with his folksy image - if not the
bill totals.
The ""God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy"" author spent more than
$3,000 at Possum Holler Catering, $1,000 at Doe's Eat Place, and
$870 at Jethro's Jambalaya.
But Donald Trump, the former ""Celebrity Apprentice"" host who
estimates his net worth above $10 billion, showed a penchant for
fast food.
Since his mid-June campaign launch, the real-estate
magnate's campaign has spent more than $450 at McDonald's, $60
on meals at Wendy's, and even he expensed a $6 purchase at a
restaurant called Beignet Done That.
Trump's not alone.
Chick-fil-A, which has often been associated with the
anti-gay marriage movement, got money from U.S. Senators Marco
Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas, who are both
conservative Republicans.
Republican Ben Carson is as famous for his eight books as
for his career as a pediatric neurosurgeon. Unsurprisingly, his
campaign paid nearly $65,000 to his publisher, HarperCollins,
for copies of an abridged version of his autobiography for his 
contributors.
""I think we ordered 50,000 books, and I'm pretty certain we
sold every last one,"" said Doug Watts, a Carson spokesman.
Watts paused, then corrected himself. ""We didn't sell
anything, we provided them for contributions.""
Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who has been
criticized for his own sometimes-shaky personal finances, lists
even the tiniest payments - down to 43 cents to a vendor named
Piryx. That's about the cost of one third of a pack of gum
(maybe half if it's on sale).
Democrat Hillary Clinton, in contrast, shows a fondness for
Amazon. Her campaign spent more than $22,000 for technology
services at the online soup-to-nuts store.
But Trump, who often touts his own business prowess and
compliments himself in public, might like writing his name on
checks even more than he likes talking about himself in the
third person: His campaign paid more than $62,000 to various
Trump-named enterprises, including the Trump Corporation and
Trump Tower Commercial LLC.

First Draft: Scott Walker Is Heckled in Formerly Friendly Iowa,nyt,http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/08/17/scott-walker-is-heckled-in-formerly-friendly-iowa/,"DES MOINES – They sported Wisconsin cheese hats but the impression that Gov. Scott Walker had brought a home-state cheering section was demolished when catcalls began as soon as he started speaking Monday morning.

“Fifty kids in a classroom!’’ shouted Jonathan Hannah, a cheesehead from Milwaukee, responding to Mr. Walker’s criticism of the Common Core education standards at the Iowa State Fair.

Speaking on the outdoor Soapbox, a perch that has drawn presidential candidates of both parties since the fair opened last week, Mr. Walker was the first to face a significant chorus of opponents.

Sarah Clifton said she and about 50 others came from Wisconsin to protest. “We’re residents of Wisconsin he’s not doing nothing for,’’ she said.  

But Mr. Walker, whose standing in Iowa polls has been declining recently, was never thrown off his stride by the steady chorus of boos and interruptions. In fact he used the opposition to try to demonstrate he was a warrior Republican who would not back down, recalling how 100,000 protesters flooded the Wisconsin capital to try to derail his anti-union legislation in 2011. 

“I will not be intimidated, just like I wasn’t intimidated there or anywhere else,’’ the governor said

He also aimed an indirect barb at Hillary Rodham Clinton, who in visiting the fair on Saturday skipped a soapbox speech, which has a history of attracting hecklers.

“This is why I love coming to Iowa, because you lay it right out there,’’ Mr. Walker said. “There’s no filter, there’s no hiding behind the national media.’’

“Right here and right now,’’ he said, “if that’s what you want out of your next president – someone who will not back down – then I ask for your vote.’’

At least some Iowans also booed the governor. Cathy Glasson, a nurse from Coralville, Iowa, gave him two thumbs down as he spoke. “I try to be open-minded about candidates but this one in particular I can’t be,’’ she said.  “He talks about creating jobs but I understand his state is one of the lowest new job creators in the country.’’

Both sides may have gotten what they wanted.  After the governor’s speech, TV cameras and notebook-wielding reporters surrounded the protesters to hear their views. 

 But Walker supporters agreed with him that those doing the booing made him look tougher.    

 “Scott stand up and talks like an American, not like a wimp,’’ said Dean Scheffert, a retiree from Indianola, Iowa.  

Jamie Steen, a stay-at-home mother from Ankeny, Wis., said, “For voters like me, it makes him look stronger that he’s not going to waver.’’",0.97884291153977643,"(1753394581362d61eaf0b524253b49b6,""{'LOC': ['Iowa', 'Iowa State Fair', 'Wisconsin', 'Wisconsin', 'Milwaukee', 'Iowa State Fair', 'Wisconsin', 'Wisconsin', 'Iowa', 'Wisconsin', 'Iowa', 'Coralville', 'Iowa', 'Indianola', 'Iowa', 'Ankeny', 'Wis'], 'MISC': ['Common Core', 'Soapbox', 'Republican', 'Iowans', 'American'], 'PER': ['Scott Walker', 'Scott Walker', 'Scott Walker', 'Jonathan Hannah', 'Mr. Walker', 'Mr. Walker', 'Sarah Clifton', 'Mr. Walker', 'Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Mr. Walker', 'Cathy Glasson', 'Walker', 'Scott', 'Dean Scheffert', 'Jamie Steen'], 'ORG': ['Soapbox', 'DES MOINES']}"",,)"
HILLARY UNDER FIRE  GOP 2016 hopefuls turn up the heat at NH summit,fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/19/at-new-hampshire-summit-big-gop-field-takes-turns-attacking-clinton-ahead-her/,"

						GOP presidential hopefuls turned up their attacks Saturday on Hillary Clinton -- taking turns piling on the 2016 Democratic presidential frontrunner during a party summit in New Hampshire.

The first five 2016 GOP presidential candidates or potential candidates used at least some of their stage time at the Republican Leadership Summit, in Nashua, N.H., to criticize Clinton, who is scheduled to be in the state Monday and Tuesday.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT

“I’m starting to worry that when Clinton travels she'll need two planes -- one for her and her entourage and one for her baggage,” said Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul, particularly critical of Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state in which four Americans were killed in Benghazi, Libya, and she used a private server and email address for official business.

“When I think of scandals, the one that bothers me the most is Benghazi,” he continued. “What I fault Hillary most for is for nine months (Americans in Benghazi) pleaded for help.”

Nearly 20 Republican White House prospects were on the program for the weekend conference that ended Saturday afternoon.

Paul was followed by former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina, the only high-profile, potential 2016 GOP White House female candidate so far this year.

“Hillary Clinton must not be president of the United States,” said Fiorina, who repeated her criticism that Clinton’s extensive travelogue as the country’s top diplomat is not a marker of success.  

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal began his remarks by pretending to have mistakenly read a Clinton stump speech, saying he wanted to talk about President Obama’s “great success” in the Middle East.

“I’m sorry, this is Hillary Clinton’s speech, not my speech,” Jindal said to laughter and applause.

He later said: “We can win, we must win, we will win. It is critical we beat Hillary Clinton.”

N.Y. real estate mogul Donald Trump was perhaps the easiest on Clinton, suggesting she was not invincible.

“I know Hillary very well,” he said. “I can beat her. And I think most people cannot.”

South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsay Graham was critical of Clinton’s now 8-day-old campaign in which her interactions with people in Iowa, and those she met along the way in her van, appear to be carefully managed.

“Hillary Clinton couldn't be here today because we didn't ask her,” said Graham, also critical of Clinton before, during and after the Benghazi attacks.

“And the reason she isn't (here) is because you can ask questions. This listening tour is like North Korea. Is there anything you'd like to ask the dear leader? How does she get away with this? I don't know. If you want to meet her you better be able to run 35mph” to catch her van.

Why Scott Walker keeps dropping Marco Rubio’s name as VP,washpo,http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636655/s/47f3062e/sc/7/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cpolitics0Cwhy0Escott0Ewalker0Ekeeps0Ementioning0Emarco0Erubio0Eas0Ea0Erunning0Emate0C20A150C0A70C0A80C720Abe62e0E23f40E11e50Eaae20E6c4f59b0A50Aaa0Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Ipolitics/story01.htm," Scott Walker has yet to launch his presidential campaign, but the Wisconsin governor is already talking both privately and publicly about a running mate: Marco Rubio. This comes as news to Rubio, the freshman Florida senator who is running his own campaign to be president. The constant prodding from Walker has become an irritant between the two GOP rivals, neither of whom knows the other all that well.  The goal for Walker is clear: to calm the nerves of Republican power brokers who love his conservative message and anti-union pedigree but who worry about the appeal of a white male Midwestern governor in a fast-changing country — especially if Hillary Rodham Clinton is the Democratic nominee.  It also less-than-subtly suggests that one of his rivals is not up for the top of the ticket.  “He’s sending several messages — give the impression he’s on top; acknowledge that he would be running against a historical figure in the first woman candidate and needs some diversity; telegraph Marco that they are allies; and in a way belittle Marco,” said Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist and longtime friend of Rubio and Jeb Bush, who is backing Bush for president.    Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has suggested that his position has provided him with foreign policy experience that a governor like Walker does not have. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)  As for Rubio, he has made clear that if there’s a ticket involving him and Walker, he wants his name first.  The two Republicans — both in their 40s and hailing from working-class families — are engaged in a fight to become the chief alternative to Bush, an establishment favorite. Rubio is campaigning this week in Iowa, where Walker is leading in the polls, as Walker prepares to formally launch his campaign Monday in suburban Milwaukee. Over the past several months, Walker has routinely discussed Rubio in private meetings with supporters and potential donors. The governor praises Rubio and all that the senator can bring to a presidential campaign but does it in a way that casts Rubio as more lieutenant than general, according to several Republicans with knowledge of the conversations. Often a donor or audience member is the one to bring up the topic, although Walker has been known to bring it up himself — and he has even spoken publicly about the possibility of a Walker-Rubio ticket.  [Scott Walker is about to launch campaign with Bush and Rubio in his sights]  “I like Marco Rubio a lot,” Walker said in a recent Bloomberg interview. But then: “Obviously, I’m deferential to governors. I think there’s a lot we bring to the table as having proved executive experience. But I do like Marco Rubio.” He added that “quite a few people” have suggested a Walker-Rubio ticket to him.  Rubio has suggested the opposite. “A Walker-Rubio ticket may be fine,” he said recently in New Hampshire, “but it’s got to be in alphabetical order.”   Walker sits with his wife, Tonette, during a fundraiser in West Des Moines on May 16. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg)  Frank VanderSloot, a top Republican donor and chief executive of an Idaho nutritional-supplement company, said Walker has mentioned the idea of tapping Rubio as his running mate twice to him — once in a phone call early this year and last month at a Utah retreat hosted by Mitt Romney. VanderSloot has also talked to Rubio about the idea; he was adamant about being at the top of the ticket.  The continuous one-upmanship, VanderSloot said, is “a little tongue-in-cheek. But in good humor there is always a little truth.” Michael Steele, the former Republican National Committee chairman, said Walker’s ticket talk “is a little bit presumptuous” — and puzzling.  “I guess because of the Hispanic vote and the idea that Rubio may have some appeal to draw that,” he said.  Walker has repeatedly described Rubio as a friend, although associates say that the two do not have an especially close relationship. They met in 2010, soon after Walker was elected to the governor’s office and Rubio to the Senate; neither side can remember the details.  “They haven’t stayed in great touch since but run into each other now and again since they attend events with a very similar following,” said one person close to Walker, who requested anonymity to describe private interactions.   [Marco Rubio: A man in a hurry]  Both campaigns declined to discuss the relationship between the two politicians. A senior Republican who stays in contact with both said Rubio’s team has reacted to Walker’s rhetoric with a shrug.  “It doesn’t make them happy, but they are not unduly annoyed,” said the Republican, who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. “They kind of chuckle and go, ‘That’s just the way the game works.’ ” Walker’s embrace-and-diminish treatment of Rubio was on full display late last month during a speech at a regional Republican conference in Philadelphia. Walker lauded the entire GOP field — but Rubio was the only one he mentioned by name.  “I know Senator Rubio very well,” Walker said. He then noted that while U.S. senators have admirably fought President Obama’s agenda, they “have yet to win any of those serious battles.” Walker has pitched himself as a candidate who can fight and win battles with Democrats. This spring, Rubio said in a meeting with the Des Moines Register editorial board that there was “no way” a governor like Walker is ready to make foreign policy decisions. Walker hit back, asking if Rubio thought former California governor Ronald Reagan had been prepared for the job.  A few days later, one of Walker’s college-aged sons tweeted: “Marco Rubio just tweeted a good 50 times in the last hour. . . . Whoever runs his account NEEDS TO CHILL.” Stanley Hubbard, a conservative billionaire who oversees a Minnesota broadcasting company and is supporting Walker, said that he likes Rubio but doesn’t think he is quite ready for the presidency.  “He has not yet had any executive experience — and that’s really important to get the job done right as president. He hasn’t had that experience yet, but he could get it as vice president,” Hubbard said.  Walker and Rubio are now competing against one another in Iowa, where both have hired strategists who steered Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) to victory in the 2014 midterms. Walker has visited the state at least half a dozen times this year and plans to again visit after his announcement next week. He is banking heavily on a good showing there, and polls show he has the inside track against the crowded field of Republican hopefuls.   [Scott Walker’s wife, toughened by life, is ready for the fires of a campaign]  Iowa is much tougher for Rubio, who is trying to make an impression there. He will hold seven public Iowa events in three days this week and has reserved TV advertising time in the state.  Some top Republicans worry that Walker is tacking too far to the right on social issues in an effort to win the Iowa caucuses, which are usually dominated by conservative activists. They point to the Supreme Court’s recent decision to legalize gay marriage nationwide, which Walker called a “grave mistake” that should be undone by amending the Constitution to give states the right to ban gay marriage. Rubio and Bush did not call for such an amendment.  Walker also came out as a more vocal critic of abortion, backing a ban in his state on abortions after 20 weeks. Walker has long opposed abortion in all cases, including pregnancies resulting from rape and incest, although he avoided discussing the issue in last year’s gubernatorial race.  “He has gone too far to the right,” said a top Republican fundraiser who is close to Walker but has not endorsed him. “He has been very focused on Iowa, but he needs to have his eye on New Hampshire . . . and the other primaries.”   Democrats are eager to engage in culture war debates with Republicans, and Clinton recently slammed the GOP as the “party of the past.” It’s unclear whether a joint ticket would resolve such problems for Republicans or cause more confusion, since Rubio and Walker disagree on some issues.  But that’s not going to stop Walker’s backers from daydreaming out loud about Walker-Rubio 2016.  “My dear wife, Karen, said to me months ago, ‘Wouldn’t a great ticket be Walker for president and Rubio for vice president?’ ” Hubbard said. “I think it’s a very good idea. It would be a heck of a ticket.” ",0.99999985039432859,"(fe764cff9b86b944a179549118f30f43,""{'LOC': ['Wisconsin', 'Wisconsin', 'Rubio', 'Iowa', 'Milwaukee', 'Rubio', 'Rubio', 'New Hampshire', 'West Des Moines', 'Idaho', 'Utah', 'Philadelphia', 'U.S.', 'California', 'Minnesota', 'Iowa', 'Iowa', 'Iowa', 'Iowa', 'Iowa', 'New Hampshire'], 'MISC': ['Republican', 'Midwestern', 'Democratic', 'Republican', 'Republicans', 'Republicans', 'Republican', 'Republican', 'Hispanic', 'Republican', 'Republican', 'Republican', 'GOP', 'Democrats', 'Republican', 'Republicans', 'Republican', 'Democrats', 'Republicans', 'Republicans'], 'PER': ['Scott Walker', 'Marco Rubio', 'Scott Walker', 'Marco Rubio', 'Rubio', 'Walker', 'Scott Walker', 'Marco Rubio', 'Rubio', 'Walker', 'Walker', 'Hillary Rodham Clinton', 'Marco', 'Marco', 'Ana Navarro', 'Jeb Bush', 'Bush', 'Marco Rubio', 'Walker', 'J.

Bernie Sanders Leads Hillary Clinton in Poll of N.H. Voters,wsj,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/08/12/bernie-sanders-leads-hillary-clinton-in-poll-of-n-h-voters/,"
For the first time, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) has jumped ahead of Hillary Clinton in a poll of New Hampshire voters.
The new Franklin Pierce University/Boston Herald poll shows Mr. Sanders leading Mrs. Clinton 44% to 37% among likely Democratic primary voters. Vice President Joe Biden, who has not officially entered the 2016 race, got 9% support.
However, voters are not optimistic that their choice will make it to the White House. When asked who they think will get the Democratic nomination, about two-thirds say Mrs. Clinton will be the party’s choice, while only 11 percent picked Mr. Sanders.
The other Democrats in the race — former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee and former Virgnia Sen. Jim Webb barely registered on the poll as a choice among voters.
Voters were asked who they would vote for if the Democratic presidential primary were held today. The Democratic primary is February 9, 2016.
A poll released a week ago by Gravis Marketing/One America News showed Mrs. Clinton leading Mr. Sanders 43% to 39%.
The telephone survey of 442 likely Democratic New Hampshire primary voters was conducted Aug. 7-10 and has a margin of error of 4.7%.

The game went on, but the Nats fell to the Reds 3-2. (@capitalweather)  THE BIG IDEA: — As Congress debates education this week, Republicans will highlight how far to the right they have moved on the issue since the No Child Left Behind Act passed in 2001. Even though the law significantly expanded the federal government’s role, only six Republican senators opposed it. Keep in mind that, running for president just five years before the law was approved, Bob Dole supported eliminating the Department of Education altogether. But George W. Bush pulled his party along with him by pushing for passage of NCLB. It was actually GOP negotiators pushing hardest for standards, challenging both teacher unions and what Bush 43 memorably called “the soft bigotry of low expectations.” In case you need another reminder, this is no longer George W. Bush’s Republican Party. Though his brother Jeb continues to support Common Core, with softened rhetoric, conservative grassroots activists have re-embraced their federalist roots and historic skepticism of any federal involvement. Eight years after No Child Left Behind officially expired, congressional leaders want to pass a rewrite of the main federal K-12 education law that can get President Obama’s signature. The bill being considered in the House would transfer far more power away from the federal government than the Senate bill, which passed unanimously out of the HELP committee after bipartisan negotiations between Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and ranking member Patty Murray (D-Wash.). The Post’s national education reporter, Lyndsey Layton, in a Q&A with The Daily 202, notes that both bills explicitly prohibit the Education secretary from influencing state academic standards. It’s not clear that a bill will become law, but it seems certain that any legislation that emerges from Congress would dramatically curtail the federal government’s involvement in state standards. Establishment Republicans hope that would take the political hot potato of Common Core off the table in 2016, helping Jeb Bush in the primaries.    Sen. Lamar Alexander, a key player in this week’s fight, was George H.W. Bush’s Education Secretary. Here he plays the piano in his Capitol office. (AP/Susan Walsh  But that’s not good enough for many on the right. House leaders already withdrew an education bill in February after they failed to whip the necessary Republican votes. Some conservatives complain that all they’re considering is a watered-down version of NCLB. While passage in the Senate seems assured, House leaders do not currently appear to have the votes without adding additional amendments that the White House sees as poison pills. Post education reporter Emma Brown focuses on three main flash points in her own curtain raiser this morning.    Bobby Jindal at a parade in Urbandale, Iowa.

Believe Again has been up for the past week with a commercial highlighting the Louisiana governor’s views on immigration. The fresh buy will get 1,675 gross ratings points in Des Moines, Sioux City and Cedar Rapids, plus statewide cable and some digital, from July 13 to August 2.

(AP/Mary Schwalm)  — Sneak peek at Marco Rubio’s tech policy speech in Chicago later this morning: “We need a new president for a new age.” The Florida senator will elaborate on what a “New American Century” would look like under his leadership during a speech at 1871, a nonprofit that provides co-working spaces for start-up companies, with the promise of fresh ideas to spur innovation and improve higher education. “Today’s Technological Revolution carries extraordinary opportunities – even more, I believe, than the Industrial Revolution ever did. But we have not yet seized these opportunities, nor is it guaranteed that we will,” he says, according to excerpts shared by his campaign. “For the first fifteen and a half years of this century, Washington has looked to the past. Our economy has changed, but our economic policies have not. And we have learned, painfully, that the old ways no longer work – that Washington cannot pretend the world is the same as it was in the ‘80s, it cannot raise taxes like it did in the ‘90s, and it cannot grow government like it did in the 2000s. The race for the future will never be won by going backward.”    Steve King talks with a DREAMer outside a Donald Trump event on June 27. (Reuters/Brian Frank)  — Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) will push Speaker John Boehner for a resolution of disapproval concerning the Supreme Court’s gay marriage. It would be nonbinding but could force Republicans to go on the record anew. “We should bring it to the floor and have a debate and let people register their positions,” the congressman told The Post’s Ed O’Keefe in an interview yesterday afternoon. King, who has a lot of sway with activists in conservative northwest Iowa, wants 2016ers to weigh in more on the issue. He complained that he’s heard “a good number of tepid responses” from presidential candidates on this. “I think it’s important to let the public know where they stand,” he said. WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: — European finance leaders are meeting to consider a new proposal from Greece to rescue the country from its cash crunch. The meeting is set to occur at 1 p.m. in Brussels (8 a.m. Eastern), and if Greece doesn’t get a new lifeline, its cash will expire within days, paving the way for an exit from the Euro. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker lowered expectations for a quick fix. “What we are going to do today is to talk to each other and restore order,” he told the European parliament on Tuesday morning, according to The Guardian. Meanwhile, the Greek crisis poses a continuing test of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s power at home. GET SMART FAST:  In the final hours before the latest deadline, Iranian officials are reportedly demanding that ALL United Nations sanctions against the regime be lifted as part of any deal. That includes the ban on importing and exporting conventional arms, which could make an already tough sale that much tougher for the Obama administration. “Forty years after the fall of Saigon, President Obama is seeking to reconfigure a historically difficult relationship with Vietnam into a strategic partnership against China. In a meeting freighted with symbolism, Obama [today] will welcome Vietnam’s Communist Party leader, Nguyen Phu Trong, to the White House two decades after the onetime enemy nations formally normalized relations.” Vietnam is one of the 12 nations involved with the TPP talks. (David Nakamura) United States officials feel confident enough that a final Pacific trade deal is in hand that they have scheduled a meeting among the chief negotiators at the Westin in Maui during the last four days in July and have notified Congress that they expect this to be the last one, Jonathan Weisman reports in the New York Times. “Still, it will be some time before a deal is ratified. Under terms set by Congress in trade negotiating legislation last month, a July 31 agreement could not be signed until Oct. 31 or more likely the beginning of November. Congress cannot begin considering it until December. Obama announced at the Pentagon yesterday that the United States is stepping up efforts to counteract ISIS online recruitment operations of impressionable young people. “This larger battle for hearts and minds is going to be a generational struggle,” he said. (NBC) The shooting death of a woman in San Francisco by an undocumented immigrant has led to a heated war or words between the Department of Homeland Security and local officials over who dropped the ball. South Carolina’s Senate voted 37-3 yesterday to remove the Confederate battle flag from the state capitol. Many of the more than 2,000 rape kits left to languish in police departments around Virginia should have been submitted for testing but weren’t, according to a fresh audit that had been ordered up by the state’s General Assembly. If tested, they could yield DNA evidence that could identify rapists and solve crimes that have been unsolved for years. (Rachel Weiner)  POWER PLAYERS IN THE NEWS:  Hillary Clinton will give an interview this afternoon to CNN’s Brianna Keilar in Iowa, her first sit-down with a national reporter since getting into the race. Former Rep. Tom Perriello (D-Va.) will be the Obama administration’s special envoy for the Great Lakes region of Africa, an appointment that covers Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. (Huffington Post) A non-profit organization created to support Marco Rubio, funded by secret donors, announced yesterday that it has raised more than $15.8 million since its creation. Carly Fiorina raised $1.4 million in her first quarter as a candidate. The Republican’s super PAC, CARLY for America, raised $3.4 million. The $4.8 million total is the most underwhelming figure from a presidential candidate so far in either party. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) raised $2.9 million for his reelection campaign last quarter and has more than $10 million cash on hand. Mitt Romney lunched yesterday with Jeb and George H.W. Bush in Kennebunkport, Maine. Columba, Barbara, Neil and George P. Bush also joined. Rep. Joe Heck (R-Nevada) formally announced he will run for the Senate seat being given up by Minority Leader Harry Reid, a recruiting win for the national GOP. Greg Lopez, former director of the Small Business Administration in Colorado, announced he plans to run for the Republican Senate nomination to challenge Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) Lopez is not a top-tier recruit. (Denver Post) Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) drew a crowd of about 7,500 in Portland, Maine, yesterday. Gov. Chris Christie (R-N.J.) attacked Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) for making the country “weaker and more vulnerable,” saying on “Morning Joe” that he should be among those held accountable if another attack occurs. Bill Cosby testified in a 2005 deposition that he got Quaaludes with the intent of giving them to young women he wanted to sleep with, and he admitted giving the sedative to at least one woman, the Associated Press reported after winning a court fight to obtain the documents yesterday.  WAPO HIGHLIGHTS: — “Cruz once clerked for a chief justice, but he’s no longer a friend of the court,” by Katie Zezima: “Cruz spent his years at Harvard Law School working to secure a Supreme Court clerkship and then made his name as a lawyer by arguing in front of the body nine times…But now, as a presidential candidate seeking support from the right wing of his party, Cruz has made excoriating the high court a central part of his campaign. After the Obamacare and same-sex marriage rulings, Cruz called for a constitutional amendment requiring members of the Supreme Court to undergo judicial retention elections and has suggested that only the people directly involved in the gay-marriage case are bound by the justices’ ruling.” — “For some workers at Trump’s D.C. hotel, route to U.S. wasn’t always legal,” by Antonio Olivo: “For weeks, dozens of construction workers from Latin America have streamed onto the site of the Old Post Office Pavilion in downtown Washington and taken pride in their work building one of the city’s newest luxury hotels…a Trump company may be relying on some undocumented workers to finish the $200 million hotel, which will sit five blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, according to several who work there…Interviews with about 15 laborers…revealed that many of them had crossed the U.S-Mexico border illegally before they eventually settled in the Washington region to build new lives… A Trump spokeswoman said the company and its contractors follow all applicable laws.” — “Here are the secret ways super PACs and campaigns can work together,” by Matea Gold: “Before former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) announced his bid in mid-June, the Right to Rise super PAC filmed footage of him that the group plans to use in ads. Hillary Rodham Clinton’s campaign is collaborating directly with Correct the Record, a super PAC providing the Democratic hopeful’s team with opposition research. Top advisers to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) have been positioned at two big-money groups as they await his presidential announcement next week. GOP candidate Carly Fiorina has gone even further, outsourcing core functions such as rapid response and event preparation to her allied super PAC, the aptly named ­CARLY for America.” SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: — ZIGNAL VISUAL: Hillary Clinton is the focus of the mainstream media, but Bernie Sanders has closed the enthusiasm gap on Twitter. Zignal Labs, our campaign analytics partner, reports that Clinton commands far more television coverage, but Sanders is actually getting more buzz across social media. While Sanders had 6 percent more Twitter mentions than Clinton on Monday (53,448 vs. 50,668), the former Secretary of State had nearly two-and-a-half times as many television mentions (998 vs. 417). A similar gap existed in online news mentions (3,203 for Clinton vs. 1,247 for Sanders). “We are worried about him, sure,” Clinton spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said on MSNBC yesterday. “He will be a serious force for the campaign, and I don’t think that will diminish.” Here is an hour-by-hour chart tracking mentions of Sanders and Clinton.     –WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT: Pictures of the day: President George W.

That Scott Walker Call? Never Happened,” by Jonathan Martin: “Last Wednesday, Stephen Moore, a scholar at the Heritage Foundation who is an outspoken supporter of an immigration overhaul, described a recent telephone call with Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, in which he said Mr. Walker had assured him he had not completely renounced his earlier support for a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants … On Sunday, after three days of pressure from Mr. Walker’s aides, Mr. Moore said that he had ‘misspoken’ when recounting his call with Mr. Walker — and that the call had never actually taken place. The turnabout by Mr. Moore came after he was quoted Thursday in a Times article detailing Mr. Walker’s shifts on immigration, same-sex marriage and ethanol subsidies to protect his early lead in Iowa, where he is facing a well-financed challenge from Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, among other rivals.” “So, what exactly is Mr. Walker’s current position on immigration? Asked if he supported any path to citizenship or legal status for illegal immigrants, Mr. Walker’s spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, did not directly respond … This is the second time this year that Mr. Walker has been reported as saying privately that he was open to an immigration overhaul beyond measures to address the border, only to have his aides later deny such assertions were made.” BUZZING AT THE CAPITOL: — The Hill, “Obama to host Senate Dems,” by Jordan Fabian: “President Obama will host Senate Democrats for a meeting and reception on Tuesday, a White House official said. The White House says the gathering will mostly be a social occasion. But it gives the president a chance to huddle with his allies in Congress who have a long to-do list this month, including a partisan standoff over government spending that could result in a shutdown. The White House is also expected to lean heavily on Senate Democrats to support a nuclear agreement with Iran if one is reached this week.” — Reuters, “Hoax letter to Russian media seeks to tie U.S. senator to Ukraine,” by Patricia Zengerle: “A forger sent a hoax letter to Russian media in an apparent bid to convince journalists that a senior U.S. lawmaker, Senator Richard Durbin, was trying to tell Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk how to run his government, Durbin’s office said on Monday…It suggested that Yatsenyuk ‘invest every effort’ to keep some officials in place, including the agriculture minister and the head of the country’s nuclear monopoly. But it said the U.S. Senate feels some others do not have the qualities necessary for their jobs.” HOT ON THE LEFT Abby Wambach kisses wife after World Cup win. From Yahoo News: “Abby Wambach celebrated the United States’ 5-2 victory over Japan in the Women’s World Cup final on Sunday [by] racing to the stands to kiss her wife, Sarah Huffman. Coming on the heels of the Supreme Court’s historic decision to legalize same-sex marriage, the significance of the moment wasn’t lost on gay rights supporters watching on television. On Twitter, many noted how far American culture has come since the last U.S. Women’s World Cup victory in 1999.” HOT ON THE RIGHT Inside the Obamas’ $12 million summer vacation spot in Martha’s Vineyard. From the Daily Mail: “The 8,100-square-foot home features seven bedrooms, nine bathrooms, a basketball/tennis court, hot tub, infinity pool and views of the Elizabeth Islands … In addition to golf, the Obamas usually spend their vacations out and about on the island, going for bike rides in Manuel F Correllus State Forest and spending days at the beach. But it appears the Obama girls like a bit of pampering as well. The [Boston] Herald reports that the Obamas have a manicurist booked to visit them three times a week during their vacation.” DAYBOOK: –What’s happening today on the campaign trail: Marco Rubio will deliver his first major domestic policy address of the campaign in Chicago, focusing on technology issues, before attending a fundraiser in Windsor Heights, Iowa, hosted by Chris Hagenow. Hillary Clinton will give her first national television interview of the 2016 election cycle to CNN at 5 p.m. Ben Carson will speak at a business breakfast in New Hampshire hosted by Renee Plummer.  –On the Hill: The House and Senate will reconvene after the Fourth of July recess. Evening votes are planned in both chambers. –At the White House: President Obama will hold meetings with Vietnam’s Communist Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and Senate Democrats throughout the day. Press Secretary Josh Earnest will brief the media at 12:30 p.m. QUOTE OF THE DAY: “The kids and their husbands came for the week. Great to see them. Once we got through the (having new men around the house) issues and everyone kind of finding how we all fit in together, we had a lot of fun.” – Scott Brown in a characteristic post-Senate Facebook post NEWS YOU CAN USE IF YOU LIVE IN D.C.: — It’s going to be hot today. “A narrow area of high pressure offers a window of drier and mostly sunny weather today, but the trade-off is the heat with highs in the upper 80s to low 90s,” per the Capital Weather Gang. “Humidity is at moderate intensity (providing a heat index that could reach middle 90s during the afternoon) with dew points mainly in the middle to upper 60s.” — The Nationals are struggling with more injuries. “Center fielder Denard Span left Monday’s game against the Cincinnati Reds after two innings with recurring back spasms, replaced in the outfield by Matt den Dekker. And in the fifth inning, third baseman Yunel Escobar was replaced in the infield by Dan Uggla because of left hamstring tightness. By the sixth inning, the only Nationals on the field who were expected to be starters this season were shortstop Ian Desmond, catcher Wilson Ramos and right fielder Bryce Harper. The Nationals have successfully withstood many injuries this season, and they tried their best to do so, too, in Monday’s rainy 3-2 loss.” (James Wagner) VIDEO OF THE DAY: Interns for Rep.

"As Deadline Neared, $1 Million Checks Boosted Clinton Super PAC",wsj,http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/07/31/as-deadline-neared-1-million-checks-boosted-clinton-super-pac/,"Priorities USA Action, the primary super PAC backing Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, raised $15.6 million in the first half of the year from 33 donors, a filing with the Federal Election Commission on Friday showed.
The super PAC, run by political strategist Guy Cecil, received eight checks for $1 million, all of which came in during the final week of June; the last day for super PACs to report donations was June 30. Mr. Cecil noted earlier this month that $12.5 million of the super PAC’s haul came in the month of June, following a shakeup that included replacing Buffy Wicks, a veteran field organizer for President Barack Obama, with Mr. Cecil, a who worked for Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 campaign and is seen by donors as closer to the Clinton campaign.
Among the top donors to the super PAC were billionaires financier Donald Sussman, global investor George Soros and media magnate Haim Saban. Mr. Soros gave $1 million to Priorities and another $1 million to American Bridge 21st Century, a second super PAC backing Mrs. Clinton. That super PAC has not yet filed its disclosure with the FEC, but said earlier this month it had raised $7.7 million. That brings the total super PAC haul for Mrs. Clinton to $24 million.
Fair Share Action, a progressive advocacy group, also gave $1 million to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. The International Association of Fire Fighters gave $50,000.
Of the $15.6 million the group raised in the first half of the year, it has spent $1.5 million—a burn rate of about 10%. It currently has $14.6 million in cash on hand
Of the total amount raised, $13.6 million came from donations of more than $200 per individual. The group raised another $1,092 from donors who gave less than $200 each.
