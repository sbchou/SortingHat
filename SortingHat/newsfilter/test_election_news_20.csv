GOP Establishment Wouldn’t Support Trump. Here’s Why It Should Say So.,wsj,"It was a striking moment Thursday, at the beginning of the prime-time debate, when Donald Trump refused to swear off an independent run and pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee. Given Mr. Trump’s post-debate antics, conservatives and Republicans in leadership positions might consider answering a variation of the question that Fox News’s Megyn Kelly opened with.
Specifically, would the GOP leadership, former White House alumni, right-leaning think tanks, and political consultants pledge to support Mr. Trump were he to become the Republican Party nominee for president? Would they forswear running an independent/third-party candidate against Mr. Trump?
I suspect the answer to both would be, almost uniformly and emphatically, no.
So maybe it is time for the Republican political class to make clear how and in what ways the political values and sensibilities inherent to the GOP are incompatible with Mr. Trump’s demeanor, disposition, and worldview.
For example, Republican foreign policy experts have spent the past six years in the wilderness, watching President Barack Obama‘s policy toward Russia, China, the Middle East, and Israel with frustration. Many have studied, strategized, and planned how to reinvigorate U.S. influence in the world. The thought of Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, responding to world affairs with name-calling or other bullying antics, is antithetical to what many Republicans hope will be a new era of respected U.S. global leadership.
Donald Trump and Fox News’s Megyn Kelly spar over his comments on women.

And conservatives might assume that Mr. Trump’s treatment of Megyn Kelly in the aftermath of her tough debate questioning is a snapshot of how he treats strong women. Those female Republicans who hope to serve in senior capacities under a Republican president come January 2017 could make clear that doing so in a President Trump’s Cabinet is not in their career plan.
Jeff Greenfield’s Politico piece “What If Trump Wins?” should be required reading for Republicans who hope to help the next GOP president govern. Best to make clear soon that should Republican primary voters decide to make Mr. Trump the GOP nominee, which leadership and political/policy wonks won’t pledge to support him–and won’t desist from building the infrastructure to support a third-party candidate.

Financial Wellness and Millennials: Hard Times Yield Important Lessons,huffpo,"Partner and National Leader of Employee Financial Education and Wellbeing, PricewaterhouseCoopers
We all know by now that millennials are different. Not different in a bad way, just different. So it is no surprise that when it comes to managing their personal finances, millennials are taking a different path than the generations before them. Until recently, Baby Boomers and older Gen Xers generally stuck to the straight and narrow and reaped good results: work hard, buy a home, invest in the stock market, and then retire on your pension, savings and Social Security. This worked well for most of their careers, as they rode a wave of stock and housing appreciation.
But millennials have good reason to question that approach. Having come of age during the Great Recession, many millennials entered their professional years saddled with burdensome student loans only to find a tight job market with disappearing pension plans, stagnant wages and continuing questions about the future of Social Security. To make matters worse, many millennials also watched as their parents' home values and retirement savings plummeted. 
Unsurprisingly, these traumas have impacted millennials' attitudes about personal finances. PwC's recently released Employee Financial Wellness Survey illuminates many of the generational differences in attitudes about financial wellbeing by comparing millennials, Generation X and Baby Boomers. Here are some of the most important aspects of millennials' approach to their finances:
This picture may look dark, but there are a couple silver linings, fortunately. First, things are improving for millennials. Although 35 percent of millennials find it difficult to meet monthly household expenses on time, that figure is down from 41 percent last year. Similarly, of the 52 percent of millennials who consistently carry credit card balances, only 30 percent find it difficult to make their minimum payments on time versus the 39 percent who did last year. And while a large proportion of millennials (52 percent) report financial stress, it is a decrease from 60 percent last year. 
Second, these tough circumstances may ultimately benefit millennials. Their frugality, including their deployment of digital savvy to find the lowest prices and willingness to live at home longer, along with their tendency to push off major expenses like buying a home (only 46 percent of the full-time employed millennials surveyed own a home), getting married, and having kids, will likely serve them well financially as they age in an increasingly uncertain landscape for retirement and other benefits. As millennial Kelly Clarkson famously sings, ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.""",0.8095950321,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.038828003499603289, u'mexico': 0.016180676954963703, u'abortion': 0.029520636700027806, u'immigration': 0.014376470206338726, u'trade': 0.015404524990794081, u'campaign_finance': 0.01444105767037052, u'other': 0.53800476019057286, u'china': 0.038465923666065778, u'military': 0.016010098825851603, u'terrorism': 0.07865553001674426, u'economy': 0.12421189482759799, u'health': 0.026751810488585732, u'women': 0.049148611962483719}"
Poll: Trump sits in second place in New Hampshire,cnn,"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump is outpolling all other Republican candidates in New Hampshire except for Jeb Bush, according to a new survey released Tuesday.
In a poll fielded immediately after their presidential announcements last week, Bush earned 14% of the vote in the crowded GOP field, followed by Trump with 11%. Nearly a third of respondents said they were undecided.
The results from Suffolk University are the clearest indication yet that Trump, the billionaire with a penchant for bombastic rhetoric and outlandish claims, is catching on with Republican voters early on in the cycle. Pollsters tend to caution that surveys more than six months before any votes are cast may simply be registering each contender's name recognition -- of which Trump has plenty.
Trump, though, is a deeply polarizing figure in the Granite State -- 49% of respondents said they had an unfavorable opinion of him, while only 37% viewed him positively.
""Trump's controversial candidacy is being constructed in a way that gives him visibility and exposure in the short term but may also limit his growth in the long run, like a glass ceiling,"" David Paleologos, who directed the poll, said in a statement.
New Hampshire, with its first-in-the-nation primary, is a key battleground for 2016 hopefuls.
Trailing Bush and Trump were Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker at 8%, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at 7%, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson at 6% and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at 5%. No other candidates earned more than 5% in the Suffolk survey.
When asked for their second choice candidate, 14% of likely GOP voters named Bush, 13% selected Rubio, 10% picked Walker, 7% said Trump and 6% said businesswoman Carly Fiorina.
Suffolk surveyed 500 likely New Hampshire Republican voters between June 18 and June 22, yielding a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.

"Trump, the Insult Comic Dog",wsj,"Donald Trump’s support is broader than you may think. Last night your humble columnist appeared as “special guest commentator” at the Women’s National Republican Club’s debate-watch party. Rather than provide our commentary, which we do every day in this space, we decided to lead an audience discussion, which we began with an informal and entirely unscientific predebate preference poll. Our method was to call for a show of hands for each candidate and eyeball the results.
Trump was the clear winner, with Scott Walker a close second. Third place was a rough three-way tie between Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and John Kasich. The last two—respectively the No. 9 and 10 seeds in the Fox poll contest—made the audience an outlier, presumably because they’re from the Northeast and, we’re guessing, somewhat less socially conservative than the GOP base. (Not a single hand went up for No. 4 seed Mike Huckabee.)
We asked Trump supporters to explain why they like him. One woman raised her hand and said it was because “I support free speech.” Her point was not that Trump is an advocate of free speech but that he is a practitioner of it: He speaks bluntly and abjures political correctness.
Once the debate started, Trump himself made the same argument, in an early exchange with Megyn Kelly. Let’s go to the transcript:
This exchange demonstrated another downside of Trump’s unfiltered style. By complaining to Kelly about “the way you have treated me,” he betrayed weakness. And in case there was any doubt that Kelly got under his skin, he continued his bellyaching in the spin room after the debate, as the Washington Examiner reports:
It’s undoubtedly true that the comments about which Kelly asked Trump were politically incorrect. But that is not the only reason why one might be put off by them. They were also rude. Kelly’s objection was that they were unpresidential, and Trump didn’t have an answer to that.
His defense was that the comments were humorous. We can’t judge that, not having heard them in their original context, but we’ll give Trump this: He is funny. We don’t think we’ve ever laughed as much at a political candidate—and to be fair, we were laughing with him as well as at him. He lived up to his billing, in a recent Tablet article, as “our last great Vaudevillian.”
Trump is a master of insult comedy, So of course he is rude—that’s what makes him fun to watch. If Don Rickles had run for president in, say, 1980, that year’s primary debates surely would have yielded many lines more memorable than “I’m paying for this microphone, Mr. Green.” But does anyone think President Rickles would have been better for the country than President Reagan?
This columnist has no objection to insult comedy per se, and indeed we have been known to employ it. We also yield to no one in our loathing of political correctness. But insult comedy—or, as it’s more commonly known these days, snark—is frequently an instrument of political correctness. We’d go so far as to say that during the Obama years, it has become the left’s primary rhetorical idiom.
As we reviewed our reader emails this morning, we kept an eye out for examples. We weren’t disappointed:
The Washington Post reports that a reporter asked White House press secretary Josh Earnest yesterday if Obama planned to tune in to the debate. “I’d be surprised if the president spent a lot of his evening devoted to watching the debate,” Earnest replied, seemingly in earnest:
Breitbart reports that Jim Carmey, a “campaign surrogate” for Wisconsin 2016 Senate candidate Russ Feingold, explained Feingold’s defeat six years earlier as follows: “2010 was just so different, with Obama just having come in and a lot of the tea party people just kind of coming out of the woodwork—coming out of the trailer parks, essentially.” That’s reminiscent of Jim Carville’s 1995 jape at Paula Jones’s expense: “If you drag a hundred-dollar bill through a trailer park, you never know what you’ll find.”
And Emily Yoffe, Slate’s “Dear Prudence” advice columnist, responds to a reader whose grandmother reacted badly to the news that the reader’s brother is gay: “The world will be a better place when such grandmas shuffle off this mortal coil.” The wit here lies in the prettified, high-minded formulation of an ugly, low thought: that Yoffe wishes her reader’s grandmother would just die already.
Jon Stewart built a fabulous career by using snark to further liberal politics. It’s fitting that his final episode of “The Daily Show” aired on the same night as Trump’s debate debut—and that, as Politico reports, “Trump’s corporate website was hacked” over the weekend by cyber-vandals who “wanted to thank comedian Jon Stewart for his work.”
Even leftists who lack wit aspire to be Stewart. Look at Salon, whose content is all insult, albeit with very little (intentional) comedy. Sample headline: “The GOP Freakshow Is Upon Us: Why Tonight’s Fox News Debates Could Make ‘Lord of the Flies’ Look Like a Picnic.”
The tone is set at the top. In a 2012 debate with Mitt Romney, President Obama channeled David Spade: “Gov. Romney, I’m glad that you recognize that Al Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what’s the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaida; you said Russia, in the 1980s, they’re now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War’s been over for 20 years.”
Well, you had to be there.
Just the other day, Obama asserted that “Iranian hard-liners” were “making common cause with the Republican caucus.” The White House transcript reports that his audience greeted this calumny with “laughter and applause.”
All this helps explain why Trump appeals to some conservatives and Republicans. Having endured this kind of abuse for years, why shouldn’t they be attracted to a candidate who seems willing and able to fight back in kind?
But that is a dangerous temptation. For one thing, Obama did not get elected in 2008 by out-snarking the competition but by projecting a thoughtful, temperate mien. Dropping the mask—“you’re likable enough, Hillary”—might have cost him the New Hampshire primary.
Obama’s performance as president should be enough to warn anyone—especially conservatives and Republicans—off from the temptation to put an insult comic in the White House. To be sure, unlike Obama, nobody has ever mistaken Trump for a thoughtful man. That is hardly an argument in the latter’s favor.

Post Trump   Sarah Bailey, who covers the religion beat for the Washington Post, brings us an excellent example of the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy.

Bailey doesn’t mention when Trump issued that broad denunciation, but as Fox News reported last month: “Trump first made his inflammatory remarks during his non-scripted, June 16 presidential announcement speech.”
So Trump saw his campaign take off after announcing his campaign. That doesn’t sound quite so dramatic, does it?

Surprise! Golfer’s wife learns that ‘Open week’ doesn’t mean ‘open week’,washpo,"   Ben Martin during the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open last week. (Jan Kruger / Getty Images)  Ben Martin’s wife learned the hard way that maybe it’s a good idea to declare all summer activities not related to golf off limits. Emily Martin consulted the family’s calendar while conferring with her sister about her sibling’s possible wedding dates and was excited to see “Open week” written on July 18. Alert the band, the caterers, the venue and the preacher — we had a date! Book it! Oops. Ben Martin arrived home and noted the potential problem immediately. “That doesn’t sound like a very good weekend,” he said, according to Golf Digest’s Shane Ryan. “No, it was in my calendar,” Emily replied. “It was open.” “Yeah,” he said. “The Open Championship. The British Open.” It was too late to change the wedding and, besides, it wasn’t a certainty that Martin would qualify for the Open that begins Thursday at St. Andrews. He did, though, and he’ll miss his sister-in-law’s nuptials. Emily Martin will miss his tournament. Don’t ask what happens if he wins.

Republican Presidential Candidates Are Rallying Around Term Limits For Judges,huffpo,"WASHINGTON -- Judicial term limits aren't the sexiest, most inspiring campaign issue of modern times. But they've been mentioned in recent weeks in speeches and appearances by several potential Republican presidential candidates, suggesting that they could very well become a prominent fixture of the GOP’s 2016 primary. 
At the Conservative Political Action Conference last week in National Harbor, Maryland, two of the base’s more popular candidates delighted the audience by offering support for the idea. 
“Maybe we should term limit out-of-control federal judges,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said on the stage of the main hall. He delivered the line almost as a throwaway. 
At a side session hours earlier, Ben Carson, the pediatric neurosurgeon and likely presidential candidate, said the time had come to reconsider lifetime appointments for federal judges. 
“Remember, when that was put in place the average age of death was 47,” said Carson, no stranger to helping people live longer lives. “So it really didn’t matter that much. Now it matters a lot.” 
It wasn’t just at CPAC either. A month earlier at the Iowa Freedom Summit, former Gov. Mike Huckabee (R-Ark.) also pointedly declared the country’s need for term limits. “Not only for the executive and legislative branches,” he told the crowd, “we need term limits for the judicial branch because nobody ought to wear a black robe for the rest of his or her life.” 
A sense that the federal judiciary could benefit from axing lifetime tenure isn’t unique to either the Republican Party or the 2016 campaign. It’s been an oft-discussed topic in political, legal and academic circles for some time, spanning ideological divides. Usually, it’s tempered by the realization that changing the system would be a monumental task: requiring an amendment to Article III of the Constitution, which provides that federal judges “shall hold their offices during good behaviour.” 
But the growing talk of the idea among potential presidential candidates this cycle has left advocates of the concept more excited about the prospect of change, even if it remains far off. 
Back in 2012, then-Gov. Rick Perry (R-Texas) was one of the few preaching judicial term limits on the trail. He called himself a “true believer” in the concept, arguing that “too many federal judges rule with impunity from the bench, and those who legislate from the bench should not be entitled to lifetime abuse of their judicial authority.” The speech was described as a Hail Mary in the press.
There are a variety of reasons why the Republican Party has grown more receptive since then. Frustration with seeing notable court cases not go their way has been supplemented by a growing belief that, in an era of governmental gridlock, the judicial system is an effective vehicle for influencing policy. 
“There obviously has been dissatisfaction with the Supreme Court for a very long time on the right, and the health care [individual mandate] case can’t have helped matters in that regard,” said Randy Barnett, a law professor at Georgetown University who helped bring that challenge to the mandate in front of the Supreme Court. 
Barnett himself doesn’t support limiting terms on the bench. Justices, he argues, are already susceptible to political influence. Removing one of the layers protecting them wouldn’t help matters; it would make them worse. “I do think there is virtue to having the court be stable all the time and not move around,” he said. “It is very difficult for the court to stand up to popular opinion and majoritarian branches under the best of circumstances. Making it even more difficult is a mistake.”
But other lawyers and prominent legal observers say that the downsides of changing the system are outweighed by the problems of the status quo. 
“I think term limits are a good idea,” said Jeffrey Toobin, a legal commentator on CNN and an author for the New Yorker. “Some combination of term limits and or mandatory retirement makes a lot of sense. The framers created the federal judiciary at a time when average life spans meant that 10 years would be about it for most judges. And fortunately, we don’t live in a world where people die in their 50s much more. “
Among the various proposals for ending lifetime tenure, the most popular is to implement a single 18-year term staggered in a way so that each president in a single term in office would have two vacancies to fill. Most commonly associated with law professors Steve Calabresi and James Lindgren, the idea counts longtime Supreme Court correspondent Linda Greenhouse and prominent D.C. scholar Norm Ornstein among its supporters. 
Toobin, likewise, called 18-year-terms a “very reasonable” policy to restructure how judges serve. But, he said, it doesn’t  “have a chance in the world because it would involve amending the Constitution, and fortunately it is very difficult to amend the Constitution.”

Cardinal Wuerl backs pope on global warming but says Bush's response was 'legitimate',fox,"			
			 
							
							
								   					
							
						
						
							mboxCreate('FoxNews-Politics-Autoplay-Videos-In-Articles');
						
						Cardinal Donald Wuerl said on Sunday that Pope Francis’ recently-released thoughts on global warming are intended to open the dialogue on the issue, not to be a definitive statement, and that GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush’s skeptical response was “legitimate.” 
Bush, a devout Catholic and former GOP Florida governor, praised the pope after he released his encyclical, or letter to all Roman Catholic Church bishops, on Thursday on global warming and its environmental impact. 
“But I don't get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinals or from my pope,” Bush said. 
Wuerl, the archbishop of Washington, told “Fox News Sunday” that he thought Bush “had a legitimate position.” 
“I would hope that no politician gets policy from his faith committee, his faith community,” Wuerl continued. “The pope is talking about what we should be doing, not ‘Here is a political agenda that you must accept.’  … “This is one of the great blessings of America. We are all allowed to speak our minds.” 
Wuerl also suggested several times that the pope thinks global warming is a moral issue because, according to some scientists, human activity his heating up the earth, which is impacting all of humanity, especially the poor.
 
“What we get is the moral frame of reference by which we arrive at those policy positions,” the cardinal told Fox News. “That’s what the church brings to this discussion.” 
Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum, a practicing Catholic, said in early June that ""there are more pressing problems on Earth"" than global warming for the pope to be tackling.  
The former Pennsylvania senator also told Fox News that that it’s more appropriate for him and other lawmakers than the pontiff to weigh in on the issue because they make public policy decisions affect American workers. 
Those decisions, he said, include ones on ozone regulations, efforts to revitalize U.S. manufacturing and energy production and create job opportunities.

"Clinton defends, Trump attacks Saturday at the high-profile Iowa State Fair",fox,"







							mboxCreate('FoxNews-Politics-Autoplay-Videos-In-Articles');
						
Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump -- the presidential candidates dominating polls and news headlines -- took their turns Saturday at the Iowa State Fair, with the flamboyant Trump staying on the attack and Clinton suggesting her email controversy is “usual” partisan politics.
Clinton reiterated that she did not send or receive emails marked classified from her homemade email server while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, an issue that continues to overshadow her campaign.
She told reporters that she would let the inquiry into her email use continue, while she blamed her Republican challengers and House GOP members for turning the issue into a partisan affair.
""The facts are the same as they have been from the very beginning,"" Clinton said.
She also hit all the highlights of the fair, including the famed butter cow and the pork chop on a stick, amid a moving mass of media and onlookers.
""Nice to be here,"" Clinton said as she started an hour-long stroll through the fairgrounds at the side of former Iowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin.

Trump arrived in a private helicopter about a mile away from the fair and talked with reporters before taking children for a ride in his helicopter.
He slammed several other 2016 candidates, including GOP challenger Jeb Bush over recently suggesting the United States needs to have ""skin in the game” to justify helping end the chaos in Iraq.
Trump said the U.S. spent $2 trillion and that thousands of American soldiers were either killed or wounded in trying to bring Democracy to Iraq while Bush argues the U.S. must to prove it has “skin in the game.”
“I think it may be one of the dumbest statements I've ever heard,"" said the billionaire Trump, who reportedly just opened a campaign office in the first-caucus state of Iowa.
He also called Clinton “the single worst secretary of state in the history of this country.”
Essentially all of the roughly 20 major Democratic and Republican candidates will attend the 10-day fair, with Democratic challenger Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Republican Rick Santorum scheduled to attend Saturday.
Clinton recently turned her server over to the FBI to investigate the security of her email setup, which The Associated Press in March traced to an Internet connection at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y.
Clinton later said she set up her own system -- rather than use a State Department account -- for the convenience of using one BlackBerry device.
Thousands of pages of her emails publicly released in recent months show Clinton did, in fact, receive messages later marked classified, including some that contained material regarding the production and dissemination of U.S. intelligence information.
Clinton said in March she had exchanged about 60,000 emails during her four years in the Obama administration, about half of which were personal and were deleted. She turned over the others to the State Department, which is reviewing and releasing them on a monthly basis.
Last month, the inspector general of the nation's intelligence community raised concerns that classified information had traversed the email system and sent a counterintelligence referral to the Justice Department. The referral did not allege any criminal wrongdoing, and her attorney has said authorities want assurances that the emails continue to be properly stored and that Clinton is ""actively cooperating.""
It's unclear how well her email system was secured, whether it had proper data backups and whether it was constantly monitored for intrusions by hackers.

CNN to host first Democratic presidential debate,cnn,"Washington (CNN)CNN and the Democratic National Committee announced Thursday the network will host the first Democratic primary debate in Nevada on October 13. The exact location will be announced in the coming weeks.
The announcement adds to the trio of Republican debates CNN is hosting, the first of which is September 16 at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.
The field of major Democratic candidates is significantly smaller than the 17-member Republican one, at five candidates, and it's been dominated by frontrunner Hillary Clinton. But that hasn't stopped candidates like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders from running neck-and-neck with Clinton in New Hampshire or former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley from clamoring for more debates.
The field, meanwhile, could expand from five to six, if Vice President Joe Biden decides to enter the fray.

First Draft: Republicans Cite Health Care Ruling in Pushing Candidacies,nyt,"Republican presidential candidates were quick to pivot off the Supreme Court’s ruling to uphold Affordable Care Act subsidies, arguing that the decision shows the need to replace President Obama with a member of their party.

Former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said that it should not be left to the Supreme Court to “save us from Obamacare.”

“We need leadership in the White House that recognizes the folly of having to pass a bill to know what’s in it,” Mr. Perry said. “We need leadership that understands a heavy-handed, one-size-fits-all policy does nothing to help health outcomes for Americans.”

Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said the court erred in trying to correct Mr. Obama’s mistakes. The decision was another reason that he should be elected president, Mr. Rubio said.

— Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) June 25, 2015



Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin said the decision should be more motivation for Congress to overturn the law.

“Today’s Supreme Court ruling upholding the administration’s implementation of Obamacare means Republicans in the House and Senate must redouble their efforts to repeal and replace this destructive and costly law,” he said. 

Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said he was the man to lead the overturn of the law.

“This decision turns both the rule of law and common sense on its head,” Mr. Paul said in a statement. ” As president, I would make it my mission to repeal it, and propose real solutions for our health care system.” 

Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida said that if he becomes president, he will make fixing the health system through the private sector a top priority.

“We need to put patients in charge of their own decisions, and health care reform should actually lower costs,” Mr. Bush said.  “Entrepreneurs should be freed to lower costs and improve access to care – just like American ingenuity does in other sectors of the economy. ” 

The Republican National Committee decided to focus its statement not on Mr. Obama, but on Hillary Rodham Clinton and the 2016 election.

“Today’s ruling makes it clear that if we want to fix our broken health care system, then we will need to elect a Republican president with proven ideas and real solutions that will help American families,” said Chairman Reince Priebus. “Hillary Clinton supports big government mandates and expanding the government’s reach into our health care system, maneuvers that have made our health care system worse off.”

"As Senate Dems move to back Obama trade deal, Clinton takes heat for staying on sidelines",fox,"

					Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton is staying mum on whether she supports legislation to give President Obama broad authority in global trade deals, amid calls for her influential support and even as congressional Democrats now appear to back the measure. 
Liberal Capitol Hill Democrats had opposed the measure, largely arguing it poses a threat to U.S. workers. 
But negotiations this week on several provisions -- including one to crack down on suspected currency manipulation by China and other U.S. trading partners -- seems to have satisfied enough Democrats to get the bill passed as early as next week. 
The legislation, the Trade Promotion Authority bill, is supported by Republicans and moderate Senate Democrats, who want to give Obama so-called “fast-track” authority on deals that they say will improve the U.S. economy and create jobs by expanding America’s markets for goods and services. 
Clinton as secretary of State from 2009 to 2013 had supported one of two deals the legislation should help Obama expedite -- the Trans-Pacific Partnership with 11 Pacific Rim nations. The other is the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. 
But Clinton, the 2016 Democratic frontrunner, has publically said little since running for president, out of apparent concern for alienating her party’s liberal base.
 
Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill recently said that Clinton wants the final legislation to benefit American workers and that she has two major concerns: the bill’s impact on national security and the currency-manipulation issue that now appears resolved. 
Robert Kagan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank, this week criticized Clinton for failing to support the critical legislation and further suggested that history shows that she would unlikely champion it, if elected. 
“There are two things no serious candidate for the White House in 2016 can equivocate on: defense spending and the Trans-Pacific Partnership,” Kagan wrote in a column Wednesday for The Washington Post. “To cower in the face of possible criticism from the irresponsible wing of (Clinton’s) party gives little assurance that she has what it takes to lead the nation in the very difficult years ahead.”   
Kagan also argued that those who oppose the legislation are thinking of “nothing more than the most narrow and parochial of U.S. interests,” not foreign policy or America’s role in the world. 
Clinton’s apparent sideline strategy has brought out an array of critics -- from conservative PACs to potential primary challenger former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley. 
They argue Clinton has already changed her positions on gay marriage and immigration reform and that opposing the trade deal would be yet another reversal. 
“She will soon have to decide whether she will continue standing with the sitting Democratic president on trade, or whether she will flip flop and join the union activists who are vehemently opposed to this bipartisan deal,"" said Jeff Bechdel, spokesman for the conservative America Rising PAC. 
Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent running for the Democratic presidential nomination, continues to oppose the bill and has called on Clinton to “make it clear” that it should be rejected. 
O’Malley, who is set to announce May 30 whether he will challenge Clinton for the Democratic nomination, prior to the Senate negotiations this week also opposes the bill, arguing it would “hurt middle-class wages and ship middle-class jobs overseas.” 
House Speaker John Boehner, who said this week that his chamber will vote after the Senate, has called on Clinton to support the legislation to help get enough Democratic votes for passage. 
He said Clinton ""cannot sit on the sidelines and let the president swing in the wind."" 
The White House has so far defended Clinton, with Press Secretary Josh Earnest saying she should take her time to “make up her own mind … as we’re encouraging everybody to do.”

The Best Reason to Take Rand Paul Seriously Has Nothing to Do With His Politics,nyt,"Although Rand Paul — who declared his bid for the presidency on Tuesday — has spent several years now inching toward the Republican mainstream, there is still a tendency among the political classes to view him as a sideshow candidate. The crankiness of his announcement-week interviews certainly suggests that he’s still getting a handle on retail politics. And though his policy views — calls for more rational sentencing guidelines, a less intrusive national-security apparatus and a restrained foreign policy — give him potential appeal with young, minority and libertarian-leaning voters, they also make him an outlier in the field of declared or likely Republican contenders.

Paul’s (relative) unorthodoxy makes him that rare candidate whose policy views draw gobs of media attention: He’s teaming up with Democrats to scale back mandatory-minimum drug sentencing and likens the war on drugs to Jim Crow? (The same Rand Paul who once said he opposed parts of the Civil Rights Act?) He’s in the same party as Senator John McCain, and yet he opposed arming the Syrian rebels?

But in fact, it’s the boring details of the organization that Paul is building that provide the best reason to take him seriously. If Paul’s views are unusually idealistic, the ground game that his team is planning is pure realpolitik. His staff is focused on the delegate math and party rules that could determine the next Republican nominee — a game-theory style of presidential politics at which the Paul team is particularly adept.

The process by which presidential candidates are nominated is, at its most basic level, a race toward a magic number of party delegates — in the Republican Party’s case, 1,235 required to win — amassed state by state and, in some cases, congressional district by congressional district. Getting them depends not only on the speechifying, door-to-door vote-hunting and million-dollar ad buys we associate with campaigning, but also on a bewildering array of procedural minutia: obscure national bylaws that overlay a mind-bending patchwork of local rules that can vary drastically from state to state, some of which award delegates not based on votes received in primary elections but on back-room wrangling at local party conventions and meetings that take place weeks or even months after votes are cast.

You would think that mastering these arcana would be a priority for campaigns, given their importance. But even the best-funded, most-inevitable-seeming candidates mess them up all the time — and long-shot candidacies have been made, or at least sustained, by getting them right. Barack Obama’s Democratic primary victory in 2008 came in large part because his strategists understood the way delegates were being doled out state by state — even to the losing candidate, based on his or her share of the vote — better than Hillary Rodham Clinton’s team did.

In 2012, Rick Santorum employed a novel strategy of focusing his resources only on states where he stood to gain the most delegates. He left other states uncontested and later tried to steal delegates from Mitt Romney in states where delegates were awarded at the state and local conventions and caucuses. It wasn’t enough to take him to the general election, but it propelled a remarkable run as the primaries’ pre-eminent spoiler — he kept Romney fighting for the nomination until April — by a candidate whom few took seriously at first.

Santorum is expected to make another run in 2016 — but unfortunately for him, two of the main strategists who worked for him in 2012 are now working for Paul. One of them, Mike Biundo, was Santorum’s campaign manager and co-piloted his cross-country hopscotching strategy. The other strategist, Paul’s national political director, John Yob, was part of Santorum’s later-stage delegate-hunting efforts. (Santorum’s chief strategist, John Brabender, told me this week that if Santorum runs, he will be just fine without Biundo and Yob and will build a “more sophisticated” operation than the one he had four years ago). With Santorum, Biundo and Yob learned the rules and the ins and outs of the electoral map in a way few others had. Only one campaign knew them still better: Ron Paul’s.

The elder Paul’s team first showed that it knew its way around the primary rules in 2008, when it took McCain’s campaign by surprise by showing up in force at state conventions to push the election of Paul-friendly convention delegates long after McCain thought he had vanquished all of his Republican rivals. “We weren’t ready for the intensity and organization they put together,” Ryan Price, a McCain national deputy political director who helped run his delegate strategy that year, told me.

The McCain team — on which Yob served as a political director — was able to keep the damage from Paul’s efforts to a minimum. Mitt Romney had less luck in 2012, when the Paulites used the knowledge they had gained from 2008 to win a plurality of delegates in several states long after their primaries and caucuses — none of which Paul actually won — were over. “They were very sophisticated about the chess match,” says Katie Packer Gage, Romney’s 2012 deputy campaign manager. “They definitely caused a lot of headaches.” As I wrote last month, Paul’s success prompted party leaders to enact new rules to discourage candidates from repeating his insurrection, which Rand Paul’s team is scrutinizing now in hopes of figuring out how to work around them.

Ron Paul, of course, never came close to winning the nomination. But if his son can mount a bigger, more credible campaign than that of his father, as he is expected to do, he could use the same apparatus and approach to expertly navigate the rules and cause more than just headaches. “If they can bring all of that with them, then it would be very, very beneficial,” Gage told me. But she added a caveat: “I just wouldn’t make the assumption that his team is going to have it just because his dad’s team had it.”

The family legacy is mixed for Rand Paul. His team does have several veterans of the Ron Paul campaigns, starting with the candidate himself; Ron Paul’s Iowa vice chairman, A. J. Spiker; and Ron Paul’s former campaign manager — and grandson-in-law — Jesse Benton (though Benton is heading to a Paul-supporting “super PAC” and, once that happens, will have to cease direct contact with the official campaign under federal elections law). But as Paul seeks to build a broader base than his father had, he is alienating some of the hard-core, grass-roots Ron Paul loyalists — the same people who were so galvanized by his father’s candidacy that they mastered the minutiae of their state party rules and infiltrated local Republican committees on his behalf.

And all of the Paul team’s savvy at counting delegates and working state rules will only take him so far if another candidate — a Jeb Bush, say, or a Scott Walker — builds early momentum and wins a series of primaries out of the gate. A truly inevitable candidate does not need to worry about the small stuff or try to game the rules. Great victories bring great caches of delegates.

But in a close-fought, state-by-state contest between two or more competitive candidates, the campaign that best understands the intricacies of delegate allotment will have a real edge — and at this point, that campaign is almost certainly Paul’s. Like Obama in 2008, Paul is a first-term senator who, aware of his underdog status, is spending the campaign’s early days planning for all the scenarios it can envision.

When I asked Yob — a second-generation Michigan Republican who knows better than to show any kinship with Obama — about the parallels, he laughed off the question. “We are simultaneously building early-state organizations that are the strongest in the field while also preparing for the possibility of a nominating process that extends to the caucuses and state conventions, where convention delegates will ultimately be selected,” he told me. “It is safe to say, I like our chances in caucus systems and conventions across the country.”",0.9999999838,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.026896210813943604, u'mexico': 0.033011557150593451, u'abortion': 0.031926149399794983, u'immigration': 0.002062007826761453, u'trade': 0.11515747426190834, u'campaign_finance': 0.13240036455916682, u'other': 1.8915220899126571e-05, u'china': 0.010222276700553916, u'military': 0.0083182691439918355, u'terrorism': 0.17557492805455507, u'economy': 0.40756626152381648, u'health': 0.004800147857327782, u'women': 0.052045437486687204}"
Green Bay Packers 2015 Draft Preview,fox,"			
			 (SportsNetwork.com) - Ted Thompson has the great draft rep but a lot of his    recent history in the first round has come up snake eyes. The three-year stint    before Ha Ha Clinton-Dix in 2014 produced Derek Sherrod, Nick Perry and Datone    Jones, not exactly a murderer's row.Point being, the sterling reputation as a talent evaluator may not be all that 
  it's cracked up to be when you put it under the microscope. Thompson was 
  certainly right back in 2005, though, when he selected Aaron Rodgers with the 
  24th overall pick out of Cal and that one selection has masked many a 
  deficiency in recent years.
The early returns are positive on Clinton-Dix so maybe the worm has turned for 
  Thompson, who starts this year's process with the 30th overall selection.
Surprisingly the Packers brought back both B.J. Raji and Letroy Guion at 
  defensive tackle so if you read the tea leaves Green Bay will likely shift its 
  focus toward the secondary to bolster a cornerback group that needs 
  reinforcements.
From a pure football perspective, Washington's Marcus Peters is regarded by 
  some as the best corner prospect in this draft class and the top man- to- 
  man coverage option in the process. He comes with plenty of baggage, though, 
  problems which become far more palatable late in the first round.

Hillary Clinton lays out climate change initiative,washpo,"   Hillary Rodham Clinton speaks at the Veterans Memorial Building before the Iowa Democratic Party's Hall of Fame Dinner on July 17 in Cedar Rapids. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)  DES MOINES — Hillary Rodham Clinton called for harnessing the power of the sun to generate enough renewable energy to run every home in the country within the next decade, as part of a climate change initiative announced Sunday. ""Future generations will look back and wonder, 'What were we thinking? How could we possibly be so irresponsible?' "" the Democratic presidential candidate says in a video that accompanied the plan, which was posted on her Web site Sunday night. ""I'm just a grandmother with two eyes and a brain and I know what's happening in the world will affect my daughter and especially my granddaughter,"" she said. In addition to touting her plan, which would include installing more than half a billion solar panels nationwide during the first term of her presidency, Clinton criticized the Republican presidential candidates, who generally dismiss the notion of climate change. ""It's hard to believe that people running for president refuse to believe the settled science of climate change,"" she says in the video as quotes attributed to GOP hopefuls fill the screen. One such quote, attributed to former Florida governor Jeb Bush, reads: ""I'm a skeptic. I'm not a scientist."" Earlier Sunday, while campaigning in Iowa, she used the ""grandmother with two eyes and a brain"" quip, receiving chuckles and applause. She praised Iowa's efforts to embrace renewable energy, noting that the state produces 30 percent of its energy from wind. Windmills are a common sight on the horizon across the state.

GOP candidates jockey for position in final debate dash,fox,"







							mboxCreate('FoxNews-Politics-Autoplay-Videos-In-Articles');
						
Less than a week before a bushel of 2016 Republican presidential hopefuls square off for the first time in two Fox News debates, billionaire businessman Donald Trump is holding firm to his primary lead -- while his lower-polling rivals battle for visibility in hopes of making the cut for the prime-time stage. 
Trump, seemingly reveling in his role as instigator and bipartisan punching bag, opened up a 7-point lead over the rest of the field in the most recent national poll. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush also are polling consistently well. 
Rather, the 11th-hour dash is among those in the middle and back of the pack, competing for the last of 10 slots in the prime-time event at Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena. 
The Aug. 6 debate is hosted by Fox News, in conjunction with Facebook and the Ohio Republican Party.  
The 9 p.m. ET stage will be open to the top 10 candidates in recent national polls. With 17 total candidates now in the race – former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore was the latest, announcing his bid Thursday – not everyone will make the cut.  
Those who don’t can qualify for an earlier debate, at 5 p.m. Fox News has eased the criteria for that debate, and candidates will no longer have to reach at least 1 percent in the polls to make the stage, though there are other criteria.

But there is heavy competition for the main event, the first time leading candidates will face off after seemingly weekly campaign kick-offs.  
“There’s too many, and so there is going to be a culling of the herd,” said Mark Jones, political science fellow at the Baker Institute at Houston’s Rice University. 
With national poll placement dictating who gets prime-time, the candidates on the margin are doing their best to boost their visibility, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Texas Gov. Rick Perry.  
Perry challenged poll-leader Trump to a pull-up contest after a week of pummeling the billionaire real estate tycoon for his comments on Mexican illegal immigrants and Sen. John McCain.  
Meanwhile, Christie declared war on marijuana this week, promising Coloradans they had better enjoy legalized pot today because he will enforce federal laws against it when he is in the White House.  
Speaking with Fox News on Thursday, the Garden State guv said ""we're very confident we'll be at the 9:00 debate."" 
After spending the last several months going after Bush – now third in the RealClearPolitics poll average, behind Walker – Christie is competing these days more with Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Christie clocked in at 3 percent in the same RCP average, right behind Kasich, putting them on the tail end of the top 10.  
Potentially outside the margin, but fighting to get in, are Perry, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, ex-Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum.  
Former New York Gov. George Pataki and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham are further behind. Each, though, has been trying to take on Trump in recent weeks, with the latter putting out a viral video of himself destroying a cell phone – a response to Trump giving out his number during the McCain flap (Graham had lashed out at Trump for questioning his friend McCain’s heroism, triggering Trump’s ire).  
“I think the top eight candidates are comfortable where they are,” said Jones. “[The others] are pushing the envelope with the goal of rising above the dust that was created when you have 17 candidates running.”  
Not making the prime-time cut isn’t the end of the road by any means, and there’s still plenty of time before the Iowa caucuses.  
“I don’t think being left out of the debate is a death knell,” said Steve Deace, who hosts a conservative radio talk show in the Hawkeye State. However, he said, “it can hurt from a momentum standpoint, in that it is a spotlight you are not getting.” 
“It will be a huge spotlight and I think for someone who is underfunded and under-organized who is impressive when they are in front of people, like Bobby Jindal, this is the spotlight they are going to need.”  
Perhaps an indication of how comfortable the GOP front-runner feels right now, Trump is in Scotland and attended the Women's British Open at one of his resorts – though he still talked campaign shop with reporters Thursday.  
Bush, though, is back on the stump stateside on Friday, with plans to address the National Urban League, along with retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Walker and Christie are campaigning in Iowa Friday, as is Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. Kasich is in New Hampshire. 
For all the buzz and attention surrounding Trump, there is now pressure on him to perform.  
“He is clearly the man of the hour from a buzz standpoint,” Deace said. “I think with one or two exceptions, the goal of the others is to get him to go from zany to crazy, to self-immolate.”  
But that might be difficult, considering he’s weathered a string of controversies over his blunt remarks since entering the race. The worst thing that can happen is for Trump to pull his punches and wimp out, Deace said. “His entire campaign is based on him being a blunt instrument he can get back at Washington with. If he dulls those edges, that would be the death knell for him.”  
Deace said the others, though, have something to gain by not going for the bait.  
“It will be interesting to see how Scott Walker performs in this environment. I think we have to see if this [debate] diminishes his stature or he is able to craft an everyman persona who is a nice contrast to the bigger personalities,” he said. On the other hand, “I think Ben Carson has a much more reserved, laid-back way of communicating than the rest of these candidates. Will he bore people, or be seen as the adult in the room?” ",0.9999999985,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.01553926241540657, u'mexico': 0.018681565223783506, u'abortion': 0.039189275527711606, u'immigration': 0.51963457455965156, u'trade': 0.22077670381339137, u'campaign_finance': 0.056313253278379598, u'other': 1.1004157855722709e-05, u'china': 0.00080665258625374915, u'military': 0.0019690913288764379, u'terrorism': 0.059954967321795435, u'economy': 0.034809233911062047, u'health': 0.0029324762190660438, u'women': 0.02938193965676646}"
Coffman's Smoke and Mirrors on Immigration Reform,huffpo,"Former media critic at the Rocky Mountain News; Blogger, www.bigmedia.org.
In response to my recent post urging reporters to spotlight Mike Coffman's weak advocacy for immigration reform, Coffman's spokesman Tyler Sandberg told me via Twitter that ""Google is Your Friend,"" and directed me to an instance when Coffman said he was ""deeply disappointed"" with House opposition to a resolution allowing young immigrants to gain citizenship via military service.
Google is my friend, and it confirms my larger point that Coffman does little to promote immigration reform besides create the appearance of seriousness without the much substance at all.
Coffman has expressed disappointment, yes, but he hasn't seriously challenged Boehner, who's arguably been the biggest obstacle to immigration reform in the country.
Where was Coffman's disappointment when the Senate's bipartisan immigration legislation, with Marco Rubio's name on it, died in the House. Coffman didn't even support a vote on the bipartisan and comprehensive bill, despite Coffman's public statements in favor of comprehensive immigration reform.
And what did he do instead? Nothing on comprehensive reform, except scrub his website of the phrase ""comprehensive immigration reform"" and to tell the Aurora Sentinel, ""What Boehner has said, and I agree with, is that a comprehensive approach doesn't have to be a comprehensive bill.""
Coffman's legislation for young immigrants and his alleged support for a guest worker program fall short of comprehensive reform no matter how you wordsmith it, and they've failed, in part, because Coffman goes to a fundraiser with Boehner at the Brown Palace and doesn't talk about immigration on the same day Coffman's bill is being killed by Republican leadership in Washington.
Via Twitter, I asked Coffman's spokesman Sandberg to write a blog post explaining how his boss has pushed Boehner for serious immigration reform--and better yet, to show us how it's done.
There's no public record of the kind of effort we've seen from Coffman on other issues. Nothing close.

Obamacare repeal vote fails in Senate,politico,"Mike Lee, pictured, is expected to ask the Senate to reconsider the Obamacare amendment. | AP Photo

7/26/15 4:10 PM EDT
The Senate on Sunday voted down a Republican effort to repeal Obamacare, the GOP’s first attempt to get rid of the president’s health law since the party took control of the chamber in January.
The effort fell 49-43, exactly along party lines, with eight senators not voting in the rare weekend session. Third-fifths of the Senate would have had to vote to add Obamacare repeal to a highway funding bill.
Story Continued Below
Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) is expected to ask the Senate — likely Monday — to reconsider the Obamacare amendment. He would propose a procedural motion to change Senate rules in order to try to repeal the Affordable Care Act with just 51 votes.
Such a momentous change in the Senate’s rules is unlikely. But conservatives have suggested that they would chastise Republicans who would block a rule change that could lead to repealing the health law that they detest.

BURGESS EVERETT and MANU RAJU
Republican Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) all initially voted against repeal but changed their votes within minutes after the apparent mistakes. Paul’s aide was spotted on the floor talking with the senator after the initial vote was cast. Collins and Sasse corrected their votes at the same time and shared comments on the Senate floor.
Other than that, Sunday’s repeal vote played out as expected. No Republican or Democrat has expressed any hint that they would break from their party’s firmly held position on Obamacare.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) predicted that outcome on Friday as he railed against Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s decision to hold the vote, saying it was done to placate conservatives who were angry that another vote was called to authorize the Export-Import bank.
“We’ll have a vote on repealing Obamacare. The Republicans will all vote yes, the Democrats will all vote no. It will be at a 60-vote threshold, it will fail,” Cruz said then. “It will be an exercise in meaningless political theater.”
Yet the vote does allow Republicans — particularly freshman lawmakers — to say that they’ve cast a vote to repeal the ACA. Several had said they wanted a chance to get on the record on a campaign promise they’d all made.
“What I’m trying to do in my short time here is look at the commitments I made to the constituents and voters of Alaska and follow through on those commitments,” first-term Sen. Dan Sullivan said last week. “And that was a commitment, and I want to follow through on it.”

But Sullivan, like many other Republicans, also said he’d like to see the Senate act on changes to the health law that have a chance of becoming law, such as repealing its medical-device tax or changing its definition of “full time” work from 30 hours to 40 hours.
“Obviously a full repeal and replace is going … to be unsuccessful,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said before the vote was scheduled. “So I would like to see us do things like move the work week to 40 hours.”
Democrats used Sunday’s vote as an opportunity to praise the health care law.
“The House has voted 55 times. The Supreme Court said it’s fine. We’re reaching 20 million Americans who now have health care,” Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said Friday. Repeal “would hurt too many people, it would create chaos.”
The Senate has voted three other times on legislation to fully repeal Obamacare — in March 2010, February 2011 and March 2013. All were on party lines. The Senate has voted about three dozen times on bills to repeal or defund all or part of the health care law since it was passed in 2010.

Oklahoma woman named Miss USA; Trump a no-show,reuters,"Oklahoma's Olivia Jordan was crowned Miss USA on Sunday, capping weeks of controversy in the run-up to the annual beauty pageant after its co-owner Donald Trump made incendiary remarks about Mexican immigrants while announcing his run for president.
Several judges, guests and the event's hosts all backed out after the real estate mogul described some migrants from Mexico to the United States as drug-runners and rapists while announcing in June he was seeking the Republican nomination.
Despite the controversy, no incidents or disruptions were apparent either in the audience or on stage during the live broadcast from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, carried on cable channel Reelz after NBC dropped the show over Trump's remarks.
Trump, who traditionally attends, said on Saturday he would be campaigning and would not be on hand.
Jordan, 26, an actress and graduate of Boston University, won the 64th pageant after deftly answering a question about the nation's next hot-button issue. Other finalists stumbled while answering similarly topical questions from the judges, who were all past pageant winners such as Miss Universe and Miss USA.
""We still need to talk about race relations in the country, we have not solved this issue,"" Jordan said. ""We really need to work on being an accepting society.""
The other finalists came from Rhode Island, Maryland and Nevada, with Texas' Ylianna Guerra winning first runner-up.
Several of the top 15 finishers spoke of their Latin American heritage, including Rhode Island's Anea Garcia, who was raised by her grandmother, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic. Garcia came in third among 51 contestants.
One segment focused specifically on contestants' multi- cultural backgrounds, with the women speaking in taped segments about being bi-racial or coming from immigrant families.
Among the few indirect or veiled references to Trump's remarks, Miss USA 2013 Erin Brady said during a live interview that she was happy to be on hand cheering the contestants on, ""especially given the chaos of the past two weeks.""
Game show host Todd Newton and former Miss USA Alex Wehrley shared hosting duties after MSNBC newsman Thomas Roberts and ""Dancing With the Stars"" host Cheryl Burke dropped out.
Hinting at the controversy, Newton referred at the show's outset to ""what has become the most anticipated and what will be the most exciting night in recent pageant history.""

Donald Trump Exaggerates Crowd Size At Phoenix Rally,huffpo,"Despite Donald Trump's assertion that the crowd at his Saturday campaign event in Phoenix was the largest of any presidential candidate so far in the race, all other estimates put the number of attendees significantly below what the Trump campaign said.
The campaign moved the rally from the Arizona Biltmore hotel to the Phoenix Convention Center to allow more people to attend. When Trump arrived at the podium, he claimed the crowd was larger than those at Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) presidential campaign events.
""This blows away anything Bernie Sanders has gotten,"" Trump said.
By comparison, Sanders' largest crowd was 10,000 in Madison, Wisconsin.
In a tweet, which has since been deleted, Trump said he was ""[s]peaking to 20,000+ patriots in Arizona."" A post on his Facebook page claimed 15,000. After the event, a campaign press release also had the crowd at 15,000 and called the event ""the largest campaign event of any presidential candidate this cycle.""
 But the Washington Post report on Trump's event put the audience at 4,200 individuals, less than a third the size of Trump's estimate. The Phoenix Fire Department said the crowd was capped at that number in accordance with the fire code for the ballroom.
Trump, who is now leading opinion polls in the Republican presidential primary race, has a theory on why no one agrees with his estimates.
This isn't the first time Trump's crowds have come under question. After his announcement speech last month, a Hollywood Reporter article said Trump paid audience members $50 to cheer for him.",0.9999982806,"{u'gay_marriage': 0.022386715866409699, u'mexico': 0.33191597076128304, u'abortion': 0.021191212264491163, u'immigration': 0.13843978296746293, u'trade': 0.045276632571795504, u'campaign_finance': 0.090097024569475312, u'other': 0.05749347760676797, u'china': 0.029570521107340309, u'military': 0.013301706963753029, u'terrorism': 0.043584508466668392, u'economy': 0.15295385602122083, u'health': 0.020732918906891794, u'women': 0.033055671926440031}"
